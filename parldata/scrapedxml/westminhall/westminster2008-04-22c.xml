<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-22c.355.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" speakername="Alan Whitehead" colnum="355"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080422/halltext/80422h0001.htm#08042258000399">
	<p pid="c.355.2/1" class="indent">&quot;As a society, we are consuming natural resources at an unsustainable rate. If every country consumed natural resources at the rate the UK does, we would need three planets to live on...Our aim must be to reduce waste by making products with fewer natural resources. We must break the link between economic growth and waste growth. Most products should be re-used or their materials recycled. Energy should be recovered from other wastes where possible. For a small amount of residual material, landfill will be necessary.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.355.2/2">Those are very wise words. Unfortunately, they are not mine: they are from the opening paragraphs of the 2007 waste strategy, and they are right. The object of a waste strategy, in a world of depleting natural resources and given the urgent need to reduce energy use and carbon emissions, is to prevent waste from arising wherever possible&mdash;in other words, we must stop waste materials entering the waste stream. If we cannot do that, the next best thing is to ensure that they can be reused with as little energy expenditure as possible, thereby stopping the entry into the system of virgin materials that might have been produced at great energy cost with the consequence of the further depletion of natural resources.</p>
	<p pid="c.355.2/3">Much of what we have called &quot;waste&quot; for a very long time is in reality nothing like it: it could, with relatively little processing, reappear in the resource chain as a raw material, ready to be used for whatever is needed. Projects such as the national industrial symbiosis programme, in which companies match what they consider to be their waste with another company's raw material requirements, have shown just how much value can be added. The Environment Agency has taken considerable steps down the road of recognising the importance of conveying a resource in the wrong place to one in the right place with the development of its waste protocols project.</p>
	<p pid="c.355.2/4">Through the operation of protocols setting out how materials are to be stewarded and processed, we can prevent many materials from being categorised and treated as waste, and can make the transition from end of use for one purpose to the beginning of use for another purpose, without costly and deleterious processes intervening. Metal is one material that fits that description almost exactly. By recovering and reprocessing ferrous and non-ferrous metals, we can supply pretty much all that we need for remaking metal products, and we can do so over and over again with no real deterioration in the quality of the recovered material. That means that the energy that we use in the process&mdash;and hence carbon emissions&mdash;is hugely reduced in comparison with that resulting from the use of virgin material. For example, about 75 per cent. less energy is used in making something out of recycled steel than in making the same thing out of virgin materials.</p>
	<p pid="c.355.2/5">In fact, the metals recycling industry has been doing that successfully for many years&mdash;long before anyone thought better of taking away in trucks most so-called waste and dumping it unsorted in big holes in the ground. That is partly because metals have always had value, and so offer advantages as a replacement source material, given the relatively clean and short processes involved in recovering and reusing them. Indeed, metals offcuts from stamping or milling processes require no processing at all.</p>
	<p pid="c.355.2/6">The age-old image of metal recycling as a dodgy industry full of back-street breakers yards receiving furtive visitors armed with lengths of illicit copper pipe and wire arose because people stole metals in the past. Indeed, recent reports of people cutting up railway side cables at great danger to themselves to steal the copper simply update that long tradition. People have always stolen metals because they are valuable, so stealing and fencing them offers a reward that plastic bottles or composting materials has never provided. However, that old image is just that&mdash;an old image. Today, metal recycling is an efficient and, generally speaking, well-rewarded business, with large recycling companies investing substantial sums in reliable and effective stewardship of the collection and recycling process.</p>
	<p pid="c.355.2/7">In fact, a range of companies&mdash;some are very large, many others are smaller family-owned concerns&mdash;maintain a high standard of recovery and reuse. Indeed, the metals recycling industry has risen superbly to the challenge of the European Union end-of-life vehicles directive and recycles 2 million cars a year&mdash;more than any other EU country. About 95 per cent. of metal recycling is undertaken by companies that belong to the British Metals Recycling Association&mdash;an excellent body that, among other things, underlines the professionalism and integrity of the modern metals recycling industry.</p>
	<p pid="c.355.2/8">That is all good news. Problems remain with some small yards on the periphery of the business evading regulation, and of course there is the continuing problem of stolen metals, not least from regulated yards themselves. Apart from that, should we not just let companies get on with it, and rejoice in their relative success? The continuation of an effective and efficient metals recycling sector is vital to the achievement of waste targets, and increasingly to the effective decoupling of energy use from industrial production, but lurking dangers may prevent it from working as well as it should. To my mind, the chief danger arises from the fact that the metals recycling industry is still classed essentially as a waste industry, despite the overwhelming evidence that, with the right processes, and the existence of responsible companies to operate them&mdash;and those companies are responsible&mdash;protocols could be established that would class industry as a resource provider, with all that that entails.</p>
	<p pid="c.355.2/9">There are no protocols, however, and metals do not feature on the list of materials for which the Environment Agency is beavering away to provide protocols. Not even metal shavings and offcuts escape that classification, with all the issues that are then involved&mdash;quite rightly for much waste&mdash;in the operation of the EU waste framework directive, including handling restrictions, processing precautions and the certification processes that accompany waste on its way to landfill, hazardous waste tips or inert disposal. Hardly any metals go along this route, and yet they are classified as if they do.</p>
	<p pid="c.355.2/10">That is a continuing problem for the handling of recycled metals, and it causes difficulties, given that one of the unsung achievements of the metals recycling is that it ranks as one of the more important of Britain's export industries. Recycled metal is not just shipped out and dumped, but goes as a high-quality raw material to markets all over the world. In fact, of the 15 million tonnes of metals recovered each year, some 60 per cent. is exported, most of it to countries outside Europe. Indeed, if that export trade were unsustainable, or no longer possible, the UK would simply have to dump recycled metals in landfill, because every year, we have a surplus of recovered metals over and above that which could be used in the UK's steel and metal foundries. That material is high quality, partly because that is what the companies purchasing it require, but in UK terms, it is regarded as exported waste.</p>
	<p pid="c.355.2/11">Stringent EU regulations are in place&mdash;again, in general, rightly so&mdash;to ensure that waste is not dumped in receiving countries and that the EU does not simply pass on its waste disposal and hazardous waste management problems to countries less able or willing to ask questions about its origin and safety. The European trans-frontier shipment of waste regulations state that waste may be shipped to countries outside the OECD only if the country concerned agrees explicitly to accept it. If a country has not notified the EU of its conditions for acceptance&mdash;120 countries have not done so&mdash;extensive pre-notification requirements on shipments must be fulfilled and considerable details on the receiving company must be logged. Arguably, a declaration of otherwise commercially-confidential material is required.</p>
	<p pid="c.355.2/12">It is perhaps not surprising that under such circumstances, British exports of clean metal resources should be rejected in favour of sourcing from other countries in which specified quality recycled metals are not classified as waste. If metal were not so classified and there was an industry onus on quality and, perhaps, export protocol, none of those difficulties would arise. However, we continue to classify metal as a waste, and at the heart of the problem is the fact that the European Court of Justice says that it is a waste. That was confirmed in a case relating to the EU packaging directive, which is widely regarded across Europe as setting an inappropriate precedent, but it will take a new waste framework directive to change matters. The revised EU waste framework directive has now completed its Second Reading in the European Parliament, and it will allow metals to be reclassified, but that will only happen after the small print is finalised. The &quot;comitology&quot; process, in which the Commission decides on the small print, is reasonably swift. On the other hand, co-decision, which is joint action between the Commission and the EU Parliament to decide on the small print, will take far longer&mdash;perhaps four years or so. It is important that the UK Government press for the early adoption of the revised waste framework in the first instance.</p>

	<p pid="c.358.1/1">The hon. Lady intervened just before I reached the sentence in my speaking notes that clarifies what I mean by choice, but she makes a an important point. On the one hand, it is important that the small print of directives is clarified in as public a way as possible. On the other hand, in this particular instance, the principles are fairly clear. The changes in the framework directive start to give a clear idea of what recycling is and, more importantly, of when waste is not waste: the point at which waste becomes a renewable resource. I am not sure that a further process of co-decision making on the directive would add a great deal. However, it would take away, over a considerable period of time, the ability of the UK Government, and of the industry, to make the necessary changes to greatly advance the passage of metal from a recyclable form into a new resource. On balance, therefore, I would prefer the directive to be decided by comitology, because the difference in time scale is enormous. The gain arising from the implementation of a new waste framework directive is so considerable that it is worth going down that particular path. However, that is not to take away from the hon. Lady's point about the need to ensure that the directive is framed in a transparent and coherent way, and should be scrutinised and examined properly.</p>
	<p pid="c.358.1/2">Having said that, the UK Government could act even more swiftly on the vexed category of waste offcuts. It is as plain as a pikestaff that offcuts are not waste and do not need to be treated as such, as there is no danger to anyone from their not being treated as waste. They can literally just be gathered up and reused roughly in the way that one uses the pastry left from making mince pies to make more mince pies. I make mince pies and am familiar with the process.</p>
	<p pid="c.358.1/3">In anticipation of the passage of the revised directive, the EU Commission has produced a draft report on an end-of-waste scrap metal case study. I will not say what the communication clearly states because I think that the phrases &quot;clearly states&quot; and &quot;Commission communications&quot; are not always natural bedfellows. Hon. Members will have to take it from me that it suggests that if excess material from a primary production process can be used directly in a further primary production process it can be considered as falling outside the definition of waste and is in effect a by-product. The UK should take up forthwith what is effectively an open invitation safely to reclassify shavings and offcuts in advance of a decision on the new framework, and I hope that the UK Government will be able to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.358.1/4">I have mentioned the efficiency of the metals recycling industry in coping with the challenge of the European end-of-life vehicles directive. Hon. Members will recall the time when local authorities scraped burnt-out vehicles from the tarmac of community car parks in which they were dumped. The introduction of the directive and the reception of end-of-life vehicles for comprehensive treatment by metal recycling plants have largely changed that situation. I have visited several large recycling yards and seen just how comprehensive that treatment is. The task is to receive the vehicle and separate it out safely into all its constituent part, and recycling companies have invested substantially in the technology to do so successfully. Consequently, the UK has been able to reach the current ELV target of 85 per cent. recovery, including 80 per cent. recycling and re-use.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-22c.359.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" speakername="Alan Whitehead" colnum="359"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080422/halltext/80422h0001.htm#08042258000403">
	<p pid="c.359.1/1">My hon. Friend tempts me to go on at length about the planning system, which I was not intending to do. However, he is absolutely right. If we look at what we, as a country, will need over the next decade to achieve a substantial changeover from the vast majority of waste going into landfill to the vast majority not going into landfill, we will need a variety of resources of so-called MRFs&mdash;materials recycling facilities&mdash;and of car reception end recycling facilities. Those facilities either exist at the moment and are under threat, or do not exist and need to be brought about by the effective use of the planning regulations. They will be needed to shift the enormous body of material away from landfill and into other forms of waste processing. The problem is that, in many instances, the planning process will impede the development of those sites rather than enabling them to be achieved on a planned basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.359.1/2">My hon. Friend tempts me to set this issue into perspective. In the south-east, we need to find and develop effectively one MRF every fortnight between now and 2015. That does not look likely to happen. There is a real issue over the whole question of planning and the siting of such facilities and an underlying issue of waste. It is up to the politicians, among other people, to emphasise that if we drive our car into a part-exchange garage and get a new car, it is not the end of our car. It is the same as putting our waste outside our front door and expecting someone to deal with it regardless of the consequences. Emphasising that point should be a watchword of domestic waste disposal.</p>
	<p pid="c.359.1/3">We all have a responsibility to recognise that our communities should be involved in the processing and recycling of waste. Saying that we want the efficient distribution, collection and disposal of waste, while also saying that we, collectively, are not prepared to provide the necessary sites and arrangements to make that happen is a dereliction of our understanding of the whole process.</p>
	<p pid="c.359.1/4">Before my hon. Friend tempted me down the planning route, I was talking about the processing and disposal of 2 million vehicles a year. However, the targets are set to move upwards over the next few years to the challenging target of 95 per cent. recovery, with 85 per cent. recycling and reuse, by 2015. The challenge is not so much in finding the vehicles to make the recovery target, but in ensuring that the vehicle components that are to be recycled or reused can be successfully retrieved, separated and put to good use.</p>
	<p pid="c.359.1/5">Currently, 75 per cent. of a vehicle's volume is its metal, pretty much all of which can be recycled and reused. The main issues with recycling vehicles are cleaning the metal, separating its ferrous and non-ferrous elements so that they are ready for smelting, and effectively retrieving the remaining components. Separating rubber, plastic, textiles, glass and some wood components to meet the higher targets will require not only additional investment but a substantial role for metal recycling yards beyond dealing with metal in its own right. Some of that additional material is recycled, and that is reflected in the overall figures, but much of it is placed into piles and sent to landfill. There does not exist, it seems, a systematic strategy to cope with that residue.</p>
	<p pid="c.359.1/6">In the absence of effective post-shredder sorting, there is no real alternative to landfill, except, perhaps, the energy-from-waste route, where metal recycling and other forms of recycling meet. Can provisions for co-firing and the development of a more effective, banded renewables obligation certificate market for energy from waste, in tandem with combined heat and power, start to take up the slack? If it cannot, it is hard to see how the UK can move from its present, impressive international position on vehicle recycling to the level anticipated for 2015. It is important to address this issue early; we should harness different strands of the recycling industry and government with a task force, perhaps similar to the recent biomass task force, to resolve the issues of moving post-shredder non-metal vehicle residues out of landfill and into the recycling system.</p>
	<p pid="c.359.1/7">One aspect of end-of-life vehicle disposal is of concern, and touches on the underlying theme of metal theft: ELV certificates of destruction. The certificate system is not effective because it allows considerable numbers of vehicles to go missing in the system, and not just literally into hedges. It under-records the vehicles that have been properly disposed of, and therefore under-reports the UK's performance on vehicle recycling. Having destruction certificates that travel more effectively with the relevant vehicles, so that vehicles do not slip through the system, would be an important part of the drive to meet the higher 2015 targets.</p>
	<p pid="c.359.1/8">I started by quoting, with approval, some paragraphs from the beginning of the 2007 waste strategy. If one looks at the list of actions at the end of that document&mdash;there are 94 of them&mdash;one sees that the words in the opening paragraphs are not really reflected in those actions, at least as far as metals are concerned. Indeed, only one action mentions metals, and that is a partial sentence devoted to aluminium. I do not particularly criticise the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for that apparent omission. It is a testimony to the success of the metals recycling industry and its genuine achievement in dealing effectively with metal wastes&mdash;rapidly and efficiently turning them into quality raw materials&mdash;that the waste strategy largely considers they can be left alone to get on with the job. However, as I have demonstrated today, there are challenges and impediments to continuing that effective job and to achieving even greater, more effective performance.</p>
	<p pid="c.359.1/9">It is a mistake to assume that metal recycling is the same as generic waste recycling and involves simply dealing with metal. The danger of applying regulation to metal recycling that applies rightly to other waste streams but is inappropriate to metals is that it becomes an impediment to be overcome, rather than a device that shapes our approach to good waste management. Recent discussions about the review of exemptions for metal recycling sites underline this issue. Changes in storage limits, such as the reduction in exempted storage from 50,000 tonnes to 16,000 tonnes, and reductions in inspection seem to reflect general assumptions about waste and not the specific issues of metal recycling, and they may result in a regime of storage and inspections. Those changes might produce additional regulation with no clear environmental benefit, while introducing an inspection regime that encourages the less compliant, smaller fringe sites that can be a problem to fly in the face of the standards that are common among most of the industry.</p>
	<p pid="c.359.1/10">The metal recycling industry needs a little regulation and a little encouragement to perform outstandingly over the next decade. We will need that kind of performance across the waste industry in the next decade to meet challenging environmental targets and to bring about a rapid reduction in the disposal of waste to landfill. The metals recycling industry can and will play a strong part in that process. I hope that it will receive the necessary support, through legislation, regulation and inspection, to enable it to do so.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-22c.361.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" speakername="Tony Baldry" colnum="361"  time="009:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080422/halltext/80422h0001.htm#08042258000404">
	<p pid="c.361.0/1">It is a pleasure to have you in the Chair, Mr. Chope. Metal is the most recyclable of materials. High-quality metal can be made from recovered metals and used time and again. In the UK, metal recycling is a well established, &pound;4 billion to &pound;5 billion industry. Recovering 15 million tonnes a year, it is the UK's biggest recycling industry. As we process far more metal than domestic manufacturers need, we are one of the world's largest exporters of recovered metals. In short, metal recycling is a UK success story, but I suspect that because the industry tends to be scattered across the country and is not concentrated in individual constituencies, it goes unrecognised.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/2">The industry faces several challenges, and I shall raise five issues of concern&mdash;fairly briskly, I hope. First, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" name="Alan Whitehead">the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead)</phrase> made clear, there is the problem&mdash;resulting, rather bizarrely, from a European Court judgment on the EU packaging directive&mdash;that recovered metal is classified as waste under European law. That approach means that the industry has been subjected to an increasing burden of waste regulation, which applies even when metal has been fully separated and prepared as secondary raw material. The need for redefinition has become urgent with the introduction of the new 2007 regulations on trans-frontier shipment of waste, because they are creating trade barriers, shipment delays and advantages for non-European competitors. It is somewhat bizarre to provide opportunities for non-EU states. Given the UK's leading position in export trade, the situation is particularly damaging to UK metal recycling.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/3">The revised EU waste framework directive, which is currently having its Second Reading in the European Parliament, creates an opportunity for long-term change. The directive will enable reconsideration of the point at which certain materials cease to be waste. Reclassification is urgently needed, and the European Commission has carried out a metals case study in anticipation that metals will be one of the first materials to be considered. However, I understand that there are attempts, to do with steel interests in Italy, to make last-minute amendments to the draft waste framework directive. The amendments threaten to introduce new administrative hurdles, and could prevent the &quot;end of waste&quot; outcome. An interesting point for the House to consider is how better to interact with the European Parliament, because our only locus in this issue is for us to lobby or make submissions to the Minister, who has a locus through membership of the Council of Ministers. However, there is no forum in which we get alongside Members of the European Parliament and say to our colleagues there that this issue is of significance to the UK and to UK industry.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/4">Reclassification is urgent. I therefore hope that the Government will seek to impress that upon other members of the Council of Ministers, and will press colleagues at the European Parliament to agree the directive swiftly to ensure that the mechanism for determining the end of waste is comitology. My Front-Bench colleague, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1896" name="Anne McIntosh">the Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh)</phrase>, who is a former Member of the European Parliament, will be able to explain lucidly and clearly to the House the distinction between comitology and co-decision. However, the basic fact is that co-decision would simply take several years longer. If comitology can be the mechanism for determining end of waste, it would just be speedier.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/5">Materials deemed to have reached &quot;end of waste&quot; under this procedure are also deemed to be &quot;recycled&quot; for the purpose of meeting the directives for end-of-life vehicles, the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive, and the directives relating to packaging and batteries. We also need to ensure that a simple definition of &quot;recycling&quot;, as proposed by the Council of Ministers, is maintained.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/6">Secondly, trade in recovered metals takes place in a well-established global commodity market, which often relies on a chain of brokers and traders between source and reprocessor. Prices may be several thousand pounds per tonne. The value of the material means that there is little doubt that the metal will, at the end of the chain, be melted into equally high-value new metals, using established reprocessing methods. Furthermore, the UK is a world leader in this market.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/7">However, because recycled metals are classified as &quot;waste&quot;, the industry is subject to the European trans-frontier shipment of waste regulations. These regulations were revised in July 2007 to address growing concerns about the dumping of problem wastes, but today we are discussing not such wastes but recycled metals of high value. These waste regulations now require that commercially confidential information be publicly stated and that advance certification be obtained from overseas recipients to confirm that reprocessing will be &quot;broadly equivalent&quot; to EU standards. So material can only be shipped to countries outside the OECD where the Government of the country in question has confirmed that it will accept this &quot;waste&quot;. In addition, Europe has imposed additional pre-notification requirements on shipments to the 120 non-OECD countries that have sent no reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/8">Applying these controls to metal shipments provides no additional environmental benefit. The new waste regulations are designed for problem wastes such as complex products where materials are not yet separated, or materials for which there is no clear market. However, recycled metal does not get fly-tipped or dumped. Indeed, high market values mean that theft is by far the greatest risk.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/9">The new waste regulations are therefore wholly inappropriate to recycled metals, but such metals get caught up in them because they are currently classified as &quot;waste&quot;. The metal recycling trade will suffer if these barriers are not lifted. The situation is very straightforward: recovered metals should be reclassified as non-waste, which would remove recycled metals from these regulations entirely, and we should also seek revision to the EC annex VII form in order to remove the requirement to state commercially confidential information about suppliers and customers. Of course, if one is dealing with complex waste, one can see that there is a need to discover where it has come from and where it is going to, so that it does not end up being dumped in a hole in a developing country. However, in the case of metals of high value, all that we are doing in giving our commercial competitors information about the value of the waste, who the customers are and where it is going is giving them a commercial advantage. That is crazy.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/10">Generally, we should ensure a light touch in implementation of the regulations to minimize the costs, delays and administrative burdens that fall on metal recyclers, particularly in relation to obtaining &quot;evidence&quot; of overseas reprocessing.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/11">Thirdly, as with every other matter, regulation should be proportionate. Metal recycling is very different from the waste sector. The UK has been recycling for generations; it sells a valuable product all over the world in an established market, and the industry has a mature structure. However, a one-size-fits-all approach designed for the waste sector means that the average metal recycling company must comply with some 15 different sets of environmental regulations, as well as the Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964. Each set has its own procedures, costs and paperwork, which obviously amounts to a substantial red tape burden, particularly for small businesses. That degree of regulation is neither proportionate nor risk-based.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/12">I submit that we need a more proportionate approach to regulation that takes into account the needs of the industry as well as the environmental needs. There should be a full review of regulation affecting metal recyclers&mdash;involving the industry, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, and the regulators&mdash;that considers the needs of both industry and the environment. There should be some risk-based training requirements, and sites with waste management licences must demonstrate that their managers are competent. Nearly three quarters of metal recyclers now do so by deemed competence&mdash;in other words, by showing proven experience or by completing a simple assessment process.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/13">The Environmental Permitting Programme will introduce new certificates of technical competence for licensed sites, and these certificates must be designed to meet metal recycling needs, not the needs of the waste industry, with adequate time allowed for their introduction. As the hon. Member for Southampton, Test said at the start of this debate, industrial off-cuts need to be recognised as by-products and not as waste. In short, the Government collectively must try to ensure that this industry is not regulated out of competitive existence.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/14">Fourthly, illegal operators must be got rid of. I suspect that one reason why this industry does not have the public recognition that it deserves, given its turnover and value, is that there is still something of the Steptoe image about it&mdash;the image of the scrap metal yard. In reality, most scrap metal yards are run very efficiently. They are, of course, subject to statutory controls, they must be licensed by the local authority and there is specific legislation relating to them. However, there are illegal operators out there and they need to be stamped out, because freeloaders operating outside the regulated system threaten to undermine those within the industry who are behaving responsibly. Tackling those freeloaders requires adequate resources to be provided to aid regulators in closing down illegal operators and in imposing appropriate fines. There needs to be a joined-up certificate of destruction system for end-of-life vehicles, so that the vehicle's last registered owner must obtain a certificate of destruction when it is scrapped. An incentive for, or penalty on, the last owner, together with a robust Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency monitoring system, would make that happen, driving out illegal end-of-life vehicle operators completely.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/15">In addition, there should be a requirement for a waste carriers licence disc to be displayed in trade vehicle windscreens, to ensure that they can be properly identified on sites. There must also be recognition that more regulation in itself will not necessarily solve metal thefts. Legitimate operators are not the problem; it is those who are acting illegally.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/16">Finally, as well as driving out freeloaders, the Government need to get together with the industry to examine how the UK can improve its recycling performance. If the UK is to meet its future recycling targets under the end-of-life vehicles directive and other directives, there needs to be more joined-up thinking involving the recycling industry. That is a challenge, because this issue straddles a number of Government Departments. A recycling taskforce therefore seems sensible&mdash;a partnership between Government and the recycling industry to plan for achieving future EU product recovery targets and landfill reduction. That taskforce must take into account all the relevant factors, such as post-shredder technology developments, landfill targets, landfill tax, research and development assistance, and generating industrial energy from waste capacity. What we are talking about here is a raft of new European directives, not just on recycling metals but on developing advanced separation techniques and new solutions for residual wastes.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.0/17">We need to ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of such developments, and that recycling continues to be a success story. That will require everyone working together, but the Government taking a lead. There are issues that we need to consider seriously if the industry is to continue to make a considerable amount of money, to contribute to a positive UK balance of payments, and to export large amounts of recovered metals overseas. There are issues that the Government need to address.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-22c.365.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" speakername="Roger Williams" colnum="365"  time="010:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080422/halltext/80422h0002.htm#08042258000407">
	<p pid="c.365.2/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, which I shall probably come to a little later.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.2/2">However much we reduce and make more efficient our manufacturing processes, and however much we reuse, there will always be some material to be recycled. The British scrap metal industry has proved to be a leader in the European Union and the world in dealing with waste.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.2/3">It is not surprising that metal has a prominent part in recycling, as it has always been a valuable commodity. Some recycling streams have not been quite as profitable in the past, mainly because the natural resources from which the commodities are derived have been cheap. It has cost less to produce commodities from virgin materials than to recycle materials that have already been produced. But metals have always been a valuable commodity, and therefore there has always been a trade in recycling them.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.2/4">It has been said that metal recycling probably contributes about &pound;6 billion to our national economy, and that 60 per cent. of the metal is exported. However, the global price of scrap metal has risen and is expected to rise further. Lead is now thought to be worth between &pound;700 and &pound;1,000 a tonne, compared with &pound;400 a tonne previously. The price of copper has risen by about 500 per cent. since 2001 and is now between &pound;2,500 and &pound;3,000 a tonne, compared with about &pound;1,000 a tonne a few years ago.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.2/5">Of course, there is more to consider than just the value of the metal itself. The cost of extracting and quarrying the ore and then refining the metal must also be considered. Part of that cost is the use of energy. For instance, the cost of producing 1 tonne of aluminium is about 10 tonnes of carbon dioxide. We can see that not only is the cost per tonne of producing aluminium affected but carbon emissions and, possibly, global warming are also affected.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.2/6">Of the 15 million tonnes of metal that are recycled in Britain, just over 8 million come from cars, fridges and other such equipment. The new EU regulations have boosted the industry and now 3 million cars are recycled each year. The target is that 85 per cent. must be recycled. The hon. Member for Southampton, Test touched on the problem of dealing with materials in cars other than metals&mdash;rubber, fabric, glass and possibly wood&mdash;and whether an incentive could be given to use some of them for co-firing in combined heat and power processes.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.2/7">British cars are more likely to be recycled because they are right-hand drive and, therefore, not easily exported to eastern European countries. On the continent, many cars are sent east for a time of retirement in other countries as they come towards the end of their life.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.2/8">There is some concern that the certificate of destruction required by the end-of-life vehicles regulations is sometimes circumvented so that some cars are not properly recycled but are sidelined, so to speak, and that only the most readily available materials are recycled while the other materials are dumped or sent to landfill. Mention has been made in the European Parliament of regulations under the revised waste framework directive, which proposes a mechanism to reclassify non-waste recycled materials. It would significantly drive down the industry's regulatory burden. There has been a discussion about comitology, or co-decision making. We desperately need to take that forward quickly if the industry is to get the benefit of being able to deal with such material in the most efficient and effective way.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.2/9">Quite clearly, a lot of the offcuts are definitely not waste: they are almost virgin material and should not be described as waste. Much of the waste material has been treated within the recycling industry in this country to make it perfectly safe to transport. There are regulations to prevent the illegal dumping of waste in third countries and to protect those countries from being exploited. We understand the need for regulation, but there must be an ability to discriminate between waste and an important raw material.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.2/10">Hon. Members have mentioned that, because of the increased value of waste metal, theft has developed, too. The Government have addressed some aspects of that issue. A productive surgery in a little village called Cwmdu in my constituency was slightly enlivened when the message came through that there had been a theft in the village and somebody had run off with some scrap metal that was being turned into a sculpture by a local artist. The village rallied round and we apprehended the person who had attempted to steal material. So it was a productive surgery in the end. But people out there are looking to take advantage of the fact that the price of scrap metal has increased.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.2/11">As I look around the countryside&mdash;I have a very rural constituency&mdash;I notice a great improvement in its appearance, because a lot of the machines that used to be left where they had died are now being brought back into the recycling stream. Genuine people out there are looking for such opportunities and they are to be encouraged. However, there is an illegal aspect to this and although regulation is needed to ensure that theft and other illegal activities are not encouraged, it must be risk-based regulation bearing down on the people who are paying less attention to its legal niceties. People running proper, legitimate businesses should not be subject to legislation that inhibits their efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.2/12">This has been a good debate. It has drawn out a number of issues. This is a most effective industry, both in terms of the economy and the environment, but the Government could do a number of things to ensure that it can operate more effectively. The recycling of certain materials does not operate to the same extent in this country as it does in others. Norway recycles 93 per cent. of its aluminium and Switzerland and Finland recycle 88 per cent., while in the United Kingdom the figure is just 48 per cent. What can the Government do to encourage increased recycling, particularly of non-ferrous metals that are valuable in terms of commodity prices but take a huge amount of energy to produce from the virgin state? What are they doing to ensure that the criminal justice system bears down on metal thefts? What are they doing to ensure that travellers on railway lines are not put at risk and churches and other community buildings do not suffer when their roofs are stripped of lead, leading to costs for the insurance industry and, always, costs to the community? Is there any way in which the UK can bring its recycling levels up to some of those in the European Union? Will the Minister strengthen the end-of-life vehicles directive and the certificate of destruction to ensure that the loopholes are closed and that as many of our vehicles as possible are recycled?</p>
	<p pid="c.365.2/13">This is a successful industry, but I feel that the Government can and should do more to encourage it, lighten the regulation where they can and bear down on those who want to make a cheap buck and do not go through the proper processes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-22c.368.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1896" speakername="Anne McIntosh" colnum="368"  time="010:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080422/halltext/80422h0003.htm#08042258000408">
	<p pid="c.368.0/1">I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Chope; it is a great honour to serve under your chairmanship. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" name="Alan Whitehead">the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead)</phrase>, not just on securing the debate but on his continued interest in all environmental matters, and I pay tribute to his expertise.</p>
	<p pid="c.368.0/2">This has been an interesting debate. It finally puts paid to the spectre of Steptoe and Son and shady business, which once came to mind as we looked on the industry with affection. It is interesting to see that the turnover of the top three companies is &pound;3.8 billion, &pound;1.1 billion and &pound;175 million respectively, so they are by no means the poor relations of the recycling industry.</p>
	<p pid="c.368.0/3">The Conservative party is heavily committed to the concept of zero waste. I commend our quality of life report, which runs to 550 pages and is widely available on the Conservative party website. With recycling in mind, and wishing to save paper, I shall resist the urge of copying the report to all hon. Members assembled in the Chamber, but I commend it to them. Conservatives are committed to the concept of zero waste and recognise that we have need a new mindset, moving away from the least-cost compliance to a recognition of the fact that metals are a valuable resource, as hon. Members, led by the hon. Member for Southampton, Test, have made clear. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> said, that resource is a big earner for UK Ltd and a big employer, too. We are looking at policies dealing not just with landfill bans on metal, but with packaging reduction regulations and incentives for returning cans and bottles. That works successfully in Scandinavia: it gives people a vested interest in the issue, and we should explore it.</p>
	<p pid="c.368.0/4">During the recent recess, while canvassing in the market town of Boroughbridge, I visited the little village of Milby Island, which is regularly flooded; although the flood defences have been improved in the rest of Boroughbridge, that is the one area that still floods. There is, regrettably, in the strategic overview for waste disposal at county level, a possible site for industrial waste disposal in this village, which would seem the least appropriate place to site it anywhere in the county because of the problem of road access and because it is prone to flooding. Obviously, all the villagers at Milby and all the residents of Boroughbridge are opposed to such a site. However, when I asked whether there were any other issues that concerned them, they said that they would like more recycling, particularly of plastics, including plastic bottles. I said, &quot;You do not wish to see an industrial recycling plant in your own market town, but you would like to see a plastic bottle recycling plant in some other little village in the Vale of York or elsewhere in north Yorkshire.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.368.0/5">Perhaps there is a way forward that would cause less grief. Inevitably, recycling sites tend to be based in the little villages of North Yorkshire. Such a situation raises many planning issues not faced by other European countries, which have a much bigger landmass. The Minister and all hon. Members are apprised of this challenge. In respect of the concept of zero waste, we are wedded to the concept of revising our thinking on powerful consumer culture. For example, people expect a new mobile phone every year, so recycling should start in the home. I visited the local tip at Rufforth when an application was being considered to extend it, and I know that glass from household waste and wood from building materials such as wood frames are two of the most difficult products to recycle. However, in the present market, metal should be easier to recycle.</p>
	<p pid="c.368.0/6">I want to throw two challenges down for the Minister. First, in reply to a parliamentary question she stated:</p>
	<p pid="c.368.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Each tonne of aluminium recycled, saves 11 tonnes of CO2&quot; &mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-02-18.259"><i>Official Report</i>, 18 February 2008; Vol. 472, c. 259</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.368.0/8">The arguments for recycling metals are compelling, and we are all aware of the high price of not doing so. Japan is growing increasingly prosperous, and is increasingly hungry for metal, which fuels illegal activity and theft. My first challenge for the Minister concerns EU regulations on the transhipment of waste, to which hon. Members have referred. When the regulations were going through, why did her Government not oppose those transhipments? Her predecessor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" name="Ben Bradshaw">the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw)</phrase>, replied to questions about the details of the measures, particularly the commercial confidentiality of some of the information on the form. What we have learnt today flags up one of the greatest difficulties with regulations, and I submit that this debate would have carried more weight and produced more action if it had taken place in the European Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.368.0/9">If the Government had opposed the regulations or sought to revise them, I submit that we would not be in the present position. I challenge the Minister to explain why the Government did not oppose the regulations when they were being considered. From what the hon. Member for Southampton, Test so eloquently and passionately argued, that is at the root of our difficulties. I also submit that the debate has flagged up a general problem with the scrutiny of EU regulations in Parliament. We can vote only for or against them, and I plead with the Minister and, perhaps more appropriately, the Leader of the House, to enable us to amend regulations as they go through the House. It is not sufficient merely to vote for or against them.</p>
	<p pid="c.368.0/10">On comitology as opposed to co-decision, I am afraid that I am a bit of an anorak, or a macintosh, because not only did I spend 10 years serving as a Member of the European Parliament, I worked for the Conservatives in the European Parliament, and prior to that I practised European law in a very humble capacity. My understanding of comitology is that it is left to national officials and experts, who are well meaning and well qualified, to meet behind closed doors and agree to regulations on which Members of Parliament and MEPs, who are the real experts, do not have the right to be consulted. They may impose&mdash;I say this sincerely to the hon. Member for Southampton, Test&mdash;additional burdens on industry, particularly UK industry, of which we are not aware until the decision has been made. We should not rush through the regulations, because they may end up like the transhipment regulations to which the hon. Gentleman referred.</p>
	<p pid="c.368.0/11">Would it not be better to have a co-decision procedure, which is transparent, with an element of parliamentary democracy at two levels? Ministers appear before European Committees and perhaps the European Scrutiny Committee, and we could improve the scrutiny and the remit with which we task Ministers to negotiate at co-decision level before they negotiate at the Council of Ministers. We also have our own Members of the European Parliament to whom we can speak, and whom I am sure the industry will lobby before going into battle. It is not necessarily in the best interests of the UK industry to agree to comitology just for speed. I do not know many hon. Members who want the measure to go through by comitology: Conservative Members would be appalled if that happened, when we could have co-decision.</p>
	<p pid="c.368.0/12">I entirely support the urgent need for a redefinition of waste, and I want to challenge the Minister further. Hon. Members who have spoken are at one in wanting that redefinition, but that will not happen unless member states support us. Will the Minister tell us which member states will support us? Without that support, there is not a prayer of the measure going through, even with the greatest will in the world&mdash;and we want to give UK industry experts the greatest support&mdash;because, from what the hon. Member for Southampton, Test said and from the tone of the debate it strikes me that everything is conspiring against us. Extra regulations are required covering export to non-OECD countries such as China. We are the major exporter and beneficiary, but where will support come from if we want the redefinition to proceed sooner rather than later?</p>
	<p pid="c.368.0/13">We need a definition of waste that is less restrictive or, as my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury said, more proportionate. Fully recovered metals must be recognised as a secondary raw material, not waste, if we are to build on, and not just maintain, the world market export position that we enjoy. I hope that after today's debate we will all contact our colleagues in the European Parliament to ensure that all the parties in that institution are singing from the same hymn sheet. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what progress has been made in the negotiating procedures.</p>
	<p pid="c.368.0/14">I support entirely what has been said about the burden of regulation: the one-size-fits-all approach to generic waste sites and regulators does not necessarily fit in with the market. We must provide greater clarity, and we must remove the confusion and the administrative burden and costs on the industry. We must ensure that illegal operators are rooted out, and that legitimate operators are allowed to develop this lucrative and legitimate trade. Metal recyclers should have a full review of the effect of the regulations on the industry, leading to streamlined regulation. The new environmental permitting programme and the DEFRA exemption review threaten to add to the regulatory burden, so perhaps the Minister would put our minds at rest on that. The Government have demonstrated&mdash;I say this somewhat reluctantly&mdash;a lack of a joined-up approach in the Department, as well as in other Departments. The Minister is on record as saying that there could be huge savings in CO2 emissions and natural resources through increased metal recycling, with gains for British business and, as a result of lower emissions, reduced pollution. There is no co-ordinated UK strategy to promote the industry, but is the Minister minded to produce one?</p>
	<p pid="c.368.0/15">In conclusion, I invite the Minister to tell the Committee why the Government did not oppose the regulations when they were being considered. What is the status of the current negotiations, and, if we are to succeed, which member states will support us? On the points that have been made about where metal and other recycling plants will go in future, is she mindful of their impact on the countryside? Such plants are a blot on residential and completely green landscapes, and can have an impact on house prices and on the general quality of life. On my canvassing excursions during the recess, great concern was expressed about where industrial waste and recycling plants are to be located. I am not going to mention it publicly, but I am negotiating on that matter and have a site in mind in the Vale of York that is more appropriate than the sites that have been given as examples. On that point, I urge the Minister to put our minds at rest, and reassure us that she and her Government will do everything in their power to support a hardworking, lucrative industry.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-22c.373.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" speakername="Joan Ruddock" colnum="373"  time="010:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080422/halltext/80422h0003.htm#08042258000411">
	<p pid="c.373.1/1">I am not in a position to say why we did not vote against those directives. Obviously, at the time I was not the Minister involved, but I will see whether there is anything useful that I can tell the hon. Lady. What really matters is that we try to overcome any existing problems. There have been problems but we have made great efforts to deal with them, and as I said, the important markets of China and India have been secured.</p>
	<p pid="c.373.1/2">The hon. Lady has anticipated my comments on how we should proceed in changing the legislation. She will know that the industry is concerned that EU procedures should not delay agreement on end-of-waste criteria, and we very much agree. As she anticipated, I must be frank and say that there is some way to go before the revised directive can be adopted. The European Parliament's environment committee recently voted to adopt 81 amendments to the common position. The Second Reading in Parliament has not occurred and is scheduled to take place in June.</p>
	<p pid="c.373.1/3">This is a difficult issue, and the question is whether it should be resolved by comitology or co-decision. My hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test and the hon. Member for Banbury both favour comitology, but the hon. Member for Vale of York disagrees. I have to tell her that although we all appreciate the importance of transparency, there has to be some trade-off. In this case, we are concerned to make more progress, and we believe that that is what the industry is demanding of us. The Government therefore believe that comitology is the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.373.1/4">My hon. Friend asked about off-cuts of metal, which is an important question. It is obvious to all that off-cuts that are not polluted in any way remain the original resource, so we clearly ought not to classify them as waste. I can give my hon. Friend some good news. The Environment Agency will shortly publish guidance on when clean off-cuts can be reused without regulatory control. I am sure that that is what he wants; it is obviously common sense to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.373.1/5">My hon. Friend went on to praise the end-of-life vehicles directive, the success of which we all very much appreciate. My constituency used to be littered with abandoned vehicles. They were removed by the local authority, which did the job efficiently and effectively but at great cost to the council tax payer. However, it is a success story, because much of that blight has now been removed from our streets. The majority of materials in such vehicles are metal. As my hon. Friend said&mdash;we all agree&mdash;they are successfully being recycled.</p>
	<p pid="c.373.1/6">Over the next few years we face challenging EU targets on recovery and recycling. The target to reuse, recover or recycle 95 per cent. of the materials used in a car by 2015 is demanding by any standards. The metals recycling industry is vital to meeting those demands. However, only approximately 75 per cent. of a car is estimated to be made of metal. The question raised by a number of hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, is how to recycle the remaining materials. One option suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test concerned energy from waste. We expect there to be an increase in the provision of energy from waste facilities; for example, by 2020 energy recovery is expected to account for about 25 per cent. of municipal waste.</p>
	<p pid="c.373.1/7">A number of hon. Members, including my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Banbury, asked whether we would support a recycling taskforce. I shall need time to consider the matter further. The question was asked also by the British Metals Recycling Association. The local provision of recycling and recovery facilities must be decided locally, and the hon. Member for Vale of York illustrated why. Nationally, a long-standing consultation group on end-of-life vehicles, including the BMRA, meets regularly.</p>
	<p pid="c.373.1/8">This year, a new advisory body was established on waste electrical and electronic equipment. There is also a waste strategy stakeholder forum. The House will see that a plethora of bodies is involved in recycling those materials that concern us today. We believe that together, those groups will provide the long-term strategic approach needed to enable us to achieve our targets. However, I would be happy to meet the BMRA to discuss the matter further.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-22c.385.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" speakername="Tony Baldry" colnum="385"  time="011:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080422/halltext/80422h0005.htm#08042258000431">
	<p pid="c.385.0/1">In the dying days of any Government, Ministers think that they need to introduce initiatives to keep the media at bay. Before <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" name="Yvette Cooper">the right hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase> trucked off to the Treasury to explain how the Government are raiding money from one group of poor people to fund another, she came up with what she thought was a whizz-bang idea for eco-towns. She thought that eco-towns had everything&mdash;they were green and gave the impression that the Government were building more affordable housing on brownfield sites.</p>
	<p pid="c.385.0/2">The difficulty is that eco-town programmes have absolutely no public participation. I have with me the 2008-11 regional housing strategy for the south-east in which there is absolutely no mention of any eco-town. That strategy was developed by the Government office for the south-east, the Housing Corporation, South East England Development Agency, English Partnerships and every local authority in the south-east. How in God's name is anyone meant to plan anything and involve local people in a bottom-up planning system, if suddenly the Government come along and say, &quot;Hey guys, we're going to impose on you a number of so-called eco-towns&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="c.385.0/3">Eco-towns are just that&mdash;towns. The one proposed in my constituency, Weston Otmoor, will be larger than Bicester, which is already one of the fastest growing towns in the UK. If it is built, the Weston Otmoor eco-town will be home to 25,000 people, growing eventually to 35,000, with 10 schools&mdash;two secondary and eight primary&mdash;and 15,500 properties. Apart from the fact that such a development might well undermine the vitality and viability of a town such as Bicester, it seems bizarre that it is to be imposed by Ministers with no local consultation or involvement. Effectively, developers bought options on land, produced pretty maps and said to the Department for Communities and Local Government, &quot;Give us a run on this.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.385.0/4">In fact, the only brownfield land on that site consists of a former RAF airstrip still used for adventure training and parachute jumps by the RAF. The developers have not even secured it, and some 25 per cent. of the site is green-belt land. It straddles a main road, over which developers have proposed to build something like the Ponte Vecchio&mdash;they say&mdash;with shops that will go over the A34. It is absolutely crazy that the Government are threatening to develop a whole new town largely on green-belt land, and on very little brownfield land, undermining the viability of one of the fastest growing towns in the UK&mdash;Bicester. Unsurprisingly, organisations such as the Campaign to Protect Rural England and the local naturalist trust are aghast. The CPRE estimates that the development, if it goes ahead, will lead to at least 7,500 extra car movements a day on the A34 and M40.</p>
	<p pid="c.385.0/5">I can never persuade Ministers to visit my constituency, which I really do not understand&mdash;it must have something to do with my aftershave. However, I would welcome a visit from the Minister to the site of the proposed eco-town. He would observe the congested A34 where it meets the slow-moving M40, and its nearest junctions&mdash;9 and 10&mdash;which are already a nightmare, as a result of traffic from the south coast and Southampton travelling towards Oxford. It takes a dogleg down the M40 and up towards Northampton. Those two junctions are congested, and begging meetings with transport Ministers have been held to discuss proposals to enhance them. The idea of putting a whole new town in the midst of that traffic congestion defies belief.</p>
	<p pid="c.385.0/6">The Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust is tearing its hair out in despair, because it is concerned that</p>
	<p pid="c.385.0/7" class="indent">&quot;the scheme would result in the loss of one of its most important nationally-designated wildlife sites, threatening an ancient woodland site, a nature reserve and numerous protected and priority species.</p>
	<p pid="c.385.0/8" class="indent">For the proposed site includes Woodsides Meadow Nature Reserve, and other meadows owned and managed by BBOWT. The grassland habitats found at this site are extremely rare, supporting important species including orchids, snipe and curlew.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.385.0/9">The BBOWT said:</p>
	<p pid="c.385.0/10" class="indent">&quot;We just don't understand how development that would result in damage to a nationally important, protected habitat can be called an 'eco-town'.</p>
	<p pid="c.385.0/11" class="indent">It makes a mockery of the term 'sustainable' development.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.385.0/12">It takes some skill to propose a massive new site on primarily greenfield land and sites of special scientific interest with the only brownfield land being a grass-covered runway, used by the RAF for parachute drops, that the developers have not even secured.</p>
	<p pid="c.385.0/13">The involvement of local people in the proposal is absolutely zero, but that is the world in which we live. I hope that, in the dying days of this Government, Ministers will stop thinking up ideas and concentrate on sorting out the mess of last year's Budget and the 10p rate, and back away from ideas about imposing 42 day's detention on us. Successive Governments have developed a planning system that is not perfect, but which is at least plan-led and under which local people have the opportunity to make contributions at different stages, leading to local development plans and regional spatial strategies. In these eco-town proposals, Ministers are threatening to overthrow, undermine and destroy all of that. Why on earth should any local authority or councillor make any contribution to the development of things such as the regional spatial strategy when Ministers who just want a headline dream up eco-towns?</p>

	<p pid="c.391.0/1">It is a pleasure to have you in the Chair, Mr. Chope. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> on securing the debate on this timely and vital issue. He has raised this and related issues on several occasions, and I pay tribute to his diligence and dedication as a constituency Member of Parliament, not least in his capacity as a borough councillor in Kettering. I pay tribute also to all my hon. Friends who have spoken for the eloquent way in which they have put their cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.391.0/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Kettering has previously raised several related issues, including housing development in December last year, transport infrastructure in July 2006 and overdevelopment in October 2005. He is, if nothing else, extremely consistent on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="c.391.0/3">Since 1998, the Labour Government have paid lip service to having proper consultation on large-scale housing developments. As has been made clear by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase>, they originally rejected the simplistic predict-and-provide approach, but the reality is that local people, elected councillors and local planning authorities have continued to be overruled by planning inspectors and the Secretary of State. We have heard that 13,100 new dwellings are being forced on the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering over the next 13 years, and that there will be 52,000 new homes across the four districts and boroughs of north Northamptonshire in the same period. Those plans arise from the Milton Keynes and south midlands growth area plan that dates from 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.391.0/4">[Mr. David Wilshire <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p pid="c.391.0/5">Looking back to 2003-04, the Campaign to Protect Rural England was already commenting in that period about the efficacy of the consultation process. It said that formal scrutiny of the plan was limited and that consultation was severely lacking. Even before the public examination ended, in 2004, the Government had announced that a committee with planning powers that were separate to those of the local planning authority would be set up to deliver growth in Milton Keynes. They had also moved to establish an urban regeneration company to take planning powers from local authorities in west Northamptonshire and begun recruiting board members. They had also already established an inter-regional board, chaired by Lord Rooker, whose declared main function was &quot;to support growth&quot;, and the board had already met before the consultation process had ended. It is a key issue that the Government have gone ahead with the plans without properly soliciting the views of local people.</p>
	<p pid="c.391.0/6">As a result of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, the top-down culture of centralised housing and density targets has been entrenched and formalised. Sections 9 and 10 of the Act allow the Secretary of State to direct that changes be made to the regional spatial strategy, notwithstanding significant consultation that has already taken place locally. County plans have been abolished and local plans under section 21 of the Act are subject to the direct control of the Secretary of State. Furthermore, since July 2007, and the publication of the &quot;Review of sub-national economic development and regeneration&quot;, regional assemblies&mdash;which at least had a vestige of legitimacy, although they are an imperfect form of democracy&mdash;are to be abolished and regional development agencies are to take over as the regional planning bodies, with no local democratic accountability. The consultation document that was published last month contains little, if any, detail about regional spatial planning.</p>
	<p pid="c.391.0/7">Local councillors, residents and other key stakeholders know that consultation is a sham in Brown's Britain. How can it be otherwise? Even parking spaces are heavily prescribed by Whitehall under planning policy guidance note 14. Let me provide an example of the ludicrous and prescriptive nature of housing targets, and I shall restrict my comments to north Northamptonshire. Despite the area being forced to accommodate an enormous number of new dwellings, it is only now, in 2008, that the north Northamptonshire strategic housing land availability study&mdash;that is quite a mouthful&mdash;is pushing ahead with identifying 40 key sites for development in the area, but without considering the problem of the A43 link road, south-east of Corby and north-west of Kettering.</p>
	<p pid="c.391.0/8">In a written answer to a parliamentary question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-29">29 November</phrase> last year, the Minister failed to give any reassurances that the capacity of the vital A14 trunk road had been considered when allocating huge housing targets in north Northamptonshire. That is despite several promises from the Department and a visit from the former Transport Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" name="Stephen Ladyman">the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.391.0/9">Let me focus on planning policy statement 12 in relation to consultation. The Campaign to Protect Rural England has made a very important point and it bears repetition:</p>
	<p pid="c.391.0/10" class="indent">&quot;The lack of encouragement to local authorities who wish to draw up development control policies is of serious concern and could undermine the ability of local planning authorities to effectively manage development, particularly in areas where development pressures and environmental challenges are greatest.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.391.0/11">It is no wonder that civic leaders and other key people in Northamptonshire feel marginalised and excluded by the Government's relentless drive for inappropriate and damaging house building targets. I quote Councillor James Hakewill, leader of Kettering borough council, who said last year:</p>
	<p pid="c.391.0/12" class="indent">&quot;Development in the county should not just be a homes-led agenda to relieve pressures in the south-east, but a genuine infrastructure approach which could deliver benefits to our existing residents, businesses and visitors.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.391.0/13">I would like to go back to the point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> made about an &quot;asymmetric&quot; consultation. What he fails to recognise is that, at the end of a process, the commensurate result is that, without proper infrastructure, the quality of life is reduced for all people, both existing residents and residents who are new to a particular area.</p>
	<p pid="c.391.0/14">Top-down targets are creating unsustainable and unsuitable developments. I refer to the sage words of the Minister, when he spoke in a Westminster Hall debate before Christmas and said:</p>
	<p pid="c.391.0/15" class="indent">&quot;My big fear is that in 20 years we shall have built homes that people do not want to live in, and will be putting more public money into them. They will not be sustainable and we shall have to think of regeneration areas for homes built between 2010 and 2015. That will not be good enough. The people of this country deserve better&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2007-12-18.210"><i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 18 December 2007; Vol. 469, c. 210WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.391.0/16">I could not have put it better myself, after 11 years of a Labour Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.391.0/17">A Conservative Government will empower local communities to build more homes by incentivising local communities. We will engage local residents more fully and restore authority and autonomy to local planning authorities, elected by local voters. People want to be consulted on the number of homes in their communities, not on the colour of the paint on the lamp posts. We do not want lip service and a Conservative Government will deliver proper consultation. We will scrap flawed density targets, which force the construction of flats and apartments at the expense of family homes. While I am it, I will point out that the whole population and housing targets are flawed; the Barker report is flawed, and the statistics driven by the Office for National Statistics on population are completely flawed and inaccurate. The Conservatives will revisit those social and demographic data, which have driven the push for unpopular and centralised housing targets.</p>
	<p pid="c.391.0/18">This Government have failed, even by their own limited terms, to honour their pledges on house building, and the answer is not even bigger and bolder targets. It is time to scrap those central targets and the predict-and-provide policy, and give power back to people and communities in Northamptonshire and across our country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-22c.395.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="395"  time="012:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080422/halltext/80422h0007.htm#08042258000441">
	<p pid="c.395.0/1">In his contribution to the debate, the hon. Gentleman made an important point about eco-towns. He was trying to hint strongly&mdash;passionately, if I may say so&mdash;that we have somehow dictated that eco-towns would be built without any public consultation and without any due regard for the planning framework and process at all. If he will allow me, I come on to discuss how eco-towns fit into the whole planning process, because it is a very important issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.395.0/2">If I may return to what I was saying before the hon. Gentleman's intervention, each authority must publish a statement of community involvement, or SCI, setting out how and when they intend to consult local communities. I understand that the north Northamptonshire joint planning unit area SCI encourages applicants for significant applications&mdash;generally speaking, developments of 100 or more dwellings, or developments of more than three hectares for residential development&mdash;to try to resolve issues prior to the submission of the application. The SCI also encourages applicants to submit a so-called &quot;statement of engagement&quot; covering their pre-submission community engagement and the way in which their proposals have changed as a result of that public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="c.395.0/3">I also understand that public examination of the core strategy for the north Northamptonshire area recently ended, which is something that the hon. Member for Kettering mentioned. I hope that he shares my sense of encouragement at this major step forward in joint working: I speak as the proud chair of the Milton Keynes-South Midlands inter-regional group, which is an impressive collaboration between four district councils and a county council that aims to rise to the challenge of housing growth that we need to address. I understand that the inspector's report is due within the next few weeks.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-22c.397.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="397"  time="012:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080422/halltext/80422h0007.htm#08042258000455">
	<p pid="c.397.3/1">Absolutely not. I would love to have a debate on housing market renewal in the north and the midlands, because that is something for which I have ministerial responsibility. I contend that we need a significant, long-term investment programme, largely to rectify the challenges caused by the Conservatives' decimation of the economic base in those areas in the 1980s. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> This is an important point in this debate, which is about public consultation on large-scale housing developments. Let us stop spreading the myth that most of the buildings in inner cities in the north are being knocked down, as that is not what is happening. The ratio of new-build and refurbishment to demolition is in the region of 4:1 in housing market renewal areas. As a result of public consultation, we are refurbishing and building more houses. The idea that someone is dictating from a desk in Whitehall how the centre of Liverpool or Salford should look is simply a myth, and I expect better of the hon. Member for Peterborough than that he should peddle it.</p>
	<p pid="c.397.3/2">Infrastructure has been mentioned, and we had an interesting debate about the issue in December. As I have said before, housing and infrastructure investment must go hand in hand. The Homes and Communities Agency that will be created under the Housing and Regeneration Bill has as a central focus investment in infrastructure in order to regenerate communities in England, as that is very important. There has been real progress to date in the area represented by the hon. Member for Kettering. North Northamptonshire was awarded the third highest allocation of all growth area locations, with an indicative award of nearly &pound;20 million for the next three years. In addition, there a &pound;200 million community infrastructure fund for growth areas, new growth points and eco-towns over the next three years, and Northamptonshire benefited from more than &pound;21 million in the first round of CIF funding. The deadline for expressions of interest in the community infrastructure fund was yesterday, and bids have been received from Northamptonshire county council for three schemes in Kettering, including the A43 Corby link road dualling, which the hon. Member for Peterborough mentioned in his concluding remarks.</p>
	<p pid="c.397.3/3">It is wrong to say that we are not thinking about infrastructure. The idea that we need to have housing and infrastructure investment together is exactly the right approach. Also, it is a myth that we do not want public consultation on housing growth: in fact, that is a vital and essential part of the community empowerment plan that we wish to introduce. In the time available to me, I am not able to respond to the point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> made about eco-towns. Needless to say, this is the first stage of the process, and it will be completely part of the planning process. However, I will write to him and respond to the points that he made. In conclusion, this is an important issue. We need to address housing needs and we need public consultation, but the debate must be sensible so that we have the homes that we need and deserve in this country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-22c.407.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" speakername="Keith Simpson" colnum="407"  time="012:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080422/halltext/80422h0009.htm#08042258000467">
	<p pid="c.407.3/1">I know that expert opinion is divided, but what my hon. Friend told us is also the opinion in my constituency, where similar developments are proposed. Indeed, in the case of the proposed development at Guestwick, the leaders of the local community told me that if the amount of power to be produced provided electricity for the neighbouring towns of Dereham, Fakenham and Aylsham, they would find it rather difficult to oppose it. However, research shows that it would produce only a limited amount.</p>
	<p pid="c.407.3/2">I represent today a specific group of constituents who have been opposing the siting of six large wind turbines since 2004. They are convinced that an unintended consequence of what is effectively a Government subsidy is that, despite the development having been turned down by local planners, the developers have twice gone to appeal. They lost both times but now, four years later, they are seeking a judicial review&mdash;and if that is successful yet another planning inquiry. What is the cost to local democracy?</p>
	<p pid="c.407.3/3">I shall briefly explain what has happened with that application. I suspect that similar examples can be found elsewhere in Norfolk and in other parts of the United Kingdom. Government subsidies are effectively being used by developers to achieve what is known locally as the Tesco factor: if one has enough money and one keeps coming back, one will eventually overwhelm the planning inspectorate&mdash;and even persuade local people, who have to use their own money to appeal, that is it not worth the fight.</p>
	<p pid="c.407.3/4">In 2004, the developers Enertrag sought to gain planning permission to erect six wind turbines 120 m high in the open countryside at Guestwick in my constituency, about four miles north of where I live in the market town of Reepham. I do not have a vested interest, as I would not be able to see or hear the turbines, but I know the area only too well. It is within sight of the large village of Foulsham. The plan was opposed by an overwhelming majority of residents, and the application was turned down in 2005 on the recommendation of local planning officers and Norfolk county council, supported by Broadland district council's planning committee.</p>
	<p pid="c.407.3/5">The Minister will be aware that local planning authorities think very hard indeed before rejecting planning applications because they risk not only having the decision overturned on appeal but having costs awarded against them if their decision is considered to be unreasonable. In my experience, they tend to go over such applications in great detail. They are only too well aware that there may be strong local opinion, but if they feel that their decision is likely to be challenged legally, they will normally allow the development to go ahead.</p>
	<p pid="c.407.3/6">That was not so at Guestwick. The decision was appealed by the developers, and a public inquiry was held in 2006. Having heard detailed evidence from the developers and the district and parish councils, the planning inspectorate inspector ruled that the appeal should be dismissed because of the impact that the turbines would have on the landscape and the listed buildings in the area. The inspector's ruling was rejected by the developers, who appealed to the High Court to have the decision overturned. To the surprise of the local community, the Treasury solicitor decided not to contest the application. The decision of the inspector was set aside, and a second public inquiry was scheduled.</p>
	<p pid="c.407.3/7">That inquiry was held in June 2007, under the auspices of yet another senior inspector. The developer's arguments were again rejected, and the appeal was dismissed for a second time. The grounds for that decision were virtually the same as those cited in 2006. The developers are now seeking a judicial review. If they win, they will seek a third planning inquiry. If it is unsuccessful, they are prepared to resubmit their scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.407.3/8">In today's <i>Eastern Daily Press</i>, Mr. David Linley, the project manager for Enertrag, said:</p>
	<p pid="c.407.3/9" class="indent">&quot;We are going to go ahead. At the end of the day, logic has to rule. We think it is a good site&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.407.3/10">So logic has to rule, but not the spirit of the law or the views of the local community. That logic is based on the Government's renewable energy targets, the proposed changes to planning and the fact that, under a subsidy system, developers can keep returning until they have worn down the inspectors and the local community.</p>
	<p pid="c.407.3/11">I do not suggest that the Minister or his predecessors had that in mind when drawing up the present system, but that is the consequence and it is affecting my constituents and those of my parliamentary neighbours in Norfolk and elsewhere. My constituents are disillusioned, angry and out of pocket. Local residents have had to fund their own legal representation.</p>

	<p pid="c.409.1/1">Not only does my hon. Friend have constituency experience of this; he is also a senior member of that most powerful of parliamentary committees, the Public Accounts Committee, and he knows only too well the financial and regulatory aspects. The point that he raises fits in nicely with the thrust of my argument. He is right. I am talking about one village and a small hamlet, but the people themselves raised &pound;15,000 for the first inquiry, and the second inquiry cost them &pound;20,000. If it goes to a third inquiry, it will probably cost them &pound;25,000. As he pointed out, it is costing them twice over&mdash;first, through the money that they had to raise and secondly through the indirect costs. Through taxation and through their electricity bills, they are effectively funding the developers, as well as having to fund their legal representation. That is wrong and unfair.</p>
	<p pid="c.409.1/2">I bring this issue to Parliament to ask whether the Government recognise that, through their renewable strategy and what I believe are subsidies for developers, they are allowing the developers to bulldoze through applications for wind turbines against the wishes of local planners and local communities. That is undemocratic and unfair. If local communities faced the prospect of those sites producing a massive amount of power locally, they would find their arguments undercut. How are the Government going to address that imbalance, which is down to the law of unintended consequences? Will they consider establishing a legal fund to enable local communities to gain access to legal representation? Taxpayers already fund the developers, so they could also fund local communities. Let us have a level legal playing field. People in Norfolk recognise that something is unfair and undemocratic about the matter.</p>
	<p pid="c.409.1/3">The Minister can expect more widespread opposition to centrally imposed targets. We want a proper renewables strategy and to bring local communities along with us on that, but the way in which developers currently go about it&mdash;perfectly legally&mdash;is producing widespread resistance and cynicism. I do not want my constituents to face one, two or three more appeals by a developer, which will cost them tens of thousands of pounds, for what they suspect will be a renewables wind farm that will not produce a significant contribution to the national grid.</p>

	<p pid="c.422.1/1">I pledge to do that. I also suggest that the Minister for the South West would be interested in the matter as well, and I hope to include him in that role.</p>
	<p pid="c.422.1/2">Plymouth is one of eight locations in the south-west awarded Government new growth point status in November 2006. That initiative was launched in December 2005 as part of our response to Kate Barker's review of housing supply and after the Government invited local authorities to submit sustainable growth proposals. The initiative is intended to be a long-term and sustainable partnership for growth between Plymouth city council and the Government designed to support the sustainable delivery of homes, jobs and relevant infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="c.422.1/3">Quite rightly, Plymouth was identified in the draft regional spatial strategy as a strategically significant city. That strategy and the new growth point bid propose that Plymouth deliver up to 1,500 homes per annum from 2002 to 2026&mdash;a total of 24,500 homes&mdash;which would represent a 35 per cent. increase on the existing level as set out in current planning guidance. The growth strategy that we have supported focuses on a number of regeneration areas and brownfield sites, which I have mentioned already, with a proposal for a new community at Sherford, on the eastern edge of the city.</p>
	<p pid="c.422.1/4">As part of the new growth point pilot fund, in 2007-08, my Department awarded &pound;960,000 to Plymouth for projects supporting the city's new growth point proposals. Some &pound;710,000 of that grant was committed to preparation costs of transport modelling and the eastern corridor major scheme bid. The balance of &pound;250,000 was provided as contribution to the start-up costs of the Plymouth city development company.</p>
	<p pid="c.422.1/5">Last year, the Government invited existing new growth points to submit delivery plans, including proposals for additional funding for medium-term projects from 2008-09 to 2010-11. Plymouth's delivery submission, drawn up in consultation with South Hams district council, was awarded &pound;780,000 of revenue funding and &pound;8.89 million of capital funding&mdash;a total of &pound;9.67 million for the three-year period. Plymouth has outlined that the revenue support will be allocated to the preparation of the major scheme transport submission, the urban fringe development plan document, the eastern corridor programme management and to enhancing capacity. The capital provision will be allocated to enhancements in the eastern and northern corridor, junction improvements to the A38, waste infrastructure projects, and city centre, public realm and green space improvements.</p>
	<p pid="c.422.1/6">Naturally, such growth requires a strong economic base. I recognise my hon. Friend's point about Plymouth being a centre of world-class expertise in marine and science technology. She made a strong and passionate case about the city's opportunities through the establishment of the marine management organisation, as outlined in part 1 of the draft Marine Bill, which was published earlier this month. She will be aware that the proposal is to establish a new headquarters for the agency with a series of local offices, and that the location of the headquarters has not yet been determined. I understand that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will undertake consultancy work to draw up the criteria upon which to assess location options for the headquarters. I also understand that she is meeting the Minister for the South East soon. I wish her well with her discussions. As a former parliamentary private secretary to the then Minister of State for Health, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" name="Rosie Winterton">the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton)</phrase>, when she was in charge of dentistry, I recall my hon. Friend's lobbying requirements and techniques with regards to a new dental school, so I know that she will do a first-class job.</p>
	<p pid="c.422.1/7">I shall address a key theme in my hon. Friend's contribution&mdash;the implications of the naval base review for Devonport. I was impressed by her contribution in last month's Adjournment debate on that matter. She will be aware that, following the naval base review, Her Majesty's Naval Base Devonport is looking to reconfigure operational activity to the core of the base and to release a number of parcels of land for civilian use. I reiterate what the Minister for the Armed Forces said in reply to her debate: recent suggestions that the Government are planning to close the naval base at Devonport are without foundation, but from this reconfiguration of land, income from the disposal of such sites could generate funds to support the regeneration of South Yard.</p>
	<p pid="c.422.1/8">South Yard comprises 100 acres, and although there is a continuing need for naval use of the quay frontage, the body of the site is considered to be suited to the creation of a marine technology business park. When redeveloped, that could generate income for the retained base operations as well as provide space for complementary businesses. We recognise that the local vision is to have a cluster of leading marine businesses and research and innovation to support the naval base, which could be a key driver for the city's economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.422.1/9">I understand that partners estimate that about 3,000 high-value jobs could be created at South Yard and that, as such, the naval base is part of Project Roundel. It is in discussion with partners including the RDA and Plymouth council about how a joint venture could be structured to achieve that marine technology site. I also understand that the RDA and the local authority are working with, and supporting, the naval base with technical studies and master planning style assessments to demonstrate the viability of such a technology park and how it could be integrated into the wider regeneration role. My Department will pledge to work with partners, wherever possible, to improve the long-term future of the land and to enhance economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="c.422.1/10">My hon. Friend asked that I and my Department take an interest in ensuring a cross-government overview of the ongoing changes in naval base activity. That is an operational responsibility for the Ministry of Defence and the Royal Navy, but I pledge to do what she asks, because I agree that it will have wide implications for economic development, growth and housing need. I mentioned earlier that the Minister for the South West will, I think, play a key role as well.</p>
	<p pid="c.422.1/11">My hon. Friend is correct in identifying the role of neighbourhood regeneration and the community in support of city growth, in which I think that there have been real developments in Plymouth that need to go further. I am keen to see that happen. She mentioned the east end partnership and community village which in March 2008 won a national regeneration award at the <i>Local Government Chronicle</i> award ceremony. Again, that reiterates that the east end partnership is a sign of the success of Plymouth in achieving growth through local community engagement.</p>
	<p pid="c.422.1/12">My hon. Friend's contribution was spot on. Plymouth is turning a corner and providing real foundations for growth. However, I would go further and say that my two hon. Friends here are providing the leadership in shaping that ambition. It is refreshing to hear for an area a positivity, ambition and aspiration that we do not always hear in debates. Plymouth has a strong local vision supported regionally in the regional spatial strategy and as one of the Government's new growth points. We all recognise that hard work remains to be done, but we are coming from a very positive base led by my two hon. Friends. However, the creation of one of Europe's leading waterfront cities is a vision very much worth realising.</p>
	<p pid="c.422.1/13" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="c.422.1/14" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at <i>one minute to </i>Two o'clock.</p>
