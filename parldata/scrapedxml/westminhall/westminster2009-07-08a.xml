<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-08a.255.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" speakername="Lembit Öpik" colnum="255"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090708/halltext/90708h0001.htm#09070879000439">
	<p pid="a.255.2/1">I thank right hon. and hon. Members for attending this debate. I am particularly grateful to Mr. Speaker for granting my request for this debate on human rights in Iran. That we should be holding it now will come as no surprise. Regrettably, the authorities in Iran have not chosen to build bridges, despite the olive branches that have been offered by me and so many others. In the past few weeks, we have clearly seen demonstrated both the internal tensions within Iran and the readiness of elements in the Iranian state to use violence and oppression.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/2">I come from the perspective of the problems faced by Iran's Baha'i community, but I note also the plight of many other Iranian minority communities and the treatment of Iranian women. And who can ignore the Iranian state's use of capital punishment? Few nations on earth execute people as often or for as many different reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/3">Nevertheless, I want to make it clear to this House and to the Iranian authorities that my objective is not to pillory that great nation. I do not conduct politics through confrontation or simplistic condemnation of individuals or Governments. Rather, my two goals are to resolve the pressing human rights issues facing the Baha'is in Iran and to prevent a dreadful miscarriage of justice in the days ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/4">The Baha'i faith has 5 million adherents worldwide, and there are 6,000 in Britain. However, the historic roots of the community lie in Iran. Despite persecution since the inception of the religion in the 19th century, the Baha'is remain the largest single religious minority community in that country, numbering around 300,000 members.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/5">Baha'is have historically been treated as scapegoats during times of social tension, but conditions sharply deteriorated after the Iranian revolution of 1979. Sadly, that situation continues to this day. Since 1979, more than 200 Baha'is have been killed and 15 others have disappeared&mdash;we must presume that they are dead. Repression of their community has included executions and imprisonment, as well as denial of the right to educate their youth. There have been regular and persistent attacks on their social, economic and cultural rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/6">The Baha'is seek no special privileges. All they seek are conditions that accord with the International Bill of Human Rights, of which Iran is a signatory. The right to life, the right to profess and practise their religion, the right to liberty and security of person, and the right to education and work: those are not heady demands.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/7">The Baha'i faith requires Baha'is to be obedient to their Government and to avoid partisan political involvement. Indeed, I am the chairman of the all-party Friends of the Baha'is group only because I am not a Baha'i myself. Were I to sign up to the faith, technically, I would have to leave party politics&mdash;something which I am glad to say I have not yet been persuaded to do. [Hon. Members: &quot;Go on.&quot;] Until this moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/8">It is important to note that subversive activity and all forms of violence are not permitted by the Baha'i faith. It follows that the Baha'i community in Iran, and, in fact, in the United Kingdom, is not aligned with any Government, ideology or opposition movement. Furthermore, showing good will to the followers of all religions is a basic, fundamental tenet of the Baha'i faith. The Baha'is are not enemies of Islam nor, indeed, of Iran. One could not find a more benign and humanistic religion anywhere on earth. The faith is of a pure, gentle and spiritual giving nature. It threatens no one but holds out a hand of friendship to one and all.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/9">Given the character of the Baha'i faith, it is all the more tragic that, in the past few years, there has been a resurgence of extreme forms of persecution directed at the Baha'i community of Iran. The upsurge has alarmed human rights monitors who fear not only for those Baha'is affected by the Government's renewed campaign but also that such attacks portend something far worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/10">International experts on ethnic, racial and religious cleansing have identified a number of warning signs that often foreshadow widespread purges. Several recent developments add to those concerns, and I shall cite them now. First, seven members of the Baha'i leadership group have been arbitrarily detained for more than eight months and still have no access to legal counsel. They form the core concern that has led to this debate. There are worrying precedents to the situation. After the revolution in Iran, the nine members of the National Assembly were abducted and disappeared. Nothing has been heard of them since then, and they are presumed dead. A new National Assembly was elected, and in 1981 eight of the nine members of that body were executed.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/11">Secondly, arbitrary arrests and detentions are being made, chiefly by the Intelligence Ministry. Currently, 31 Baha'is are in prison, and, as of June 2009, 78 Baha'is who had been detained and then released on bail are awaiting trial. Thirdly, there has been a general upsurge in vigilante attacks against Baha'is and their properties, such as the bulldozing of Baha'i cemeteries and the torching of Baha'i homes. Fourthly, there appears to be an increase in incitement and propaganda in state-run news media to vilify and defame Baha'is as individuals and the faith as a whole. The fifth example is the deliberate policy of denying Baha'is their right to a livelihood by banning them from employment options, confiscating their means of business, and blocking their access to higher education.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/12">Much of that is part the Iranian Government's strategy to suppress the Baha'i community without attracting undue international attention, as outlined in a secret memorandum from 1991 that aimed at establishing a policy regarding &quot;the Baha'i question&quot;. So we know that there has been a strategy behind all this in the past, and it is reasonable to assume that there is a similar strategy at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/13">Little wonder, then, that the Baha'is of Iran are denied the right to practise their faith freely, which is a right guaranteed under international human rights instruments such as the International Bill of Human Rights, to which, I stress again, Iran is a state party. Baha'is recognise that there are many other oppressed groups in Iran, including academics, women's rights activists, students and journalists. The situation of Iranian Baha'is, however, offers a special case, inasmuch as they are persecuted solely because of their religious belief, despite remaining committed to non-violence and non-partisanship and seeking only to contribute to the development of their homeland.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/14">Our experience indicates that bilateral and multilateral scrutiny of Iran's human rights record is the best method of engaging the Iranian authorities and preventing further deterioration of human rights for the many citizens of that country who face repression. The seven members of the Yaran&mdash;the Friends&mdash;constitute an ad hoc leadership body that co-ordinates the activities of the 300,000 strong Baha'i community in Iran. The elected administrative bodies of the Baha'i faith are banned, so these people, detained and on trial as they are, represent the focus of the matter in hand. This, despite the fact that the Iranian authorities have had regular, if informal, contact with the Yaran for many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/15">The secretary of the Yaran, Mrs. Mahvash Sabet, was arrested on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-05">5 March 2008</phrase> while attending a Baha'i funeral. The remaining six members, Mrs. Fariba Kamalabadi, Mr. Jamaloddin Khanjani, Mr. Afif Naeimi, Mr. Saeid Rezaie, Mr. Behrouz Tavakkoli, and Mr. Vahid Tizfahm, were arrested on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-14">14 May 2008</phrase>. I expect the Minister to read out all those names as well when he responds. All seven have been detained for more than a year in Evin prison, Tehran. They have been held in section 209, which is under the direct control of the Revolutionary Guard Corps. The five male members have been incarcerated in a cell with no bedding.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/16">In June, the Centre for Human Rights Defenders in Iran learned that the seven will face revolutionary trial, and our best guess is that that will happen on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-11">11 July</phrase>&mdash;this Saturday. The lawyers have indicated that they have had the opportunity to review the related case files but have not been able to complete the process as the files are unusually extensive.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/17">Further to the decision of Ms Shirin Ebadi of the Centre of Human Rights Defenders in Iran to serve as legal counsel for the seven Baha'is, fraudulent claims have appeared in the Iranian media that aim to malign or intimidate her and thereby prevent the Baha'is from having legal representation. Untrue and erroneous stories have also asserted that Ms Ebadi's daughter has apostastised from Islam and converted to the Baha'i faith. Ms Ebadi has also had death threats pinned to the door of her office, one of which was signed &quot;The Association of Anti-Baha'is&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/18">It is understood that the trial will be carried out under the jurisdiction of branch 28 of the revolutionary court. That is significant because the recent case of American-Iranian journalist Roxana Saberi was also tried in branch 28, in camera, in proceedings that lasted a single day, at the end of which she was sentenced to eight years for espionage.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/19">Under Iranian law, the lawyers for the Baha'is are not allowed to reveal information they are privy to from the case file. Amazingly, it remains unclear whether the seven Baha'is have been formally charged with any offence to date&mdash;just days before the trial. However, reports in February 2009 indicated that they will be charged with</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/20" class="indent">&quot;espionage for the state of Israel&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/21">and</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/22" class="indent">&quot;spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/23">and</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/24" class="indent">&quot;insulting religious sanctities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/25">In May of 2009 it was even reported that they will also face accusations of</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/26" class="indent">&quot;spreading corruption on earth&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/27">a pretty gigantic charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/28">The Baha'i international community categorically denies the accusations against these individuals, but fears that they may none the less face execution. So-called spying has long been used as a pretext to persecute Baha'is and as an attempt to impede the progress of the Baha'i community. Since the 1930s, Baha'is have successively been cast as tools of Russian imperialism, of British colonialism, of American expansionism and, most recently, of Zionism. The Baha'i faith has never been a part of any of these movements. There is no truth in this allegation and no evidence to support it.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/29">That the international headquarters of the Baha'i faith is located within the borders of modern-day Israel is purely the result of Baha'u'llah, the founder of the faith, being banished from his native Tehran and sent by Persian and Ottoman authorities in the 19th century to perpetual exile in the city of Acre, near Haifa. Baha'u'llah arrived in Acre in 1868, 80 years before the establishment of the state of Israel. The Iranian Government know this but wilfully chooses to misrepresent the facts.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/30">What would we like to see? Initially, we ask our British Government to apply whatever pressure they can to encourage the Iranian authorities to release the seven members of the Yaran. They have done nothing wrong and do not deserve the treatment that they have received; they deserve justice and release from their unjustified incarceration. If a trial goes ahead&mdash;as I say, it is scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-11">11 July</phrase>, which is this Saturday&mdash;we ask Ministers to impress upon the Iranian authorities before then that it must be carried out in an open, transparent manner, according to international standards, with proper access to legal representation and with no effort to fix the outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/31">In terms of wider action by the Government, we ask for collective action by British Ministers and our European and international partners for a longer-term easing of the persecution that is being endured by the Baha'is and others, including Christians, in Iran. In this context, I cite the plight of Maryam Rostampour and Marzieh Amirizadeh, both held in Evin prison since March 2009, apparently for being Christians. We understand the considerable difficulties in dealing with the Iranian authorities and the limitations of international pressure.</p>

	<p pid="a.259.2/1">If push comes to shove, I have a small aircraft of my own and I can see if I can make it in eight short hops. However, it would be safer for me, and easier for the country, if the Minister used his considerable weight and the considerable stature of the British Government to seek once again to extend an olive branch to Iran and make it clear that we do not seek to attack it, but merely want to encourage it to take a more benign, positive view towards the Baha'is and other oppressed minorities, and towards these seven Baha'i leaders in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.2/2">My requests are simple. I ask that the British Government do all they can to prevent a miscarriage of justice in regard to the seven Baha'i leaders facing trial. I ask the Iranian Government for engagement. Ultimately, this is the best pathway to justice. Iran can have many friends in Britain and worldwide, and I would like to be one of them. By lightening the load of oppression on the Baha'is and others, Iran finds for itself the best avenue to lead itself and its citizens into full partnership in the international community. I am sure, with all my heart, that that is something we would all like to see.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-08a.260.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="260"  time="009:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090708/halltext/90708h0001.htm#09070879000444">
	<p pid="a.260.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit Öpik">the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> on securing this timely and welcome debate. I endorse all the points that he made about religious freedoms and tolerance, which are necessary in any modern society. In Iran, which has a plethora of ethnic communities and religious groups, that sort of tolerance is more important than in many other countries. I therefore support what the hon. Gentleman said about the rights of Baha'is, Jews, Zoroastrians, Christians, non-Shi'a Muslims, and people of other religious faiths to be able to practise their religion and to operate in freedom. What he said this morning is extremely important and it is important to have that on the record. Iran is a signatory to the United Nations charter&mdash;obviously, because it is a member of the UN&mdash;and the universal declaration of human rights. All those rights are protected in international law, so it is perfectly right and proper to exert that pressure.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/2">These are stirring and important times in Iran. The demonstrations of the past few weeks following the election have been unprecedented since 1979&mdash;phenomenal numbers of people have appeared on the streets. I deplore the way in which many of the demonstrators have been treated&mdash;the beatings and killings. That is not acceptable in any society, be it in Iran, China or anywhere else in the world. People have an absolute right to express their views peaceably on the streets.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/3">Coverage of the demonstrations that was received around the world was interesting. Initially, various Iranian channels reported on the demonstrations, as did the BBC, CNN and others, and there was an interesting degree of opening in political debate, both inside and outside Iran, immediately after the elections. One should be pleased about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/4">I was pleased to sign and support early-day motion 1755, tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>, which condemns</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/5" class="indent">&quot;the arrest, torture and murder of protesters...and urges the Iranian Government to accept free and fair UN-supervised elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/6">I do not believe for one moment that Iran will accept outside supervision of elections, but every country in the world, including the UK, should be more than happy to accept international observers and reporting of elections. We should not be so precious about that. We send observers to other countries and we should welcome observers here. Every country's electoral process should be open to observation, which would create a degree of equality.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/7">These are interesting times, but it seems that after the protests about the election and the demands by Mousavi's supporters for a recount following the declared very large majority for Ahmadinejad, the Guardian Council approved a limited and partial recount, but the Supreme Leader declared that the election result must stand and that was the end of the matter. At that point, public debate was effectively closed down, as was any attempt at serious discussion. We must express serious concern about that, not in a spirit of hostility to Iran or its history and culture, but in a spirit of co-operation and support for civil society in Iran. There is an important distinction to be drawn, which I shall discuss.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/8">The excessive rhetoric, particularly from the Bush Administration and at various times from our Governments, has not helped the situation&mdash;in fact, it has made it worse. There must be a process of dialogue and respect. Far too little is understood of Iranian history&mdash;Iran is the inheritor of the great civilisation of Persia&mdash;and the persistent British and American meddling in Iranian affairs. During the first world war, Britain occupied parts of what is now Iran; we installed and removed various Governments of Iran; and British and Soviet Union forces occupied Iran again during the second world war, eventually withdrawing.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/9">In 1952, the nationalist Mosaddeq Government were elected on a manifesto of obtaining equality of oil revenues from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, later the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which later became BP. The British refused, there was a dispute, and a coup was engineered by the CIA and the British. The Mosaddeq Government were removed, the Shah came to office, compensation was paid to BP, and we were back to square one with a repressive regime under the Shah. Those events are remembered in Iran. Iranians do not forget British involvement and our obsession with their oil reserves. When dealing with Iran, we must remember that we do not have clean hands, and we should be prepared to admit that.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/10">The Shah's oppressive regime, with its appalling human rights record, used outside SAVAK forces to attack Iranian students. I remember that during the 1970s, when the Shah's secret agents operated in British universities and tried to criticise Iranian students who were active. The Shah's human rights record led to huge protests and demonstrations and he was eventually removed in 1979, apparently only a few weeks after the British security services and the CIA had said that it was perfectly safe for him to stay there for many decades. They misunderstood the situation somewhat, and not for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/11">In the turmoil of the 1979 revolution, Iran did not turn into a secular democracy. It became a Muslim state under Ayatollah Khomeini and the present constitution was invoked. It is an interesting document, but the western press simply fails to understand Iran's power structures. It assumes that President Ahmadinejad, because he is President, is equivalent to President Bush or an executive Prime Minister in the west, but he is not. He is head of the civil Government, obviously, but he and anyone else are allowed to be a candidate in the election only if they are approved by the Council of Guardians, which is responsible to the Supreme Leader. The Assembly of Experts also has a role in appointing the Supreme Leader.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/12">There is a tripartite/quadripartite sharing of power in Iran, and we should remember that whatever the President or anyone else says, that is not the whole story; it is only part of it. One should try to understand that, and the fact that within all the complications of Iranian society and its structures, there are people who manage to speak up for civil rights and women's rights, to organise trade unions, to pursue intellectual work, and to operate in independent universities. Like any other society, Iran's is not a seamless whole, and we should also be aware of that, too. Western strategy on Iran is part of the problem, and I shall be grateful if the Minister says a little more about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/13">After Khomeini became the Supreme Leader, Iran entered a period of isolation and US sanctions. Because of the relationship between the US and Iran following the taking of US hostages and the resulting difficulties, the Iran-Iraq war occurred. Although that dreadful war probably suited Saddam Hussein and Ayatollah Khomeini in equal measure, it cost the lives of at least 500,000 people. It also made a great deal of money for the arms industry around the world. We should remember that, again, Britain and the United States do not have clean hands, because at the same time as we were trying to buy oil from Iran, we were supplying arms to Iraq to provoke that war. Our role in recent history is not clear and not clean. Whatever we say about Iran, we should have some respect for our own role.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/14">Israel's threats to Iran are obviously serious and Israel's ability to bomb Iran is very strong. Iran is a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, but not the supplementary protocol allowing unannounced inspections. It is developing a nuclear reactor and processor, but that is not the same as developing nuclear weapons. Although I do not want Iran or any other country in the world to develop nuclear weapons, any more than I want this country to continue to hold nuclear weapons, it is impossible to argue credibly for nuclear disarmament and a nuclear-free middle east while we remain silent about Israel's development of nuclear weapons and its obvious ability to use them at some point. If we are serious about bringing about peace in the region, that also requires promotion of a nuclear-free middle east, which requires Israel to be brought to the table through a nuclear weapons convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/15">It is important to get those general points on the record. In supporting human rights in Iran, we must build up the best possible contacts and relationships. Parliament to Parliament, there have been Inter-Parliamentary Union delegations, which have enabled some contact and the development of a relationship in that way. Much better relations must also be developed between universities, trade unions and civil society groups, and there must be support for individual cases such as those to which the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/16">I chair an organisation called Liberation, which was involved originally as the Movement for Colonial Freedom and is now more of an international solidarity organisation. We had our annual meeting last Saturday and we passed an extensive resolution on Iran. I shall quote some of that very long resolution. We said:</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/17" class="indent">&quot;The high rate of people's participation in the election alerted the international community to the fact that the Iranian people wish to have and take an active role in their own destiny.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/18">It is important to say that. We went on to make specific requests, stating:</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/19" class="indent">&quot;The international community therefore should support the Iranian people's struggle for peace, democracy and social justice in their country.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/20">We pointed out the &quot;continued deterioration&quot; of human rights in recent years in Iran and the &quot;flagrant disregard&quot; for internationally accepted conventions. We were referring to the most extreme forms of sharia law that are used, involving the stoning of individuals, amputations and public executions. Obviously, that is totally wrong and must be condemned, as I would condemn the death penalty in any circumstances anywhere in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/21">We also raised the violations of the rights to free speech, freedom of association and peaceful protest, which are important, and the continued detention of trade unionists and workers' activists, including the leader of the Tehran Public Bus Company workers syndicate, Mansour Osanloo. I hope that a message goes out that we support his release just as much as we would support the release of any other person held on grounds of conscience or activity. We pointed out that the International Labour Organisation conventions 87 and 98 require all signatory states to allow the organisation of independent trade unions. That applies just as much to Iran as to any other country. In raising all those issues, and in supporting women's rights and women's activists in Iran, we have to send a message that we are serious about supporting human rights and civil society in Iran.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/22">Our history is not clean by any means. The rhetoric used against Iran, the sanctions policy being used against Iran and the implicit military threats that have been made against Iran at various times do not force Iran to back down and operate differently. Instead, they unite Iranian people against the west, build the feeling of isolation and build the power of those who wish to pursue military options in Iran rather than peaceful options.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/23">There must be a way for us to open a dialogue. A previous Foreign Secretary&mdash;the current Secretary of State for Justice&mdash;went to Iran and tried to open that dialogue and I commend him for doing that. I did not agree with what he did over the Iraq war, but I did agree with the fact that he was prepared to go to Iran and participate in that dialogue.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/24">I hope that when the Minister replies, he will say that we are prepared to maintain dialogue with the Government of Iran; to co-operate in sending observers to future elections, if the Iranians are prepared to allow that, because it would be a helpful way forward; and to do what we can to take up individual cases of human rights abuse and individual cases in which people are wrongfully detained. Doing that will promote the development of the very strong civil society that has demonstrated itself on the streets of Tehran and the other cities in the past two weeks, and will help to develop the tolerant civil society that traditional Muslim countries have and the toleration that traditional Islam is all about. The Jewish community has always been present in Tehran; the Zoroastrians have always been there, as have people of many other faiths. There is much to be very proud of in the history of Iran and in the tolerance of ordinary people in Iran towards those of different faiths.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/25">That is the message that we must send: one of sympathy, support and understanding, but above all condemnation of the abuses of human rights and the illegal and irrational imprisonment of people who are merely standing up for their cultural identity, their trade union rights or their right to demonstrate and express their political views.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.1/1">I absolutely agree. Eighteen months ago we debated that very point in this Chamber, although another Minister responded&mdash;but there we are, that is the merry-go-round that we experience in Westminster.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.1/2">I conclude with a plea to the Minister and his boss, the Foreign Secretary, as I am a born optimist. Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, the president-elect of the Iranian resistance, has urged the west to reject the regime's sham elections and the appointment of Mr. Ahmadinejad. She has also urged it to force the regime to accept a free UN-supervised election based on people's sovereignty, not the rule of the Supreme Leader. She has also suggested that we suspend all political and diplomatic ties with the mullahs' regime until the suppression is completely stopped. She suggests that we impose a trade, diplomatic, arms and technology embargo on the regime and a foreign travel ban on its senior officials. Finally, she urges the UN Security Council to refer the crimes committed by the regime's leaders&mdash;particularly Khamenei and Ahmadinejad&mdash;to an international tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.1/3">The Minister frowns, and I accept that that is an extremely ambitious list&mdash;if he mentions it in is winding-up speech, he will probably say that it is not achievable. We will, however, have a general election before May or June next year, and the Government, who have made some terrible mistakes on all sorts of issues, now have an opportunity to do the right thing on human rights in Iran. As the hon. Members for Islington, North and for Montgomeryshire said, we are asking not for blind rhetoric&mdash;the time for that has passed&mdash;but for engagement. All that I am asking is that the Government speak up clearly to try to improve the human rights situation in Iran.</p>

	<p pid="a.270.1/1">I too congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit Öpik">the Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> on securing this debate. He has a strong record of fighting for justice in Iran, particularly for the Baha'i, which was the focus of much of his remarks. Indeed, he chairs the all-party group Friends of the Baha'i. None the less, the debate was wide-ranging and dealt with various aspects of human rights in Iran.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.1/2">All too often when discussing Iran, our thoughts turn to the important question of nuclear proliferation; it is particularly helpful that we find time to think also of human rights. I was moved by the contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" name="Nigel Evans">the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans)</phrase> because, even in the language of human rights, it is sometimes easy to forget that we are talking about not only philosophical concepts but the horrific and unthinkable experiences of individuals in Iran and other countries, who do not have even the basic rights, which, getting up in the morning and going about our daily business, we too often take for granted. It is important to reflect upon that.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.1/3">The debate is timely, given the protests over the Iranian election and the harsh repression of those protests. It is difficult to know the exact figures, but reports suggest that dozens of people have been killed and that possibly hundreds of protesters are still in prison, their families not necessarily knowing their fate. Those being held in prison do not even have good access to lawyers. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" name="Mark Williams">the Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)</phrase> and the hon. Member for Ribble Valley mentioned the case of Neda Soltan; those who have seen her image will find it forever seared on their minds and consciousness as a symbol of repression. It is deeply concerning that someone should have suffered that fate.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.1/4">There is a danger that when we in Parliament discuss human rights in Iran, or in any other country, it could be seen as meddling. However, in this case we are absolutely not meddling in Iran's internal affairs. As my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire pointed out, Iran has signed the universal declaration of human rights and the international covenant on civil and political rights. It therefore has an international obligation to uphold those conventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.1/5">I call on our Government to uphold human rights when, in my view, they sometimes fail to do so&mdash;for example, their promotion of detention without charge and some of the murkier allegations made recently about torture and possible complicity in torture. We must be as rigorous in calling on our Government to uphold those international standards as we are with other Governments. By taking that equal and fair approach it is possible for us to call on other Governments to uphold their international obligations. That is what we hope to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.1/6">I wholeheartedly endorse what was said by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase>. If we are to ask other countries to accept international election observers we should be open enough to accept them here. Indeed, when we had difficulties with ballot papers in the Scottish elections in 2007, it might have helped if they had been here.</p>

	<p pid="a.271.1/1">We can only hope that that suggestion is greeted positively by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.1/2">We should remember that Britain's influence in Iran is limited, especially as relations have deteriorated since the election, the worrying expulsion of British diplomats from Teheran and the arrest of the Iranian British officials. We need a degree of realism about what our Government can achieve. None the less, we still have bilateral relations, and we have relations through the European Union and the United Nations. We should use whatever influence we have to uphold human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.1/3">I have only a short time left, so I shall touch briefly on a number of matters. The lack of freedom of expression is one of the most concerning aspects of the denial of human rights. As has been pointed, the lack of freedom of expression gets in the way of the upholding of many other rights, and the democratic system can fall apart.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.1/4">I have to declare an interest, given that the debate is on human rights. I am a member of Amnesty International, which is fairly damning about Iran's record on freedom of expression. In its 2009 report &quot;State of the World's Human Rights&quot;, it says:</p>
	<p pid="a.271.1/5" class="indent">&quot;The authorities maintained tight restrictions on freedom of expression, association and assembly. They cracked down on civil society activists, including women's rights and other human rights defenders and minority rights advocates. Activists were arrested, detained and prosecuted, often in unfair trials, banned from travelling abroad, and had their meetings disrupted.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.271.1/6">That has come to fruition, as we saw recently on our television screens.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.1/7">I hope that the Iranian media will one day be freer to report views and news that are different from those of the state media. Following the election, there has been an interesting development in the use of social media, which have been taken up in huge numbers by Iranians through blogging, Facebook and Twitter. That is handing power to ordinary people, enabling them to report what is happening and effectively giving all citizens the power to act as journalists. Crackdowns on the social media have been reported, so it is still a concern, but it is difficult to crackdown on everyone, especially given the internet&mdash;as even the Chinese are finding. I believe that the internet will become an increasingly powerful tool for freedom, particularly in those countries where there is repression. Those countries may employ thousands and thousands of people to crack down on its use, but ultimately they will be unsuccessful.</p>

	<p pid="a.273.2/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for those kind words; I shall mull them over and decide whether to forgive him.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/2">I also welcome the Minister to his place. We were sparring partners when he was in the Treasury and I was a shadow Treasury spokesman, and I look forward to sparring with him now. I hope that he will enjoy some security of tenure, at least for a few months, in the Foreign Office. I say that in particular because we have just had news that Lord Malloch-Brown, a Foreign Office Minister, has announced his resignation from the Government. Perhaps this Minister will last a little longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/3">Iran is an ancient civilisation that cannot easily be caricatured. It is a little-known fact that it can claim to have produced the earliest-known charter of human rights on earth, back in 539 BC. In this remarkable document, a copy of which hangs in the UN Security Council, the Persian King Cyrus states:</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/4" class="indent">&quot;Until I am alive, I prevent unpaid, forced labour... I announce that everyone is free to choose a religion. People are free to live in all regions and take up a job provided that they never violate others' rights. No one could be penalised for his or her relative's faults&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/5">The country is blessed with abundant natural resources, but suffers several daily power cuts. It has the world's fifth-largest global oil reserve, but outside petrol stations, queues of cars continue often for half a mile. Its people have a thirst for change so telling that hundreds of thousands of citizens took to the streets to call for recounts after the recent elections, only to be ruthlessly crushed by the Government authorities. We witnessed masked paramilitaries roaming the streets on motorbikes chasing peaceful protesters, intimidating, hounding and beating them. We are still unaware of exactly how many protesters died.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/6">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" name="Nigel Evans">the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans)</phrase>, in his powerful speech, mentioned Neda, the 27-year-old music student, whom we saw, apparently shot by paramilitaries, lying bloodied on the street in Tehran. Her death was captured on video and beamed across the world in a day to millions of viewers. In many ways, she has become the icon of the clash between the old and the new in Iran. In the end, no Government can rule without consent, and this is a crisis of the regime's making. Although it must be for Iranians to decide how Iran should be governed, it is the demands of ordinary Iranians to which the Iranian Government should respond, and they forget that at their peril.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/7">British foreign policy towards Iran should always be based on a pragmatic and hard-headed assessment of where British interests lie. Although those interests lie in an Iran once again engaged in the mainstream of the international community, we should never lose sight of the fact that Iran has one of the worst human rights records in the world. It is ranked 145th out of 167 in the Economist Intelligence Unit's democracy index. In the past few days, locally employed staff in the British embassy were taken captive without provocation. The unjustified harassment of staff from any embassy is a violation of diplomatic norms and utterly unacceptable. It is hard to know where to begin in the seemingly unending list of human rights abuses, a number of which were referred to by my parliamentary neighbour, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1829" name="David Amess">the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/8">The personal stories paint a powerful picture. Iranian authorities executed Delara Darabi in Rasht central prison on a Friday morning in May. Not only had there been no formal notification 48 hours before the hanging, as required under Iranian law, but just a fortnight earlier, Ms Darabi had been granted a two-month stay of execution by the head of the judiciary. The day before their daughter was walked to the gallows, her parents visited her in jail where she excitedly informed them that there was to be an appeal so that new evidence could be heard. Twenty four hours later, she was dead. The Iranian people responded with huge internet campaigns and mass demonstrations&mdash;a powerful expression of disapproval of the regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/9">It is evident that Iran's head of judiciary has little ability to control his own judges. Nevertheless, I urge him to act before any of the other 130 juvenile offenders on death row are executed. The international community has a clear duty to take a stand against an act that we all agree is wrong, and the message to the Iranian regime must be clear: its actions have consequences. Amnesty International regularly reports that trial hearings are often heard in private and that political detainees are denied access to legal counsel, often despite assurances to the contrary. It is ironic that when one visits Tehran, the Iranians talk with great pride about how there are designated seats in the Majlis for representatives of the Christian, Jewish and Zoroastrian minorities. That must be contrasted with the appalling apostasy laws that still exist in the provinces, and the ruthless treatment of members of the Baha'i faith, whose leaders are even now imprisoned without trial, possibly awaiting charges for which, if found guilty, they could face a capital penalty. I pay tribute to the strong case made on their behalf by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire in his capacity as the chairman of the all-party friends of the Baha'is group.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/10">Even the designated non-Islamic religions face persecution. According to the last US State Department report on religious freedoms, there was an exponential rise in officially sanctioned anti-Semitic propaganda, including official statements, media outlets, publications and books. So-called President-elect Ahmadinejad still pursues a virulent and outrageous anti-Semitic campaign, regularly questioning the existence of the holocaust. He also persists in chauvinistic remarks and has vetoed Bills designed by the seventh Majlis to improve the position of women.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/11">Gender inequality and discrimination are widespread, and are perpetuated by Iran's constitutional structures. In Iran today, a woman's testimony is worth half that of a man's; compensation payable to the family of a female victim of a crime is half that of a man's family; boys inherit double what girls receive; and securing a divorce and custody of children is near-impossible for a woman. However, despite all the constitutional discrimination set against them, we again see the spirit and determination of the Iranian people themselves: two-thirds of students are women, and there are female MPs, doctors, policewomen and taxi drivers, and some 97 per cent. of women can read and write, which is one of highest literacy rates in the middle east.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/12">Iran's leaders face a clear choice. Either they can accept the United States' offer of engagement and negotiation, which means dramatically improving their human rights record and suspending their nuclear program, or they can face international isolation, economic stagnation and a tightening of international sanctions. We hope that they see it as in the long-term interests of Iran and its people to choose the former.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-08a.278.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" speakername="David Howarth" colnum="278"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090708/halltext/90708h0004.htm#09070879000464">
	<p pid="a.278.1/1">The effects of bullying on children can be devastating. Their mental and physical health can be destroyed, their self-esteem may be devastated, and they may even contemplate suicide. The fear of being bullied is a major reason for unauthorised absence from school, with all the effects that that can have on life chances.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/2">The Cambridge-based charity, Red Balloon, which provides education and support for bullied children who have excluded themselves from mainstream education and helps them to recover and re-enter mainstream education, has helped many young people whose physical and mental health has been wrecked by bullying. I pay tribute to that charity, and I shall draw the Minister's attention to three of its cases to illustrate what we are dealing with.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/3">The first case is of a girl who was beaten up and locked in a toilet in primary school. That induced a complete physical and mental breakdown. Aged 11, she was admitted to an adolescent mental health unit. She was barely able to walk and suffered from a facial palsy, and had such low self-esteem that she refused even to have her photograph taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/4">A second girl stopped going to primary school when she was eight after she had been humiliated and called names. She was diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis and spent the next five years at home, receiving no education of any sort from the local authority. When she came to the charity aged 13, she was unable to read or write.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/5">The third example is of a boy who was extremely badly bullied, constantly, over a long period. He was often surrounded and taunted by groups of boys. On occasion, he would lose his temper and fly into a rage, which just encouraged his tormentors to continue. Finally, one day he lifted a chair and threw it at them, and he was the one who was excluded.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/6">All three of those stories end well. The first girl, within six weeks of receiving the specialist care and attention that she required, had recovered to the extent that the palsy had gone, she no longer limped and she was smiling. It was found that she had an excellent singing voice. Nine months later, she was performing solos in front of hundreds of people. She is now at sixth form college, and her mother says she is flying.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/7">The second girl recovered to the extent that she is also at sixth form college doing A-levels. The boy, in the safe environment with which he was provided and the calm in which he could get on with his studies, did well and subsequently went into a good job.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/8">However, many such stories do not end so well. Children exclude themselves from school for years and end up with no qualifications or, worse, they suffer lasting damage to their mental health and educational achievement. Of course, the most serious outcome is suicide, and such cases appear in the media from time to time. It is difficult to design studies to show a causal link between bullying and suicide, but a review of 37 studies from 13 countries by Kim and Leventhal of Yale medical school showed that bullied children were far more likely than normal&mdash;nine times more likely according to one study&mdash;to think about killing themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/9">My question for the Minister is this: what can the Government do to help bullied children and, in particular, should the Government be counteracting some of the tendencies in school funding that might act against the interests of bullied children? The first point to make is that there is uncertainty about how many children are affected by bullying to the extent that they miss school. The official returns concerning school absences do not include bullying as an official category, so we have to rely on unofficial research.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/10">Research by Beatbullying, another organisation that does very good work on bullying, including in Cambridge, has estimated that 170,000 absences a day are caused by bullying, which amounts to about 20 daily absences in a school of 1,000 pupils. I do not know whether that is correct, but even a tenth of that number would be something to worry about. Red Balloon believes that anything up to 6,000 young people nationally could be in need of the sort of service that it provides, but we do not know for certain.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/11">That is worrying because of the way in which provision for children not in school is funded. The Government intend that, by September this year, all secondary schools will be part of school behaviour partnerships, which will deal, among other things, with the question of absences from school and the commissioning of services to deal with them. In addition, encouraged by the Government, local authorities are increasingly devolving spending decisions on what services to provide for children not in school to those partnerships, via the devolution of funding to schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/12">I am not against devolution of budgetary power and responsibility to schools. Indeed, this debate gives me the opportunity to commemorate one of the pioneers of local financial management of schools, the former leader of the Alliance group on Cambridgeshire county council, Peter Lee, who sadly died on election day this year. Peter understood that there are serious difficulties inherent in, and therefore limits to, local financial management. One difficulty with such local financial management is that it could accidentally give schools an incentive to reduce costs by reducing quality. There has to be something in the system to counteract that tendency. I am concerned that schools and partnerships could have an incentive in the system as it has been set up to deny the extent of the problem of bullying, especially given the lack of official information.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/13">It is important to understand that many children who are excluding themselves because of bullying do not have statements and, unlike the boy I mentioned, have not been excluded formally from school, so it is very difficult for them to show up in the numbers and easy for them to slip through the cracks. I do not want to make accusations against specific local authorities or imply that some councils are more prone to that behaviour than others, but my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1641" name="Lynne Featherstone">the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone)</phrase> was told by her local authority that there were no known cases of pupils dropping out of school because of bullying. I cannot see how that contention is believable.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/14">In addition, the devolution of budgets might add to an existing pressure on local authorities to adopt the view that everything necessary in the field of bullying can be achieved by preventive measures, which tend to be much cheaper than the kind of services that are required to recover children from serious bullying after it has happened. Some very good organisations work to prevent bullying. I mentioned Beatbullying, whose interventions can reduce bullying by up to 40 per cent., but I should also mention Stonewall, which deals particularly with homophobic bullying, which is the second most frequent form of bullying of schoolchildren, behind bullying about body shape and ahead of racial bullying. Stonewall reports that homophobic bullying can be 40 per cent. lower in schools that have adopted policies expressly against homophobia and in which students take part in lessons in which the equality of rights for gay people is discussed. Many other organisations do excellent work on preventing bullying. However, none of those organisations would say that it is possible entirely to prevent bullying or that we will be able at some point entirely to dispense with the services of organisations such as Red Balloon, which deals with children who have been seriously bullied.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/15">Red Balloon's mission is to recover such children and return them to mainstream education. The problem is that recovery is an expensive business, costing about &pound;15,000 per pupil per year. I fear that schools and partnerships will feel under pressure not to refer pupils to such provision. We already see that sort of thing happening in parts of the country. Of course, the cost pales into insignificance when compared to the cost of not intervening, and it is important to stress that the kind of programme offered by Red Balloon is effective. Attendance levels are very high, and many of the pupils, like those I mentioned, go on to sixth-form education or further education, back into mainstream school or into employment. The success rate is high, as is the percentage of pupils gaining five A* to C-grade GCSEs.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/16">By contrast, more conventional pupil referral units, to which such children might otherwise be referred, have very low rates of exam success. As the Government themselves say, only 1 per cent. of such pupils gain five A* to C GCSEs. It should be stressed that bullied children&mdash;it is important to remember that they are the victims of bad behaviour and not its instigators&mdash;are likely to find conventional pupil referral units at least as frightening as conventional school, meaning that such units are not the appropriate way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/17">As I see it, the problem is that the structure developed by the Government might disadvantage bullied children in two ways. It lumps them in, perhaps inappropriately, with children who have very different types of problem but who might well have access to additional resources because they have statements and the bullied children do not. It also encourages the false belief that there is no need to spend heavily on recovering bullied children and that everything can be done through prevention.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/18">What can be done about that? I accept that the Secretary of State cannot and should not attempt to run every school in the country and that local policy making is vital, but there are three things that I suggest central Government can appropriately do.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/19">First, the Government could bring together existing research and new authoritative research on the extent of the problem of self-exclusion because of bullying, so that schools and local authorities tempted to deny the existence or the extent of the problem can be challenged. A local authority or school that claims that none of its pupils has ever refused to come to school because of bullying should be open to legitimate challenge on the basis of established facts.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/20">Secondly, there should be advice to schools and behaviour partnerships about the particular needs of bullied children. Such advice should point out the devastating costs not only of failing to prevent bullying, but of failing to offer effective routes to recovery to children who have been seriously bullied.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/21">Thirdly, the Government should consider whether a policy aimed principally at changing the behaviour of disruptive pupils on the basis that, to quote the White Paper &quot;Back on Track&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/22" class="indent">&quot;Primary responsibility for good behaviour sits with young people themselves&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.278.1/23">is at all adequate to meet the needs of bullied children, who are the victims of bad behaviour, not its perpetrators. If Beatbullying is right that one-third of unauthorised absences are caused by bullying, perhaps the central assumption of the Government's policy must change. The costs of bullying are great to both society and victims. In some cases, it is literally a matter of life or death. I appeal to the Government to do more for victims.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-08a.281.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" speakername="Vernon Coaker" speakeroffice="The Minister for Schools and Learners"  colnum="281"  time="011:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090708/halltext/90708h0005.htm#09070879000465">
	<p pid="a.281.0/1">It is a pleasure to be here under your chairmanship, Mr. Chope. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase> on securing this important debate. We all know that he has been assiduous in pursuing the issue over a considerable period.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/2">Bullying is hugely important. The only point that I would add to the hon. Gentleman's remarks is that it is important not only because of the child being bullied but because of the bully. Sometimes that aspect is ignored. If somebody is allowed to continue to bully, that clearly damages the person being bullied&mdash;as the victim, they must be at the centre of our thoughts&mdash;but we must address the bully's concerns as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/3">The three cases that the hon. Gentleman referred to are absolutely appalling. They are only three out of numerous examples that could be found across the country. I am a former deputy head teacher and used to be responsible for trying to deal with such issues. I was not the most brilliant history teacher in the world; others were good at that. I was much better at dealing with the difficult disciplinary and behaviour situations that others would rather somebody else dealt with. I enjoyed it.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/4">One important thing that the hon. Gentleman mentioned was name-calling. There is nothing more hurtful or damaging than name-calling. It is sometimes regarded as only a bit of fun or a throwaway remark, but name-calling is hugely damaging. It is an important example of bullying and should be taken very seriously. If bullying in the form of name-calling is not dealt with quickly, it can become much more serious for the person doing the name-calling and, more importantly, for the individual being bullied.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/5">Before I move to the formal part of my remarks, I will respond to the three points that the hon. Gentleman made at the end, so I do not lose them. I will say something about what we are seeking to do in order to collect more accurate information about the number of young people in school who are being bullied or who self-exclude. Should we go ahead with our plans, as I think we will, there will be a consultation, and he may well wish to make the point in consultation that it is not only about who schools think is absent because of bullying; it is also about people who appear to be absent for other reasons when in fact they are excluding themselves. That is an important point to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/6">I will write to the hon. Gentleman after checking what advice we send to schools and what guidance we send to behaviour partnerships. I am not clear whether we are as forthright as we need to be or how up-to-date the guidance is, so I will have a look at it. Otherwise, it is pointless having debates such as this one.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/7">The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the position of a pupil who is out of school and in trouble with their school due to being bullied is different from that of a pupil who is out of school and in trouble with their school because they are difficult or have behavioural problems. One challenge for our education system and for any Government is how to distinguish between all the different reasons why individuals present problems in schools. If alternative provision is required, as it sometimes is, we must find a way to determine the most appropriate provision for the individual. Of course a child being bullied has different needs from a child excluded for other reasons. He is right to make that point. I would extend it, and he can probably think of other examples where that is the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/8">In the best alternative provision, many local authorities take that into consideration. I cannot say that the situation will change overnight, but it is something of which I am acutely aware. When talking to pupil referral units and alternative provision with local authorities and others, I will make the point that they should not tar everyone with the same brush. Different young people in different circumstances have different needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/9">The fundamental aim must be to get such children back into mainstream education. That is not always possible, but it should always be the aim. Such places should have a revolving door, as far as is possible. I am not stupid about these matters and understand that that is not always possible, but we must ensure that people who have had problems because they have been bullied are not simply left somewhere. They must be monitored, worked with and given the education that they deserve, with the objective of bringing them back into mainstream education. I hope that those opening remarks are helpful in responding directly to the hon. Gentleman's points.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/10">Bullying is an important subject. I have just been to a meeting of the Children, Schools and Families Committee. The hon. Gentleman may know that we are discussing the introduction of a school report card. Those who want to have a go at the report card ask why it refers to pupil well-being, when parents want to know about a school's standards in reading and writing, how good it is at getting pupils through GCSEs, what academic breadth it offers and so on. However, I believe fundamentally that parents also want to know whether the school is safe for their children and whether it has an ethos that tackles bullying, whether it is racist, homophobic or any other form. The schools that have good policies on such matters and can reassure parents that they can deal those problems are usually the schools that are well regarded. They are also often the schools that have good exam results. He may want to read the debate on the report card that we are seeking to introduce, because it explores what schools should be about as well as academic results.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/11">I assure the hon. Gentleman that I take bullying seriously and I am grateful to him for raising the subject. Like him, the Government recognise that bullying is a corrosive problem that can steal years from a young person's life if it is not acted against quickly. That is why we have made it clear and I repeat today that bullying is not and never will be acceptable in the classroom. As he knows, we are working closely through the national strategies and the Anti-Bullying Alliance to equip local authorities, schools and teachers with the information they need to deal with the problem. We are also giving staff the practical skills they need to challenge physical and verbal abuse through guidance such as &quot;Safe to Learn&quot;. All such support is aimed at preventing bullying from taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/12">Where abuse persists, we must ensure that young people are given the help and support they need immediately. As the hon. Gentleman said, that means having high-quality provision across the country, not just in some parts. He mentioned Red Balloon centres, which provide the high-quality provision for pupils that should be available when then they need it. There is a legal duty on all local authorities to provide suitable education for pupils who cannot attend a mainstream or special school, whether through an appropriate alternative unit or through a voluntary or private sector provider such as Red Balloon.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/13">The Government cannot and should not decide exactly what types of provision should be used in individual cases, as the hon. Gentleman accepted. Such decisions should be made at local level by those who are closest to the pupil and their family, because they are the professionals who know what the young person needs and when they need it. However, I recognise the tension that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. He is probably a stronger localist than I&mdash;I am not sure about you, Mr. Chope&mdash;but one problem is that when the Government back off and leave such matters to local bodies and that does not work, people say that the Government should intervene. On the other hand, when the Government do intervene, people say that they should get out of it and let local people get on with it. That is not a sarcastic remark because there is a real tension between the central and the local directions; it was ever thus and it probably always will be. Nevertheless, the Government should be concerned about the variability of provision and try to do something about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/14">We cannot say from Westminster what sort of provision an individual pupil in any given town, city or rural area needs. Funding for alternative provision should therefore be left to those on the ground. Even if we were to direct the investment in individual providers, however well intentioned that might be, it could distort the alternative provision market, giving providers who receive Government funding an unfair advantage over those that do not. Red Balloon has an opportunity to market itself and the hon. Gentleman has done his best to market it, not in the bad sense of the word, but in its proper sense. The Secretary of State has written to authorities in a number of areas&mdash;for example, in South Yorkshire&mdash;urging them to consider the opportunities that the charity might offer.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/15">I will briefly discuss how local authorities obtain alternative provision. Some authorities are worried about getting funds back from schools to help the pupils who have fallen out of mainstream education. The School Finance (England) Regulations 2008 were introduced to ensure that local authorities can access funding to set up such provision, but local authorities do not often make use of that. Local authorities, not only in Cambridge, should remember that those regulations give them the power to withdraw funding from a school when one of its pupils enters alternative provision. They also allow local authorities to retain funding centrally for alternative provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/16">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the commissioning of research into the number of children and young people who are out of school because of bullying. He has discussed the matter with the Secretary of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40031" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase>, who has since become the Speaker, and Dr. Herbert recently. We are considering the feasibility of such research and intend to introduce a statutory duty on schools to record incidents of bullying between pupils. We hope to consult on whether a further duty should be introduced for schools to report all bullying incidents to their local authorities and we will consider whether the types of bullying should be recorded, such as whether it relates to race, sexual orientation or disability. The hon. Gentleman might wish to respond to the full public consultation that we plan to hold on the draft regulations later this year. We expect them to come into force early next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/17">Such regulations will underscore the fundamental principle that bullying is simply not acceptable. That is why there is a clear legal duty on schools to have policies in place to prevent and tackle bullying. We expect schools to apply disciplinary sanctions to bullies. That is the other side of the coin.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/18">I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured by my brief comments that as the Minister with responsibility for this area, I take bullying seriously. I accept the three points he made and will pursue them. I hope that he is reassured that we are looking again at the statistics.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.1/1">That is a constructive and helpful comment. No hon. Member wants any young person to be bullied. My concern is the variability in provision across the country, which should not exist. Notwithstanding the point I made about localism, it is right of the Government to ensure that there is adequate provision across the country. We must ensure that alternative provision is tailored to the individual needs of the pupil as far as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/2">I feel passionately about alternative provision for young people and it is clear that the hon. Gentleman does too. It is the sign of a good society that as well as caring passionately about the academic achievement in its schools, it thinks about what it can do for those who struggle, however that struggle is brought about. From my experience as a deputy head raising standards in difficult schools, when the young people with particular problems are dealt with in a caring way, achievement goes up. Schools that do that are the ones the parents want to send their children to. My message to schools is, let us see what more we can do together to tackle this serious problem.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-08a.286.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" speakername="Paul Flynn" colnum="286"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090708/halltext/90708h0005.htm#09070879000468">
	<p pid="a.286.2/1">This is a very sombre moment, Mr. Chope. We have heard of the unprecedented deaths of seven of our soldiers within seven days. All our emotions are churned up by that, and there is sadness at the brutal deaths of seven unique young men. There is admiration for their bravery and professionalism, which we all salute, but there is also anger at some of the political decisions that have been made, which have led us to the carnage of NATO and Afghan civilians on a scale that was not anticipated.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/2">We have heard today, from the new Secretary of State, that he will be resolute in the face of the situation. I believe that we are on the point of change in public opinion, in the same way that there was a change in public opinion in America when the body bags were returning in large numbers from the Vietnam war. I believe that public opinion will be tested and that the public will ask why this country should pay a disproportionate share of what is known as the blood price in Afghanistan. That, I do not believe, will be tolerated, and I believe that other questions will be asked about whether we can continue and tolerate those deaths on such a scale.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/3">The Secretary of State today said: &quot;For Britain to be secure, Afghanistan must be made secure&quot;. That is a repeat of comments made by past Secretaries of State, meaning that there is somehow a threat of terrorism to Britain because of the Taliban. That is part of the canard that it is much easier, or more plausible, to repeat old myths than to reveal a new truth. That is a myth: there has never been any Taliban plot against any western European city. There have been al-Qaeda plots, and the two are conflated, but there is no risk to us from the Taliban.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/4">As was vividly revealed in James Fergusson's book &quot;A Million Bullets&quot;, the Taliban are fighting us because we are the farangi&mdash;the foreigners&mdash;in their country; they are fighting a jihad to expel us from their country. James Fergusson tells a story about a conversation he had with a top leader of the Taliban, who told him, &quot;I've got three small children, but I don't visit them very often because I don't want to love them, or for them to love me, because if they do it'll be a greater loss when I die.&quot; James Fergusson asked him, &quot;Do you want to die?&quot;, to which he replied, &quot;Of course I want to die; I want to die like my father, my grandfather and my great-grandfather died, fighting in a jihad against the farangi.&quot; That is why they are fighting us. Their ambitions and their antagonism to us do not stretch beyond their own lands. They also made the point to James Fergusson that, &quot;We are fighting you.&quot; They would not kill him because of their tradition of hospitality and courtesy to strangers, but they asked him, &quot;Wouldn't you fight people who came to your land and killed your wives and children?&quot; That is the reality of the position that we are in.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/5">I shall concentrate on Helmand, because I believe that what happened there was a great turning point. I am grateful to see here in the Chamber my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1976" name="Adam Ingram">the Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow (Mr. Ingram)</phrase>, who was the Minister answering a debate on this subject in March 2006. I am not one to attack him or any other Minister, but having gone through the wonderful pack that the Library has prepared for the debate, which gives details of all the debates on this issue in recent years, I see one compelling truth: the Government and the main Opposition have always been wrong in their forecasts, and the critics have nearly always been right.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/6">The intervention in Helmand took place in 2006, at which time the then Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" name="John Reid">the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid)</phrase>, said that he hoped it would last for only three years and that not a shot would be fired. That phrase will be part of our history for a long time. To be fair to him, he pointed out the dangers, but his view was that the British should go there to ensure that reconstruction could take place, and that if there was any shooting to be done, it would be done by the Americans. However, others took a different view at that time. In a 2008 debate on this issue, it was said that what we were doing was as futile and as dangerous as the charge of the Light Brigade. This time it was</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/7">&quot;Bush to the left of them,</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/8">Blair to the right of them,</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/9">Hollered and thundered,</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/10">Theirs not to reason why,</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/11">Theirs but to do and die,</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/12">Into the valley of the shadow of death</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/13">Into the mouth of Helmand</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/14">Drove the five thousand.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/15">Those words were described as an exaggeration, but we now know that, since Helmand, more people have died there than died in the charge of the Light Brigade. At that time, the war, or intervention, in Afghanistan was going fairly well. Only seven British soldiers had died in five years, and five of those were in accidents, but since Helmand, 176 British lives have been lost. It was said then that we were stirring up a hornets' nest, and that is what happened, but the Government blundered on, and the lives of our British troops have been sacrificed because of that.</p>

	<p pid="a.287.1/1">We do not have wars any more; we rarely declare war, so the nomenclature that we use is misleading. But, certainly, by any standards, this is a war. We have always had an excessive share of the burden&mdash;quite unreasonably. We are not the policemen of the world, and our young men are not there to be slaughtered in order to correct every injustice that takes place in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/2">I am a member of the Western European Union, and I have spoken about this issue in Hungary and several other countries in Europe, including France and Germany. The view there is that they will not go to Afghanistan to do the dying. They will go there to do police work and other jobs, but they will not put their young soldiers at risk of being killed in a war that they know to be futile. I think we should accept that view. Some people did not accept that a year ago, but I believe that everyone accepts it now.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/3">In 2006, there were voices&mdash;not just politicians'&mdash;saying that what was being done would be a calamity, and was a mistake that would rank in British history as having been as bad as Suez and the UK's decision to join Bush's war in Iraq. Brigadier Mark Carleton-Smith, who led 16 Air Assault Brigade in Helmand, before the real trouble began said:</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/4" class="indent">&quot;There is not to my mind an insurgency in Helmand. But we can create one if we want to.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/5">It was a peaceful area, and we created the insurgency by our presence there in 2006. Ministers sleepwalked into the hornets' nest of Helmand and changed what was a manageable situation in Afghanistan into one that is now unwinnable.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/6">After eight years, what progress have we made? What is this brave new world of Afghanistan that we are now asking our soldiers to die for? Certainly, there have been advances, for example, worthwhile advances in education, particularly in the education of girls. There is a frail embryo democracy and there has been some reconstruction, but the democracy itself is so frail and fragile that the Economist Intelligence Unit classified it as the 134th least democratic nation out of 167 countries. Progress has been painfully slow.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/7">Corruption&mdash;to clean out the state&mdash;was one of the reasons that we went in there. Integrity Watch Afghanistan tells us that of the $25 billion given in aid to Afghanistan only $15 billion have been spent and for every $100 that have been spent, only $20 reached the Afghan recipient. However, there has been an extraordinary increase in the number of millionaires and billionaires in Kabul and those two events are connected. Transparency International UK points out that Afghanistan has slipped from being 119th in the international table of corruption to 154th out of 159 countries. So, we have gone backwards in that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/8">President Karzai's half brother, Wali Karzai, is head of Kandahar's provincial council and is widely believed to be the source of drug trafficking and trade eastward beyond Kandahar. Many people in the Afghan Government and many of the provincial leaders are up to their neck in the drugs trade. What progress have we made in human rights that justifies us calling our young men to go to Afghanistan to die? Karzai refused a pardon to a young man who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for accessing an article on women's rights on the internet. However, Karzai did pardon a group of young men who were found guilty of gang-raping a 13-year-old girl. Those trials are very rare in Afghanistan because if such a case comes before the courts, it usually means the disgrace of the victim. Yet, he pardoned those who gang-raped a 13-year-old girl. A law to legalise rape in marriage was approved by Karzai in spite of western protests, and a father murdered his daughter for having a passing acquaintance with a NATO soldier. The Afghan Government refused to intervene because it was an honour killing.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/9">The very distinguished woman MP in Afghanistan, who has now been suspended from Parliament, Malalai Joya, visited this country last year to accept a human rights prize. Her judgment is that the rights of women in Afghanistan now are worse than under the Taliban. Is it really sensible to ask our soldiers to die for those human rights, which are the result of eight years of our presence there?</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/10">On drugs, Tony Blair was fond of saying that Afghanistan was a terrible state because 90 per cent. of the drugs on the streets of Britain came from there. I have heard almost every Secretary of State down the years say exactly the same thing. In some years, we have spent &pound;90 million of our taxpayers' money and in some years, up to &pound;260 million of taxpayers' money to eradicate drugs. That is British money. We led the field in the elimination of drugs. However, the result is that we have had the three biggest harvests of drugs ever in Afghanistan and the money spent has made no difference. There has been no reduction; the only reduction that takes place is when the price of wheat goes up and there is a higher market for that. The market for heroin is flooded throughout the world. There has been one change as a result of the misuse of taxpayers' money: the price of heroin on the streets of this capital and every capital in the world has gone down and it is much easier for people to become drug addicts.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/11">When David Loyn recently gave evidence to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, he said that 60 per cent. of the police are heroin addicts in Afghanistan and virtually all members of the Afghan army use cannabis. Those are our allies in our war against drugs. Afghanistan drug exports are worth &pound;3.4 billion. For a cut of that, the Afghan officials and the police allow free passage along their roads. They allow public land to be used for growing drugs and they protect the drug dealers. The main source of the Taliban's funding, which is certainly hundreds of millions of dollars, comes from the drug barons. They come to the Taliban and the money is used to buy weapons to attack our troops. Does anyone seriously believe that such an anti-drugs policy can ever change or be successful? Such a policy has failed for everyone during the past eight years&mdash;in fact, the money has had no effect whatsoever. The market out there is untouched by our interventions and activities&mdash;it is a hopeless cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/12">We could all acknowledge that we cannot win by military means in Afghanistan, and that we have to win by persuading the Afghans that we are there for their own good. We need to win the battle for hearts and minds. I have received a reply today from the new Secretary of State for Defence that points out that we do not collect statistics on the number of civilian deaths in Afghanistan. However, as far as we can, we should do that because every one of those deaths is a problem to us and every one of those deaths means a family that is hostile to the mission of NATO. Happily for us, the United Nations calculates that just last year, 826 civilian casualties resulted from NATO activity and 1,160 civilian casualties resulted from the activities of the insurgents. We know that all those deaths are a defeat to us. Will we now learn the lesson&mdash;perhaps the Americans have&mdash;that hearts and minds cannot be won by bombs and bullets?</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/13">Another independent source of information on Afghanistan is UNICEF, which points out the sad fact that hundreds of schools have been closed in the south and that most of the country's polio cases are in the same region. Where there is a lack of security, vaccination dives. Afghanistan has the world's third highest child mortality rate, with 257 of 1,000 children dying before they are five. Only two other nations in the world are worse. Afghanistan also has the world's second highest maternity mortality rate with around one in eight women dying because of child birth and, according to UN figures, most cases are preventable. Those are horrific pictures. Considering the amount of money&mdash;the great tsunami of dollars and pounds that have been poured into the country&mdash;things have not got better; in many areas they have got worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/14">We have discussed the terrorist threat before, but we need to call on the Government to provide the proof. Where is the evidence that we are protected against terrorist threats in Britain because we are in Afghanistan? I can think of none and I have not seen any produced, but that canard is repeated again and again as if it were a truth. Today it was used as a justification for the loss of seven lives in seven days. I press the Minister to tell us what he thinks the evidence is for that claim, which I am sure will continue to be repeated.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/15">Our present position is very interesting because, just a year ago, there were signs that we would have to adopt a different policy. Exactly a year ago, I was in the Pentagon and I was told by the religious right and the old neo-cons that we will be in Afghanistan for generations. Others said that no invading alien army has ever won a battle against a local insurgency&mdash;a very chilling argument to make. The only possible exception is Malaya, but that insurgency did not have any popular support; it just represented a small tribe.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/16">The way that these things go, we are likely to end up with one of two possible outcomes. One is that a deal is done: something happens and negotiations take place which will give us a chance to consolidate and preserve the gains made in education and reconstruction while making concessions on government concerns and the NATO presence. I believe that that is achievable. The alternative is that we run out in the same way the French did from Dien Bien Phu, the Americans did from Saigon and the Russians did from Kabul. In 2001, a fellow member of the Council of Europe, a Russian, slapped me on the back and said, &quot;Ah, you British, you are very clever. You've conquered Afghanistan. We Russians did that. It took us six days. We spent billions of roubles there. We had 120,000 troops there. We killed 1 million Afghans and lost 16,000 of our own soldiers. We ran out, and, within a short period, there were 300,000 Mujahedeen around Kabul. It will happen to you.&quot; That was in 2001, and the Russians are now looking at us and saying that we are making the same mistakes as they did.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/17">A year ago, there was hope of drawing in other European states, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> suggested. That is gone; it will not happen now. A year ago, our UK ambassador in Kabul, Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/18" class="indent">&quot;American strategy is destined to fail&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/19">and warned that increasing troop levels would serve only to</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/20" class="indent">&quot;identify us even more clearly as an occupying force and multiply the number of targets&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/21">He urged the presidential candidates not to get bogged down in Afghanistan. America's top general at the time, Brigadier Mark Carleton-Smith, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/22" class="indent">&quot;We're not going to win this war.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/23">He went on to state:</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/24" class="indent">&quot;If the Taliban were prepared to sit on the other side of the table and talk about a political settlement, then that's precisely the sort of progress that concludes insurgencies like this.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/25">There are hopeful signs in the election of President Obama. He was committed to the surge by an election promise. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-09">9 February</phrase>, an early-day motion was put down in this House pointing out that a surge in troops in Afghanistan would mean a surge in fatalities. It is no comfort to see that the prophecy was accurate; it was certain to happen. We have had the surge of troops, which was based on the conclusion that if a surge worked in Iraq, for very different reasons, it might work in Afghanistan. Politically, President Obama had no choice but to become involved in the surge, but he has done other things that are far more promising&mdash;for example, he got rid of his previous NATO supremo and appointed General Stanley McChrystal, who has used words that have never been used before about Afghanistan. He used the word &quot;defeat&quot;, and we must consider the possibility of defeat. No one in America had ever dared to utter such a word, but General McChrystal uttered it, and he is a practical soldier. He used another word that is important to us: &quot;exit&quot;. We must now concentrate not on a perpetual war&mdash;a war without end&mdash;but on looking for practical ways of getting out. The main reason our soldiers are dying is not the wickedness of the Taliban; they are dying because of our presence in Afghanistan. We should look at previous insurgency wars that have taken place and learn from their results.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/26">As I said earlier, we are at a turning point today and this week. Public opinion will suddenly become aroused. There are exact precedents for that in other parts of the world. We know of the anger that was expressed about our reasons for going to Iraq. There was virtually universal approval of the reason for our going to Afghanistan in the early stages, but, in my view, if there had been a debate and a vote in this House, there would not have been approval for the incursion into Helmand province. That was the disastrous turning point that turned a manageable situation into what we have now: one in which it is impossible to win.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/27">I conclude by paying tribute to the soldiers. I speak as the proud son of a soldier who faced the enemy on many occasions. This House sent those young men and women to Afghanistan. It was our decision, and we should confront it. I was called on Friday by a reporter from the <i>Wales on Sunday</i> newspaper who asked whether I was proud that there were more Welsh troops in Afghanistan than there have been in any British operation since Malaya. I said that, yes, I was proud of their bravery and professionalism, but that I worried that the outcome would be the loss of more Welsh lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/28">I recall the words that are on the side of the beautiful Welsh war memorial in Cardiff:</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/29" class="indent">&quot;Dros ei wlad fe rodd ei lw,</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/30" class="indent">Dros f&ocirc;r fe aeth i farw.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/31">For his country, he gave his oath, over the sea he went to die. Let us for a moment recall the names of those who went over the sea to die.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-08a.295.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" speakername="Nick Harvey" colnum="295"  time="015:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090708/halltext/90708h0007.htm#09070879000475">
	<p pid="a.295.1/1">But the Russians' objective was completely different. They were trying to take over the country and run it. We are not trying to do that in any sense. The objective of the NATO presence in Afghanistan is to help the elected Government stabilise the country to the point where reconstruction can take place and Afghanistan can retake its place in the community of nations. That is a totally different objective from bringing in an invasionary force to take complete control of the country and run it.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/2">The difficulties in what we are doing are all too clear. The hon. Gentleman rightly pointed up the shortcomings in the emerging governance of Afghanistan. There are shortly to be elections, and it is dearly to be hoped that something more viable will come out on the other side of them, but there are not necessarily grounds for optimism. None the less, we were right to go in at the beginning. The change of strategy in 2006 was agreed in NATO, and we have done what we undertook to do in Helmand to the best of our ability. Equally, however, the hon. Gentleman is right to have sought a debate about the overall strategy, because we will not achieve the undefined goals that we have set ourselves by carrying on as we are at present. I very much hope that the change of tempo that President Obama has signalled is the beginning of a complete change.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/3">The hon. Gentleman is right that a deal would be struck in the end and that a political solution would have to be found. Everywhere where we have been involved over a very long time, we have denounced people as terrorists and said that we would have nothing to do with them, only to end up having to sit down and talk to them. There is no doubt that that will ultimately happen in Afghanistan, but we must ensure that what emerges enables Afghanistan to rebuild itself over a long period, so that it can become a stable country and not a haven for terrorism. I very much hope that we will get to that point sooner rather than later. Previously, I might have believed that we could carry on as we are doing for 20 years and achieve the outcome that we seek, but I can no longer accept that as valid.</p>

	<p pid="a.299.1/1">It is not the Tories' fault. The Government have had 12 years to put it right, and they have been very slow about it. None of those Chinooks is available now, so what are the Government going to do to increase the immediate availability of helicopter lift, and what has happened to the NATO commitment at Bucharest to create a pool of helicopters available for deployment?</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/2">My second point, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> wanted me to address, is the exit strategy. I do not detect any discernible exit strategy from Afghanistan. As the hon. Member for Newport, West said, we all know the history of British military involvement in that country in the 19th century, and we need to be reassured that history is not about to repeat itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/3">That is not an attack on the Government; it is, I hope, a sober challenge to all of us to understand the magnitude of the issue. To know where we are going, it helps to know where we have come from, and there is no doubt that our experience in Afghanistan in the past does not auger well, although the hon. Member for North Devon was entirely right in pointing out that our mission is very different from that undertaken by the Soviets. I hope that the Minister will tell us what state of transformation in governance and self-sustaining Afghan military capability will constitute success, and at which point it will be safe for Britain and NATO to withdraw.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/4">For sure, there is no way in which we can sustain this tempo of operations for an extended period, let alone the 30 years mooted two years ago by the then British ambassador, Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, with whom I breakfasted, as did the Minister, at the British embassy at Kabul prior to his going on the &quot;Today&quot; programme to explain his view. Nor is there any way in which we can create a benign sort of Hampton-in-the-Helmand in the society described by a friend of mine who is a former brigade commander in Afghanistan. When we were discussing the general situation, he said: &quot;If you want to understand this place, Gerald, just go back to the 15th-century Scottish borders&quot;&mdash;that is where I am half from&mdash;&quot;and you will then have some idea of what this country is like.&quot; We must be realistic about what we can achieve</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/5">There is widespread acceptance that the battle in Afghanistan must be won, not least because NATO's credibility is on the line, but also so that those who have given their lives in this cause will not have done so in vain. However, we must recognise that it is part of a much larger picture involving al-Qaeda and Pakistan. I suggested to General Richards some time ago that there was a risk that Helmand province would act as a magnet to Islamic fundamentalists&mdash;foreign insurgents&mdash;who are keen to exploit the chance to hit the West. I believe that I was not wide of the mark, although few agreed with me at the time. That is another issue. We must consider the extent to which it is becoming, as the Leader of the House said, a &quot;crucible&quot; that is acting as a magnet for those forces who perhaps failed to deal with us in Iraq and are now looking to deal with us in Afghanistan before they reject everything that we stand for.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/6">Yesterday, the Government announced their intention of beginning work on a new defence review&mdash;an announcement that, given its serious implications for the nation's entire defence strategy, should have been made on the Floor of the House so that all hon. Members could have the opportunity to question the Secretary of State. That review must be foreign policy-led, not Treasury-led and, above all, it must factor in lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan, and the likely impact that continuing operations will have on our foreign policy and military strategy. That is the very least that we must do, and I hope that the Minister will respond to the key issues that have been raised during this debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.303.5/1">I shall come to that point in a moment. I want to deal first with drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.5/2">The impression is being given that no progress has been made on drugs, but Governor Mangal has run an effective narcotics programme in Helmand, working with the coalition force in providing grain for local farmers. Overall, more than half of Afghanistan's provinces are now are poppy-free. We started with six in 2006; there are now 18. The question is whether it will be a long, slow process. It may be, because we must ensure that we bring in alternative lifestyles behind the poppy eradication.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.5/3">I shall now pander to the hon. Member for Aldershot and his question on helicopters. I have to say that I agree with him about protected vehicles. Even if all our vehicles were highly protected, we still would not get rid of the potential for injury. We are dealing with a dangerous situation and clever opponents are always changing their tactics. That is why our counter-ID teams and others are working hard to look at the different techniques that are used.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.5/4">Our approach is clear. The Government not only put in the money, but we make a wide range of vehicles available. However, it is for commanders on the ground to decide when they are used, not politicians. The hon. Gentleman is right that to say using a Mastiff vehicle in parts of Helmand province is not on. First, it would not move; it would sink into the sand in certain areas. Secondly, he is right to say that winning hearts and minds cannot be done from inside a vehicle. Our people will be exposed, and it is important to ensure that we get the training tactics and techniques right. The way to win hearts and minds and influence the local people is not to fly everywhere: there is a case for getting out on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.5/5">We have increased the operating hours of helicopters by 84 per cent. We have also brought in some capacity, with our coalition partners, for commercial helicopters to do some of the heavy lifting. Again, we should get away from the notion that Britain is out there on its own, using its own helicopters for its own use. It is a coalition approach, and helicopters are being shared&mdash;as we learned this week, when a British soldier was tragically killed in a Canadian helicopter. It is all about pooling our resources and using them in the most appropriate way.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.5/6">As for the next move, the hon. Member for Aldershot will know that when the Merlins come out of Iraq, they will be moved to Afghanistan. When I was there, I had to share helicopters. People were asking whether we have the helicopters that we need. Yes, we have. The next question is whether they could do with more. Someone said, &quot;We will always ask for more.&quot; However, for the operations going on at the time we have the helicopters that are needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.5/7">My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West asked what is the alternative. I see one weakness in that approach. It is the question, &quot;What would you do differently? What other conclusion could be drawn?&quot; It is clear that if we leave Afghanistan, it will become a safe haven, as the hon. Member for North Devon suggested. I pay tribute to the Pakistan army, which is taking the fight to the Taliban in the north of that country and is having great success in bearing down on safe havens for terrorists. The Pakistan army should be congratulated on that and we recognise the sacrifice that they are making. I do not agree that we are at a stalemate position in Helmand. We are at a turning point, given the surge of Americans and our strategy. It is all about keeping the momentum going. Is it going to be tough? Yes it is; no one would say that it is not a difficult situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.5/8">I was asked what the end game is. The end game&mdash;we are moving in that direction&mdash;is to ensure that the Afghan national army, and the police and the Government, can take over security. I pay tribute to them; they are taking an increasing role, including in the successful operation at Musa Kala. The Kajaki dam convoy was supported by the Afghan national army, and it is taking a clear role in providing security for the Afghan presidential elections later this year. We need to train the Afghan national army to ensure that it can continue in that role.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.5/9">The hon. Member for Aldershot asked about our exit strategy. It has been clear from the start that it about ensuring that we put in security, bring in development, and train the Afghan national army and the Afghan police to take over security. We also need to put government structures in place that will lead to the sustainable development that is needed. I do not accept the analogy with the Russians drawn by my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West. They took a very different approach to occupation. We should not think that the lessons of history can be necessarily be used in modern-day Afghanistan or in other situations.</p>

	<p pid="a.306.1/1">My hon. Friend asks about Osama bin Laden. The fact of the matter is that we cannot leave a failed state and its entire infrastructure. The Taliban are not only persecuting the people of Afghanistan but exporting terrorism and ideology around the world. It would be nice if they were peace-loving people, but I do not believe that that they are.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/2">My hon. Friend spoke about reconciliation. That is already happening in Afghanistan. When I was there last year and met Governor Mangal, some members of the provincial council were Taliban but had come over. However, that is a matter for the Afghan Government. The clear position laid down by President Karzai is right: if people want to renounce violence and contribute to the peaceful prosperity and growth of Afghanistan, they will be welcomed&mdash;but not if they continue to support the Taliban in their horrendous persecution of the Afghan people or their terrorism. The process has to be Afghan-led and some progress is being made.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/3">Is it a hard task that we ask of our people in Afghanistan? Yes, it is; we are asking them to do a difficult job, but we can be proud of them. The influx of the Americans, the work that is happening in Pakistan and the continued commitment of our British forces will make a difference, and we can be proud of that. I have met our forces, both in Helmand and in Pakistan, and they know that they making a difference. They are proud of what they are doing. If that means not only bringing prosperity to Afghanistan but ensuring that there is no threat against the UK mainland, it is a cause that is well worth fighting for.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-08a.307.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1566" speakername="Ian Stewart" colnum="307"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090708/halltext/90708h0009.htm#09070879000496">
	<p pid="a.307.1/1">I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise this issue today as chair of the all-party group on vaccine damaged children. I preface my remarks, as I always do, by saying that the all-party group supports a public vaccination programme and the protection of workers in the work place. We recognise the role that vaccination plays, and has played, in the reduction and eradication of disease, and like everyone, I want protection against disease for my nearest and dearest, and for everybody else's too.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.1/2">With protection, however, comes responsibility. Society must accept its duty to give financial support to the small number of workers who have a serious, adverse reaction to a vaccination. The vaccine damage payment scheme, which we are discussing today, is administered by the Department for Work and Pensions, but the Department of Health has an input too. The DWP was first in the drawer for this debate, so I went for it first, but I hope to tackle the DOH at the earliest opportunity. The all-party group has established a good working relationship with the DWP, but sadly the same cannot be said of the DOH. Some of my remarks are intended for the latter, but basically I want to consider what financial support is, or could be, offered to workers damaged by vaccines, whether through the payment scheme, industrial injury benefits or, if appropriate, a new 21st century system of assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.1/3">Today's debate focuses on adults such as those in the medical professions. 1993 DOH guidance required, as a condition of service, that all new employers in &quot;exposure prone procedures&quot; should receive hepatitis vaccines. However, people in other jobs are affected too, and I have listed them in my recent early-day motion 1646, which has attracted 138 signatories from all parties represented in the House. I repeat that the numbers affected are small, but, as with all vaccine victims, the casualties are completely innocent; their lives, and those of their families, have been sadly diminished through no fault of their own. This is a family issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.307.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate and on his many years of excellent work, in this House, in trying to secure justice for individuals such as Mr. Robinson, a constituent of mine, who, six years ago&mdash;when he was a fit, young man of 43 years&mdash;had to be vaccinated for hepatitis B as part of his work as a forensic scientist. Two days later he was taken ill, and unfortunately several weeks later had to finish work. He is now 60 per cent. disabled. Does he agree that this vaccination has had a very detrimental effect on some people's lives and health, and that they should be compensated?</p>
