	<p pid=".1.4/1">This is a narrow debate. It is focused on the GM science review. As my intention is to get the Government's reactions to that review, I have informed my hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment of the questions that I intend to ask. I hope that I and other Members will be brief, so that the Minister has sufficient time to answer our questions.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/2">The GM debate is all too often characterised in this way: on one side are the scientists who understand the issues, and on the other, non-governmental organisations and the public who are ignorant and unjustifiably alarmed. The Prime Minister has repeatedly said that this issue will be decided on the basis of sound science, but many of us do not accept that science is the only criterion on which to decide about GM.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/3">The position of those who argue for the commercialisation of GM crops in Britain would be greatly strengthened if the science review were comprehensively reassuring about GM foods and crops, but it is not. Importantly, for the first time in a review of GM science the lead was taken from expressed public opinion, and uncertainties and gaps in knowledge were documented. The review demonstrated that in all the areas that it covered, from human health to the environment, scientific knowledge on the potential impacts of GM food and crops is limited and uncertain and that harmful and irreversible effects may occur. When I read the report, I expected that many of my concerns would be seriously challenged and that my arguments would be undermined, but they were not. In every chapter, evidence that gave confidence to the case for GM was soon followed by evidence that a continuing lack of knowledge presented risks.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/4">It is worth recalling a few of the statements in the GM science review that emphasise our lack of knowledge in areas that are not trivial. For example, it states that although existing evidence on animal and human health indicates a lack of adverse effects, there is uncertainty about the extent of any hidden adverse effects that might</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/5" class="indent">&quot;be too mild to detect, have a very low incidence or a long gestation period.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/6">It states:</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/7" class="indent">&quot;It is still largely unknown what happens to Bt toxins in non-target herbivores.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/8">It states:</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/9" class="indent">&quot;It is hard to predict the impacts that GM antifungal/antimicrobial crops might have on soil organisms and processes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/10">It also declares:</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/11" class="indent">&quot;A large area of uncertainty is the way in which the different factors in determining co-existence will combine at a commercial scale&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/12">On gene flow, it states:</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/13" class="indent">&quot;Although there are uncertainties about the scale and variability of crop to wild relative (and indeed crop to crop) gene flow, the major gaps are in understanding the potential consequences of gene flow.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/14">The science review also reminds us of the unpredictable nature of GM:</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/15" class="indent">&quot;The process of genetic modification theoretically has the potential to create unanticipated alterations in the levels or nature of toxic plant metabolites&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/16">I will now point to some of the uncertainties in greater detail. In a recent parliamentary answer to a question of mine, the Minister with responsibility for public health told me that in research using seven human beings</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/17" class="indent">&quot;to examine the potential for horizontal gene transfer from GM food to gut bacteria . . . No intact DNA was shown to be transferred&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-06">6 November 2003</phrase>; Vol. 412, c. 782W.]</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/18">Will my hon. Friend the Minister confirm that the volunteers were fed only one meal of GM soya, and that there was evidence that a part of a transgene was transferred to a micro-organism?</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/19">My hon. Friend will know that the science review concluded that there was no difference between the fates of transgenic and natural DNA. Can he point me to any studies that allow us to draw such a conclusion? Can he also tell me what research has been conducted on humans and farm and laboratory animals on the transfer of transgenic DNA from plant material to micro-organisms in the mouth? What evidence of gene transfer was identified, and did the gene construct used affect the outcome?</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/20">As I said, the science review acknowledges many uncertainties, yet it is repeatedly reassuring about the GM foods and crops already approved. It states that</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/21" class="indent">&quot;testing the composition of the new crop, food or feed in its entirety in feeding studies&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/22">provides &quot;a double safety check.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/23">Elsewhere, it is stated that such testing</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/24" class="indent">&quot;is done by undertaking typically a sub-chronic 90 day rat feeding study&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/25">That is reassurance until one reads the research, undertaken for the Austrian Government, that reviews 11 GM plant and food dossiers submitted for European approval. That research was not considered by the science review, but has been submitted to the comments website by a group of NGOs&mdash;Econexus, the Five Year Freeze Campaign, GeneWatch UK, which has helped me with my research, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and the Soil Association.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/26">Although the science review refers to testing new crops, food or feed in its entirety, the Austrian analysis of EU applications concluded:</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/27" class="indent">&quot;Data on the toxicity of the whole GM&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/28">plant</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/29" class="indent">&quot;are not provided in any dossier.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/30">Yet the science review says:</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/31" class="indent">&quot;The stringency and consistency of application of the regulatory evaluation and oversight are essential for securing public health standards and confidence.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/32">Furthermore,</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/33" class="indent">&quot;If the new gene product or endogenous plant metabolites were not as intended they could potentially lead to toxic, allergic or antinutritional effects.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/34">The Austrian report notes that in reality,</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/35" class="indent">&quot;Potentially toxic effects resulting as a secondary effect from the gene insertion are not considered in any case.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/36">We might conclude that those deficiencies in the process have been found too late to deal with food and crops already approved, but the scandal is that only yesterday our Government gave their support for Bt11 sweetcorn&mdash;Bt stands for Bacillus thuringiensis&mdash;tested under those very procedures. Can my hon. Friend the Minister tell me why, in light of the Austrian study, the Government are minded to give their consent to Bt sweetcorn?</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/37">In this short debate, it is not possible to follow through on the fascinating and well-written 250-page science report. I will restrict my comments to one further source of uncertainty. My hon. Friend the Minister recently answered some parliamentary questions of mine on the persistence and invasiveness issues, and rightly pointed me to the science review's deliberations. Perhaps at that time he had not seen the response of English Nature to the review. In that response, English Nature questioned the reliance on a sole set of experiments, the PROSAMO&mdash;Planned Release of Selected and Modified Organisms&mdash;experiments, which suggest that the current generation of GM crops are unlikely to be invasive.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/38">The conservation bodies point to other work that throws the underlying assumptions into question. What is my hon. Friend's response to that criticism by English Nature? Can he tell me what research has been conducted on the invasiveness of GM herbicide-tolerant and other GM crops inside arable systems that use herbicides and fertilisers?</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/39">My hon. Friend will be aware that, throughout the review, great emphasis was placed on a case-by-case analysis. That is obviously highly important in relation to invasiveness. Can he say whether any of the long-term studies of invasiveness involve exactly the same GM crops&mdash;the same GM lines&mdash;as were tested in the farm-scale evaluations? What does my hon. Friend consider is the significance of the fact that the Canadian authorities have made Roundup Ready canola one of the country's top 10 weeds?</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/40">In conclusion, I congratulate the Government on commissioning such an extremely important review. I have asked only a few questions; other hon. Members will have many more. I am certain that the available evidence and its interpretations are still contentious. Questions, such as whether we should proceed with GM food and the commercial growing of GM crops in this country, remain unresolved. The science review does not give a green light to GM food and crops. In particular, it gives no basis for hasty decision making. Why, in the face of such uncertainty, should we place the importance of making a decision about GM foods and crops above getting on with the vital task of pursuing a policy of sustainable agriculture and safe and nutritious food, which has been so well developed by the Government?</p>

	<p pid=".4.2/1">Good grief, no. Not at this stage.</p>
	<p pid=".4.2/2">I find the hon. Lady's attitude to such matters so negative that I think that she is a red flag walking in front of a train. I must draw attention to my entry in the Register of Members' Interests. The way that media and pressure groups have portrayed the various studies that have been produced by the Government does not do justice to those studies. In a year in which the planting of GM crops throughout the world exceeded twice the area of the United Kingdom, we must consider carefully what the studies have meant.</p>
	<p pid=".4.2/3">Leading up to the science review, the strategy unit economic review concluded that there were many potential benefits for genetic modification. It said that existing crops that offer cost and convenience advantages to United Kingdom farmers will be available, that future developments in GM crops have the potential to offer more wide-ranging benefits to farmers and consumers and that possibilities included GM crops with agronomic benefits more suited to the UK. The review pointed out that GM crops could deliver direct health benefits and that the overall balance of costs and benefits will depend on public attitudes. We are engaged in a battle for public attitudes.</p>
	<p pid=".4.2/4">The strategy unit recognised that, although economic benefits to the United Kingdom are likely to be limited in the short term, that was due mainly to the relatively minor status in the UK of the crops currently being considered and would increase considerably when traits suited specifically for the UK and GM crops, such as wheat, were available. It is worth noting the limitation of benefit that the unit identified was due to the limited market and public perception, not to the fact that the intrinsic economic benefit of the crop was low.</p>
	<p pid=".4.2/5">The science review was extremely positive. It concluded that, globally, there have been no observed detrimental health impacts as a result of the introduction of present GM crops and GM foods. The science review was based on a wealth of accumulated peer-reviewed scientific evidence and nearly 700 publications. It stated that there were no expected or observed detrimental health impacts from the introduction of present GM crops and GM foods. It went on to say that genetic modification, as an option for developing crops, was as predictable and reliable as other crop breeding methods, that DNA&mdash;or genes&mdash;were a safe, normal component of food regardless of origin and that a case-by-case assessment is essential for GM crops. It said also that there was no evidence that current GM crops would become &quot;super weeds&quot;, and concluded that</p>
	<p pid=".4.2/6" class="indent">&quot;they were very unlikely to invade our countryside or become problematic plants.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".4.2/7">Finally, the science review concluded that the current herbicide-tolerant crops envisaged for the UK offered increased flexibility and an improved environment profile of weed control.</p>

	<p pid=".5.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the problem of a case-by-case analysis according to scientific evaluation is that it is dangerous to allow particular parts into the food chain until we know the full impact of GM?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-11-11.5.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1018" speakername="Robert Key" colnum="5"  time="09:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo031111/halltext/31111h01.htm#31111h01_spnew6">
	<p pid=".5.1/1">No, I do not accept that view. The report also concluded that the UK and Europe have a very strict science-based regulatory regime, which ensures that today's GM products are at least as safe and nutritious as their non-GM equivalents. Biotechnology companies support such science-based reviews, which lead to a better understanding of the true impact&mdash;that is, the risks and benefits&mdash;of GM crops within the UK and globally. They welcome the science review's important contribution.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/2">Reports on the &quot;GM Nation?&quot; debate, focused almost entirely on an uncontrolled and self-selecting sample and paid little attention to the check of the focus group survey. That was interesting, especially as Professor Malcolm Grant&mdash;the chairman of the Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission&mdash;commented publicly that the wider self-selecting arm of &quot;GM Nation?&quot; was not representative of the UK public. We knew that of course and we should not assume that such an organisation is representative of the public.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/3">Although participants had concerns, the more representative focus groups also saw the positive benefits of GM crops in providing cheaper foods, helping British farmers and improving the environment by reducing inputs, such as pesticides and fertilisers. There was also the possibility of significant medical advantages, and that GM could help developing countries. Interestingly, a comparison of samples of people from the focus group with samples of people from the &quot;GM Nation?&quot; debate showed that when it came to helping developing countries only 12 per cent. of people in the debate, as opposed to 55 per cent. of the focus group, thought that that was significant. Only 15 per cent. of those involved in the GM debate, as opposed to 52 per cent. of the focus group, thought reducing inputs was important. When it came to helping poor old British farmers, only 10 per cent. of people in the GM debate, as opposed to 48 per cent. of the focus group, thought that that was important.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/4">When the results of the farm-scale evaluations were added to the above reports, it suggested that none of the reports should be viewed in isolation. The farm-scale evaluations confirmed what industry had long argued: the flexibility of GM crops allows them to be grown in a way that benefits the environment. I have seen that myself. I spent a day at Brooms Barn and saw what was being achieved in the sugar beet experiments. I came to understand the issues, which were different from what I thought they were until I went to see for myself. I subsequently read the scientific review of the Brooms Barn experiment and the reports in the press, but the latter bore little resemblance to what the science suggested in the report itself.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/5">Pressure groups claim that GM crops are, in effect, green concrete and would wipe out wildlife. The farm-scale evaluation results showed that that was scaremongering and not supported by the facts. On the contrary, the evidence reiterates that commercial experience around the world shows that GM crops are more flexible and can enhance biodiversity. It is also important to remember that the farm-scale evaluations were not putting GM on trial. As the statement by the scientific steering committee said:</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/6" class="indent">&quot;The researchers stress that the differences . . . were not a result of the way in which the crops were genetically modified. They arose because these GM crops gave farmers taking part in the trial new options for weed control.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/7">What was significant was not GM versus conventional farming, but different approaches to crop type, herbicide use and management practices. That research highlighted that the impact on biodiversity is all to do with how crops are grown and how farmers control weeds. When a person wants to grow a high-quality, safe, affordable food, they have to control weeds that would otherwise degrade quality, safety and affordability.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/8">After the most intense year of debate and investigation we have expanded proof of the economic benefits and safety of GM crops and there is no evidence of health or environmental risk. There is a good argument, based on the scientific evidence, for moving forward with the responsible, case-by-case introduction of GM crops to the UK under our robust, safe regulatory system. If the Government decided to proceed, they would allow UK farmers and consumers to benefit from the choice and flexibility offered by GM&mdash;that is denied them at present.</p>

	<p pid=".6.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1203" name="Joan Ruddock">my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Joan Ruddock)</phrase> on securing the debate, on her wisdom in seeking to direct questions and intelligence to the Minister, and on giving him ample time to reply. I shall also be fairly brief, although I am tempted to reply to various points made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1018" name="Robert Key">the hon. Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key)</phrase>, who spoke on behalf of the National Agricultural Biotechnology Council.</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/2">The science review is an excellent, pretty balanced, wide-ranging report, but it did say this: first, there was no test of the health impacts on humans of eating GM foods; secondly, the environmental testing was limited and the long-term cumulative impacts on the environment were not tested; and thirdly, no coexistence framework existed and it would be irresponsible to proceed to the commercialisation of GM crops until there was one.</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/3">I have one or two questions on health and the environment. Replies from the Department of Health to parliamentary questions confirm that it has not commissioned any research to look at horizontal gene transfer from GM to gut bacteria&mdash;why not? I take it that the answer to that question is that the Food Standards Agency conducted a small study that found:</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/4" class="indent">&quot;No intact DNA was shown to be transferred to intestinal tract bacteria.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/5">I should like to know why the Government continue to use that evasive FSA formula, which I believe is highly economic and selective and says that</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/6" class="indent">&quot;'transgenic DNA is no different from other DNA consumed as part of the normal diet and it will have a similar fate'.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-06">6 November 2003</phrase>; Vol. 412, c. 782W.]</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/7">I should say that trial data from the Newcastle trial</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/8" class="indent">&quot;clearly show that measurable amounts of the full length transgene survived in the gut demonstrating that food processing and the acidic environment of the stomach were not able to completely destroy food DNA. Additionally the experiment on the digesta samples confirmed that full length and active epsps genes had transferred to gut bacteria. It should be noted that those taking part were fed only ONE meal consisting of a deep fried soya burger and a milk shake&mdash;&quot; <i>[Interruption.]</i></p>
	<p pid=".6.0/9"><i> </i>I make no apologies for the diet. I simply report what happened. As a result, the experiment</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/10" class="indent">&quot;fails to address possible cumulative effects of antibiotic resistance gene building up in gut bacteria or the effect on the digestive tract of the release of other GM products (e.g Bt toxin).&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/11">My objection is that the FSA responded by saying that that was nothing new and that there was no risk to human health. I believe that both those statements are inaccurate.</p>

	<p pid=".7.0/1">Is my right hon. Friend suggesting that DNA from transgenic organisms is more likely to transfer to other organisms than non-transgenic DNA?</p>

	<p pid=".7.1/1">No, I am not suggesting that it is more likely to&mdash;the key point is whether it does transfer. Prior to the Newcastle study, scientists and, I think, the biotech industry, believed that that would not happen. They were amazed when it did. That is why it is so dishonest to pretend, as the FSA did, that there was nothing new about the experiment. It was astonishing, and produced the exact opposite of what was expected. The normal scientific response in such cases is to say, &quot;This may be a freak result. I do not know whether it is. We will replicate it by further extensive testing.&quot; That is not what has happened. The result has simply been dismissed and pushed under the carpet. That is wrong.</p>
	<p pid=".7.1/2">Furthermore, the trial data also show that</p>
	<p pid=".7.1/3" class="indent">&quot;the CaMV promoter which drives expression of the GM genes is known to be highly active in bacterial hosts. Therefore, if transferred intact to gut bacteria, as has been shown to be possible by the Newcastle study, CaMV-GM genes will function efficiently and release their products into the gut with still unknown immunological and other health consequences&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".7.1/4">What conclusion do the Government draw about the implications of that? Additionally, the data show</p>
	<p pid=".7.1/5" class="indent">&quot;no simulations of conditions that compromise normal digestion (e.g. diarrhoea) were tested to determine if GM Antibiotic Resistant Marker gene-containing bacteria could then be released into the environment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".7.1/6">That is a serious issue, which makes it clear that we need much more extensive, direct health testing. Does my hon. Friend the Minister agree?</p>
	<p pid=".7.1/7">On the environment, we all know that the environmental testing in the farm-scale evaluation trials, although well executed and undertaken&mdash;I have no objection there at all&mdash;was limited and confined to herbicide management, as was confirmed by the science review. What action are the Government taking to have further environmental testing on soil residues and bird populations? If farmers in a normal market situation sought to maximise commercial yield and not minimise environmental impact, as happened in those trials, what would be the impact on the environment? That, in particular, is a key issue.</p>
	<p pid=".7.1/8">The Government made it clear&mdash;I know this because I made it clear when I was in government&mdash;that if there were a risk to the environment, they would not license GM crops. Does the Minister accept that the evidence required to meet the Government criteria is absolutely irrefutable with regard to oilseed rape and beet? Do the Government therefore accept that, at least in respect of those two, there is no need for further evidence to reach a decision?</p>
	<p pid=".7.1/9">On maize, does my hon. Friend accept that, as has been widely said, the trial has been flawed by the use of atrozine&mdash;it has now been banned so it is no longer a valid comparison&mdash;by those growing conventional maize? Does he also accept that on the other side of the equation&mdash;the GM side of the field&mdash;the test was also invalidated by the fact that Bayer CropScience told its farmers that they should spray only once? It no doubt intended more weeds to return, which would be good for wildlife, and the environmental effects to be minimised. Does the Minister accept that in Canada there are never fewer than two sprayings and that sometimes there are three? Again, the result is invalidated. Will he confirm that in the beet trial the bolters were removed every two weeks on the GM side? That is totally contrary to normal commercial practice, in which the bolters might be removed&mdash;to reduce cross-pollination&mdash;only once in the whole season.</p>
	<p pid=".7.1/10">The most recent research on GM oilseed rape gene flow indicates that it is inevitable in the case of weedy relatives, such wild cabbage, and is likely to be on a much bigger scale than we thought. Does my hon. Friend believe that if such hybrids become established or become a serious problem, they will be able to be controlled or eradicated? What evidence is there to support claims that hybrids could be controlled?</p>
	<p pid=".7.1/11">My next point appeared in the science review and is very significant. In modelled arable systems of two years of winter wheat and one year of winter oilseed rape, with no attempt to control the feral population after the first harvest, it took 16 years after the initial oilseed rape crop for impurity in yield to fall below 1 per cent. Even if there was firm control, it took five years. Would that not have a serious implication for British agriculture if we were to proceed to commercialisation? What research has been undertaken into the control of oilseed rape volunteers by farmers? In Canada, they are now regarded as one of the top 10 weeds and the Canadians are fearful that if we have GM wheat, things will become worse. What levels exist at present and would the need to control GM volunteers lead to detrimental impacts on wildlife?</p>
	<p pid=".7.1/12">I have a host of further questions. Perhaps my hon. Friend will try to answer some of them now and the rest in a letter, which I hope can be put into the public domain so that a fuller understanding of GM science, which is in the interests of all, can be secured.</p>

	<p pid=".9.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1203" name="Joan Ruddock">the hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Joan Ruddock)</phrase> on securing a debate that focuses on perhaps the most important aspect of decision making on the future of the commercial planting of GM crops in the United Kingdom. I was fortunate to secure a debate on the wider topic of GM food a couple of months ago, so I will confine my remarks to a few questions to the Minister, to which I hope that he will take the opportunity to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".9.0/2">I want to pick up w<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1107" name="Michael Meacher">here the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher)</phrase> left off on the scale of the field-scale evaluations. The scientific review is of great importance to decision making. One of the key questions that comes out of the review is whether there have been the sort of results that the Government had in mind&mdash;although a different Minister was involved at that stage&mdash;when they said that if there was environmental harm from the planting of GM crops, they would not license those crops. The question must be: do the results indicate that sort of environmental harm? We know about the difference in the results, particularly with beet and rape, but the question is whether the Government think that those results are in themselves significant. They have yet to say yes or no to that question and if we can get one thing out of the debate, it should be that.</p>
	<p pid=".9.0/3">Two points follow on. What measurements of yields were made during the field-scale evaluations? My understanding is that none whatever were made.</p>

	<p pid=".9.1/1">There are so many questions that I do not know whether I can get through them all in the short time available. I will answer some before they slip my mind. There was a detailed scientific assessment of yield and that has been published as a separate scientific paper. My understanding is that the actual maize crop was managed in normal commercial circumstances.</p>

	<p pid=".9.2/1">I thank the Minister for that reply, which leads to my second point. I understand that the herbicide regime will not be legally available. We have been told that the Liberty-atrozine regime will not be the commercial regime for the future.</p>

	<p pid=".9.4/1">I thank the Minister for clarifying those matters from his perspective. There is still the question whether growing maize under the field-scale evaluation regimes is a commercial option. I hope that he will say whether the Government considered environmental harm when they set up those evaluations.</p>
	<p pid=".9.4/2">Will future developments occur on a case-by-case basis? We have two options. First, we can say that there are severe doubts about some aspects of some GM crops and that we will not therefore progress with their commercialisation. Secondly, we can say that the results were mixed for maize, beet and rape, and that every single GM crop will go through a field-scale evaluation. I understand that the industry is not desperate to sow many more GM crops in the United Kingdom, but whether that will be done on a case-by-case basis or whether the results are sufficient to take forward the commercial planting of GM crops is a point of principle for both us in the United Kingdom and the European Union.</p>

	<p pid=".10.0/1">That is one of the crunch points. It is possible that individual companies will go to individual countries within the EU to try to prove that there is every reason to license their crops. What will that do for countries that may not want to license such crops in the EU? In that case, the science would become irrelevant.</p>

	<p pid=".10.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. The chair of the review body examining the evaluations, Professor Chris Pollock of the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research in Aberystwyth, said that the results are applicable throughout the European Union. My question to the Minister is how will the Government interact with other European Governments? Do the results mean that maize is okay in the UK and is therefore okay in every other country?</p>
	<p pid=".10.1/2">My final question to the Minister is on the European dimension. I do not know whether he knows this but at the end of last week the Welsh Assembly Government joined with 10 other European regions to declare themselves the network of GMO-free regions. Those regions include Wales, Upper Austria, Tuscany, Aquitaine, the Basque country, Limousin, Marche, Salzburg, Schleswig-Holstein and Thrace-Rodopi.</p>

	<p pid=".10.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman feel that those regions and nations have enough power to declare themselves GMO free? He mentioned Upper Austria, which is taking legal action against the decision that it cannot declare itself a GMO-free zone.</p>

	<p pid=".10.3/1">That is an important point, which I want to put to the Minister. When Franz Fischler came to Wales in the summer to visit the Royal Welsh show, he said that it would be possible for regions to ban GM if there was evidence of harm. Do the field-scale trials provide such evidence? The 10 regions do not include Scotland, but no doubt the issues will be explored there. What will the Government do at a European level to ensure that Wales, and Scotland if it so chooses, can continue its GM-free status? The Welsh Assembly Government's statement was an important statement of principle and of public view, which was based on the precautionary principle. I think that they would say that some of the findings of the evaluation support what they did in that regard.</p>
	<p pid=".10.3/2">My final question comes down to the nitty-gritty. What will the Government do regarding co-existent regimes, in relation to their own policies and those in Wales? The Welsh Assembly Government and the National Assembly for Wales are very concerned about the impact of GM crops on the organic sector in Wales. We have a bigger organic sector than the rest of the United Kingdom. It is an expanding sector: a new organic plan for Wales is being discussed at this moment and will be launched by the end of the year, which will put Wales at the forefront of organic growing throughout the whole of western Europe.</p>
	<p pid=".10.3/3">The planting of GM crops has obvious implications for organic agriculture and the key will be any co-existence regime. I want assurances from the Minister that he will be prepared to bat for Wales based on what the Welsh Assembly Government want from a co-existence regime, and he will ensure that those matters can be implemented in Wales in the way that the Welsh Assembly wants.</p>
	<p pid=".10.3/4">The key to the whole debate is how we will be able to work together at a European Union level and how we can use the information from the field-scale evaluations to make some hard decisions based on environmental harm and the precautionary principle. We must ensure that that is done transparently and in a way that does not make the public lose some faith in food safety and the environmental concerns of the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".10.3/5">I congratulate the Government on having the evaluations&mdash;they were very important&mdash;but they have thrown up as many questions as they answered. I want the Government to give at least some of those answers later this morning.</p>

	<p pid=".11.2/1">I want to concentrate on the field trials that feed into the science review and make several general points. First, I welcome the fact that the field trials were completed because they have provided a wealth of information that is being used on both sides of the argument. I hope that those who tried to disrupt the trials are now thoroughly ashamed of themselves and an apology to the public at large would be extremely helpful. For those people to try to prevent evidence from being collected discredited their opposition to GM crops. I am glad that the evidence has been collected, despite their efforts.</p>
	<p pid=".11.2/2">The field trials were the largest investigation of farm ecology in the world and as such, they pose some rather interesting questions about British agriculture, which are much bigger and more important than the debate about GM crops. The key data that came out of the field trials showed that the most important issue was not whether a crop was GM or not&mdash;although there were significant differences between the GM and non-GM crops. The key issue was that of the crop&mdash;whichever it was&mdash;and the regime under which it was grown. Where it was grown in the UK seemed to be pretty irrelevant: it did not seem to make much difference. That demonstrates that we should have had such trials before GM came into view because they allow the public to have a clearer view of issues of agricultural practice and the decisions that have to be taken.</p>
	<p pid=".11.2/3">The trial clearly demonstrates that to talk of banning or not banning GM crops is to miss the point. The debate has to be conducted on a case-by-case basis because the issues are different with each crop. I will cite some figures to demonstrate that it is the crop that matters, not whether it is GM or not. If one considers beetle numbers&mdash;I do not know what sort of beetle was counted&mdash;1,707 were collected in a year from conventional sugar beets, whereas 1,576 were collected from the GM crop. That is a significant difference, but it pales into insignificance compared with the counts for conventional and GM maize, which were half that. The differences between maize and beet were hugely greater than the differences between GM and non-GM varieties. One finds similar differences throughout.</p>
	<p pid=".11.2/4">The crucial factors are the crop and the herbicide. I regret the fact that the first GM crops to be tested were all genetically modified for herbicide resistance, because those crops are the most contentious. Had the manufacturers had the sense to introduce a GM crop with rather more obvious benefits to the consumer, the debate would have been hugely different and more balanced.</p>
	<p pid=".11.2/5">The field trials concentrated on three crops&mdash;maize, beet and rape&mdash;that are relatively unimportant in the UK anyway, in that they cover only 10 per cent. of UK arable land. The trials did not deal with wheat, which covers 50 per cent. of arable land and, whether GM or not, is almost certainly the most inimical to biodiversity because of the way it is cultivated. The value of the crop is hugely diminished if it contains any weed seeds.</p>
	<p pid=".11.2/6">Essentially, the field trials also gave no information on the effect on the environment of crops for which herbicide resistance has been gained by conventional plant breeding methods. I suspect that they are just as inimical to the environment as GM crops. Again, that shows that we are arguing about the wrong thing. We, the British public, ought to be arguing about agricultural practice in the UK and what we are prepared to pay for it. We are not really talking about those crucial questions, which I wish to highlight.</p>
	<p pid=".11.2/7">The field trials should help the British public to start a proper debate about agriculture in this country&mdash;about whether we want a more biodiverse countryside and if, as taxpayers, we are prepared to compensate farmers so that, essentially, they look after the countryside rather than maximise their financial yield. We must decide whether we are prepared to pay farmers to create and maintain a biodiverse countryside and to compensate them for the fact that they will get a low financial return on crops that have a high weed content. Do we want to pay them to reduce the area under cultivation for crops that of necessity provide a regime that is inimical to biodiversity and wildlife, or to leave greater areas of land uncultivated to create biodiversity?</p>
	<p pid=".11.2/8">Those issues are hugely more important than the relatively unproductive debate about GM and non-GM crops. I hope that people will use the interesting field trials results to move on to much bigger questions about the way in which British agriculture operates.</p>

	<p pid=".13.1/1">I shall be brief to allow my colleagues to speak. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1203" name="Joan Ruddock">my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Joan Ruddock)</phrase> on raising the debate and other colleagues on turning up today. This serious subject is really about science, the public and the Government and getting the whole mix together so that we can have a proper debate.</p>
	<p pid=".13.1/2">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1107" name="Michael Meacher">my right hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher)</phrase> was speaking, I was tempted to challenge every conclusion that he made about every experiment, but that would be being a clever Dick. There will be another time and place for that. Sound science is an interesting concept. I have no knowledge of sound science, because there is always someone who will argue until the cows come home about how to interpret an experiment. There are usually various interpretations. The phrase &quot;sound science&quot; dribbles off the tongue, as if science gave the ultimate answer. It does not. It gives part of the answer, and that is how we should view the issue.</p>
	<p pid=".13.1/3">This debate always has been and will continue to be polarised. Let us consider the link between mobile phones and radiation. I wonder whether mobile phone technology would have been developed had we known about that. We must consider how the public perceive certain technologies at different stages in their development, and how opposition to them is conveyed. There is more evidence against the safety of mobile phones and telecommunications masts than there is against GM in scientific publications.</p>
	<p pid=".13.1/4">There has been a lot of hot air from both sides. It is completely untrue to say that because of the anti-GM culture, bioscience people are flooding out of the country to work elsewhere; there are more people entering this country because plant biology is about not only GM but many other things. The Biological and Biotechnological Science Research Council has put &pound;56 million into that area. An institute in Norwich tells me that many bright young people destined to be stars have come over from Australia and the United States.</p>
	<p pid=".13.1/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1249" name="Phyllis Starkey">My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> said that the debate was the wrong way round and that by focusing on one technology it becomes a lightning rod for a never-ending list of hypothetical concerns. We should start with the overarching problems in the long term and work back to the science and technology. It would bring together all the stakeholders to co-operate rather than produce the inherent dialectic of being for or against a specific technology. We should determine what science and technology could contribute towards a solution and identify the policy needed to facilitate the process.</p>
	<p pid=".13.1/6">The major remits ought to be the consideration of what level of photosynthetic production is sustainable in this country and in the world; how much we should share with other species; and how we obtain global food security with a technology-delivery window of 20 or 30 years hence if Australia's harvests are disastrous, eastern Europe has low grain reserves, Africa has a food deficit, global food deficits occur by 2020, there is little new prime land because of spoilage, and global climate change takes effect. We should discuss all that, not only one aspect of it, and then we might not need GM technology because science might develop in other ways. I doubt that it would because a lot of gene technology has developed in biomedicine, and it has been accepted because one can prove the benefits of developing new insulin and new drugs, and that does not worry people.</p>
	<p pid=".13.1/7">We should initiate a risk-benefit analysis, which does not exist in GM. It is a difficult concept that cannot be dealt with in this debate. The GM science review seems to suggest such an analysis. Many people on the review took up polarised positions and it was magnificent that they produced that document. It was like a Select Committee report: a minority report could have been produced but it was not. It is a very thoughtful document and it should be taken seriously.</p>
	<p pid=".13.1/8">The Science and Technology Committee will reassess the evidence. Tricky decisions must be made and there is a lot of research to undertake, as other Members have mentioned. We should be less vehement in our opposition to each other and we should discuss the wider context. In that way, science and technology will benefit, and it will not lead to an anti-science and technology culture, which sometimes seems to be around the corner.</p>
	<p pid=".13.1/9">I welcome the fact that the debate is now enjoined. I have sat on the Royal Society's committee for the public understanding of science and it has been very difficult to talk to the public about the issue. I am not convinced that the people who were consulted could be considered ordinary members of the public; I know who they were and they were drawn from polarised organisations and positions. That is not the way to engage in public debate and we have lots to learn. We should step back and consider the issue in less of a hothouse atmosphere.</p>

	<p pid=".14.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1203" name="Joan Ruddock">my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Joan Ruddock)</phrase> on securing the debate. I also congratulate the Government on holding the science review in the first place. It is easy to lose focus on the importance of the UK position, given that we lead the international debate on what science can tell us, what the limits are of what we know and what we do not know. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will respond to our questions. We should be admiring and praising the Government for conducting the science review. It has put us way ahead of almost any other country and places us in the unique position of defining the next set of issues that we will have to address nationally and internationally.</p>
	<p pid=".14.0/2">The Minister knows that I have raised several issues with him in written form, a couple of which I shall focus on today. I refer to co-existence and what we know about the evaluation techniques in the science of unintended consequences. As a benchmark, I want to say that GM is different from commercial plant breeding. It is not simply another form of it. There are risks and downsides in the production of many plants and the over-consumption of different food types. The difference with GM is that, with other conventional plants, we have inherited and accumulated knowledge that has been built up over 1,000 years. We are discussing a revolutionary technology and we do not know the consequences of some of the risks that go hand in hand with that. Will my hon. Friend the Minister say how we are attempting to put in place the benchmarks of a science that is about assessing and evaluating the risks associated with the revolutionary step change in what technology can offer?</p>
	<p pid=".14.0/3">Unlike mobile phones or the A-class Mercedes that fell over when it went round corners, it is difficult to identify a product recall mechanism when commercial approvals have been given to the system. I wish to ask the Minister a couple of specific questions about the stage at which the science is now. Has he read the two most recent studies on oilseed rape that were published in the UK during the last month, one of which was undertaken by Warwick et al and the other by Wilkinson et al? Both studies raised extremely important issues about the movement of genes between species. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1107" name="Michael Meacher">my right hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher)</phrase> made clear, the industry had denied the prospect of horizontal gene flow. We now know that that is not only a prospect, but a reality.</p>
	<p pid=".14.0/4">The study carried out by Warwick produced the evidence that transgene escape from oilseed rape to a wild relative from a commercially released crop was a measurable reality. Now that we know that, we need a science that is capable of evaluating where that goes and the risks that it entails.</p>

	<p pid=".15.1/1">I understand what my hon. Friend is saying. My point is that we have never before experienced a widening of the gene pool that has not been controlled by nature. We have a science that is capable of crossing all the frontiers that nature has set. We need a measuring process that is up to evaluating the risks that that leap forward can carry with it.</p>
	<p pid=".15.1/2">I come now to the connected issues raised by Wilkinson et al, which was published in last month's issue of <i>Science</i>. It shows that 32,000 hybrids between oilseed rape and the waterside form of wild turnip form each year and that there are 17,000 with the weedy population, primarily wild cabbage. The study showed that, if oilseed rape were grown, genes from bacteria and viruses could be introduced into the gene pool. That is the risk element&mdash;the uncertain area&mdash;in which we could become involved. We are not denying that nature has itself been responsible for the maintenance and change of the gene pool evolution. We are talking about the risks of a scientific revolution. The issues that we must understand and evaluate relate to the consequences of that revolution for both human and environmental health.</p>

	<p pid=".16.0/1">Does my hon. Friend accept that the way nature controls the situation, as he puts it, is through natural selection, which, as it relates to non-genetically modified organisms, operates against genetically modified organisms? If organisms do not have a select advantage in the wild environment, they will be wiped out by natural selection.</p>

	<p pid=".16.1/1">I am quite fond of nature's ability to control and regulate the planet. I am worried that the science of what can be done technologically is not matched by the scientific evaluation of the consequences for society. We need to know whether we are introducing the risk of new susceptibilities to bacteria and viruses. It worries me that industry has been good at producing scientific breakthroughs and then doing a runner when the cost of the damage becomes clear to society.</p>
	<p pid=".16.1/2">Will the Minister carefully consider the comments in the science review on the phrase &quot;no evidence&quot;? Will he take on board the recommendation made last year by the United States National Academy of Sciences that the US Government should not use the term &quot;no evidence&quot; in their environmental assessments? It added:</p>
	<p pid=".16.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The term 'no evidence' can mean either that no one has looked for evidence or that the evidence provides contrary evidence. Lack of evidence is not typically useful in making regulatory decisions about risk&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".16.1/4">Given the Minister's comments about the science of uncertainty about our current knowledge limits, can he tell us what new regulatory framework will be introduced to undertake clear risk assessments before he even contemplates commercial approvals?</p>

	<p pid=".16.2/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1203" name="Joan Ruddock">the hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Joan Ruddock)</phrase> on securing this debate. She hoped that we would all speak as briefly as possible in order to give the Minister ample time to answer the myriad questions that have been thrown at him, so in the spirit of that request, I shall do my best to keep my remarks brief.</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1249" name="Phyllis Starkey">The hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> emphasised the distinction between the views of those who are often characterised as anti-GM&mdash;people who roll around in fields wearing spacesuits and oxygen masks and take a luddite view&mdash;and what today's debate has been about, which is a healthy and responsible scepticism based on the uncertainties that the scientific debate has thrown up thus far. The debate has uncovered the fact that the more that we understand the subject, the more questions and uncertainties arise, and I hope that the Minister will address some of those questions.</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/3">When crucial decisions need to be made, I hope that it is recognised that we are far from having an adequate picture, and, in light of the evidence so far, I hope that they can be put off. I do not think that we will ever have the whole scientific picture, but an adequate picture, rather than the current piecemeal approach, will help to advise the Government and the Council of Ministers when they take their decisions. Yesterday, there was a classic example when the regulatory committee considered Bt11 sweet maize; it could have made a decision yesterday that could have started us down a particular route.</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/4">What concerns me and many hon. Members is that there has been insufficient debate in the House. We have had the &quot;GM Nation?&quot; debate in this country, but so far, limited scientific evidence has been brought forward. We might be sleepwalking with small, incremental steps towards making a significant decision, although there has not been adequate opportunity for that decision to be taken on the big stage. Instead, it will have been taken through the back door. That is what worries me. I am pleased that the regulatory committee has put off a decision until at least December; more evidence is required.</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/5">Many hon. Members pointed to the significant difference between medicines such as thalidomide, which, having been released into the market place can later be withdrawn, and GMs, where, the decision having been made to release them into the environment, it is largely irreversible, as the Canadian example shows. The fundamental point, which I hope that the Minister will take on board, is that we want reassurance that decisions will be taken only once we have an adequate and full picture of the science, rather than irreversible mini-decisions being made elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1279" name="Simon Thomas">The hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas)</phrase> raised questions about GM-free zones. I would be interested in the Minister's response to the fact that in October, following the FSE results, the health and consumer protection commissioner, David Byrne, is reported to have said that</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/7" class="indent">&quot;the threat to biodiversity would be treated as a matter of subsidiarity and therefore individual member states could make their own decisions&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/8">in respect of GM-free areas. Perhaps the Minister would like to reflect and comment on that.</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/9">I was interested to find that the GM review threw up a lot of points of uncertainty. For example, it concedes that</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/10" class="indent">&quot;where a GM allergen was not recognised in regulatory screening, and its effects only emerged in the longer term, avoidance of the allergenic protein by the consumer could be difficult, because they would not be able to recognise its presence in the foodstuffs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/11">It also says that</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/12" class="indent">&quot;the complexity of the safety assessment process&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/13">is &quot;likely to increase&quot; with the development of second-generation GM crops.</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/14">The review states:</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/15" class="indent">&quot;Our relative lack of knowledge about . . . factors that are important in sensitisation and eliciting an allergic response&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/16">means</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/17" class="indent">&quot;that we should exercise caution when assessing all new . . . foods&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/18">including foods and animal feeds derived from GM crops. On the environment, the review says:</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/19" class="indent">&quot;We do not have an exact understanding of what changes in a plant's life history will affect its invasiveness . . . there is a need for larger, more agronomically realistic studies to be undertaken to demonstrate absence of harm to non-target organisms.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/20">There are many questions that have been thrown up by the science review. I hope that the Minister will take them on board.</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/21">Like other hon. Members, I congratulate the Government on setting up the review panel. I know that, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/911" name="Ian Gibson">the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> said, there is great polarisation within that panel, and it has done well. At what point does the Minister believe that the Government will be in a position to make strategic decisions, not simply delegate them to the FSA or others, about what they believe? When will they be able to say what safety conclusions they have come to in respect of GMs? It is clear that the science review so far has to take on the FSA results; there are further results to come next year.</p>
	<p pid=".16.2/22">At what point will the science review panel, which is perhaps the best that is available, and the best science forum for this debate, and the Government be in a position to make those crucial decisions? Can the Government reassure us that those crucial decisions will not be taken through the back door in Europe, whether through the FSA or otherwise, until that crucial decision is taken?</p>

	<p pid=".18.0/1">I echo the remarks of other hon. Members by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1203" name="Joan Ruddock">the hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Joan Ruddock)</phrase> on initiating this debate on a matter of great public importance. I do not wish to sound too carping a note, but it is regrettable that this issue has yet again had to be debated in Westminster Hall, as a result of the initiative of a Back Bencher. That has inevitably meant that there is not as much time as all hon. Members want for the Minister to provide a full response.</p>
	<p pid=".18.0/2">There have been a number of excellent contributions and the wide cross-section of opinion that exists on this matter has been demonstrated. Those opinions are not determined along party lines. However, if there is one thing that everybody agrees on it is that, in order to proceed with the development and exploitation of technology of this kind, it is essential that we have as much information as possible. Whether one is an opponent or a supporter of GM, nobody would disagree that things must be done on the basis of scientific analysis, and that that must be made public so that everyone is capable of reaching a judgment. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1249" name="Phyllis Starkey">the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> in condemning those who have sought to prevent the further investigation of the possible effects of the exploitation of GM by disrupting field trials. That is something that nobody who is serious about this issue should support.</p>
	<p pid=".18.0/3">As hon. Members know, my involvement in this subject is relatively recent. It is less than 24 hours since I was debating the future of broadcasting policy.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-11-11.18.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/911" speakername="Ian Gibson" colnum="18"  time="10:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo031111/halltext/31111h01.htm#31111h01_spnew30">
	<p pid=".18.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is an expert.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-11-11.18.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1315" speakername="John Whittingdale" colnum="18"  time="10:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo031111/halltext/31111h01.htm#31111h01_spnew31">
	<p pid=".18.2/1">That is very kind but I am, perhaps, not an expert yet, and for that reason, as well as because the Minister needs to be given enough time to speak, I want to offer a very few preliminary thoughts.</p>
	<p pid=".18.2/2">The first question, which everyone must address, is whether we need GM crops at all. The answer is that we probably do not. Nevertheless, evidence is emerging that they have the potential to offer genuine economic benefits and an improvement in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1018" name="Robert Key">the human condition. My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key)</phrase> set out some of the areas where this technology might offer benefits. It might benefit the environment by leading to herbicides being used less&mdash;or certainly being better targeted. It might lead to the benefit of increased yields, and the consequent prospect of cheaper food, which would have benefits for the third world and the alleviation of starvation. There are also other potential benefits to do with pharmaceuticals and general health.</p>
	<p pid=".18.2/3">Nevertheless, this is a technology about which we still know very little. I agree with the Members who pointed out that, unlike with many other scientific advances, with this one when the genie is let out of the bottle it will be extremely hard to put it back in. Therefore, we need to proceed with great caution in exploiting it.</p>
	<p pid=".18.2/4">For all the assurances that scientists have given, the public still do not believe their statements. The hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford suggested that science is not the only criterion that is applicable in this debate. I agree. We have to take into account public concern. We must also accept that the assurances of scientists are now viewed with considerable suspicion. I was in No. 10 Downing street when the Government were saying that there was no available evidence that BSE could pass into the human food chain. I was also there when the Secretary of State for Health said, &quot;Well, Prime Minister, at the beginning of the week that statement was true, but I have to tell you that, as from yesterday, it no longer is.&quot; It is unsurprising that people are not going to accept the word of scientists when they have been shown to be wrong in past. There is a real problem with the public acceptance of a vast array of technologies including mobile phone masts, nuclear power, electricity distribution and GM technology.</p>
	<p pid=".18.2/5">The debate has focused on the science review and that is certainly an excellent contribution that has generally been positive, as my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury said. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1107" name="Michael Meacher">The right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher)</phrase> is, however, justified in saying that although the questions dealt with so far have produced relatively reassuring answers, some have not yet been focused on. Although we can continue to deal with matters that have not been properly dealt with, we still need to pause and ask further questions.</p>
	<p pid=".18.2/6">I am also slightly concerned about the general approach of adopting a case-by-case analysis. We need to examine bigger questions such as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" name="David Drew">the overall impact, as the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> said. There are various other concerns that we have not touched on in the debate and into which I shall not go today. However, we must tackle the potential impact on a growing industry&mdash;the production of organic food&mdash;and how we can ensure that consumers have properly informed choice through labelling, and legal liability. The bottom line is that the safety of the technology is not in itself a sufficient condition for proceeding, but it is necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".18.2/7">The debate has exposed real concerns that still exist. People still have real questions, even after all the answers provided so far, and the Minister has the opportunity to deal with some of the detailed questions. Accordingly, I shall not speak any longer, so that he has the maximum time to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".20.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1203" name="Joan Ruddock">my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Joan Ruddock)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the way she made legitimate points with which we need to deal. The Government recognise that&mdash;and so do I. I have some technical answers to some of her very technical points. I shall come to those in a moment.</p>
	<p pid=".20.1/2">I also welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1315" name="John Whittingdale">the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale)</phrase> to his new post. I look forward to debating with him on many future occasions. He touched on BSE, which is at the root of many of these problems. There was an erosion of public trust and confidence&mdash;that is part of the problem that we face today with new technologies, such as GM. The Government are trying to deal with that by putting much of the decision-making process into the hands of independent bodies. We think that setting up the Food Standards Agency and the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment, involving the wider public and being open and transparent, is the right way forward.</p>
	<p pid=".20.1/3">I lived through BSE&mdash;I was on the Opposition Front Bench at the time, on the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food team&mdash;and I would not blame the scientists. There was a lot of scientific evidence of trans-species transmission, but the implications for humans were not accepted. I do not believe that evidence is being ignored in the GM debate. There is an attempt to take all the evidence into account. That is the idea behind setting up the science review, the role of which is to bring together all the evidence to be properly evaluated and considered.</p>
	<p pid=".20.1/4">I accept <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/911" name="Ian Gibson">the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase>. This country has a world-class reputation for science, including plant science. It is true that people, institutions and organisations are keen to be based and work in this country because they will be supported in a range of scientific studies looking at the scientific horizons. That is important; we make no apology for it.</p>
	<p pid=".20.1/5">It might be worth reminding ourselves of the conclusions in the first report of the science review. I say &quot;first report&quot; because there is, of course, ongoing research. Some of the points that hon. Members mentioned are being considered in terms of the latest research on a whole range of issues&mdash;I shall touch on some of the details later. The first report concluded that although there is no scientific case for ruling out all GM crops, they should not be given blanket approval. The report endorses the Government's precautionary approach to regulating each GM crop case by case. The science review is neither a red light nor a green light for GMs. It is a thorough, neutral analysis of the actual science. The review raised some comprehensive questions. It states that there are gaps in our knowledge, which we must address. It is fair to say that knowledge is never complete. What matters is whether we have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the risks to make decisions on the risk analysis&mdash;a point on which Members touched.</p>
	<p pid=".20.1/6">Overall, the science review is generally positive, but it is measured. It is very good and has received a wide welcome. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1226" name="Alan Simpson">my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson)</phrase> said, it is also true that we are taking an international lead in the thoroughness of our work. Our work has three strands&mdash;the scientific review, the economic review and, of course, the farm-scale evaluations. No other country is carrying out such a detailed and thorough review of GMs.</p>
	<p pid=".20.1/7">The science review also says that we should not be complacent in either the risk analysis or the regulatory process, which must match advances in science. Going back to BSE, it is always in the back of my mind that we commissioned the Phillips report, which gave sound advice on examining all risks and not ruling out anything. We must examine everything through science-based and risk-based approaches.</p>
	<p pid=".20.1/8">I welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1018" name="Robert Key">the comments from the hon. Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key)</phrase>, who has spoken about the matter on a number of occasions. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1107" name="Michael Meacher">My right hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1249" name="Phyllis Starkey">my hon. Friends the Members for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase>, for Lewisham, Deptford, for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) and for Nottingham, South, and the hon. Members for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) and for St. Ives (Andrew George) are all involved.</p>
	<p pid=".20.1/9">We recognise that there are gaps in knowledge, which we must address. That point is recognised in the science review and by the Government. My right hon. Friend was right to say that the experiment carried out with volunteers by the Food Standards Agency involved only one meal, which was indeed soya burgers and soya milk.</p>
	<p pid=".20.1/10">On DNA transfer, the science review concluded that the experiments to investigate the transfer of transgenic DNA from GM plants to bacteria have generated consistently negative results with one exception, which we must examine to determine what it means. The balance of evidence points in the opposite direction, however, and the consequences of transfer have been risk assessed.</p>
	<p pid=".20.1/11">It was always assumed that DNA transfer could occur. The studies were conducted on the assumption that DNA transfer in the gut will happen. We must consider the potential consequences and whether any known risks have been identified. That has not been the case so far in these studies. The studies go back to 1996, when the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes, which was concerned by the presence of antibiotic resistant marker genes, conducted one.</p>
	<p pid=".20.1/12">A number of research projects were commissioned by the FSA to determine survival in the gastrointestinal tract and to address the potential for gene transfer in bacteria. The research demonstrates that the risk of transfer is extremely low. One can never say never, but I understand that further work has not identified DNA in bacteria. That work continues, but the FSA feels that that research study's findings were not significant. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West is right that the findings were entirely consistent with those for non-GM food and that there is no difference in the transfer of DNA. There is nothing special about the findings so far.</p>
	<p pid=".20.1/13">In relation to the Bt11 crop, the Austrian research was published in 2002, so it is not new and it has been taken into account in the evaluations and our own scientific research. The Austrian research is known, and it raises a series of questions rather than coming to a conclusion in itself. Those questions are reasonable and need to be addressed in our scientific review, which is based on the international standards for such research. An attempt is being made to create some consistency internationally in the way that that is done.</p>
	<p pid=".20.1/14">Only three objections of substance were made in any of the 25 countries in the EU involved with Bt11. There were a range of issues relating to post-market monitoring and traceability. We are also concerned about that and want it in place before there is progress.</p>

	<p pid=".22.1/1">There has been detailed analysis of the crop. Sweet maize is not for planting in the EU or UK: it is to be imported for animal feed and processing. That was referred to the normal committees, including the Food Standards Agency, which evaluated it and came to the conclusion that there was no evidence of any risk. That was the basis of the guidance that was given in response to that application.</p>
	<p pid=".22.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, Deptford mentioned English Nature. That organisation congratulated the chair and panel of the science review on producing such a &quot;comprehensive review&quot;. It agreed that the research should be conducted on a case-by-case basis, and it also agreed with the panel's view that although risks may be associated with growing some GM crops, there may also be significant benefits for the environment. The organisation raised a number of issues; that is absolutely true. I understand that the science review panel is looking into those points and takes them seriously. We would expect that and there is a representative of English Nature on that panel.</p>
	<p pid=".22.1/3">My hon. Friend mentioned invasiveness and there has been a great deal of research on invasiveness in relation to crops: &quot;Environmental Risks of Herbicide-Tolerant Oilseed Rape&quot; published in 1999; &quot;Investigation of Feral Oilseed Rape Populations&quot; in February 1999; &quot;Monitoring large scale releases of genetically modified crops, incorporating report on project EPG 1/5/30: monitoring releases of genetically modified crop plants&quot; in December 2002; and &quot;Consequences for agriculture of the introduction of GM crops&quot; in October 2003. A further project investigating aspects of persistence of oilseed rape is currently underway. Entitled &quot;Factors affecting cross-pollination in oilseed rape varieties, particularly of low male fertility, growing under typical UK conditions&quot;, it is due to be completed in 2006. A lot of comprehensive work is going on, which relates to the oilseed rape involved in the FSE trial.</p>
	<p pid=".22.1/4">On the question about Canada and what is classified as a weed, the canola is Roundup Ready canola, which has no approval in the UK or the EU, and the findings of the Canadian experience would guide the regulatory process if there were any application in the EU or the UK. We take that particularly seriously.</p>
	<p pid=".22.1/5">On the question about soil asked by my right hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West and Royton, I understand that studies carried out so far have been unable to detect evidence for horizontal gene flow between GM plants and bacteria in soil. That issue has been considered. As for wild birds, it is difficult to put a study together for wild bird populations unless one has very large GM areas in which to measure. Of course, measuring the availability of food&mdash;seeds and invertebrates&mdash;in the FSEs can be modelled to give an indication of the impact on wild bird populations. My right hon. Friend will be aware that I have some experience in such areas, so I know how that can be done.</p>
	<p pid=".22.1/6">There is not much time to go further into the detailed points, and I shall ensure that written answers are provided for the questions that have been asked.</p>
	<p pid=".22.1/7">The debate has been very useful. This was not the first on the subject&mdash;we have had several&mdash;and, because of the interest, there is certainly an argument for more detailed debates in the future. Taking seriously and addressing the relevant and perfectly reasonable points that hon. Members of all parties have raised will be an ongoing process.</p>

	<p pid=".24.1/1">It is a real pleasure and a great honour to be able to raise this subject on this day at this hour, and I thank those who are responsible for arranging such matters for their foresight and consideration. I welcome the Minister and hope that we can have several useful exchanges in the course of this relatively short debate in order to clarify the Government's policy on and their plans to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the D-day landings on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-06">6 June</phrase> next year.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/2">I raise the issue not only on behalf of the Liberal Democrats or myself, but on behalf of many Normandy veterans, the Normandy Veterans Association, the British Legion and, of course, as many as 200 Members of Parliament who associated themselves with early-day motion 618 on the subject and many members of the public across the country who feel strongly about the matter. I am grateful to my local paper, the <i>Yeovil Express</i>, which arranged a petition to highlight the importance of the issue to veterans.</p>

	<p pid=".24.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on an appropriate and timely debate. Does he agree that the significance of the 60th anniversary is particularly felt by those who, now in their 80s and 90s, were participants in the D-day landings, many of whom may not be in the position to make a journey to Normandy in 10, 15 or 20 years' time?</p>

	<p pid=".24.3/1">I am grateful for the comments of my hon. Friend, who anticipates a point that I intended to make later about the importance to many veterans of the 60th anniversary celebrations, particularly as that will probably be the last major anniversary that many of them will be able to attend. I hope that the Minister will respond to that point.</p>
	<p pid=".24.3/2">There is no doubt that the D-day landings on <phrase class="date" code="1944-06-06">6 June 1944</phrase> represented one of the most significant military engagements in British history. In &quot;The Second World War&quot;, Churchill described the landings as</p>
	<p pid=".24.3/3" class="indent">&quot;the greatest amphibious operation in history&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".24.3/4">In the same journal, he revealed that Stalin had telegraphed him on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-11">11 June</phrase> of that year to say that</p>
	<p pid=".24.3/5" class="indent">&quot;the history of warfare knows no other like undertaking from the point of view of its scale, its vast conception, and its masterly execution&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".24.3/6">That was a tribute indeed coming from a veteran of the terrible conflicts on the eastern front.</p>
	<p pid=".24.3/7">On <phrase class="date" code="1944-06-06">6 June 1944</phrase>, an immense armada of some 4,000 ships and many thousands of smaller craft set off from these shores, supported by the allied air forces and by airborne divisions.</p>

	<p pid=".24.4/1">Will my hon. Friend pay tribute to the veterans in my constituency who are trying to preserve one of two slipways in Torquay harbour from which more than 15,000 US servicemen took their places on vessels going over on D-day? That ought to be a centre for the anniversary celebrations in south-west England.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-11-11.25.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1036" speakername="David Laws" colnum="25"  time="11:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo031111/halltext/31111h02.htm#31111h02_spnew4">
	<p pid=".25.0/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. Later, I hope to touch on the Government's announcement that the New Opportunities Fund may be used to help to commemorate the D-day landings. My hon. Friend may wish to apply to that fund to see whether he can associate it with his constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".25.0/2">There is no doubt that the Normandy landings were a crucial event in the second world war. In a sense, they marked the beginning of the end of Hitler's regime and the single moment in the war on the western front when victory seemed at last attainable and even imminent. Surely, therefore, nobody in the United Kingdom, or among our allies, can doubt the importance of the D-day landings or of marking their 60th anniversary, which is coming up next year, particularly given that, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" name="David Heath">my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> pointed out, this will undoubtedly be the last opportunity for many of the veterans to attend a major commemoration of the event.</p>
	<p pid=".25.0/3">In the light of that, it is disappointing that the Government did not come forward earlier with more decisive plans to celebrate the 60th anniversary. Instead it seems that, up until now, it has been left to the Normandy veterans, the British Legion and Members of Parliament to press the Government on the issue and urge them to mark the anniversary next year in a more suitable way. We have just seven months left in which to get the details right before next year's commemoration, and I hope that we can engage with the Minister on that today.</p>
	<p pid=".25.0/4">I seek four assurances from the Minister. I should be grateful if he would reassure us that the Government understand the importance of the anniversary and will give as much prominence to the 60th anniversary celebrations as they did to the 40th and 50th anniversary commemorations. In an exchange in another place, the Minister for Defence Procurement told the House:</p>
	<p pid=".25.0/5" class="indent">&quot;It is worth remembering that the Normandy landings received large-scale commemorations on both their 40th and 50th anniversaries. A number of significant Second World War anniversaries will fall in the years up to 2005 and it will not be possible financially to mark them all on a large scale.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-14">14 July 2003</phrase>; Vol. 651, c. 626.]</p>
	<p pid=".25.0/6">Is that really the Government's message to the veterans who risked their lives on the Normandy beaches? In that statement, it sounds as if the Government were essentially saying that the Normandy veterans have had their commemoration and that, as there was a limited pot of money to go round and to be spent on such things, their initial intention was that there should be no large-scale commemoration next year. I hope that they have changed their mind and that the Minister present today, who has been praised by some of the Normandy veterans since he was appointed, will be able to clarify matters and report that there has been a change of heart at the Ministry of Defence.</p>
	<p pid=".25.0/7">The second issue concerns representation. In 1984 and 1994 both Her Majesty the Queen and the then Prime Ministers attended the D-day commemorations. According to the Minister's letter to Members of Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-07">7 July 2003</phrase>, the UK Government will be represented at ministerial and senior armed forces level. With respect, does he understand that the veterans seek Head of State representation? Does he understand that the veterans view with scepticism the point in his letter that attendance by the royal family was a matter for the royal household? The veterans understand that on such occasions it is usual for Ministers to give advice to the royal household, which no doubt it listens to very carefully.</p>
	<p pid=".25.0/8">If the Minister advises that it will be a low-key celebration, which will not be on the scale of the 40th and 50th anniversaries, surely it is no surprise that we have had no announcement from the palace about whether Her Majesty the Queen or another member of the royal family will attend. Does he agree that if the President of France or the President of the United States were to attend the commemorations, which is quite possible, it would be inappropriate for us not to be represented in the same way? I appreciate that this is a sensitive matter, but I should be grateful if the Minister would shed more light on the advice that has been given to the palace.</p>
	<p pid=".25.0/9">We appreciate some of the practical measures that the Government have introduced in the past few months to help the veterans who wish to attend the commemorations in Normandy. We particularly appreciate the free one-year passports and the concessionary fares from ferry operators, which have been negotiated with the help of the Government. Nevertheless, it is possible that many veterans will not be able to afford to attend the commemorations in France, and I should be grateful if the Minister would say whether the Government are considering any further financial assistance to veterans who would otherwise have difficulties travelling to France.</p>
	<p pid=".25.0/10">Will the Minister shed more light on the announcement made at the Labour party conference by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport that there is a real possibility of money from the New Opportunities Fund being used for commemorative services? Will he clarify whether that could be used for assistance with travel costs, or whether it will be aimed only at commemorative events in this country and in France? In particular, will it be used to help the younger generation to understand the importance of D-day commemorations?</p>
	<p pid=".25.0/11">There has been some concern from the Normandy veterans and the British Legion about the practical preparations being made in France next year. I appreciate that that is a matter for the French authorities, and that if the British authorities offered to run the event themselves it would not be entirely welcome, but what practical steps are the Minister and his Department taking to ensure that events run smoothly? I was reassured to hear from the Normandy Veterans Association that a meeting took place last week involving the British project officer, and that good progress was made.</p>
	<p pid=".25.0/12">In the course of a short half-hour debate, we will not be able to address all the points that have been made, so will the Minister consider meeting a cross-party delegation and representatives of the British Legion and the Normandy Veterans Association to ensure that any matters that are not adequately dealt with in the debate are followed up? That will ensure that we do not leave any stone unturned and that the commemorative celebrations are of a level and with the organisation that they deserve.</p>
	<p pid=".25.0/13">Representatives of one of the veterans' associations told me that since the Minister's appointment earlier this year, the Government's attitude to these matters seems to have changed for the better. I hope that that is the case and that he will be able to offer us more encouragement on the points that I have raised. I take his positive facial movements as an indication that he is keen to make that announcement.</p>
	<p pid=".25.0/14">Now is the Minister's opportunity to translate what has been a change of tone into real action. Almost 60 years ago in this House, Winston Churchill announced the D-day landings and talked of the &quot;liberating assault&quot; that had fallen on the coast of France. I hope that the Minister can demonstrate today our nation's enduring gratitude to the men at the hard edge of that liberating assault, not only in words and fine phrases, but in real action.</p>

I have no doubt that his predecessor would not have countenanced such a gesture. It is important that we have the debate, but it was not necessary to use the 11th hour of the 11th month. The debate could have occurred at any time on any day. Of course, as the Minister who represents veterans' interests, I am always happy to debate such important policy areas, but perhaps the hon. Gentleman should consider whether veterans groups might have preferred me to have been at the Cenotaph at 11 am today or in Hyde park, where I am pleased to say that Her Majesty, accompanied by the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Australia, unveiled a memorial to the 101,000 young Australians who gave their lives for the Commonwealth and this country in the two world wars.</p>

	<p pid=".27.5/1">No, I shall not give way.</p>
	<p pid=".27.5/2">I am not sure what more the hon. Gentleman expects to gain from the debate when I have provided the House with regular progress reports in my answers to hon. Members' questions and letters. I am aware that the veteran community, fired by widespread and unsubstantiated rumour and misinformation&mdash;which the hon.

	<p pid=".28.1/1">Let me make it clear that the Government endorse the importance of remembrance and commemoration, and I am well aware of the veterans organisations' views on those matters. I spoke to them about those matters at a recent meeting of the Veterans Forum.</p>
	<p pid=".28.1/2">The D-day landings in June 1944 were a significant time in our history. They were the largest international combined forces amphibious assault that the world has ever seen. The huge number of people involved, the planning, the logistics, the co-ordination, were unimaginable. The task of concealing that immense operation from the German occupying forces in France, just a few miles away, was a phenomenal project. Most importantly, the bravery, courage, nerve, resilience and audacity of the heroes who had to implement the plans that were drawn up in secret over so many months was remarkable. It is one thing to read about such momentous events or to sit passively and watch wartime film footage, post-war documentaries and Hollywood re-enactments but, regardless of how realistically they are staged, to have participated in them is another matter entirely.</p>
	<p pid=".28.1/3">To have actually taken part in an assault on land, sea and air against a well-armed, professional, battle-hardened and competent enemy is something that the majority of us will never have experienced&mdash;and, hopefully, will never have to. Such courage in the face of the enemy must never be forgotten, regardless of whether it was shown in the mud of the Somme in 1916, on the beaches of Normandy in 1944 or in the sands of Iraq in 2003. We owe those who put their lives at risk in these ways this country's eternal gratitude.</p>

	<p pid=".29.0/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I have seen his contribution to business questions and I will shortly write to him and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1108" name="Alan Meale">my hon. Friend the Member for Mansfield (Mr. Meale)</phrase> about the matter. As we are talking about medals, 900 Suez medals were dispatched by Remembrance Sunday, following my comments in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-08">8 September</phrase>, and we hope very shortly to complete those for which we have already had applications.</p>
	<p pid=".29.0/2">The Department has already provided assistance for a number of 60th anniversaries of the second world war. Between now and 2005 there are a succession of anniversaries of significant actions, and the Ministry of Defence cannot organise commemorations for all of them. It was therefore agreed with the services and veterans organisations that we would fund a commemoration of one representative battle for each of the services, with a tri-service commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war. The actions chosen by the services were the battle of the Atlantic for the Royal Navy, the battle of El Alamein for the Army and the battle of Britain for the Royal Air Force. Those anniversaries were commemorated in 2003, 2002 and 2000, respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".29.0/3">It was also agreed that other major anniversaries would be marked where possible by the presence of Ministers or senior officers at events organised by the veterans. This level of assistance and support does not mean that the 60th anniversary will be treated with any less respect than is due to these brave men and women.</p>

	<p pid=".29.2/2">Some questions that I am asked are easy to answer, though the message does not seem to be getting through, judging by some of the hon. Gentleman's comments. The participation of members of the royal family and members of the British Government is a matter that is often raised. Veterans have referred to stories that President Bush and other Heads of State will attend, but the attendance of Heads of State and Heads of Government is pure speculation at present.</p>

	<p pid=".29.2/4" class="indent">&quot;France, the United States of America and Canada are considering requests for their heads of state to take part in ceremonies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".29.2/5">No country has taken any sort of final decision yet, and I reject the accusation that the UK&mdash;either the royal family or the Government&mdash;are dragging their feet on this issue. Nothing could be further from reality.</p>
	<p pid=".29.2/6">It has also been suggested that the Government could provide financial assistance to veterans for their transport and accommodation expenses. It would not be possible&mdash;neither would it be fair&mdash;to be seen to provide assistance for one anniversary or group of veterans and not another. However, to ease the financial burden for veterans travelling to Normandy, I announced in a written ministerial statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="">17 September</phrase> that the Ministry of Defence had obtained a 50 per cent. discount on P&amp;O Ferries fares for veterans groups travelling to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the D-day landings.</p>
	<p pid=".29.2/7">Further details are provided in a handout that I will place in the Library today. I wish to place on record how delighted we are that P&amp;O made such a concession available. The leaflet also contains the required information on the concessionary passports scheme, which was announced by the Home Office on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-04">4 June</phrase>. That initiative offers a free one-year passport to veterans who wish to attend commemorative events in 2004 and 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".29.2/8">My Department has approached the Normandy Veterans Association and offered assistance, if it is required, at their service of remembrance and thanksgiving, which will be held at St. Paul's cathedral on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-20">20 October 2004</phrase>. The hon. Gentleman also asked me about the New Opportunities Fund, a lottery distributor that awards grants to education, health and environmental projects in the United Kingdom. It focuses particularly on those in society who are most disadvantaged. It recently announced its intention of helping war veteran groups to mark the 60th anniversary of the final period of the second world war.</p>
	<p pid=".29.2/9">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and I are investigating the way in which her Department, the Ministry of Defence and the New Opportunities Fund can work together to bring such support to bear. We are mindful of the need to involve today's younger generation in our history, remembrance and commemorative affairs. Officials from my veteran affairs secretariat have been arranging a cross-Government education project jointly with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Education and Skills, working alongside the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the Royal British Legion, the Imperial War museum and single service museums. The first stage of the initiative will be to encourage secondary schools to participate in a national schools competition, as part of their research for their citizenship project work. They will gather testimony from eye witness veterans who took part in the D-day landings. I expect to make further announcements about the project during the rest of this year.</p>
	<p pid=".29.2/10">With regard to the traffic problems in Normandy in 1994 when British troops were used to assist with traffic control, it is fair to say that, at the time, the French were taken by surprise at the events. From my discussions in Paris, I understand that the French Government's organising committee is taking on board such issues in its current proceedings. I have said before that we shall be sending two military bands to Normandy. I mentioned earlier that, while invitations from the French Government have yet to be received and accepted, it is likely that the United Kingdom will be represented by members of the royal family, by Ministers including myself and by senior members of the armed forces. It is also likely that there will be other representatives from the three services, but I regret that it is still too early to say who they will be. In recent months, our armed forces have of course been busy throughout the world. Deployments take time to arrange and our resources are not infinite. They must be utilised carefully and sensibly. The Ministry of Defence has many important commitments for many months ahead and we must be careful to achieve the right balance. I will make further announcements to the House when I can do so.</p>
	<p pid=".29.2/11">The Government take all the 60th anniversary commemorative events very seriously. However, there is still much work to do in connection with D-day and I am committed to ensuring that it will be done. Let us deal with reality, not speculation. That is what those brave men deserve.</p>

	Health Funding (Cornwall)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-11-11.32.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1274" speakername="Matthew Taylor" colnum="32"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo031111/halltext/31111h03.htm#31111h03_spnew0">
	<p pid=".32.1/1">I welcome this debate, and we welcome the fact that the Minister has taken a real interest in the health service in Cornwall. It was only in March that I introduced a previous debate on the health service issues facing the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, in particular, so I might repeat some of what I said then. However, today I wish to speak about the wider financial issues facing the health service in the county. I understand that those are reflected throughout much of the rural south of this country, with numerous health providers struggling to overcome deficits at the same time as trying to put in place welcome changes as a result of the Government's attempt to rebuild and improve the national health service, with finances for the NHS that both the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats welcome. We believe that that investment is necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".32.1/2">There is no disagreement between our two parties about the fact that over many years, the NHS has been substantially underfunded for the services that we have asked it to provide. That is why the Government have now put up taxes and are making a substantial increase in investment in the NHS throughout the country. We welcome that, but it is important to realise that throughout Britain, NHS service providers have been trying to perform in the context of clear historical underfunding. In different parts of the country that problem has manifested in various ways, such as long waiting times, run-down, old and inadequate buildings and, in many cases, a lack of staff.</p>
	<p pid=".32.1/3">All too often, hospitals and health providers have not been able to operate within their budgets, especially when they have been hit by factors outside their control in the short term, such as increasing numbers of people attending accident and emergency departments. Even given what has happened historically, year after year the number is well above projections. Such issues cannot be easily controlled, especially when the health service is short of money to make the investment in alternative long-term health provision that might keep people away from accident and emergency departments.</p>
	<p pid=".32.1/4">It is important to explain to the Minister that many people providing health services in the county have an historical record of delivering financial responsibility. For example, until a year ago the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust had had nine consecutive years of living within its budget. With the abolition of the old health authority, the organisation that had responsibility for the deficits no longer exists, and the organisations that now have to pay for the consequences of the failure to deal with some issues in past years are the hospital providers and the primary care trusts. Independent views have been commissioned by the health community to examine how funds have been spent. The November 2002 service modernisation and financial plan, for example, said that the history</p>
	<p pid=".32.1/5" class="indent">&quot;was one of comparable efficiency and relatively low unit costs. There is no evidence of serious inefficiency.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".32.1/6">It must be said that in the past couple of years, primary care trusts have often been called in by the strategic health authority to be told that things are not right and that they have to tackle the deficit. There is a real feeling among them that they are doing their best and that, to some extent, they have been saddled with historical problems. If I were to sum up the position, I would say that people are desperately striving to deliver improved health services. Cornwall has a good record of doing that; it is very innovative.</p>
	<p pid=".32.1/7">On the subject of ensuring that patients are seen quickly in an emergency, it is a simple fact that the percentage of those seen within four hours at the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust has gone up from only 60 per cent. not so long ago to 90 per cent. That meets the Government target. As the Minister well knows, some hospitals met that target simply by calling in extra staff in March, just to get the figures right when they were due to be collected. One hospital not so far away from ours did that&mdash;indeed, another Minister said that it had done the right thing, as that is how the rules work.</p>
	<p pid=".32.1/8">The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust invested in changes to accident and emergency arrangements, and separated people in desperate need of emergency treatment from those with minor injuries, so that those with minor injuries did not wait for ever, but were seen separately by staff dedicated to such cases. The trust did all that it was asked to do, but there are costs involved in doing that properly. Our health authority has also been at the front of the pack in implementing National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommendations, such as those on cancer care and treatment, but there is a cost involved in doing that.</p>
	<p pid=".32.1/9">On the other hand, those on the health authority are criticised for not tackling the problem of the historical deficits for which they, individually, are not directly responsible; they did not take the strategic decisions that led to them. They feel that one thing or another has to give; it is not possible to continue making the changes, some of which&mdash;particularly those aimed at reducing the increasing numbers going to accident and emergency, and to hospital in general, by giving better care on the ground&mdash;will lead to lower costs in the long run. However, there are up-front investment costs involved in doing that, and they cannot be met if the health authority is also being asked to pay off the deficit at the same time.</p>
	<p pid=".32.1/10">I emphasise that we recognise the positive news in the investment that the Government are making. There is &pound;5 million for the oncology unit at Royal Cornwall hospital, so at last it is getting proper funding for treatment for cancer. There is to be an extension to the maternity unit at St. Austell community hospital in my constituency. Work is under way on the Knowledge Spa, which should transform our health provision, because not only will it train the people we need for the NHS, but it will do that within the county, and that will improve quality and care for patients. Also, the new-build Bodmin hospital has been completed.</p>
	<p pid=".32.1/11">I also emphasise that we can see that patient needs are efficiently handled. The price per patient in Cornwall is much lower than the English average; Cornwall is 14.5 per cent. more efficient in cost terms, despite the high volume&mdash;well above the national average&mdash;of general and acute activity there.</p>
	<p pid=".32.1/12">There is real acceptance that there needs to be a plan to move people out of hospital acute care and into the community, and a lot of work is being done on that. The service modernisation and financial recovery plan is aimed at doing precisely that, and having more cost-effective prescribing programmes is a high priority. As the Minister knows, that is not easy to deliver, because the matter is to a large extent in the hands of private contractors and GPs. However, it is taking place, through getting consultants together with GPs to work through programmes. That has changed some consulting practices.</p>
	<p pid=".32.1/13">For example, there is more use of generic drugs within the hospital. That was not always the case in the past. KernoFlex is a nursing recruitment campaign aimed specifically at reducing the high cost of agency nurses by having a system within the health service for the kind of part-time and more flexible working for nurses that avoids those high agency costs. Again, however, there are up-front investment costs. There is the modernisation programme for mental health provision. A lot of extra money is going into mental health support in the county; that is welcome, and in the long run, will reduce the number of patients who have to go back into hospital, or spend time in hospital unnecessarily because eyes are on the other forms of provision and support. At the moment the health authority has to cut back on provision for many of those patients, to deliver the so-called efficiency savings. In the short run, that is likely to mean that we have to fund both the up-front investment, which is trying to change things for the better, and the increasing numbers of people who go to hospital because of lack of community support, so we get the worst of all worlds.</p>
	<p pid=".32.1/14">There is an agreement to create what is virtually a single operational management team across the entire community, so that everyone is working in the same direction, including social services through the county council, which is a big step in the right direction.</p>

	<p pid=".34.1/1">The Minister is nodding, but we both know that that has not always happened in the past. However, it is happening now&mdash;and it looks rather like the recreation of the Cornwall health authority. I would have preferred a single authority for Cornwall in the first place; I am not sure that three PCTs was ever a great idea. Anyway, all those people are coming together and working to a strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/2">A single referral point for GPs has been developed, to encourage the use of alternatives to acute admissions. Integrated patient management provides a county-wide view of the availability of treatment facilities, so that they are used in the best way and costs are cut. An &quot;acute care at home&quot; model has been developed to minimise readmissions. The West Cornwall hospital pilot will maximise the range of services that can be provided locally, and I hope that that model will not only spread across Cornwall, but be picked up nationally. The Government have shown a lot of interest in that pilot. All those measures demonstrate progress in finding creative solutions, which, in the long run, will improve patient care and reduce costs&mdash;particularly by tackling the high levels of hospital admissions. Those are not in anybody's interest if they can be avoided to the benefit of the patient.</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/3">However, all that is undermined by the county's need to repay those historical debts. That overhang, involving substantial sums&mdash;some &pound;13 million still has to be found from ongoing expenditure&mdash;is putting its ability to deliver those measures in severe doubt. That is a process point. The debts are historical and non-recurring. If the health authority did not have to wipe out that deficit, it would be in nothing like the same financial pain, although obviously it would still have to address those issues.</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/4">We in the Cornish community have made an effort to resolve the problem ourselves. I have touched on the plans in place. I have no doubt about the willingness and eagerness of some of the best people in the country&mdash;dedicated members of the health service, both management and staff&mdash;to adopt the kind of approach that the Government are looking to for reform. However, they are struggling to achieve a solution.</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/5">The final blow came with regard to what had been designed as exactly the kind of innovative solution that the Government have asked for: a financing solution, involving a loan from the county council. Like most local authorities, Cornwall county council holds substantial reserves. It was in a position to make a loan of some &pound;8 million&mdash;&pound;4 million a year&mdash;to the health community, which would have paid interest, so the loan would have imposed no cost on the council tax payer. The council would simply have been investing in the health service rather than in a bank. It looked as if the loan would meet a substantial proportion of the targets that the health authority was being asked to meet, and help to solve those long-standing financial problems. The historical deficits would have been paid off over a longer period than the Government would otherwise have allowed.</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/6">That was done with the encouragement of the strategic health authority, and other strategic health authority moneys, which now seem in doubt, appear to have hinged on its success. The district auditor was happy in principle, but suggested taking legal advice, and the whole thing was scuppered on the grounds that the health community&mdash;the PCTs&mdash;did not have the legal authority to borrow. Whatever the rights and wrongs are, as I understand it the Minister is in no position to allow the loan to go ahead, because the decision is based on statute.</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/7">There was no practical way round that block, with the result that the underpinning of the effort to address the financial deficit was brought to a resounding halt. At that point I applied to secure this Adjournment debate, the community health council wrote to the Secretary of State raising its concerns, and I met the Central Cornwall primary care trust to discuss the financial situation. It said, &quot;We'll try to get rid of this overhang&mdash;the historical deficit. That's the order, and that's what we'll do. But we simply don't see how we can do that and maintain the quality of care, let alone the improvements that the Government are looking for.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/8">That brings me back to a fundamental point. The Government are putting increased resources into the NHS because they, like the Liberal Democrats, recognise its historical underfunding. It is no surprise that in parts of the NHS&mdash;not just in Cornwall, but in most southern rural areas&mdash;the result of that historical underfunding was not just poor service and long waiting lists, but deficits built up in one form or another. It is self-evident that it is counter-productive to demand that the deficits be paid off in short order when it is recognised that they built up partly because of poor service, which is now being addressed.</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/9">Although the money that the Government are putting into Cornwall is welcome, it is not sufficient both to pay off the historical deficit and to improve services. Indeed, the amounts are not calculated on that basis; they are calculated to provide the regular annual income needed to run the health service properly today, not to pay off past deficits. There is no allowance in the formula for more money to pay off a deficit, so at some point, patient services are bound to be squeezed.</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/10">The Minister would not expect me to finish without asking whether the formula is equitable in addressing the costs of providing health services in rural areas. She will be aware that there is good evidence that throughout rural southern areas&mdash;apart from the cities, and separate from the northern areas&mdash;there is a consistent pattern of deficits and spending difficulties, although those vary, and I understand that some areas are substantially worse than Cornwall and others are less bad. There does, however, seem to be a pattern, because there are some hidden costs in rural areas that have never been dealt with effectively.</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/11">The Minister will be aware that there have been studies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland of the costs of providing rural health care, and in each case money has been allocated to try to redress the balance. Studies of comparable areas suggest that in rural areas there is an additional resource need of between 7.5 per cent. and 30 per cent., depending on the nature of the area in question. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all taken steps to adjust funding to take account of those additional rural costs, but England remains the exception. The strategic health authority has recognised that there are some outstanding cost factors facing Cornwall, but its attitude is that the budget for the next three years is fixed, so that argument is still some way down the line. None the less, it is important that the Minister is aware that the health authority has recognised the case.</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/12">The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust report published on Tuesday found that the cost of primary care for a patient in Cornwall was &pound;206 per head&mdash;&pound;25 higher than the national average. Having talked about historical deficits that are not the fault of the people now having to crack them, and having addressed the Government's acceptance that there have been financial shortfalls in the NHS as a whole, which are now being dealt with, we should not find such deficits surprising. There are real issues for the health authority to face in the delivery of care in Cornwall. Perhaps we will say to patients that they must travel to get care, and we will not bring it to them. We could, for example, close down all the cottage hospitals. The previous Secretary of State said no to some closures, precisely because people want care delivered locally, but unless there is a serious diminution of services in the county, costs are likely to remain high.</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/13">The county's health services are doing all that can be reasonably expected of them to deliver the improvements for which the Government are asking. They have imaginative ideas for addressing financial problems in the future. They are delivering exactly the kind of innovative solutions on the ground that will deliver a more efficient service and, more importantly, a better service for patients by helping them in their own homes and in the community, rather than allowing them to end up in emergency care in hospital. In the long run that will mean that more people will be better treated, and for less cost.</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/14">However, health services are now being asked to make huge savings to pay off a deficit for which they were not responsible, and which reflects historical underfunding, whether specifically in rural areas such as Cornwall or more generally. Now that the loan from the county council has fallen through, they can see no solution. Although the strategic health authority has regularly called them in to tell them that they need to do something, the SHA is at as much of a loss as they are about what they should do. There is no difference of opinion between the SHA and the local health community on the subject of making savings and making plans; the health services are simply told, &quot;You have to find the money from somewhere.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/15">The only person to whom we can look now is the Minister, who could offer some help, at least in spreading the time over which the deficit can be paid off. However, I would say that she might take a hand in this, and accept that there is a reason for the deficit, because there has been historical underfunding. The Government themselves, with the vast unallocated funds that still exist within the money allocated to health over the next few years, could write off those historical deficits.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-11-11.37.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/915" speakername="Linda Gilroy" colnum="37"  time="14:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo031111/halltext/31111h03.htm#31111h03_spnew2">
	<p pid=".37.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1274" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I recognise the constructive way in which he made the case for Cornwall, and the fact that he acknowledged the Government's significant investments. He would also probably join me in welcoming the increases in service personnel&mdash;40,000 nurses nationally and some 1,800 in the south-west peninsula. We are all proud of the Peninsula medical school, which is training about 200 of the extra 1,000 plus doctors whom we desperately need if the health service, not just in the south-west but nationally, is to continue to make progress.</p>
	<p pid=".37.0/2">I assure hon. Members that Plymouth is still located on the east bank of the Tamar, and has no aspirations to build an empire in Cornwall; I hope that the same applies vice versa. However, many Cornish constituents look to Plymouth Derriford hospital for acute services, including some 130,000 from the east end of Cornwall. People from throughout Cornwall come to Plymouth for tertiary specialist treatments. As a Plymouth MP, therefore, I take great interest in the impact of Cornish funding on our hospital in Derriford and its many challenges.</p>
	<p pid=".37.0/3">Today, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/702" name="Candy Atherton">my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton)</phrase> is receiving NHS treatment in Cornwall. Some might think it opportune that she is at the front line of the NHS in Cornwall while it is being debated in Westminster; she will have an insider's view of services. Members must be assured, however, that the timing of her appointment depended on the recommendation of the consultant, and is not part of a fact-finding mission for this debate. I spoke to her earlier today, and although she has been experiencing excellent service, the shortage of staff is undoubtedly putting more pressure on existing staff and impacting on services. There has been some freezing of recruitment to try to address the deficit problem in the short term and, as the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell outlined, that is of concern to the local health service.</p>
	<p pid=".37.0/4">The strategic health authority that covers Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly has a challenging three-year programme of reform and redesign of services, which it is working to implement with the health community in Cornwall. That is helped by the significant increase in local funding. As the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell said, it had a plan to clear its non-recurrent debt of &pound;34 million over the next three years, which would have minimised the impact on the delivery of health care. The recovery and efficiency savings required across Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly during 2003&ndash;04 would have been &pound;15.8 million, which represents a 3.5 per cent. saving on the total budget of &pound;453 million. Therefore, the project that is in hand to address the situation is substantial. Everybody has been innovative, and looked in every possible corner to see what can be done.</p>
	<p pid=".37.0/5">I understand from my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne that her constituency&mdash;which is mainly served by West of Cornwall primary care trust, and partly by Central Cornwall primary care trust&mdash;has had its allocations increased by 9.42 per cent. next year, 9.23 per cent. for 2004&ndash;05 and 8.93 per cent. for the following year. Those are healthy increases but the historical debt, which the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell outlined, is the principal problem facing the health community in Cornwall.</p>
	<p pid=".37.0/6">Objective 1 funding is an indication of poverty, which, as my hon. Friend the Minister will be aware, is always accompanied by significant health inequalities. I urge her to take that into account in her consideration of the case laid out by the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell&mdash;which will, no doubt, also be made by his colleagues when they speak.</p>
	<p pid=".37.0/7">Funding of out-of-area treatment is an issue that other hon. Members may refer to in more detail. I understand that the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust is owed &pound;2 million for the treatment of holiday visitors, which has to be claimed in arrears. The number of visitors has been rising in the past two years, and although other counties have a tourist industry, I do not think that any of them are on a greater scale than Cornwall's. Plymouth, too, has experienced increased demand; although numbers are not as high as they are in Cornwall, this year they have been the highest ever, and they were exceptionally high in August. Tourism is a growing part of Plymouth's economy, so this aspect of health funding will be an increasing problem for us, too. I therefore urge my hon. Friend the Minister to consider the way in which that funding is processed to find out whether it can be part of the package that I hope will evolve to address these serious issues in Cornwall.</p>
	<p pid=".37.0/8">As I mentioned earlier, the links between Plymouth and the Cornish health community and economy are strong: 60 per cent. of North and East Cornwall PCT patients go to Derriford hospital. Therefore, any pressure on the Cornish health economy will have knock-on effects at Derriford both in terms of commissioning decisions and because of the links that we know exist at the interface between acute and primary care. If there are difficulties, people can end up being admitted to hospital inappropriately and prematurely, and there can be similar problems on discharge.</p>
	<p pid=".37.0/9">Derriford already faces significant financial challenges. With some assistance from the strategic health authority, it has been able to get the sums down until the gap was narrow enough for it to break even. That was a considerable achievement, and it was part and parcel of the trust's regaining its two-star status this year. People have worked their socks off to achieve that. However, the position continues to be very difficult, with accident and emergency admissions going up significantly. The hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell mentioned that that had also been the case in Cornwall.</p>
	<p pid=".37.0/10">I conclude by asking my hon. Friend the Minister to keep my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne and me fully informed of the steps being taken to ensure that the deficit can be&mdash;and is&mdash;addressed through genuine efficiencies rather than cuts, and to keep the situation under close scrutiny with regard both to the objective 1 issues, which I have mentioned, and to Plymouth Derriford hospital, for the reasons that I have just outlined.</p>
	<p pid=".37.0/11">I am sure that the Minister knows that the strategic health authority is very supportive and is playing a key role in helping our health communities to get best value for money out of the significant extra investment and to meet the challenges in developing and implementing robust delivery plans. In Cornwall and Plymouth, however, the upsurge in accident and emergency work is putting those plans under significant pressure. Spending at Derriford has already increased by 50 per cent. since 1997 and will more than double within the period of the 10-year plan. That is, of course, reflected across health communities the length and breadth not only of our peninsula but of the whole country.</p>
	<p pid=".37.0/12">Will the Minister accept that as an objective 1 area, Cornwall faces particular challenges across the range of public service delivery? Health inequalities associated with high levels of deprivation present particular challenges to primary care trusts that take on a backlog of inherited deficits.</p>

	<p pid=".39.0/1">I am pleased to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/915" name="Linda Gilroy">the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase>. I am sure that all my colleagues in Cornwall will appreciate the trouble that she has taken in examining the issues on both sides of the Tamar. She mentioned that many of my constituents look to Derriford hospital for their tertiary care, and I take to heart her point about the knock-on effect on Derriford. At the north end of my constituency, those living in and around Bude must look to Barnstaple, so the problems cause a knock-on effect in north Devon as well as in Plymouth.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/2">It is a fortunate and happy feature of debates in this Chamber that we often seem to start on a point of agreement, which is a positive advantage of t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1274" name="Matthew Taylor">his assembly. As my hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> said at the outset, we can agree that the problems originated before 1997; we are not suggesting that the problems suddenly developed under this Government. We are dealing with historical underfunding and the deficits that have developed in Cornwall.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/3">I shall briefly underline some of the important points made by my hon. Friend. The problems in Cornwall are probably endemic to several areas in southern Britain. I hope that the Department of Health and the Secretary of State for Health will take the lessons that we in Cornwall have painfully learned in recent months to heart in examining similar problems across southern Britain.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/4">In a curious way, the issue that we are now addressing has far more to do with accountancy than with medicine. I am no doctor, and certainly no accountant, so I would not profess to be an expert who can advise the Minister. However, I hope that she is receiving good advice. I recall only too well going to see the former Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/856" name="Frank Dobson">the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson)</phrase>, with a series of deputations to argue the case for trying to ensure that any new structure in the health service took better account of the need for year-to-year management of budgets and deficits.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/5">The extraordinary regime of strict year-to-year control is ridiculous. It would not be applicable to the private sector, or even to local authorities. It imposes impossible restraints and constraints on the people trying to manage the budgets. Even if we did not have the historical deficit in Cornwall, it would still be an anomaly that the time scale for dealing with any temporary deficit is so short.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/6">My Cornish mother brought me up on the old saying &quot;Penny wise, pound foolish&quot;, and it is extraordinary how often in public life we see people trying to make desperate economies so fast that in the long term they spend more money. That point should be addressed very quickly if the national health service is to survive in its current form. Even with new investment, which we all welcome, it is important to get that balance right. In Cornwall, intense efforts are being made to recruit more permanent staff into the NHS and to bring back people who have had broken careers because of family commitments. It is obviously sensible to economise on the otherwise considerable extra costs of agency and bank staff, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell said, the danger is that, as there is a comparatively small outlay in the short term, the deficit is increased, and therefore that policy, which makes such good sense in the longer term, is at risk.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/7">Both hon. Members who have spoken have made it clear that the members of the Cornwall health community have been working hard together in recent months to deal with the historical problems. I know the team that works in the North and East Cornwall primary care trust very well and I know the team in the Central Cornwall PCT, which serves my constituents in and around Newquay. I also work with and talk to a large number of other people in the health community. All the trusts have been working with the strategic health authority to deal with the problems that have arisen. They were not caught napping by those problems; they have been considering them and trying to deal with them over a substantial period.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/8">I am struck by the substantial work that went into the service modernisation and financial plan&mdash;I am sure that the Minister will be well aware of that. One of the factors that comes out strongly is that the risks of taking short-term decisions for short-term deficit management have been carefully identified. Those risks are considerable, and if the Minister cannot do anything else this afternoon, I hope that she will agree that they are real. If she can indicate where cuts can be made without risk to the current level of health provision in Cornwall, I am sure that we will all be extremely grateful. I challenge her. It is extremely difficult to see whether the cuts that are being considered could be made to the extent that would be necessary to achieve the savings required.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/9">There is another subject that concerns many of us: the level of investment in preventive medicine and long-term planning to reduce the expectations on our health service. Across the parties, hon. Members will, and should, be concerned about that. Whatever investment goes into the health service, we cannot simply have an illness service. The service must be concerned with improving the health of the community. It is all too easy to deal only with the immediate reaction to the emergency that we face, and to make short-term savings, but fail to recognise the longer-term problems.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/10">My hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell and the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton have already referred to some of the special features of the demography of Cornwall. As everyone will know, Cornwall has not only an elderly population, but a growing elderly population. That is partly because of the natural climate and the good food, good air and good environment of Cornwall. It is also because people of Cornish blood have a longevity that is renowned throughout the country. My mother lived to over 100&mdash;and my wife is scared stiff that I might do the same. The serious issue is that it is difficult to plan for that type of long-term development in the demography of any part of the country, and that is certainly an element of the equation in Cornwall.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/11">As has already been said, it is also difficult to plan for the emergencies that may arise where there is a big summer holiday population. My Newquay experience is appropriate in that context. For a few months of the year, the excellent minor injuries unit in Newquay hospital has a work load for which it is difficult to plan. As we all know, it is a great deal easier to budget for a steady demand for a service, whatever that demand might be, than for a service with ups and downs, particularly if there are dramatic ups for a small part of the year. That is certainly true of the way in which we have to provide health care for our visitors. There is a time lag between the provision of that care and our being paid for it through claims made in arrears.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/12">Both hon. Members who have already spoken have said that Cornwall has been trying to do precisely what it has been asked to do by Government in many areas; I hope that the Minister will agree. There have been innovative, intelligent and imaginative attempts made to meet the particular needs of Government policy and National Institute for Clinical Excellence priorities. In some ways, those attempts have been a model of how best to react to those extra demands and expectations.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/13">We are in a very serious situation, and I hope that the Minister takes that seriously. The morale of staff, who have put in so much during recent months to make those improvements, is being badly hit by the current indecision, and the crisis atmosphere hanging over their work and the service that they provide to the community. In the end, the people who will suffer from that are the patients&mdash;the people of Cornwall. I believe that they deserve better, and I hope that the Minister agrees.</p>

	<p pid=".42.0/1">I join o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1274" name="Matthew Taylor">thers in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> on securing this timely and important debate. I shall follow on from the constructive comments made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/915" name="Linda Gilroy">my hon. Friend and by the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1297" name="Paul Tyler">my hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/2">In case we risk being admonished for being ungrateful, for the Minister's sake I shall repeat our gratitude to the Government for the funding of the peninsula's medical schools, the health action zones, the West Cornwall hospital study, to which I shall refer in a moment, and the intervention of the former Secretary of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/856" name="Frank Dobson">the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson)</phrase> in 1998. He implicitly accepted that his Department would assist the then Cornwall and Isles of Scilly health authority with its deficit of &pound;5 million inherited from the previous Administration, and the threats to community hospitals in Cornwall that existed at the time.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/3">I have a few comments to make. Some embellish previous points, but they will largely cover new areas. I hope that I shall be sufficiently brief to allow Front-Bench Members to give the Minister ample time to answer the many questions that have been raised during the debate. First, there is the issue of the strategic view. Where is the strategy for the future of Cornwall's health service coming from?</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/4">I want to elaborate on a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell. In order to get a strategic view for the Cornish health community under the reformed structure, it is necessary to bring together at least eight chief executives: those of the three primary care trusts, the Cornwall Partnership NHS trust, the acute trust and the ambulance trust, the director of social services&mdash;who is essential&mdash;and the head of the strategic health authority. Moreover, as the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton pointed out, Cornwall does not look to those trusts alone to serve all its needs.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/5">As we well know, those on the eastern frontier of Cornwall have to look to their friends on the western side of England, in Plymouth and Barnstaple, to the north and south of that boundary, for assistance. That brings other trusts and services into our consideration of the approach that should be taken in delivering health services in Cornwall. If we are talking about joined-up government, we have to bear in mind that all the money coming from the Government is originally joined up in the Department of Health, but ends up extremely unjoined-up when it arrives on the ground, for social services and trusts. Although the bodies that deliver services across the whole of Cornwall make herculean efforts, they are drawn into a tremendous bureaucratic process to achieve the agreements that are required. Most of the divisions, particularly the primary care trusts, are largely defined by artificial boundaries, because most services are provided across the boundaries, not within them, so they may not be helpful.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/6">That arrangement represents a challenge, rather than a solution, to the problems that we are discussing today. The challenge exists country-wide, but I want to emphasise its impact to the Minister. Chief executives will not complain publicly about it, but complaints and comments are made in private about the way in which the system operates.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/7">In May I asked some parliamentary questions about inherited debt, to which I received some rather delphic responses. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-19">19 May</phrase>, I received an answer to the following question:</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/8" class="indent">&quot;To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what advice his Department has given hospital and health trusts, who ended either or both of the last two financial years in debt, on the relative importance of (a) clearing their debts and (b) meeting government performance targets&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/9">The response from the Minister's fellow Minister of State at the Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/987" name="John Hutton">the right hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton)</phrase> was:</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/10" class="indent">&quot;All national health service organisations have been asked to plan for and achieve financial balance.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/11">Although non-financial targets are part of the equation, there is no clear indication as to whether the balance should fall in favour of meeting targets or clearing debt. It would be helpful if the Minister told us how that difficult balance, which was well described by my hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall, is to be achieved. As we understand it, the health community in Cornwall must balance its books by the end of this financial year. It would be helpful to have a clear indication.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/12">Another question, to which I received a response on the same day, was:</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/13" class="indent">&quot;To ask the Secretary of State for Health which PCTs inherited a debt legacy from their predecessor organisations or authority; and of these how many and which PCTs ended their (a) first and (b) second financial years in debt.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/14">The response, from the same Minister, was:</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/15" class="indent">&quot;Information on primary care trusts inherited debt legacy is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/16" class="indent">The audited annual accounts for 2000&ndash;01 and 2001&ndash;02 show no primary care trust reported an overspend against their revenue resource limit.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-19">19 May 2003</phrase>; Vol. 405, c. 621&ndash;22W.]</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/17">That is reassuring, but the West of Cornwall primary care trust reported to me that one of its most significant difficulties is inherited debt. It would be helpful to have some clear explanation from the Minister of what assessment her Department has made of the impact of inherited debt on the operation and decision making of PCTs, and on the targets that they can set and achieve.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/18">On formula funding, a subject that has been addressed by all hon. Members so far, I point out to the Minister a legislative solution that I introduced in the autumn of 1997. Under the ten-minute rule, I tabled the National Health Service (Equity of Funding) Bill, which proposed a method by which a more transparent arrangement could be put in place to enable the Government to consult the wider community, both politically and statistically, on the difficult issue of establishing an acceptable formula.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/19">Some measures used to calculate the allocation formula have been identified as inappropriate or inadequate for rural areas. The first is the proportion of unemployed people. That is used as one of the variables on the acute need index, but that fails to recognise the poverty in areas such as Cornwall that is caused by low pay. A perennial feature in Cornwall has been much low-paid, part-time seasonal employment, rather than long-term unemployment.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/20">Car ownership is another part of the formula, and has been used as a measure of affluence, but that fails to recognise that in Cornwall people need private cars. Even if they are driving around in old bangers that struggle to pass their MOTs, access to a car is essential if people are to have any kind of quality of life. I do not know how we could measure the number of old bangers, compared with the number of properly functioning cars.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/21">Thirdly, there is the market forces factor, which captures the low-pay features of rural areas such as Cornwall. We have been at the bottom of the earnings league table pretty much since records began&mdash;but the vast bulk of NHS staff are on national pay scales, and that is not properly taken into account.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/22">Additional costs of providing services in areas such as Cornwall are created not only by rurality and the dispersed nature of the population but, particularly in areas such as mine&mdash;west Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly&mdash;by peninsularity. In the acute emergency services sector, we cannot call on neighbouring authorities to the north, west or south to help us out when a crisis occurs. No account is taken in the funding formula of the extra costs of ensuring, or attempting to ensure, that acute services are provided equally in areas where there are geographical challenges as well as the fundamental problem of rurality.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/23">A further problem concerns economies of scale. To avoid sacrificing accessibility by concentrating resources, rural primary care trusts must develop more numerous smaller units. That was exposed in the debate on community hospitals in Cornwall. Yes, logistically it would be good for health managers to have one or two big hospitals and make everyone go to them, but, for historical and geographical reasons, adequate service provision can be made only by using smaller dispersed units. The provision of a network of community hospitals, which has been mentioned before, presents a challenge. As I have said, there was a successful campaign in 1998, when the Secretary of State said that he would assist. He had withdrawn, and did not support, the health authority's plan to close four community hospitals in Cornwall, which was intended to address the problem of a &pound;5 million debt. The Secretary of State told us covertly that he would assist the health community in Cornwall to overcome the debt problem through other means. Unfortunately, rather than addressing the problem of that debt, we have now inherited further debt.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/24">There are higher travel costs, too, and problems of skills mix, which mean that wage costs in rural and dispersed areas are bound to be higher. The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, reflecting the views of the Cornwall health communities, has campaigned for greater funding to reflect the unique nature of Cornwall in terms of rurality and relative poverty and deprivation. Cornwall argues that if it had been allocated a deprivation ratio in line with other objective 1 regions, as the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton implied, it could have attracted an additional &pound;18 million a year on that basis alone. There are significant issues in the formula funding, which must be addressed. I urge the Minister to look seriously at them when responding, and when reflecting on the debate.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/25">There are various impacts. As I said earlier, I am grateful to the Minister and her Department for its assistance in addressing the challenging issue of the future of West Cornwall hospital. I have debated that in this Chamber and on the Floor of the House before. The particular geographical challenges in Cornwall mean that it would be unwise to have only one acute emergency centre there. Leaving aside the historic legacy of the area's geography&mdash;such as why the main hospital was established in Truro and not a few miles further east, and why West Cornwall hospital was established in Penzance&mdash;if we consider the trolley waiting times and the number of ambulances waiting outside the accident and emergency service at Treliske, the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust base in Truro, it is clear that the system cannot manage.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/26">It would be a dangerous folly simply to put all the eggs in one basket, and hope that that basket will manage to provide a service. That is why I am pleased that the Department of Health has put some money into considering how emergency services can be managed using two acute centres. Admittedly, West Cornwall hospital is small, with only 80 beds, but it has a good range of experienced staff, including general surgeons and general medical consultants with wide experience.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/27">West Cornwall hospital has provided a model that allows it to work very closely with the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust in Truro, but it faces difficulties. It requires adequate back-up staff, particularly anaesthetists, on site or at least on call, to ensure that it meets the levels of clinical safety that we all want.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/28">The stakeholder steering group of which I am a member has provided an interim report to the Department, and funding will inevitably be an issue. I hope that the Minister and her Department will reflect on the possibility that the West Cornwall hospital initiative might provide an excellent model for use in other remote rural areas. Funding is clearly an issue, and when the pilot scheme produces its proposals late this year or early next year, Andy Black, who has undertaken the work for Durrow Consultancy, will provide a clear idea of what the Department must do. This debate is not about special pleading for Cornwall; rather, it has emphasised an admittedly challenging case that is clearly reflected in other areas.</p>

	<p pid=".45.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1274" name="Matthew Taylor">my hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> on bringing to the attention of the House and the Minister an issue of great importance to Cornwall. I look forward to the Minister's view on how the problem can be solved.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/2">I echo the comments of my hon. Friends about the increased investment in health. It is welcome, and it has been called for by the Liberal Democrats for a long time. However, because the investment in health has come later than we hoped, several historical problems have to be worked through. Cornwall faces particular difficulties, with the &pound;31 million of debt that has been mentioned.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/3">Health service staff are working very hard; they are attempting to introduce innovative measures to solve problems. Cornwall is one of two areas that are using the most Government-recommended National Institute for Clinical Excellence cancer drugs. This means that treatment in Cornwall is likely to be of a higher quality than it is elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/4">The funding problem stems partly from &pound;31 million of debt and partly from the annual overspend that the Cornwall health economy has extreme difficulty dealing with. The chairman of Central Cornwall primary care trust said:</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/5" class="indent">&quot;We have to face the facts that Cornwall is probably underfunded.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/6">I shall echo some of the points made by my hon. Friends. The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust is reported to expect a &pound;2.2 million overspend this year, although the figure could be between &pound;4 million and &pound;5 million. The overspend is because of clinical issues rather than mismanagement of money. Indeed, an independent review commissioned by the health community showed that the trust is handling its money well.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/7">Some of those problems are caused because the costs of living are high in a tourism area. The cost of employing nurses is great because they need to live in the area and buy homes. It is difficult to recruit nurses. Cornwall has been forced to employ agency nurses, who are more expensive in the long term. Recruitment is becoming increasingly challenging, and it is especially difficult to attract people from outside the county as house prices and the cost of living in Cornwall continue to rise. The overspend on agency nurses at the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust is &pound;210,000.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/8">Additional costs are incurred by emergency admissions, which are 11 per cent. greater than the trust is funded for. It has dealt with an extra 2,386 emergency patients above its funded level. Emergency admissions account for an overspend of &pound;850,000.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/9">The number of visitors to Cornwall has increased by 18 per cent. this year. From April to August, out-of-area treatments&mdash;treating tourists&mdash;increased by 11.4 per cent. The trust has been struggling with the increases for some time. Department of Health rules mean that payments for out-of-area patients are made two years in arrears.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/10">There are other indications that the hospital is struggling to meet targets, such as the Government target for patients to be dealt with within four hours of admission at accident and emergency. We have heard that there are queues of ambulances waiting outside the accident and emergency department. In July, the 90 per cent. target was achieved, but the figure dropped back to 88.3 per cent. in August. The hospital is also struggling to deal with the county's many orthopaedic patients.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/11">It seems to me that the plan to work with Cornwall county council is exactly what the Government want to see. An &pound;8 million loan has been requested, and work has obviously gone into getting the local county council and the health economy to work together, which is exactly the sort of co-operation that one would want between local authorities and health authorities. Because of a legal opinion, which obviously has validity, and the district auditor's belief in that legal opinion, the action has been deemed illegal and has not been allowed to go ahead. That situation must be re-examined. The work was painstaking and was a genuine attempt to sort out the problems caused by the historical debt, but it has not been allowed to progress in spite of what the Government and, indeed, the Liberal Democrats want to see.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/12"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1297" name="Paul Tyler">My hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler)</phrase> mentioned the need for the health economy to get hold of the prevention and public health agenda. It is running to catch up in that area and must be allowed to work on those issues. It will be extremely difficult for it to do so while it must make cuts.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/13">There is a real fear that vital patient services will be cut in this area. It has been reported that the North and East Cornwall PCT has started making cuts, and it is feared that the West of Cornwall and the Central Cornwall PCTs will follow suit. There is particular concern about elderly patients. My hon. Friends mentioned the increase in the numbers of elderly patients in the area, which is a strain on the entire health community.</p>

	<p pid=".47.0/1">I, too, wanted to draw the Minister's attention to the large numbers of elderly patients, but did not get the opportunity to do so. A consultant in Cornwall alerted me to the fact that, for understandable reasons, there is a tendency for people with disabilities or people caring for people with disabilities to move to places such as Cornwall because of the quality of its community support. Cornwall also reports much higher than normal numbers of epileptics and patients with learning difficulties, and historically has had high numbers of people with statemented special needs, many of whom moved into the county. There is nothing wrong with that if the county wants to support them, but that may be a less obvious cost than the one incurred by elderly people moving into the county.</p>

	<p pid=".47.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I was about to point out that area rehabilitation centres for patients who have suffered strokes or Parkinson's disease have closed in Liskeard and Saltash in north and east Cornwall. That may be part of a larger plan, but those patients have lost services.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/2">I was brought up in different parts of the country, but my grandparents came from Plymouth. I grew up in the certain knowledge that the Tamar was much more than a river and that Cornwall was considered a different country from the mainland. As hon. Members have said, Cornwall is an objective 1 area with some of the lowest incomes in the UK. It has large numbers of older people and pockets of great deprivation. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/915" name="Linda Gilroy">the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase> said, it would not have objective 1 status if the community were not deprived. However, Cornwall has not been defined as a priority social need area in the health budget. It would receive an extra &pound;18 million a year if it received the same treatment as other objective 1 areas. The low incomes relative to house prices in the area also exacerbate health inequalities.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/3">The lack of rural public transport is key, as other hon. Members have said. Health care closer to home is important for people in rural areas, as they otherwise have to travel long distances to receive out-patient care. Bearing in mind that none of the towns has more than 25,000 inhabitants, the development of diagnostic and treatment centres throughout the county is vital, as it will enable patients to receive better care nearer to where they live.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/4">Rural areas are very different from urban centres, and the targets devised for them often do not make as much sense. There should be more freedom for areas such as Cornwall to innovate locally, which Cornwall has clearly been trying to do through the local authority and the health authority. Cornish people should also have a greater say in how their local services, including their health services, are run. It is well known that the Liberal Democrats want health services to be delivered locally and to be locally accountable. We have had the potential for providing local solutions to local problems, but the county council and the health community have been prevented from supplying them. I look forward to hearing what the Minister can offer to address the justifiable concerns of my hon. Friends who represent Cornish constituencies.</p>

	<p pid=".48.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1274" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase>. I enjoyed reading the contribution that he made earlier this year, and have also enjoyed his remarks today. This morning, I discussed with the Minister how we could address the historical debt that arose in the Bath area and that greatly affects my constituents in west Wiltshire. I suspect that many of the problems that affect the hon. Gentleman's constituents are also relevant to my neck of the woods, so I feel his pain. We can debate how the debt has arisen because the main thesis that we are discussing is health service debt, but addressing that debt is central to the way in which I hope to see health care developing in my area. I appreciated the remarks the Minister made in that context this morning.</p>
	<p pid=".48.0/2">I am pleased to be making my Front-Bench debut on the subject of health services in the south-west region. I think that we all share some of the problems that have been related today. I caution against focusing overly on debt, and talking of historical debt as if it arose many years ago. The Labour Government have been in power for six and a half years, and perhaps we have to apportion blame for the arising of that debt within that time as well as in the time of the previous Administration. I shall try to do so, but I find the area extremely complicated. I think that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1297" name="Paul Tyler">the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler)</phrase> remarked that he was neither a doctor nor an accountant. I am a doctor, but it does not help me very much with the accounts.</p>
	<p pid=".48.0/3">Trying to define exactly where the debt has arisen, and who is responsible for it, is difficult and probably counter-productive. In many areas of the country, debt relates to financial mismanagement. I accept that that is not the case in Cornwall, but it probably is in my area. The debt has arisen for many reasons, but we need to move on and decide how to move forward. It is very much the case that debt is demoralising to health service managers and the health professionals who see their services being cut and their service planning driven by the need to address debt.</p>
	<p pid=".48.0/4">In my area, a number of health professionals have said to me how they regret the need always to think about where the axe will swing. I would say that the axe tends to swing in a disproportionate sort of way. In my experience, it tends to go for primary and intermediate health care services. One of my worries concerns community hospitals. They are very much under the spotlight in my area at the moment as we consider how we can address a health service debt for which we do not really feel responsible. It was arrived at under a previous health authority, and has little to do with the structures currently in place and even less to do with what one might call democratically accountable structures in the area.</p>
	<p pid=".48.0/5">There is a feeling that in the not-too-distant future we shall see a threat to primary health care services, intermediate health care and community hospitals that disproportionately affects the elderly and disabled. In that context, it is worth while discussing briefly the particular problems faced in Cornwall where, as in the rest of the south-west region, there has been a considerable loss of care home places, which has affected elderly people in particular.</p>
	<p pid=".48.0/6">There have been problems with primary health care, with a number of vacancies in general practice: there are 94 in the south-west peninsula area. I cannot understand why that is the case. I have practised in Plymouth and it is a truly delightful part of the world. I cannot see why GP trainees and people coming into general practice for the first time would not be queueing up to practice in Devon and Cornwall, but there we are. Those vacancies have increased in the region by 31 per cent. since 2002, and the number of applicants has decreased by 61 per cent. since 2000. There is a real problem with primary health care. On top of that, we have the problem of historical debt, which must be addressed. As I have suggested, it will disproportionately affect primary health care.</p>
	<p pid=".48.0/7">If I were to make one small criticism of the contribution of the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell in March, it would be that he perhaps fell into the trap that many Ministers fall into by focusing heavily on the acute sector. Although I am sure that he did not mean to give this impression, he seemed to focus heavily on hospitals rather than on primary health care. That is something of which we as politicians need to be very aware. The Government are right to underscore and underline primary health care in their words, but we sometimes find it very difficult&mdash;particularly when health service managers are instinctively centralising&mdash;to focus on primary health care, which arguably has a greater capacity for increasing the sum of human happiness than the acute sector.</p>
	<p pid=".48.0/8">Another difficulty facing the Government is that they have focused very much on targets, principally in the hospital sector. It is perhaps to be welcomed that we have seen a slight change in emphasis of late away from targets towards more rational measures of health care provision. We must hope that primary care benefits as a result. Several hon. Members have drawn attention to the difficulties of rurality and they were right to do so. Such matters affect my area just as much as they affect Cornwall. Although it pains me to do so, I must say that the Scottish Parliament has perhaps got it right, given how it has reflected the difficulties of the provision of health care in rural areas. Were such matters to be factored into Cornwall, they would wipe out almost half of the debt that we are discussing today.</p>
	<p pid=".48.0/9">Rural areas face particular health care funding challenges. Cornwall has problems with the ambulance service, for example, with the handover time of ambulances, which at the Royal Cornwall hospital is 20 minutes compared with 11 minutes at Derriford. We need to find a cause for that considerable difference. I draw attention to the number of delays between one and two hours for the last quarter for which figures are available. There were 151 such delays at the Royal Cornwall hospital compared with 99 at Derriford and 39 at Taunton.</p>
	<p pid=".48.0/10">We must ask why there is a problem with the ambulance service. We have heard about more general problems in accident and emergency departments and I am led to conclude that they are owed to difficulties with primary care. Recently, the number of emergency admissions has increased by 10 per cent. in Cornwall, Devon and Somerset compared with an increase of 4 per cent. in ambulance calls described by doctors as urgent. The reason for the difference in the two figures is that the general public has access to emergency ambulances, but not to urgent ambulances. They are probably finding difficulty in accessing primary care and calling out ambulances. That brings me back to my original thesis, which is that the historical debts that we face in many areas throughout the country, especially rural areas, affect us disproportionately in primary health care. In many of those areas, primary health care is already under some pressure.</p>
	<p pid=".48.0/11">The hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell was a little generous by not going for the Minister about the drift of moneys towards metropolitan areas. Each week, it seems that a Labour Back Bencher gets to his or her feet and says how grateful he or she is for new investment in hospitals that are principally in metropolitan areas. That undoubtedly impacts on those of us who represent predominantly rural communities. The Prime Minister claimed that his priorities were &quot;schools 'n' hospitals&quot;. He should have rephrased that, perhaps more prosaically, and said instead, &quot;schools 'n' health care&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".50.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1274" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> on securing today's debate, which has covered many issues thoroughly. I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1132" name="Andrew Murrison">the hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase> on his new position. He obviously has a wide-ranging knowledge of the health service, and I am sure that that will stand him in good stead in his new role. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/915" name="Linda Gilroy">my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase> not only on her contribution to the debate, but on managing to bring in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/702" name="Candy Atherton">my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton)</phrase>, which she did so skilfully. We all know that my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne is a great champion of the health service in Cornwall, and we wish her a speedy recovery.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/2">Specific issues have been raised this afternoon, and I shall try to deal with them all in the time available to me. However, before I do I shall take the opportunity to pay tribute to the good work that has been carried out throughout the south-west peninsula. High-quality services have been delivered by dedicated staff, many of whom I had the good fortune to meet when I visited the area recently.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/3">I was extremely impressed not only by the way in which the health service and the social services were working together, which has been mentioned many times today, but by some of the innovative ideas. For example, with my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne, I launched a &quot;telemedicine contraption&quot;, if I may call it that, which links one of the outer centres to the accident and emergency department. That is a very imaginative way of delivering accident and emergency care, to which many hon. Members have referred today.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/4">I have two examples of how performance across the whole region has improved. The Cornwall health community achieved all in-patient and out-patient waiting time targets in 2002&ndash;03, and the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust has improved from one-star to two-star status. Various people, as well as myself, have talked about the accident and emergency services, but achieving 93.6 per cent. on the four-hour target is a tribute to the hard work and dedication of staff. I know only too well that the targets are not achieved unless there is imaginative thinking and real effort by local front-line staff.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/5">Many hon. Members have acknowledged the Government's increased investment in the national health service: 7.4 per cent. a year above inflation until 2007. That is an increase of &pound;34 billion. Central Cornwall PCT has benefited from that, and received &pound;172 million this year, an increase of 9.4 per cent. Many hon. Members have highlighted the changes that that has brought to service delivery in the area. However, I am also aware of the issue of inherited debts and the general financial position in the Cornish health community, which has been raised by hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/6">To backtrack slightly, I should perhaps explain that although the health service has received significant additional resources it is still true that annual expenditure must remain within the resources allocated by Parliament. All NHS organisations must be clear that, having received their fair share of resources, they have a corresponding responsibility to manage them effectively without relying on further help from the centre or from other parts of the NHS. It is now the responsibility of the strategic health authorities both to deliver the overall financial balance for their economies and to ensure that each and every body achieves financial balance.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/7">By shifting the balance of power and devolving to local areas we are trying to ensure that local people find local solutions to local challenges. Some 75 per cent. of the entire NHS budget is now devolved to PCT level. However, where an individual NHS body has a deficit, overspends have to be matched by underspends elsewhere. There is a degree of flexibility in that, as I have said. I do not deny that it is a challenging task in Cornwall, but the local health community, with the support of the strategic health authority, is taking steps to address its financial position. Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly have worked together as a community to produce a service modernisation and finance plan. That is a three-year programme of reform and service redesign, aimed at achieving sustainable services in financial balance, and the delivery of key targets.</p>

	<p pid=".52.0/1">Has the Department assessed whether the cause of the debt that the trusts are experiencing is not any failure on their part, but a failure to anticipate the real costs of providing health services in an area such as Cornwall, which has so many geographical and other challenges?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-11-11.52.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1332" speakername="Rosie Winterton" colnum="52"  time="15:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo031111/halltext/31111h03.htm#31111h03_spnew10">
	<p pid=".52.1/1">Plenty of areas have had similar challenges over the past few years, but they have not necessarily had the same kind of inherited debts as Cornwall. I do not deny that there is a challenge, but the health communities across the south-west peninsula have already supported a package of measures totalling &pound;18 million worth of non-recurrent flexibilities to help offset the one-off debts in the current year. Steady progress was achieved in 2002&ndash;03, and further savings in 2003&ndash;04 are being considered as part of the three-year plan.</p>
	<p pid=".52.1/2">In addition, the health community in Cornwall and across the peninsula will address the &pound;13 million shortfall that still remains in order to achieve financial balance in 2003&ndash;04. I stress that a key part of drawing up the recovery plans has been ensuring that there is as small an impact as possible on direct patient services. That has been attempted in a variety of ways, including reducing recruitment and travel costs and considering home treatment as opposed to in-hospital treatment. I reassure hon. Members that my Department and I are working closely with the strategic health authority to ensure that the &pound;13 million debt is considered carefully&mdash;with all the reassurances that I have given about the effect on patient care and targets&mdash;and I will continue to talk with hon. Members about those issues.</p>

	<p pid=".52.2/1">I thank the Minister for her response. Her visit to Cornwall was welcome, and people appreciated her comments. Following this debate, will she ask the strategic health authority what advice it is giving on how Cornwall should tackle the problem, given the unravelling of the financial plan involving the county council? There is a feeling that the strategic health authority is waving a stick, but not making any constructive proposals about what to do.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-11-11.52.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1332" speakername="Rosie Winterton" colnum="52"  time="15:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo031111/halltext/31111h03.htm#31111h03_spnew12">
	<p pid=".52.3/1">Yes, I certainly undertake to do that.</p>
	<p pid=".52.3/2">I will make two more points before I finish. The issue of the funding formula for rural areas has been raised. The new formula takes account of the effects of access, transport and poverty. The allocation that Cornwall received is some &pound;3.2 million more than the average under the national allocation formula. Finally, I understand what hon. Members have said about out-of-area treatment. Since March 1999, reimbursement for such treatment has been through annual non-recurring payments. However, hon. Members may be aware that the Department is considering ways in which the out-of-area treatment system can be improved. That has recently been consulted on, but I will certainly give careful consideration to the comments that have been made today and take them on board before making any further decision.</p>
	<p pid=".52.3/3">I hope that hon. Members will now be reassured that I am aware that there are real challenges ahead for the NHS in Cornwall. However, I am confident that the health community is responding to those challenges and that significant efforts are being made to achieve financial balance. I hope that hon. Members agree that it is necessary to get that financial balance to achieve sustainable services and to deliver key targets. The strategic health authority will continue to offer support and guidance to the community and individual organisations across the health economy during this period of significant reform, and I will keep in touch with hon. Members about the progress that is made.</p>

	Housing (Milton Keynes)

	<p pid=".54.1/1">The subject of this debate is of enormous importance to my constituents and those of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1313" name="Brian White">my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Brian White)</phrase>. It is also crucial to an area of Government policy; that is, the Government's desire to increase housing growth in the south-east, particularly in Milton Keynes, which is to have 34,000 extra homes by 2016.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/2">The Government's designation of Milton Keynes as a housing growth area has been largely accepted in Milton Keynes, although specific details about where the housing is to be built are still a matter of some concern. Essentially, that is because people in the area understand that the shortage of housing, particularly affordable housing, is detrimental to those on lower incomes and to young people who are growing up in Milton Keynes and who wish to have homes of their own there.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/3">The housing shortage is also a threat to the continued health and growth of the economy. Many local firms already experience difficulty in recruiting people because it is hard for individuals to find affordable housing in Milton Keynes. Indeed, many commute.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/4">Notwithstanding the general acceptance, there is huge local concern at all levels that extra housing must be underpinned by the parallel provision of infrastructure. Past experience in Milton Keynes does not inspire confidence. Of course, it is true that Milton Keynes is a planned community. Its development plan has been largely rolled out and adhered to, but there have been problems, particularly in the provision of schools and health facilities. In the growth areas in the west and the east, the school population has overtaken school building. The consequence is that children are forced to travel to more distant schools. Even some who actually live right next door to a brand new school do so, because brand new schools are often oversubscribed from the start.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/5">On health provision, the hospital never had the planned phase 3. Despite the generous new build that has been funded by the Labour Government, it will not be until the end of 2004 at the earliest that hospital bed provision in Milton Keynes will reach the size warranted by the current population. As the population is growing all the time, it is somewhat like trying to fill up the bath with the plug out. Everyone in Milton Keynes is well aware of the consequences for national health service care of the undercapacity across the board. Naturally, there is a huge fear that further growth will simply reduce for everyone the quality of the public services.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/6">The Government have assured us that infrastructure will be provided in parallel to housing growth, but the structures and mechanisms to achieve that are not clear. I hope that the Minister will be able to put more flesh on the bones and to reassure me, my colleagues and our constituents in her response.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/7">In her written parliamentary answer of <phrase class="date" code="">21 October</phrase>, the Minister described the Milton Keynes and south midlands inter-regional board, which I will henceforth refer to as the inter-regional board. Chaired by her colleague, Lord Rooker, it will</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/8" class="indent">&quot;seek long-term commitment to delivery through high level executive membership from relevant agencies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/9">She also said that it will</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/10" class="indent">&quot;influence the investment of others, which will include both capital and revenue implications of planned growth.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-21">21 October 2003</phrase>; Vol. 411, c. 542&ndash;3W.]</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/11">I encourage the Minister to be more expansive in describing exactly how that would work.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/12">I wish to focus on health and transport, which have been highlighted in the Milton Keynes and south midlands sub-regional strategy. It was drawn up by the three relevant regional assemblies and has been out for public consultation. In that document, transport, health and education were diagnosed as areas that already had an infrastructure deficit.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/13">Past underfunding in the NHS in Milton Keynes meant that in the decade up to 1998 and despite population growth of 2 to 3 per cent. each year in that period, no extra beds were provided at Milton Keynes hospital. That caused huge problems and the diminution of its service.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/14">Despite the generous increase in funding that the NHS has received under this Government, Milton Keynes has been badly hit by two factors. First, the 2001 census underestimated the population of Milton Keynes. The Milton Keynes unitary authority and the primary care trust are involved in continuing correspondence with the Office for National Statistics about that, and following written questions that I have put about the census they will meet soon.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/15">NHS funding is set for a three-year period based on the population in year one. So, even if the population in year one were correct, it would not be by year three. It is very difficult to see how further growth can be accommodated within the normal revenue funding mechanism of the NHS. I am not so worried about capital funding, as it is much easier to see how the NHS executive would respond to increased growth in Milton Keynes through the allocation of capital funding, because that does not depend on a formula. Revenue funding depends on a formula, and it is ill suited to the situation in Milton Keynes.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/16">How will the inter-regional board ensure that the NHS funding system recognises the growth requirements of Milton Keynes, with expanding hospital, GP and community NHS services to meet population growth as it happens, rather than years later? The revenue resources are important, because without them the new capital facilities cannot be opened and staffed.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/17">Transport is the second area of concern. The Milton Keynes and south midlands sub-regional strategy highlighted the weaknesses in east-west road and rail transport links in the region and said that improvements to those links were a priority for supporting and facilitating growth. The east-west rail link from Cambridge to Oxford through Bletchley in the southern part of Milton Keynes has long been supported by an active consortium of local authorities along the route and a virtual all-party parliamentary group, if I can describe it as that, which includes <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/972" name="Kelvin Hopkins">my hon. Friends the Members for Milton Keynes, North-East and for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins)</phrase>. It is a high priority for all three regional development agencies.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/18">There have been improvements to that route, largely in the eastern section that is already funded by the Strategic Rail Authority. A bid is being discussed between the Strategic Rail Authority and the local authority consortium for the reopening of the Bicester to Bletchley section.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/19">The Minister will be pleased to know that I will not outline the detailed business case for the east-west rail link; I have done so on numerous occasions in letters to Transport Ministers and at an earlier Adjournment debate, as have several other Members. The section from Oxford through Bicester to Bletchley is crucial for growth in Milton Keynes and the south midlands. It is an important alternative commuter route from new houses in western Milton Keynes into Bletchley and Milton Keynes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-11-11.56.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1313" speakername="Brian White" colnum="56"  time="15:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo031111/halltext/31111h04.htm#31111h04_spnew1">
	<p pid=".56.0/1">One of the proposed areas of growth is in the villages of Wavenden and Woburn Sands in my constituency, which rely on the Bedford-Bletchley line, part of the east-west line that is to be upgraded. People are concerned about maintaining those communities. Does my hon. Friend accept that transport links are the key to making sure that the communities of Wavenden and Woburn Sands are retained in any development?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-11-11.56.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1249" speakername="Phyllis Starkey" colnum="56"  time="15:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo031111/halltext/31111h04.htm#31111h04_spnew2">
	<p pid=".56.1/1">Absolutely. The use of the railway as an alternative commuter link is incredibly important to encourage development to occur in a sustainable way, so that it does not simply consume all the countryside round about, and to provide a more environmentally friendly way for people to travel to and from employment, which would almost certainly be in Bletchley or Milton Keynes. The rail route is extremely important to that.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/2">The Milton Keynes and south midlands growth area study suggested a new station at Newton Longville to service housing growth in that area, which is on the western side. The Bicester to Bletchley line reopening would also link in with a putative branch line to Aylesbury, where further growth is also planned. Again, many people in Aylesbury are likely to work in Milton Keynes.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/3">The Oxford to Cambridge route is a key part of the infrastructure underpinning the Oxford to Cambridge technology arc, which is a project that attempts to exploit the academic research discoveries of Oxford, Cambridge and Cranfield universities, and indeed of the Open university in Milton Keynes, to generate employment. At the moment, Oxford and Cambridge are very constrained in terms of land availability, whereas in the middle section of the arc, around Bedford and Milton Keynes, land is available for firms generated by the academic excellence of those universities. Obviously, the east-west rail link is a crucial part of that concept, and indeed is crucial to the economic regeneration of Bletchley.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/4">The Strategic Rail Authority has its own funding priorities, although I was interested to note that its latest report entitled &quot;Everyone's Railway: The Wider Case for Rail&quot; says that the SRA will need to look at its role in underpinning the Government's sustainable communities strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/5">The latest bid made to the SRA for the Bicester to Bletchley section is said to be being considered as part of that sustainable communities scheme, but it is not clear what that really means. The SRA will be represented on the inter-regional board; again, I want to know what the mechanism is to encourage the SRA to move transport schemes that underpin growth, such as east-west rail, up its priorities. In particular, can the SRA be encouraged to access developer funding to add to its funding for schemes such as east-west rail?</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/6">Further pressure on the SRA to rethink its priorities has come from the all-party group on rail's report, which highlights increasing road congestion and the effects that road pricing and other traffic management measures can have in encouraging the transfer of traffic from road to rail. The Milton Keynes and south midlands sub-regional strategy points out that there is particularly high traffic growth in our region, and that public transport improvements are crucial to facilitate growth. That, in my view, must make the east-west rail link even more important.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/7">In conclusion, the provision of infrastructure in parallel with housing growth is absolutely crucial if that housing growth is occur. That was recently reiterated by Lord Rooker at a meeting in Milton Keynes, where he was addressing the business community. He said that private development is needed to fund housing, but that will not come in if the infrastructure is not there. It is recognised that it is crucial for the housing growth to occur, but it is also crucial that we retain the support of the population of Milton Keynes for the growth.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/8">I know that the Government appear to recognise the importance of the issue, but I, my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East and our constituents need the reassurance that Government can deliver that infrastructure and in particular that the NHS and the SRA can deliver on their part.</p>

	<p pid=".57.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the debate and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1249" name="Phyllis Starkey">my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> on securing it and on what she said, with which I entirely agree. Some of the housing about which my hon. Friend spoke will stretch as far as my Luton, North constituency and there will be some expansion to the north of it. Even now my constituency is under-provided with infrastructure, particularly transport.</p>
	<p pid=".57.0/2">There is another east-west transport link&mdash;the proposed relief road going across the north of the Dunstable-Luton conurbation through the A5, the M1, the A6 and the A505. That is fundamentally important now, but there have been suggestions recently that it should start at the A5 and stop at the M1. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister seriously to consider giving a higher priority to that relief road and ensuring that it goes right across to the A505. There will then be another genuine east-west trunk link between the centre and the east of England and people will not be required to travel on inappropriate residential roads in my constituency, as they are now.</p>
	<p pid=".57.0/3">If the houses are built without the relief road being built at the same time, serious congestion problems will be caused&mdash;even beyond those we have now. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-11-11.58.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/818" speakername="Yvette Cooper" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister"  colnum="58"  time="15:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo031111/halltext/31111h04.htm#31111h04_spmin0">
	<p pid=".58.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1249" name="Phyllis Starkey">my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> on securing a debate on matter of such importance to her constituents. Milton Keynes is already well established as Britain's fastest growing urban area from the 1970s to the 1990s. Its planning targets require growth of 27,500 dwellings by 2016 and consultation is underway on proposals that would see that target increase to up to 33,900 dwellings. I know that my hon. Friend is a strong advocate for improving the infrastructure in her constituents' area, both currently and in future.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1313" name="Brian White">My hon. Friends the Members for Milton Keynes, North-East (Brian White)</phrase> and for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) have also been strongly engaged in that debate. They are right to argue that as we expand growth in the housing supply&mdash;including affordable housing&mdash;and support growth in the area, it must be underpinned by the necessary critical infrastructure for those communities and the communities of the future.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/3">I should like to talk briefly about the background to the growth area proposals and the recent update, before responding directly to some of the points made by my hon. Friends. Following the identification in 2001 of the Milton Keynes and south-midlands area as one of the four growth areas in the south-east, independent studies have highlighted the considerable potential for further growth there. My hon. Friends are right to point out that that is critical to the local economy in Milton Keynes and the general area, and to the supply of affordable housing. It also has an impact on the needs of the economy and housing requirements of the south-east and London as a whole. That is why the sustainable communities plan published earlier this year, and the progress report released in July, set out a substantial programme for providing the additional housing and infrastructure required to create sustainable communities. That programme included the allocation of &pound;136 million in funding to pump prime the delivery of growth. Milton Keynes has had a history of considerable success in urban development, but we must also recognise that there have been difficulties in the past and learn from those as we expand growth in the area in future.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/4">The level of growth for the area is the subject of an extensive consultation process. As my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West said, the three regional assemblies are taking forward the growth proposals. The draft alterations they have prepared propose that the Milton Keynes area should seek to deliver up to 33,900 dwellings between 2001 and 2016. Under the proposal, new development would be delivered through the completion of developments that are already planned, urban intensification, and the creation of new sustainable urban extensions, which will need to be integrated with the provision of new and enhanced public transport systems and interchanges. The consultation document also sets out what local partners consider to be the key elements of local transport infrastructure that require enhancing and upgrading by 2016 in order to facilitate the growth. That will need to be examined through the regional planning guidance process.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/5">The planning consultation document has already gone through an initial period of public consultation&mdash;including public consultation events. I understand that more than 1,600 submissions were received during the first phase of the consultation. The next phase will be the public examination run by an independent panel, which will be held in March 2004. That panel will scrutinise all the proposals, including those at Milton Keynes, and the wider transport infrastructure required to go with the proposals. Further public consultation on the proposed changes will be undertaken later in 2004, before the alterations are finalised towards the end of 2004. The consultation process has some way to go.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North mentioned the transport issues affecting his constituency. I will discuss that further with my noble Friend Lord Rooker, who is closely involved in the Milton Keynes growth area, but I also point my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North towards the public consultation process, which will give considerable opportunity to consider transport infrastructure issues in more detail.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/7">Sustainable communities are not just about housing. This cannot simply be about building dormitories; it must be about building sustainable communities. That is why we need to look at issues around jobs and economic infrastructure, and around transport and public services, including access to good schools and health facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/8">A number of initiatives are in place, including the additional Government funding to pump prime the delivery of growth, which has already been provided to the Milton Keynes and south midlands growth area. The announcement that was made in July allocated &pound;136 million for specific projects across the three growth areas over the next three years. Part of that money has been used to fund a study of the strategic primary and social health care provision in the Milton Keynes and south midlands growth area. That is crucial for anticipating the kinds of problems that my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West raised with regard to the health care needs of the existing community, and the community in future as growth occurs. There are additional resources to fund similar projects, which we expect to announce shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/9">Transport issues have been addressed. I welcome the fact that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport has announced a package of improvements worth &pound;2.2 billion for the growth areas. They include improving and widening the M1 motorway south of Milton Keynes, the Dunstable northern bypass, and the dualling of the A421 between Bedford and junction 13 of the M1. In addition, there is the Stoke Hammond and Linslade bypass to help improve road links between Aylesbury and Milton Keynes. The Strategic Rail Authority has committed to local upgrades as part of the west coast main line improvements, which will assist Milton Keynes with its north-south links.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/10">I recognise the point that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West and strongly reinforced by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East about the need for east-west public transport links. It is therefore welcome that the SRA is examining the business case for rail services on the western section of this line between Oxford and Bedford, and working closely with the East West Rail Consortium, comprising local authorities and key stakeholders. This is clearly an important issue that will need to be addressed further over the coming months and years as part of the programme to support growth around Milton Keynes.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/11">We have also been working closely with colleagues in the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills to ensure that health care provision and education facilities in the growth areas properly recognise the impact of growth and anticipate it. Those discussions are also under way at ministerial level.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/12">I come now to the important questions raised my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West about local delivery vehicles and the nature of the inter-regional board. As hon. Members know, we have said that we will establish an urban regeneration area for Milton Keynes to be led by English Partnerships and the local authority and in which local partners must play a key role. We have said that new delivery arrangements must involve working in close partnership with Milton Keynes council, the local strategic partnership and the local business community. They also need to facilitate a strong input from those who represent potential private investors and professional bodies concerned with growth and development.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/13">Successful growth across the Milton Keynes and south midlands growth area requires engagement at regional level and a wide variety of local and regional partners. To ensure that that occurs, the proposal is to establish an inter-regional board, to be chaired by my noble Friend Lord Rooker. The function of the board is to support growth, and to influence and encourage integration between the different organisations. The board will not supplant the operations of existing agencies or delivery vehicles. Normally, it would not have its own funds to allocate, and it will focus on high-level executive intervention. We expect it to involve senior representatives from strategic health authorities, regional development agencies, regional planning bodies, the Strategic Rail Authority, water companies and other utilities, the Highways Agency, the Housing Corporation, county councils and unitaries, the Confederation of British Industry, the House Builders Federation and others.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/14">It is critical that my noble Friend Lord Rooker will chair that board. That recognises our strong ministerial commitment to making the board work effectively and engaging the different agencies that need to be involved at a sufficiently senior level. We expect proper senior representation from the organisations, and for them to work closely with each other and my noble Friend Lord Rooker to ensure that infrastructure issues are anticipated early enough. We will continue to raise issues with individual Departments and have discussions across Whitehall and at regional and inter-regional level. We expect to establish the membership shortly. The hope is that the board will hold its first meeting in the new year, and will begin to anticipate its programme of work over the next few months.</p>

	<p pid=".61.1/1">I see no reason why that should not happen. I shall raise that point with Lord Rooker. We recognise the important role that the contributions of MPs play in this process.</p>
	<p pid=".61.1/2">Milton Keynes council has made clear representations to the Government about its unique circumstances and the way in which funding for the council has lagged behind growth. In recognition of that, my noble Friend Lord Rooker has given approval for English Partnerships to contribute additional funding for the council towards the cost of providing amenities for the town. English Partnerships is working closely with Milton Keynes council to define how best to apply the funding of up to &pound;2 million a year over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid=".61.1/3">There is a real opportunity to plan for sustainable growth for the benefit of Milton Keynes. The Government are keen to do everything they can to assist in providing the infrastructure to go with growth, and to enable Milton Keynes to continue to prosper and reform.</p>
	<p pid=".61.1/4">The ethos of the sustainable communities plan is that we should support the entire community, and that we should invest in the infrastructure needed. We are not simply discussing the bricks and mortar of houses, but crucial community infrastructure, so that such areas can thrive in future. I note the points made by hon. Members from the area. I assure them that we strongly agree with the points that they made about the need to ensure that that growth occurs in a sustainable way.</p>

	<p pid=".62.2/1">This takes me back to the days of the Conservative Government when, even though Ministers were present, it was almost pointless them being there. In this case, I have no Minister to talk to, unless perhaps, in the absence of her ministerial colleague, the Under-Secretary of State, Office of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/818" name="Yvette Cooper">the Deputy Prime Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase> will officiate. I trust that he will come, because although I am happy to make my speech for the record, it would be a shame if I were not able to address my remarks to the right Minister. I imagine that, even as we speak, efforts are being made to raise him.</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/2">The debate is about post office closures in central Manchester, a matter that I have wanted to bring to the attention of the House for some time. It is widely accepted that the post office is a vital part of the infrastructure of our fragile inner-city areas. That has been recognised by the Government&mdash;every Minister who speaks about post offices makes the case that they are part of that infrastructure, and that there is a social case as well as a business case for them. Indeed, the Government have accepted that inner-city case to the extent that local government wards in the bottom 10 per cent. of the most deprived wards are given extra consideration&mdash;the normal rule that post office branches should not close unless there is another post office within a mile has been reduced to half a mile. That is an important addition.</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/3">The whole of my constituency is inner city: every ward falls into that bottom 10 per cent., and seven of the eight wards fall into the bottom 1 per cent. I shall illustrate the scale of the problem with reference to one of the wards, Moss Side, where one of the branches to which I shall refer was located. Moss Side is very much at the worst end of the social ladder. Some 70 per cent. of its population have no access to the motor car; and bus use is 2.6 times greater than normal. In the case that I shall discuss, the direct bus services to alternative post offices are bad. Unemployment is 2.8 times the national average, and there are 3.9 times the number of single parents, as well as many elderly people who have great difficulty with mobility and in accessing the normal facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/4">It is in that context that I want to raise the fact that the Post Office has broken its own and the Government's commitment to maintain a proper and adequate framework of sub-post offices. In particular, I shall judge the Post Office against the words of David Mills, the then chief executive, who wrote to me a year ago in October 2002. He stated:</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/5" class="indent">&quot;We have a commitment to our branches within deprived urban areas, especially those with no other branch within &frac12; mile, but you will appreciate that this commitment is impossible to achieve without the goodwill of landlords.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/6">He also stated:</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/7" class="indent">&quot;We cannot afford to keep failing branches open since Post Office Ltd suffered a loss of &pound;163 million in the last financial year.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/8">That is fine, but I assume from that comment about failing branches that if branches are successful they should remain open. I also want to raise the issue of whether the Post Office adequately consults the public. The Post Office miserably fails the half-mile test, the viable business test and the consultation test, and it has a robotic approach to post office closures.</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/9">Seven post offices have closed in my constituency, but I will refer to only five. I will not mention the closures on Sackville street, which is in a prosperous area of my constituency, or in Rusholme in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1009" name="Gerald Kaufman">the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/10">I will refer first to the post office in West Gorton, which closed in 2001 when the sub-postmaster retired. When he left, the Post Office promised that it intended to fill that sub-post office with another sub-postmaster, but that promise has never materialised. The Post Office has not found an alternative sub-postmaster, and a proper search for a replacement has never been considered. What is more galling is that I put it to the Post Office that a local shopkeeper was prepared to upgrade his property to act as a sub-post office, but that offer was treated with absolute contempt, with no reasons given for refusing the offer. Many elderly people live on the estate, and the nearest post office is about 1.5 miles away. That is way beyond the half-mile limit that the Post Office uses in that area, and even beyond the one-mile limit that it uses in non-deprived urban areas. West Gorton seems to have disappeared from the post office list. It has never been formally announced to me that the post office is closed; it is simply no longer open.</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/11">The Post Office originally claimed that the post office on Lower Oldham road was within half a mile of other post offices. I arranged to test that and, when somebody walked to the nearest post office with a pedometer, the distance was 0.7 of a mile. Despite the fact that we proved beyond reasonable doubt&mdash;walking the distance is a reasonable way of assessing the distance that elderly people must travel&mdash;the Post Office insisted that it was right and the sub-post office was less than half a mile from the nearest post office. I do not know what we have to do to prove that to the Post Office. Does consultation mean that, if it is demonstrated that the Post Office's rules are being broken, it stubbornly maintains its decision to close? People local to Lower Oldham road still feel a sense of injustice, particularly the elderly who find it difficult to walk the longer distance.</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/12">The Post Office originally claimed that the nearest post office to Clayton Bridge post office was within half a mile. I pointed out that the nearest post office was 0.6 of a mile away and in the end it accepted that. However, there was no good grace in its recognition. A Post Office representative wrote to me about the decision regarding the future of the branch. The letter read:</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/13" class="indent">&quot;I have received a number of comments from customers and local representatives . . . These centred on how such a permanent closure would affect the community and local businesses. Concern was also expressed that the disabled and pensioners would find the alternative branches too far away.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/14">The letter continued:</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/15" class="indent">&quot;Although I believe that other branches nearby are suitably located, offering the right services to meet the needs of the local community, I have carefully reconsidered my original decision&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/16">There was no recognition that the Post Office had simply got the distance wrong, or an apology. It even reaffirmed that other branches were suitably located when clearly, by the standards that the Government asked the Post Office to put into practice, they were not.</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/17">I welcomed with good grace what I saw as a reprieve for the Clayton Bridge post office. However, in the months following, the Post Office did little to find new premises. It finally wrote to me saying that it intended to close Clayton Bridge permanently, as it had advertised the vacancy but no alternative was available. As a vacancy for a new property could only be advertised locally, I asked if local people knew about it, but they told me they were unaware of it. Once again, by its own test, the Post Office badly let down the community of Clayton Bridge.</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/18">The Post Office wrote to me about the university precinct post office, saying that its proposal to relocate that office had been made to secure the long-term provision of the post office services in a new outlet. The Post Office told me that as it was a relocation, not the closure of a post office, the rules about distance no longer applied. It said:</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/19" class="indent">&quot;The assurances that had been given to ensure, wherever possible, that we will not close any post offices in urban deprived areas unless there is another branch within half a mile were given as part of the commitment to our Network Reinvention programme. However, our proposal to relocate University Precinct is not part of that programme but is part of our day-to-day management of our nationwide network of offices.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/20">In other words, as long as the Post Office says that it is not a closure, but another kind of restructuring, it can ignore all the rules that the Government asked it to abide by and close post offices willy-nilly, despite the fact that many elderly people cannot travel the 0.7 miles to the relocated post office.</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/21">What makes the situation even more annoying is that the existing owner of the property that had housed the sub-post office wanted to continue to offer the Post Office a lease, but it refused to continue negotiations with the landlord, and in doing so seriously disadvantaged the traditional users of the post office.</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/22">However, perhaps the most perplexing decision was that concerning the Moss Side post office. The story is almost bizarre: local rumour said that the post office was due to close. I contacted the Post Office; I will not mention the names of those involved, although the names of some of the senior officials should be in the public domain, so that when they are put in the stocks with dunces' caps on their heads they can be properly pilloried. I give thanks to my colleagues who have been so supportive of me in this Chamber.</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/23">The Post Office originally denied that it had any intention to close the Moss Side branch, saying that the rumours about its closure were false. Later that day, when my office queried what the Post Office said, because local people insisted that the branch was to close, it said, &quot;Yes, there is a temporary closure.&quot; That seemed to be all right; as I had complained about its failure to get its act together, the Post Office wrote to me saying that it was not such a big deal. It said:</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/24" class="indent">&quot;We are working hard to explore ways to restore normal services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/25">It said that there were a number of branches within a mile of that sub-post office, but once again, the constant reference to a mile denies the fact that all the sub-post offices in my constituency should be measured by the half-mile test, which the Minister agreed with the Post Office and which the Post Office so cavalierly ignored, as shown in my earlier examples.</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/26">I was delighted to receive a letter from the Post Office on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-03">3 July</phrase> saying,</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/27" class="indent">&quot;We are currently developing a proposal for the future of this branch and hope to take this to public consultation in the near future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/28">That delighted local people, as it gave them great heart. They thought that the post office had been closed only temporarily and was on its way back. However, three weeks later the Post Office wrote to me saying that its proposal for the future was to close the branch. I replied, complaining bitterly and accusing the Post Office of extreme bad faith and dishonesty, because, de facto, it allowed the public to be deceived. I think that that is lying, in the parlance of the outside world. I can say that about the Post Office and its senior managers because, I am afraid, that was the reaction induced in me. That decision was very unfair. I then received a letter from a senior Post Office manager, who said:</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/29" class="indent">&quot;The phrase 'currently developing a proposal for the future of this branch' could, I accept, easily be interpreted to mean that we were committed to keeping the branch open. Although we were open-minded in our approach to the issue, closure was always one of the options.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/30">Of course closure was always one of the options, because in every case in which the Post Office has consulted in my constituency, it has ended up closing the branch that it originally targeted, although it has temporarily wavered.</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/31">In the Moss Side case, there has been a slight reprieve. The Post Office wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="">29 September</phrase> saying that</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/32" class="indent">&quot;the proposal to close this branch will be deferred until the implementation of the plan in this area&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/33">which takes place in April next year. It omitted to say that it was keeping that post office temporarily closed, so the fact that the branch had been given the reprieve made no practical difference. It made no difference whatever to the elderly people, or to the 85 per cent. of that post office's customers who use it to claim benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/34">In summary, I am extremely frustrated by the robotic and inconsiderate way in which the Post Office is closing branches in my area. No test of financial viability&mdash;as in Moss Side or in other areas where sub-postmasters are willing to take on the business&mdash;seems to make any difference to the Post Office. Given an excuse to close, it closes. It goes through a formal consultation process, but that makes no difference to the result. The half-mile test that the Minister negotiated with the Post Office is cavalierly and regularly ignored. In the end, the many people who depend on the Post Office, both as a business and in its role as a part of the social fabric&mdash;a role that the Government recognised in the negotiations&mdash;are ignored by that very Post Office. People of the inner cities are treated with enormous contempt.</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/35">I raise the matter today because I would like some retrospective justice and a review of some of those Post Office decisions. I know that traditionally the Government take an arm's-length view, but the Minister is responsible for policy on the Post Office and he ought to ask it to justify the examples that I have given, rather than simply to comment on them. It needs to justify those examples properly because next year, when my constituency, like all other constituencies, is faced with the reinvention programme, the Minister will have&mdash;I assure him of this&mdash;pressure from me once more if the Post Office handles the issues in the same contemptuous way.</p>
	<p pid=".62.2/36">I hope that the Minister will contemplate what I have said. Perhaps he could write to me on the detail that we have had to race through today. I hope that he can give me some comfort that next year the process will be handled in a way that is satisfactory for my constituents.</p>

	<p pid=".66.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1052" name="Tony Lloyd">my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> on securing the debate. I apologise to him for my delayed arrival. I am grateful to the Under-Secretary of State, Office of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/818" name="Yvette Cooper">the Deputy Prime Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase>, who remained longer than she might otherwise have done.</p>
	<p pid=".66.0/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central made some important points and he has shown a lot of interest in this subject over a long period. He has raised his concerns with me on a number of occasions, and I agree with the points that he made about the importance of the post office network to communities in constituencies such as his&mdash;in some ways similar to my constituency&mdash;as well as those in rural areas, where there has sometimes been more focus on such matters. The Post Office plays an important role in inner-city areas as well. I completely agree with the point that he made on that.</p>
	<p pid=".66.0/3">That is the background to our determination to maintain a viable nationwide network of post offices&mdash;they are so important as a focal point for their communities, particularly for elderly customers and for people who are less mobile than others. I will pick up some of the specific points that he made about the branches in his constituency. However, it is worth setting out the background to the changes happening in the post office network.</p>
	<p pid=".66.0/4">In 2000, the performance and innovation unit produced a report that was widely welcomed and that has formed the basis for the Government's policy on the post office network since then. We accepted all its recommendations. It was also widely welcomed by the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters and others. Among its recommendations was that, if the Post Office decided that fewer offices were needed in some urban areas because of there being less business for the post office network than in the past for a variety of reasons, the Government should consider providing funding to ensure that affected sub-postmasters could be compensated adequately for the loss of their business.</p>
	<p pid=".66.0/5">Last November, following parliamentary approval of the funding, Post Office Ltd. initiated its urban network reinvention programme, which will be taken forward in Manchester by the exercise to which my hon. Friend referred. The closures that he mentioned in the debate are mainly outside that process. The pattern for the whole area will be set out in a proposal by the Post Office before long.</p>
	<p pid=".66.0/6">I wish to pick up particularly on the half-mile issue to which my hon. Friend referred. At present, there are 17,000 branches of the Post Office throughout the country. That is more than all of the banks and building societies put together. More than 1,000 urban sub-post offices have at least 10 other post offices within a mile. That is reflected in the difficulties in my hon. Friend's constituency. Sub-postmasters have been finding it increasingly difficult to earn a reasonable income from their business and they have been leaving the network.</p>
	<p pid=".66.0/7">If action had not been taken under the reinvention programme and had the Post Office not taken it forward in the way that it has, there would be an unmanaged decline in the network and many serious gaps would open up. The examples to which my hon. Friend referred are illustrations of that starting to happen. I regard the urban reinvention programme as an alternative to that. It is a properly managed process that recognises that there is no longer the volume of business going through the post office network that there was in the past. I recognise equally that we must ensure maintenance of a network of post offices that serves each part of the country.</p>
	<p pid=".66.0/8">Some two thirds of the urban population live within half a mile of two or more post offices. Many of those offices have been struggling to survive. My hon. Friend knows that the Post Office must make decisions about the operational matters of its own account, a policy that has been established for a long time. The closures that have been mentioned in the debate have happened for various reasons, but it is important that we protect and safeguard the network throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid=".66.0/9">We asked the company to make sure that, other than in exceptional circumstances, its urban reinvention proposals should not include offices within the 10 per cent. most deprived urban wards in the country where there is no other post office within half a mile. The deprived urban post office fund has been established to help offices in urban, deprived areas thought to be at risk of unplanned closure. However, the Post Office is not in a position in which it can guarantee that it will not close offices in urban, deprived areas or, for that matter, in any other part of the network, for reasons that are outside its control, such as where there have been contractual problems or a sub-postmaster has retired and the company has not been able to find a suitable replacement. I understand that that has happened in several offices to which my hon. Friend referred.</p>

	<p pid=".68.0/1">Of course the Post Office says that it is right. The problem is that there is no evidence to that effect. In one case, no one knows where the Post Office has looked for alternative property. In another case, when I was prepared to introduce those involved to a viable local business undertaking another activity, which was willing to take on the post office business, it simply dismissed that out of hand. The test of viability, especially in the latter case where the next post office is one and a half miles away, should have kicked in, but the Post Office did not want to know.</p>

	<p pid=".68.1/1">I am concerned to hear those points, but I was pleased to hear my hon. Friend say that the Post Office has deferred the decision on Moss Side and that that branch will be considered when the Post Office announces its area plan for Manchester, Central next May or June. He said that he took that as a positive sign.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/2">I shall comment a little on the other branches that my hon. Friend mentioned. I am told that in West Gorton the sub-postmaster simply wanted to leave, following a number of armed attacks on that branch. I am assured that a good deal of effort was made to find a replacement there, although I take my hon. Friend's point that one simply has to accept the Post Office's word for that. I gather that there were a number of contractual difficulties at the Clayton Bridge branch on Holyrood street and that, again, the Post Office was unable to find a suitable replacement. In the case of the university precinct branch, there were some accounting irregularities, and the lease expired. For some time, the branch had been run by a temporary sub-postmaster, but the company formed the view that it was becoming increasingly commercially unviable. It opened a new outlet at Wilmslow Park, which I understand is some way away&mdash;about three quarters of a mile&mdash;but has much better facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/3">The exercise through which we are now going is partly aimed at the goal, which the PIU report set out, of bigger, brighter, better Post Offices with improved facilities, where there has been serious investment, often for the first time in a long time, to make them more welcoming and attractive places where people will want to go. Increasingly, we want to see the Post Office providing banking services in communities such as those that my hon. Friend and I represent. We have invested &pound;500 million in the technology needed for the Post office network to offer its customers banking services, which, among other things, will contribute towards tackling financial exclusion.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/4">I shall say a little on how we see the process of urban reinvention unfolding between now and the end of next year, when it should be complete for the whole country. Proposals were initially focused on single offices known to be most at risk because of poor viability. That was to minimise the incidence of unplanned closures of the kind that have caused such great difficulties in my hon. Friend's constituency. However, the Post Office accepted that much uncertainty about the future shape of the network arose from that approach, so it has now undertaken to produce its proposals on an area-by-area basis using each parliamentary constituency or groups of constituencies. My hon. Friend will agree that that approach is better, because we can all see where that process is leading, rather than simply having one branch considered at a time. In its recently published report on the post office network, Postcomm has commended the Post Office for that response to the concerns raised. The Select Committee on Trade and Industry also welcomed the different approach.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/5">I understand that other than for the Moss Side branch that we have discussed, there have not yet been any proposals under the programme to close branches in my hon. Friend's constituency. It is proposed to introduce next May or June the area plan for Manchester, Central, along with those for Manchester, Blackley; Manchester, Gorton; and Manchester, Withington. Producing an area-wide plan in that way will bring the benefit of providing a clear view of the level and location of service provision at the end of the urban reinvention programme in a given area, while also providing the opportunity to understand the views of hon. Members and local authorities on those wider plans. That will be an important tool in ensuring that the offices in my hon. Friend's constituency are viable, will be there for the long term and are in the right locations for his constituents. It will also help to reassure sub-postmasters about their prospects. I hope that it will also guard against the kind of unplanned closures to which my hon. Friend referred. I entirely understand his concerns about those.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/6" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/7" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at half-past Four o'clock.</p>
