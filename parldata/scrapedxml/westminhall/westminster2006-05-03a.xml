	<p pid="a.447.3/1">Sir Alan, I have no registrable interests to declare, but I am chairman of the Britain-Nepal parliamentary group. In that capacity, I was asked to lead a parliamentary delegation to Nepal recently, which was funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Our visit in March this year followed on from a visit in January 1996, when I led the last Inter-Parliamentary Union delegation to Nepal. The Nepal we found in 2006 was very different indeed from the one to which I went 10 years previously.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.3/2">In 1996, there was a flourishing, working, multi-party parliamentary democracy in Nepal and, as far as I am aware, no political detainees in that country. The media were conspicuously free. The Maoists were unheard of and their insurgency had not started at that point, although it began later that year. The king, now sadly the late King Birendra, was universally respected and admired in the country for bringing it to a new condition of constitutional monarchy and genuine multi-party parliamentary democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.3/3">The Nepal we visited in March was sadly wholly different. Parliament had not sat for four years, and an unknown number of people were subject to political detention, including Mr. Madhav Nepal, the leader of one of the major political parties, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist). Notwithstanding its name, that is a democratic party. The Maoists were in effective territorial control of approximately three quarters of the country. In private and, in part, public conversation, the current king, King Gyanendra, was subjected to a degree of venom and vitriol that made me wonder whether I was going about in late 18th-century France.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.3/4">As the Foreign and Commonwealth Office predicted, King Gyanendra declined to see us, although we noted with a degree of wry amusement that in the week we were in Nepal he none the less, according to the <i>Himalaya Post</i>, found time to receive a special envoy from Fidel Castro at the same time that he declined to see a delegation from the mother of Parliaments.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.3/5">Should the Minister feel that his Department's funding was in any way not put to good use, I assure him that we were able to strike at least one solid blow for the restoration of parliamentary democracy. We paid a call on Speaker Ranabhat, who led the last Nepalese IPU delegation to this Parliament in 1999. Although Speaker Ranabhat was deprived of his Chamber, he was still the official Speaker. I asked him whether he would kindly show his Speaker's Chair, which is beautifully carved in British oak and was a gift from this House to the Parliament of Nepal in 1992, to the British parliamentary delegation. He kindly agreed to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.3/6">We went along to the House of Representatives, and the forbidding steel-grille gates were unlocked and opened. The large outer doors were also opened, and in we went to see the Chamber covered in dust sheets. That has been Nepal for the past four years, with its parliamentary democracy covered in dust sheets. Speaker Ranabhat took his Chair, and we stood on either side of him. The Minister will be glad to know that that picture received front-page coverage in every leading newspaper in Nepal&mdash;in the English and, more importantly, Nepalese languages&mdash;and appeared under the headline, &quot;After 4 years, Ranabhat sits on Speaker's chair&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.3/7">I do not think that any of us who went to Nepal thought in our wildest and most optimistic dreams&mdash;there were no huge grounds for optimism&mdash;that within five weeks to the day of our departure from Kathmandu, the Speaker's Chair in the House of Representatives in Nepal would be occupied for the real opening of the Parliament. That, of course, took place last Friday. The credit for it lies with one group and one group alone&mdash;the people of Nepal, most particularly the 100,000 or so who took to the streets in Kathmandu and the thousands more who took to the streets in other towns and cities all over Nepal to demand the restoration of their Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.3/8">Those were the people who had the courage to defy the curfew, the risk of arrest and imprisonment, and the bullets, although tragically some 14 people were killed. I would like to say that we in the House salute the people of Nepal for the bravery and determination they have shown and for their achievement in getting their Parliament restored to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.3/9">The restoration of Parliament in Nepal is, I suspect, just the beginning; it is certain that the hardest part still lies ahead. Last week the King gave in, but the Maoists will be a far harder nut to crack. They have a stranglehold on the country that is based on brutality, fear and intimidation. That stranglehold, as I have said, extends territorially to at least three quarters of Nepal.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.3/10">We received a striking illustration of the nature of that stranglehold at our meeting with the chief district officer in Biratnagar. He told us that, as a result of intimidation of school management committees and head teachers, the Maoists had a total ability to walk into any school in his district, with the exception of those in the immediate environment of the city of Biratnagar, take over the classrooms and spew out their propaganda to the children and students. To translate that into UK terms, that would be approximately the same as a United Kingdom in which the whole of Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England with the exception of London, the Birmingham conurbation, the Manchester conurbation and Newcastle were under Maoist control.</p>

	<p pid="a.448.0/1">I am sorry to interrupt my right hon. Friend, but I am sure that he would like the rest of that conversation with the chief administrator to be put on record. We were told not only that the Maoists could access schools at will, but that teachers had to pay a month's salary in extortion to them and that most small businesses had to pay them protection money.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.449.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1877" speakername="John Stanley" colnum="449"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h01.htm#60503h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.449.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who is absolutely correct. I shall refer to that dimension of Maoist influence in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/2">The real winners from last week's events, welcome though they were, stand to be the Maoists. They can claim, with real credibility, that the king's capitulation was due to them and the crowds that they brought on to the streets, not to the leaders of the democratic parties. They have also got themselves into a pivotal position, and Nepal's political and democratic development will depend on what they are or are not prepared to agree to.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/3">As of now, the Maoists have given up nothing of substance in return. They have given no assurance that they will not resume their murder, torture and brutality or their exercise of fear and intimidation when the ceasefire that they announced ends in three months. They have given no assurance that the financial extortion to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase> referred will not continue. That extortion extends to all parts of the country and, we were told, even to payments to Gurkha pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/4">The Maoists have given no assurance that they will not resume their blockades, which emptied the markets in Kathmandu and precipitated a business and food crisis in the capital in a matter of days. Finally, they have given no assurance that they will lay down their arms and, most critically, that they will allow free and fair elections to take place.</p>

	<p pid="a.449.1/1">During that recent visit to Nepal, did my right hon. Friend find out whether the Maoists are sponsored or supported in any way by the authorities in neighbouring China?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.449.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1877" speakername="John Stanley" colnum="449"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h01.htm#60503h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.449.2/1">All the conversations that we had during our visit, and all those that I had previously, indicate that this Maoist group, rather like Shining Path in Peru, receives no backing from the Chinese Communist party.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.2/2">Nepal is on a knife edge between a democratic or a Maoist outcome. As of today, it is far from clear which way Nepal will fall, and it would be a brave person who said that a democratic outcome was assured. The political democratic leadership is relatively aged and, it must be said, somewhat tainted by the past. Central Government institutions are weak, and we must always remember that Nepal has the most favourable terrain in the world for terrorist operations. In this country, someone in need of help and protection will receive it in a matter of minutes, but in the hills of Nepal it will not arrive within minutes or even hours&mdash;it is several days' walk away. That factor alone puts the hill people and, indeed, many others in Nepal at the mercy of the Maoists.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.2/3">As a sovereign country, Nepal is of course responsible for determining its own destiny, but there is little chance of a successful long-term democratic outcome if the country is left unaided and unsupported by its friends and the international community. Britain is in a unique position among the members of the international community. It is Nepal's longest-term friend, and that friendship goes back nearly 200 years, in which time Nepalese soldiers&mdash;the Gurkhas&mdash;have served in the British armed forces with conspicuous distinction, in peace and war. Britain is the European Union member state with far and away the closest relationship to and greatest influence in Nepal. It is also much more trusted there than either of Nepal's most immediate big neighbours, China and India.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.2/4">The central question facing Nepal today is whether the hugely welcome restoration of parliamentary democracy will be permanent or simply a transitional phase towards a Maoist state. If that were the outcome, it would be a tragedy for the people of Nepal. Almost as significantly, however, it could have profound regional consequences because Nepal is surrounded by three large neighbours&mdash;India, Pakistan and China&mdash;all of which are heavily armed and, of course, nuclear powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.2/5">I do not for a moment suggest that the British Government can single-handedly prevent such an outcome, but they must do their utmost to ensure that a Maoist state is not the end result for Nepal. At this critical moment for Nepal, and in the light of our 200-year friendship, the British Government need to give Nepal a new and altogether higher priority. The people of Nepal deserve nothing less from us.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.450.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1637" speakername="Tom Levitt" colnum="450"  time="009:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h01.htm#60503h01_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.450.0/1">I rise both to compliment <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1877" name="John Stanley">the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)</phrase> and to complement what he has said in his speech. I compliment him on leading the delegation, on which I was proud to serve, and I have a feeling that the other Members who served on it, including the hon. Members for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) and for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway) will want to pay tribute to him for leading it with courage, strength and great passion. Indeed, his feelings about Nepal are sincere and go back a long way.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/2">I was very moved by what I saw on our visit, which was my first to the country, and I want to draw a few conclusions to complement what the right hon. Gentleman said. I should say for the record that we spent some of our time looking at aid issues and that I am a Parliamentary Private Secretary at the Department for International Development. My comments today, however, are about the political situation in the Foreign Office context.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/3">Before we went there, Nepal was showing all the signs of a failing state. It is an incredibly poor country, with per capita income at $260 a year and falling. Indeed, the figure might be only as high as that owing to the value of remittances, which come from the perhaps one quarter of all Nepalese people who now live outside the country. That says something about the situation inside the country. Some 60 per cent. of the economy of Nepal is agricultural, but that means that about 30 per cent. of the economy relies on tourism. The five-star market, as it is called, has completely collapsed. I read from figures published this week that in April alone there was a 2.2 per cent. fall in the value of the tourist economy in Nepal, which is obviously dependent on that contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/4">Nepal is also a country where there has been overt and covert censorship in very large measure. It is fortunate that we can mark today as world press freedom day, and I should like to draw attention to one or two conclusions that the Federation of Nepalese Journalists has reached about the past 15 months. Over that time, during which the king had absolute power, two journalists were killed, 88 were tortured, 11 were abducted, 282 were attacked and 707 were arrested. Similarly, 39 journalists were displaced and 250 sacked, and 108 newspapers were forced to halt publication. The Nepalese Government also blocked at least 25 news websites, raided private radio stations and banned broadcasting of news from all stations for a few months, until the supreme court stepped in to allow FM stations to broadcast news again.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/5">Not all those incidents were the responsibility of the Government of Nepal, however. The figures released by the Federation of Nepalese Journalists suggest that the Maoist forces killed at least two journalists, and assaulted and threatened many others over a 10-year period, and have continued to bar them from reporting freely from the Maoist stronghold, even though the leaders of the Maoists have time and again expressed their commitment in principle to respecting press freedom.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/6">According to one international organisation, Reporters Sans Borders&mdash;I am not sure what language that title is supposed to be in&mdash;more than half the cases of news censorship worldwide in the past year were in Nepal, with 567 incidents reported and 145 journalists physically attacked or harassed. A country where there has been no press freedom over the past 15 months or so is a difficult country for the outside world to explore.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/7">We also know that about 3,000 people were detained without trial for various durations, leading up to the abortive local elections in February. I would be interested to hear any news from my hon. Friend the Minister about whether people continue to be held without trial or whether more have been released&mdash; Mr. Nepal, who is one of the high-profile prisoners, has been released, but information about others would also be welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/8">To return to the list of hallmarks of failing states, there have also been several instances of soldiers and members of the armed police being arrested for crimes such as robbery. The ability of the Royal Nepalese army, which is one of the biggest armed forces in the world, successfully to control its vast number of new recruits is questionable.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/9">Over the period of the king's autocratic rule, we also saw the systematic replacement of non-sympathetic members of the supreme court. I understand that the new Nepalese Government have already said that that process will stop. However, I hope that it will not only stop but be reversed and that an objective means of appointing members of the supreme court in Nepal will return.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/10">Over a long period, there were also the bhands&mdash;or transport strikes&mdash;which seemed to become more and more potent, and were used by more than one element in what passes for the political process in Nepal. One of those strikes ended just before we arrived there. Nevertheless, when we travelling out to Biratnagar we saw minibuses and buses that had been newly torched and trees that had been newly felled over roads. I subsequently discovered that a gunfight between Maoist forces and the Royal Nepalese army took place in the village close to the one that we visited while we were there. Fortunately, we did not hear it or get close, but as the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling and the hon. Member for Cotswold mentioned, there was clearly a lot of intimidation going on, even outside the strikes.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/11">Throughout much of April we saw 100,000 dissenters on the streets, as the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling said. It is reported in the news today that the Nepalese Government have announced that 19 people, rather than 14, died at the hands of the military and the armed police during the days of dissent and demonstration.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/12">In response to the developing situation over the past year or so, Britain, like other countries across the world, has quite rightly stopped supplying lethal military aid to Nepal. We have continued to provide Nepal with training in human rights issues for military staff, as well as anti-mine technology and training in its use. No one would argue with that, but we need to consider whether&mdash;and if so, how quickly and in what quality&mdash;any military aid from Britain would be increased to Nepal, particularly as its problem is an internal one, rather than one from an external aggressor. The situation is made even more complex by the fact that the very people from whom protection is required are in some form of alliance with the democratic parties. I therefore suspect that the Minister will say that there is no likelihood of any early restoration of military aid in its previous form.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/13">There is a sad situation in Nepal, which is changing but getting no less sad. The threats are no less than those that the right hon. Gentleman described. In retrospect, the week that we were there was crucial for King Gyanendra. It was probably his last chance to oversee a peaceful transition of power back to the forces of democracy in a way that could have guaranteed the continuation of the constitutional monarchy. Much has happened in the past 18 months to destroy trust in the king and the position of the monarch, in his relationship not only with politicians but with the people themselves. I have mentioned the hallmarks of the failing state, many of which followed from the king's autocratic rule. They were not chance happenings but deliberate actions by the king and those acting on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/14">While we were in Nepal, the leaders of the seven-party alliance were trying valiantly to keep the lid on popular republican sentiments. My guess is that in the long term they will be seen to have failed in that. I have a sneaking suspicion that the king might no longer be in office 12 months down the road. That might be the outcome of the constitutional settlement that is now being sought. I believe that Nepal will probably fail as a constitutional monarchy because the king hung on to power for far too long, although I admit that there were very difficult circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/15">We know that the Maoists have declared a three-month ceasefire, which is welcome, but it should be regarded with some suspicion, not least because it does not cover the likely date for a general election. The monsoon season will start shortly so, as we heard from the Nepalese ambassador with whom we had a positive meeting yesterday, the first credible date for an election is in September or October.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/16">We must not underestimate the size of the task that faces the Nepalese Government. Restoring Parliament is only the first step in the long path to restoring faith in democracy. Inside Kathmandu, the threads of democracy are being maintained for as long as possible. Outside Kathmandu, for reasons mentioned by my colleagues the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling and the hon. Member for Cotswold, democracy has disappeared; and it needs to be reinstated from first principles. That cannot be done while there are forces in Nepal that seem to insist on undermining the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/17">Despite the conciliatory words of the Maoists, it is clear that we will not achieve democracy in Nepal while parts of the country are controlled by terror and intimidation and by unaccountable forces. That is the principal challenge that faces the seven-party alliance.</p>

	<p pid="a.453.0/1">My hon. Friend gives a fascinating account of what he and his colleagues discovered in Nepal. In his discussions with representatives of the seven-party alliance, did he gain any notion of what the alliance thought would be the prospect of the Maoists going down the democratic road?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.453.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1637" speakername="Tom Levitt" colnum="453"  time="009:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h01.htm#60503h01_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.453.1/1">The seven-party alliance drew up the 12-point agreement with the Maoists, and it was re-endorsed a couple of weeks before our visit. That agreement is the straw at which everyone is clutching. My knowledge of the Maoists is not sufficient for me to make an absolute judgment as to their reliability, but we must also consider their capacity to deliver on a deal with the democratic forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/2">It is worth pointing out that, by definition, an alliance of seven parties will have problems in keeping together. There are many other political parties in Nepal; some of them could have been described as &quot;two men and a dog&quot;, except that I did not see many dogs. There must as a result be tensions within the alliance, particularly on how far the 12-point plan can be trusted and worked on. I hope that we will be able to help all seven members of the seven-party alliance to build a capacity to function as democratic parties, because there are real questions about their democratic credentials. By any standard Nepal is a young democracy, and it did not reach democratic maturity before starting to take backward steps.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/3">On the party political front, we should not forget that there are some very influential and powerful individuals in Nepal. Among those placed in position by the king over the past 18 months, some will want to follow the pro-monarchist agenda, and their political programme may include undermining and trying to split the seven-party alliance. We must be aware of that possibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/4">I return to the Minister's question. It is true that the Maoists must be defeated, but it has to be a political defeat. Everyone agrees that there is no chance of a military victory against the Maoists because of the country's terrain, poor communications and so on. However, the 12-point plan has to be the means by which the political parties call the Maoists' bluff. If they can deliver on the 12-point plan, they will have taken a huge step forward. They have to call their bluff.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/5">While we were in Nepal, some of us were putting a case for the political parties to call the king's bluff and taking up the king's nominal and perhaps superficial offer of elections. The parties chose not to do so. Perhaps they will now call the Maoists' bluff, saying that it is either the 12-point plan or nothing, with the constitutional election and decisions about the future of the constitution at the heart of the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/6">It was a challenging week, but enjoyable. We were joined by two Members of the other House. Between us we represented the three main parties and the Cross Benches, but we spoke as one. Our delegation's analysis of the situation was pretty uniform. I thank the Foreign Office for having enabled the delegation to take place. I hope that we can look back and say that we helped at the start of the long process of restoring democracy. Democracy is much more than elections, and Nepal has a long way to go, but I hope that the Government will take up our historic role of being a good friend to Nepal and give whatever assistance they can to help that country become a stable, satisfactory and successful democracy.</p>

	<p pid="a.454.0/1">During the last 40 minutes, in excellent speeches from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1877" name="John Stanley">my right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1637" name="Tom Levitt">the hon. Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt)</phrase>, we have heard as good an analysis of the situation in Nepal as one could expect to hear anywhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/2">I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman that my right hon. Friend showed admirable leadership during the visit. He ran the exercise with military precision&mdash;not once were we allowed to deviate, hesitate or turn from the programme. In my judgment, it was the most effective parliamentary delegation in which I have been involved, largely due to its composition: as well as the hon. Gentleman and my right hon. Friend, it included <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase> and two Members from the other place, Baroness Northover and the Earl of Sandwich. It was a very cohesive and effective team.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/3">I thank our ambassador to Nepal, Keith Bloomfield, and his colleagues. Our embassies are always supportive when parliamentarians make such visits. One senses that our embassy to Nepal went the extra mile on this occasion&mdash;partly because it was the embassy's idea that we should visit&mdash;but it made a special effort, which made our visit far more effective. I agree with the hon. Member for High Peak that, in a modest way, our visit might have made a difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/4">My right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling said it all in his introductory remarks. This was my second visit to Nepal; I was there in 1994 as a United Nations observer of the second general election under the old king. It is sad that those elections led eventually to the country's demise, but I have been left with a feeling of the nation's unpredictability. Every time I thought that I could see my way through the situation, something happened that made me realise that I was wrong. I would not like to put any money on what the outcome might be&mdash;on what the situation will be in a year's time.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/5">When we arrived, the protests were just beginning. They then escalated until the day of action in early April&mdash;the violence reached a level I had not expected. Two days were earmarked as days of action, but the protests went on for 12 days. Hundreds of thousands of people were on the streets: there was a shoot-to-kill curfew, yet they still went out, and some people were killed. I had not anticipated that happening. Then the king slowly and incrementally capitulated. First, he asked the political parties to appoint a Prime Minister, and then he said he would restore Parliament, whereupon everything stopped&mdash;in Iran, however, such protests led to the Shah going&mdash;and everyone seemed to be happy. That was mainly because the political parties had achieved their objective with the king, which was getting democracy. They were not for getting rid of the king&mdash;the Maoists were in favour of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/6">It was a rollercoaster ride, and the people showed a great enthusiasm for democracy. Frankly, I would be happy if in our country we were to have hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets campaigning for Parliament. <i>[Interruption.] </i>As my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold says from a sedentary position, perhaps tomorrow they will show some enthusiasm.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/7">However, to stick to the issue in hand and to refer to a point that has been made, of the various components in Nepal, the Maoists' motives is the most unclear. The Maoists control large swathes of the country with the stated aim of deposing the king and establishing a one-party state, but then they signed up to the 12-point agreement with the political parties, and now they have acquiesced in the current situation, so there has been a complete switch there.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/8">I am not sure that I would trust the Maoist parties further than I could throw them; my advice to the political parties of Nepal&mdash;and, indeed, to the British Government&mdash;is to sup with them using a long spoon. One suspects that they have entered into an agreement for short-term, opportunistic reasons. Perhaps both sides of that dispute feel they cannot win. The Nepalese army cannot beat the Maoists, and the Maoists are looking at a Royal Nepalese army that is bigger than the British Army, and they have probably reached the conclusion that they cannot beat it. Therefore, there is a stalemate of sorts.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/9">In our initial briefings after we arrived, we were told that there were three components of the situation in Nepal: the king, the political parties and the Maoists. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling said, there is also a fourth component, which is the people of Nepal. They have been through tremendous hardship. One should never underestimate their commitment to resolving this situation and to fighting for what they believe in if they feel they can achieve their objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/10">The human rights situation was of great concern to us all. We had a meeting with the foreign press delegation, and the hon. Member for High Peak has set out the breaches of human rights. While we were there, the leader of the Communist party was under house arrest for no good reason. I ask our Government to keep a close eye on that as we engage with the Nepalese Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/11">I wish to make four points on our policy. First, will the supply of military equipment to the Nepalese army be reviewed? Rightly, anything that could be used for an aggressive purpose has been withdrawn. Do we now feel that the situation has changed? We should take note of the role of the army: it was loyal to the king when he was the executive power, and one assumes that it will be loyal to the Government now that executive power has been bestowed upon them. If the Government are committed to free and fair elections, does that change the situation? Perhaps the Minister has not yet reached a conclusion on that, but it should be reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/12">Secondly, the heart of our policy should be to give full support to the Nepalese Government to hold free and fair elections. That is the only way forward; without them, the situation will collapse into anarchy. I encourage the Nepalese Government to announce a date&mdash;even if it is in September&mdash;as soon as possible to show their commitment. I hope the embassy will encourage them to do that. Thirdly, the basis of the way forward is the 12-point plan that was agreed in the early stages, in March.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/13">Fourthly, my humble advice to the Government is to stay close to the Indian Government in this. India is the nation of influence in Nepal, alongside us. In truth, because of India's proximity, it has more influence. It is also affected by the Maoist insurgency, which has spilled over into the north-east corner of that country. I think that will focus India's mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/14">Nepal is in for a very rocky time. The king has lost all credibility, and it remains to be seen whether he will survive. I do not think the incumbent has a useful role to play and his son is manifestly unpopular, so I do not know what the future holds for the monarchy. I believe in constitutional monarchy, as we have in our country, but I cannot see an obvious candidate to restore credibility in Nepal. That, however, shows the unpredictability in that country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.456.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" speakername="Jeremy Browne" colnum="456"  time="010:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h01.htm#60503h01_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.456.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1877" name="John Stanley">the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)</phrase> on securing the debate. My grandmother lived her entire life in the same house in West Malling in his constituency, and my grandfather, Gordon Browne&mdash;spelled correctly, with an &quot;e&quot; on the end of his surname&mdash;continues to be an enthusiastic constituent of the right hon. Gentleman. Therefore, I am very familiar with the part of the world he represents.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.0/2">Sadly, I am less familiar with the part of the world we are discussing, and I am probably the only participant in this debate who has not been to Nepal. Nevertheless, I will endeavour to offer thoughts and suggestions on how this Parliament and the British Government can best seek to ensure a happy resolution of the difficulties in Nepal that we have been reading a lot about in newspapers and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.0/3">In debates of this sort, I am often struck by how much cross-party consensus there is. I suppose that is inevitable, because all of us in this Parliament are liberal democrats&mdash;with a small &quot;l&quot; and a small &quot;d&quot;. Rightly, there is a consensus that the objective in respect of Nepal is to seek to establish open, liberal government by the people and for the people, and for elections to take place, and for there to be all the other traits that one associates with an open society&mdash;press freedom, fair trials, multi-party democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.0/4">However, as is often the case, the situation is difficult, awkward and less clear-cut than we would wish. There is not a group of good guys we can straightforwardly support and a group of bad guys we can oppose. That presents a difficulty for the British Government, and we should be cautious not to overestimate their ability to resolve the situation. Obviously, we should try to participate, but, ultimately, the decisions will be made by the Nepalese.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.0/5">However, I would be interested to learn from the Minister what is the approach of the Government. As I understand it, the United States of America&mdash;inasmuch as it is playing an active role&mdash;is not willing to deal in any way with the Maoists in Nepal. Do the British Government have a different approach? Do they consider that they are most likely to be effective in their role if they try to deal&mdash;in a reasonably even-handed way, if possible&mdash;with all the different groupings and factions, or does the Minister think that that is unlikely to be an appropriate or effective way to proceed?</p>
	<p pid="a.456.0/6">The first of the other areas that I hope and believe that the Government will consider is political education. In this country, we take for granted the formation of democratic parties and all the paraphernalia or infrastructure that goes with democracy and elections. It is easy to say that there should be elections and that we should get a Parliament up and running, as if that could be done at the drop of a hat, and people, including me, often sound somewhat glib in saying it. However, there is a lot of organisation to be done in terms of not just the mechanics of polling day, but the political parties&mdash;what they represent ideologically, and whether they are coherent and hold together in a proper, identifiable way, and do not keep splintering into lots of different groups, as that makes it impossible for people to exercise any choice that can be transferred to the delivery of power. All that is a difficult process in any country that, unlike ours, is not a mature and stable democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.0/7">Anything that we as a country can do to educate and assist in those processes should not be underestimated. Diplomacy or Government action of that sort does not seem very dramatic and does not seem to make a huge impact, but on the ground, in a quiet way, we can contribute to the mechanics of democracy and political education in Nepal.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.0/8">Also, I hope that we can foster and encourage exchange schemes and other ways of increasing knowledge and understanding of Nepal among those in Britain and the west. In that regard, tourism is a considerable asset. I suspect that most British people who are familiar with Nepal have been there as backpackers between school and university, or after leaving university, or on visits of that type. So, there is a contemporary, as well as an historical, link that many British people have with Nepal. I hope that that will be of benefit to our country in trying to engage the Government in Nepal, whatever form they take, in the months and years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.0/9">The second point that I would like the Minister to touch on is how we go about trying to exercise influence in Nepal. We have an historical tie with that country and that part of the world, but are we also working with our partners in the European Union and, more importantly, India, with which, of course, we have great historical links and which has a direct strategic interest in the region? Of course, India is a democracy&mdash;a somewhat imperfect one, but considering it has more than 1 billion people, it is an extraordinarily effective and stable country in terms of how power is exercised there. It has lessons to teach many countries in the world, including Nepal. All our links with the Indians will be extremely welcome in trying to resolve any problems in Nepal.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.0/10">The last of my three main points is about what role the Government can play in alleviating poverty and distress in Nepal, not only because that would evidently be a good in itself, but because any country that seeks political stability and rational decision taking will also benefit from its people enjoying a certain basic standard of living. It is hard to interest people in liberal concepts involving elections, free media and so on when they have more immediate concerns about their material and physical well-being. The Government, the Department for International Development and the Foreign Office take an interest in the provision of aid to Nepal, and we play a financial role. I would be interested to learn how that is tied in with diplomacy and a potential political solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.0/11">I conclude by repeating a remark made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1637" name="Tom Levitt">the hon. Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt)</phrase>, which summed up the way forward as we in the House see it. He said, &quot;The Maoists must be defeated, but it has to be a political defeat.&quot; That is an astute summary of the position as I understand it, which is that we should seek a constitutional settlement and that the 12-point agreement is the basis on which to move forward. The outcome that we should be seeking is effective multi-party democracy, not change from one undesirable system to another.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.0/12">I wish the Minister and the Government well in assisting with achieving that end, and wish the people of Nepal a happy, settled, stable political future in which they are not constantly buffeted by different forces that make it hard for them to live free, open and decent lives.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.458.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" colnum="458"  time="010:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h01.htm#60503h01_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.458.0/1">It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Anderson. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1877" name="John Stanley">my right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)</phrase> on securing this timely debate, and on the knowledgeable and thoughtful way in which he introduced it. On my very first day in the House, I went into the Tea Room and an elderly Member said to me, &quot;Be very careful what you say in this House. There is always an expert on every subject.&quot; My right hon. Friend is exactly that expert. As I went to sleep last night, I had a vision of him towering over me, listening to everything that I said, so I must be careful in case I incur his wrath.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/2">My right hon. Friend led a worthwhile delegation to Nepal between 19 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-23">23 March</phrase>, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" name="Richard Ottaway">my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1637" name="Tom Levitt">the hon. Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt)</phrase> have said. Like my right hon. Friend, I hope that that delegation has contributed, in a very small way, to setting that country on the path on which I hope it has embarked.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/3">My right hon. Friend was absolutely right to focus on the people of Nepal, because we wish those people to continue along the path of democracy. We want their economy to recover, we want them to prosper and we want them to live in peace and harmony with each other. They are a very pleasant people&mdash;hard-working, industrious and peace-loving, as was shown by how rapidly they went from demonstrating against the authorities one day to celebrating the result of their success the next. As my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South said, in other countries there would still have been looting many days later, as was the case after the fall of the Shah of Iran and the fall of Ceausescu in eastern Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/4">Hon. Members have ably described what happened in the past, and have alluded to our great historical links with Nepal over almost 200 years, as well as our strong bonds with its people through the Gurkha connection. Those bonds will continue. That is why the British Government, as a great friend and historical ally of Nepal, should remain heavily engaged in the peace process, which we hope will go from strength to strength. I want to concentrate, in a prospective way, on one or two things that could happen in Nepal, and I want to ask the Minister a few questions about how the British Government will react and help.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/5">As has been said, before we arrived, there was a three-cornered political situation that involved the king, the Maoists and the parliamentary parties. The king, I hope, has now conceded power in a real way; it seems that there is no way back to the former situation, at least in the short term. Whether the king survives as constitutional monarch is a much more open question.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/6">The king has ceded real power, but what about the political parties? As has been said, there are seven of them, and they have vastly differing views. Some of them wanted the country to be a republic even before the current situation arose, so it is unclear what their real political aims are. But as the Minister said, interestingly, in an intervention on the hon. Member for High Peak, it is the capacity of those political parties to deliver, and whether they will remain a cohesive whole, that is the critical question.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/7">Part of the problem up to now has been the weakness of the political parties. We wish them well, and we wish them a transition into a mature phase, so that they can at least prepare for elections. The first question I want to ask the Minister is, what help will we give through the rights, democracy and inclusion fund to the people and the political parties in Nepal as they prepare for the elections? A great deal of work must be done. An interim constitution must be drawn up and the election procedure must be sorted out.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/8">I have no idea how advanced the registration of voters is. I suspect that people will probably need to start almost from scratch, but how that can be done when the Maoists control a large chunk of the country remains to be seen. The process presents considerable difficulties, and I think it unlikely that an election will take place in September or October. A more realistic timetable would mean it taking place next year, but perhaps the Minister will give us the Government's view on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/9">The third of the three groups involved is the Maoists. Much has been said about the Maoists this morning, and I have asked the Minister a series of questions on Nepal, both before and after our visit. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-26">26 April</phrase>, the Minister answered one of my questions, and it is worth quoting that answer because it gives the Government's official view of the Maoists. I asked what assessment he had made of them, and the answer was:</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/10" class="indent">&quot;The Maoists carry out widespread human rights abuses including torture, kidnap, rape, murder and extortion for money. These acts of abuse perpetrated against innocent civilians, including women and children . . . the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reported that a large number of children were being used by the Maoist forces as helpers and porters during military operations . . . We are aware that the Maoists have been involved in importing explosives and detonators into Nepal. The Royal Nepalese Army seized over 5,000kg of commercial explosives and in excess of 30,000 commercial detonators in separate operations, in March 2006, along the Nepal-India border. We cannot judge what proportion of the overall total of Maoist imports this represents.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-26">26 April 2006</phrase>; Vol. 445, c. 1152&ndash;53W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/11">There is clearly a serious threat of insurgency and it requires every effort to be made during the political process, through negotiation with the Maoists by the democratic parties, which will be coupled with activity carried out by the police and the Royal Nepalese army.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/12">As we learned in Northern Ireland from the situation involving the IRA and other paramilitaries on both sides, the solution was partially military, but it was political to a much greater extent. That is the message regarding how to deal with the Maoists. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling said, there is a real prospect that Nepal could degenerate into a fully fledged Maoist state&mdash;a very unpleasant regime, which would be very deleterious for the people of Nepal. Every effort must be made by the whole international community, through every organ we can use in Nepal, to prevent that from happening. The one achievement of today's debate should be to issue a warning about that possibility, and I hope that we can prevent it from happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/13">Moving on from the political aspects, what is to be done for the future? Mention has been made of the Royal Nepalese army, which is big and increasing in size and which comprises almost 90,000 people. It has the capability, if given the right equipment, to deal with some of the problems. The key issue was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. If the political situation moves, as we hope it will, satisfactorily towards democracy and a situation where peaceful and fair elections can be held, the British and Indian Governments, the United States and the international community will have to review their policy of not supplying any form of lethal equipment to the Royal Nepalese army.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/14">The situation is pretty dire at the moment, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling alluded to it. If the army gets information that a serious incident involving Maoists has taken place in a rural area 200 miles from the capital, Kathmandu, for example, it can take the soldiers days to get there because the army simply does not have enough helicopters to lift them into position. When the soldiers get into position, they probably will not have enough equipment to deal with the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/15">Indeed, while in Nepal, we heard of the Maoists cutting a major water pipe. When the army went to repair it, the soldiers were attacked by the Maoists and several were killed. If the situation is to be properly brought under control, the Royal Nepalese army needs to be equipped with proper communications, helicopters and night vision for the Islander aircraft so that the troops can see what is going on, as well as proper co-ordination of intelligence, particularly with the Indian authorities. Those basic things must be put in place, and must be carefully considered by the international community.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/16">Another policy that must be reviewed is that on ministerial visits. I have asked the Minister a question about those before. In the run-up to what I hope will be free and fair elections&mdash;I am sure my right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling will want to take a full part in that process&mdash;we can show the political parties and the people of Nepal that we are there to help in whatever capacity they want. The policy on ministerial visits urgently needs to be reviewed and such a visit in the relatively near future would be a helpful step to give political parties some encouragement.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/17">As the hon. Member for High Peak said, there must be a proper, independent judiciary. That is crucial. Some important judgments have been made in the past about the constitution and the role of journalists, and I hope that the political parties can now put in place a team of judges and a judicial system, in a way that is seen to be free and fair, that can act in controversial situations, which will undoubtedly arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/18">One such situation is preparation for elections. There is an urgent need to establish a fully independent electoral commission. Legal questions will arise from the work of that commission, which should be considered by a free and fairly appointed judiciary.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/19">Mention has been made of the press and the media, which are critical in any fledgling democracy. While in Nepal, we were lucky enough to meet the independent organisation of journalists, and I have no doubt that it will continue to press the political parties to allow full access to all strands of media, including independent radio, which reaches most parts of Nepal, but also television and a free press. I hope that that takes place as part of the emerging, reassuring process that follows.</p>

	<p pid="a.461.0/1">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman was pleased to note that the Nepalese Cabinet has already lifted the controversial ordinances concerning broadcasting. That will set Nepal in the right direction in respect of press coverage.</p>

	<p pid="a.461.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to draw attention to that. It is a good sign that things are moving in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.1/2">I want to give the Minister plenty of time to reply, but my final point, which I referred to earlier, concerns this country's connection to Nepal via the Gurkhas. We were lucky enough to go the Gurkha headquarters in Kathmandu and to be briefed fully on the situation. One emerging factor concerning the Gurkhas is that the British Government have, quite rightly, altered the rules on leave to remain in this country, so that Gurkhas who have served in the British Army can apply to this country&mdash;although they will be discharged in Nepal&mdash;and expect to be granted leave to remain, provided that they have given exemplary service. It is expected that most will apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.1/3">That is a good thing in many ways, because of the foreign remittances that they send back home to their families, but it gives rise to another problem, which concerns the number of social security staff already required to look after the existing 10,000 or so Gurkha dependants in Nepal. There is a severe concern about those social security staff, particularly regarding their wages.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.1/4">I do not expect the Minister to be able to deal with that problem today, but I hope he will consider it. The well-being of those dependants in Nepal is a critical part of our responsibilities to that country, and it would be reprehensible if anything were to happen to that network. If the Maoist threat lessens, the job will get easier, but for some of those social security staff travelling to dangerous rural areas in the west of the country, this is a hazardous job for which they are paid a pittance. It would be helpful if the Minister looked into that.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.1/5">This has been a thoroughly well informed debate. Let us hope that, through it, we can send a message to the British Government that we fully support the people of Nepal. We desperately hope that the path to democracy will be smooth and that they can defeat the Maoist threat. However, like all difficult paths, it is bound to have its ups and downs. Let us hope that, on the whole, we can progress smoothly.</p>

	<p pid="a.462.0/1">It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Anderson. May I add to the thanks offered to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1877" name="John Stanley">the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)</phrase> for securing parliamentary time to discuss Nepal at this critical point in its history? I know how deeply he feels about Nepal, and I have benefited more from this short debate, in terms of learning about the nature of a country, than I have from any other.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.0/2">The right hon. Gentleman gave us an excellent and most revealing comparison between the conditions that he encountered in 1996 and those that he encountered t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" name="Richard Ottaway">his year. His colleague, the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway)</phrase>, helped with that comparison, too. I must say&mdash;the right hon. Gentleman made this point&mdash;that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has received great value for money from his trip. I get lots of e-grams and intelligence about the situation in Nepal, but there is nothing to beat the reports of colleagues who have been out there to look carefully at the situation on the ground. I have learned a great deal.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.0/3">This debate should tell us something about the value of inter-parliamentary visits. They do not usually receive very good press in this country, because they are considered a freebie, with MPs jaunting around the world. However, in the past hour or so, we have heard a report that it would be impossible to obtain from any other quarter. If it came from the intelligence services or an independent agency, there would probably be allegations that they had their own agenda. Through this cross-party visit, however, we have received invaluable information.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.0/4">As the right hon. Gentleman and others reminded us, the king's restoration of Parliament is a great victory for the forces of democracy in Nepal. It offers the prospect of a resolution to the 10-year conflict there, and a return to peace and stability. I remember that when the right hon. Gentleman first spoke to me about that country, he told me that it was such a dreadful shame that a place he encountered 10 years ago had been driven into such straits.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.0/5">This morning, the right hon. Gentleman has given us the hope that there is a way through that situation. He quite properly drew our attention to the central feature of the past couple of weeks: the great bravery of the Nepali people and their determination in the face of great difficulty to try to reinstate some of the order that previously existed.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.0/6">The one point that the right hon. Gentleman did not mention was Bhutan, although he might wish to intervene on me. On the &quot;Today&quot; programme this morning, I heard an extraordinary interview in which somebody said that politicians should try to make us happier in life. I am not sure whether it was during the interview, but people talked rather glowingly about how the Government of Bhutan measure their success or failure in terms of the happiness of their subjects, yet 100,000 Bhutanese refugees live in Nepal, having been driven there in the most brutal conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.0/7">I was hoping that the right hon. Gentleman could tell us about that, so I shall give way.</p>

	<p pid="a.463.0/1">As the Minister has invited me to intervene, I shall do so in the traditional way, by posing questions to him. I could have spoken at considerable length about the Bhutanese refugees, but I wanted to ensure that all my colleagues had the opportunity to make their remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.0/2">Is the Minister aware of what we learned for the first time in the Sanischare Bhutanese refugee camp? Sadly, the then Government of Nepal were engaged in gross discrimination against the Bhutanese refugees. Their policy was to prevent those people in the refugee camp from trading and working outside it, and even from leaving the country when third countries were willing to take them. Will he examine those issues, which I have indeed put to the Foreign Secretary?</p>

	<p pid="a.463.1/1">I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman has posed that question, because it is very serious.

	<p pid="a.463.2/1">As probably the only Member of the House to have visited Bhutan and met its Foreign Minister, I say to the Minister that there is a willingness among the Bhutanese Government to help to resolve that problem. Bhutan is only a small state with 500,000 people, and it cannot realistically repatriate all the refugees. In fact, the total number of refugees is not the total number who were driven out of Bhutan, because many refugees have been born in the camps.</p>

	<p pid="a.464.3/1">I appreciate that. It is worth putting it on record that the then Nepalese Government were preventing not only third-party movement, but the movement of those people who wished to return to Bhutan and whom the Bhutanese were willing to take back&mdash;much to the frustration of the international agencies running the refugee camps and entirely at their cost. There will come a time when the agencies are no longer willing to take on that burden on their own.</p>

	<p pid="a.464.4/1">Yes, indeed. That is a situation that I am afraid we are all too familiar with in other parts of the world. I hope that the Nepali and Bhutanese Governments, and outside agencies that can work to broker a much better arrangement, will prioritise that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/2">The United Kingdom went to great lengths to persuade the king not to take power in Nepal, and, once he had, to hand it back to the political parties. In December 2004, in response to rumours of a palace coup, our ambassador in Kathmandu sought an audience with the king to forewarn him of the consequences of a takeover. The ambassador said that a palace takeover</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/3" class="indent">&quot;would put the King in the front line and the monarchy at risk, provoke violent street demonstrations and push the parties into the arms of the Maoists, divert security resource from fighting the Maoists, and risked losing international support which was posited on multi-party Government and a democratic Nepal.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/4">The accuracy of that prediction was illustrated precisely by the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling when he expressed his great fear that the real victors would be the Maoists, if we were not careful. I am afraid that that is all too true.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/5">Looking back, those words were prescient. We welcome, therefore, the king's decision to reinstate Parliament. With that announcement, the security situation has begun to improve. The parties have called off their protests and the Maoists have announced a three-month ceasefire, although the details of how it will be implemented are not yet clear. There is a prospect of a new Government with the full authority to reciprocate a ceasefire, open negotiations with the Maoists and bring an end to the conflict, which has cost the lives of some 13,000 Nepalese. That is an extraordinary number when one thinks that we lost about 3,500 people over all those years in Northern Ireland. The fact that 13,000 Nepalese have died is a terrible indictment of what has happened in that country.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/6">We do not to underestimate the considerable risks and challenges ahead. To begin with, it is imperative that the Maoists make a complete and permanent end to their violence, and commit to abandoning their arms for ever. That has been done in other parts of the world, and it can be done in Nepal.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/7">As right hon. and hon. Members have said, the Royal Nepalese army will need to undergo what amounts to a cultural shift to turn it into an accountable, professional army under civilian, democratic control. We have been working hard to achieve those ends through our efforts to promote human rights. I will come to the question of human rights, which the hon. Member for Croydon, South raised, in a moment. The political parties will need to show vision and leadership, and learn lessons from the past, and there will need to be a peace process involving the Government and the Maoists to bring the conflict to a permanent conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/8">As right hon. and hon. Members have said, the first sittings of the reconvened Parliament on 28 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-30">30 April</phrase> were landmark occasions. Parliament agreed on elections to a constituent assembly and to talks with the Maoists, which we hope will pave the way for a permanent peace settlement. As colleagues have pointed out, the UK is an old friend of Nepal, with a long history of involvement. We are already working with our key international partners such as the US and India&mdash;we have urged that work should be done with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" name="Jeremy Browne">the Indians; the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne)</phrase> raised that issue&mdash;and the EU to take full advantage of the opportunities in Nepal.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/9">In co-ordination with our EU partners, we will consider lifting the agreement not to meet Nepalese Ministers from the king's Government. If appropriate, we will look for an early opportunity for a UK Minister to visit Nepal. [Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear!&quot;] We will examine ways to ensure that the new Government are equipped for the challenges that lie ahead. As a lifelong mountain climber, I very much hope that that Minister will be me, so that I might see the Himalayas, although I must admit that I limit my climbing to the Alps these days. One can be rescued there by a red helicopter. I have not seen any of those in the Himalayas, and I am getting on a bit now.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/10">The first priority will be to establish a mutually agreed ceasefire. We welcome the Maoists' announcement of a three-month ceasefire, and urge them to make it permanent. We remain absolutely clear about the fact that the pursuit of political ends through violent means is absolutely unacceptable, as is a one-party Maoist state. In response to what the hon. Member for Cotswold said, I hope that that is a clear enough warning from the House to the Maoists. That is very important.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/11">The UK continues to support the transition of the Maoists back into a democratic political party participating in a multi-party democratic system. I heard the comments made by the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling with a great deal of optimism. The fact that the Marxist-Leninist party that he mentioned is now a democratic party, so much so that its leader is under house arrest&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.465.1/1">Was under house arrest. That is a great encouragement, as it shows how such parties can change.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> asked whether the Maoists in Nepal are being financed by the Chinese Communist party. Maoist parties have always been completely beyond my comprehension, as a student of the left, so I was glad to hear that they are not.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/3">The hon. Member for Croydon, South mentioned the spread of the influence of Maoist insurrectionists into north-east India. There have been problems with the Naxalite insurrectionists in that area, who have committed some brutal murders. The hon. Gentleman is right to emphasise that aspect, and we must work closely with the Indian authorities to consider those links.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/4">I am sure that most people in this country would be amazed to discover that Nepal has a large population. I initially thought that it had a population of about the same size as that of Scotland, but nobody knows how big it is. It is estimated to be between 25 million and 28 million. It is a huge population, which is very influential on India.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/5">The hon. Member for Taunton talked about developing the economy and about the need for us to become more familiar with Nepal through tourism and other means. I do not know, but perhaps the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling, as his interest continues, will be able to tell us whether Nepal might be able to supply India with electricity using hydroelectrics. Perhaps its future lies in becoming more involved in that burgeoning area of economic growth in northern India, which is not far away and with which it has many organic links and links through river valleys.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/6">Such progress is happening in Afghanistan, and the great hunger for electricity in Pakistan and India could be met by Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan&mdash;those mountainous countries in the western Himalayas&mdash;via Afghanistan. Perhaps there is a similar future for Nepal. That is an important question.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/7">The UK continues to support the transition of the Maoists back into a democratic political party, which would then participate in a multi-party democratic system, but that must be predicated on the Maoists making a demonstrable commitment to ending their violence and putting their arms beyond use for good. I make it absolutely clear that that is the only way that the Maoists will gain legitimacy in our eyes. The hon. Member for Cotswold was right to say that and the point must be emphasised.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/8">We stand firmly behind the efforts of the political parties to take the reins of government and bring an end to the Maoist insurgency. We will make every effort to ensure that they are prepared and equipped to do so, including though our development assistance and the global conflict prevention pool. We are working with our international partners on co-ordinating the international effort as closely as possible. <i>[Interruption.]</i> There is something about a clock written here&mdash;oh, I see.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/9">Several hon. Members asked about military supplies to the security forces. Following the king's takeover of power last year, we put military assistance under review and cancelled the package of military assistance that we had intended to donate to Nepal using funds from the global conflict prevention pool. At this stage, it would be premature to make any formal commitments on security assistance. Now that there is a new Prime Minister and the prospect of a new Government who will take forward negotiations with the Maoists, we will consider requests from that new Government, but so far there have been none.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/10">In the context of the new political landscape in Nepal, our conflict prevention objectives will inevitably shift. If the new Government can make progress on a peace process&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.468.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to introduce this debate on a big and important subject&mdash;probably too big for a half-hour debate. I am aware that many of the issues that are relevant to this discussion, particularly in respect of the pressures on some university science departments, are being dealt with elsewhere in the House, notably by the Select Committee on Science and Technology, which is chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1617" name="Phil Willis">my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/2">I wanted to introduce this debate for several reasons, some of which are personal. Although my constituency is not a university centre, it does have two of the biggest science laboratories in Britain. The National Physical Laboratory is Government owned and supported by the Department of Trade and Industry. Among other things, it has responsibility for the atomic clocks and, therefore, Greenwich mean time, and it houses hundreds of highly qualified physicists. The Laboratory of the Government Chemist has been privatised in recent years but retains its core function of standard-setting for chemistry. It also employs many highly qualified chemists. As a result, the Twickenham-Teddington area is populated by a substantial number of high quality, highly qualified scientists.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/3">I meet those scientists on the doorstep. They convey their anxiety about the state of science in the universities, on which they depend for their graduates and in which many of them alternate in taking university appointments. There is particular anxiety about the closure of chemistry departments in London, including those at Queen Mary's and King's college.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/4">I have a long-standing interest in science education at school level. I secured an Adjournment debate two years ago following the introduction of the Adrian Smith report on maths teaching, and I maintain a close interest in it. Although the Government have undoubtedly taken some action, I am still concerned that some of the underlying problems, which are linked to the problems of the university science sector, remain.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/5">On a personal level, I am of that generation of people who found it easiest to get into university by doing maths, physics and chemistry. I spent two years in chemistry laboratories before deciding that economics was a somewhat more amenable, perhaps easier subject. However, I have since then repaid my debt to science by having a son who is a very good post-doctoral scientist. He briefs me on the strengths of British centres of scientific excellence&mdash;for example, Imperial college, where he works&mdash;but also on some of the frustrations of academic scientific life.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/6">I mentioned my background because it has some relevance to this debate. When I studied science in the 1960s, there was a great deal of interest in the role of science, prompted mainly by the Harold Wilson Government. There was the Trend report on the future of science, out of which emerged the conventional wisdom that Britain was very good at science but not very good at applying it to wealth creation. That general idea has existed for the past 30 to 40 years, but increasingly people are questioning the underlying proposition, for two opposite reasons. One is that Britain has become better at translating science into wealth creation. There is a great deal of evidence that many good science-based industries are developing in the UK. On the other side, there are questions about whether we can continue to be so complacent about the excellence of British science. There are genuine worries on that score, but before I detail some of them, I should like to start with a positive observation.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/7">British universities certainly have a great deal to be proud of in the science field. This country has 1 per cent. of the world's population but 10 per cent. of all cited papers and 11 per cent. of cited papers that attract the greatest degree of scientific attention, and 12 per cent. of the university science prizes. An indicator has been developed to compare the performance of science faculties across Europe&mdash;obviously, there are arguments about methodology&mdash;and British universities topped the list, having six of the 10 top university departments in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/8">On several measures, Britain does very well. I recently saw a reference in <i>New Scientist</i> to the fact that Britain now may stand ahead of the United States on some measures of the standard comparators for the life sciences. There is a very good story to tell in some areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/9">Equally, there are some serious worries, on which I shall focus. As the Minister knows, much of the anxiety centres on the large-scale closure of university science departments. There have been 79 in the past six years and, in the past 18 months, there have been suggested closures of five chemistry departments, although I believe that the one at Sussex university has been reprieved. The Royal Society of Chemistry has argued that, on the basis of current policies on research funding allocation and teaching funding allocation, it would expect another 20 to close in the next 10 years. The 60 chemistry departments that we now have would be reduced by a further 20. That is on the basis of current trends&mdash;it may or may not happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/10">Those comments were sufficient to produce the reasonable consensus that was summarised by the Science and Technology Committee, which expressed in moderate language what is a growing worry in the science community. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/11" class="indent">&quot;Whilst it may be exaggerating to say that university STEM departments&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/12">that is, science, technology, engineering and mathematics departments&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/13" class="indent">&quot;are in crisis, it is clear that their numbers are experiencing a sharp decline. Since the financial situation faced by these departments is unlikely to change in the short term, it is reasonable to assume that there will be further closures. If this process continues unchecked, there is a very real possibility that the system will no longer be able to provide sufficient numbers of STEM graduates to meet the needs of the UK economy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/14">That conclusion has been reinforced by businesses. Companies such as GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca have publicly expressed their worry about the decline, particularly in chemistry. The CBI has likened the position of university science to a car crashing in slow motion. That may be an over-dramatisation, but businesses as well as academics have a view on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/15">What are the sources of the problem? I shall touch on four issues which are, to some extent, interconnected: first, the overall funding position; secondly, the availability of students to do science in universities; thirdly, the formula that is used for allocating funding for science teaching; and, fourthly, the basis of allocation of science research in universities. Those four things are interrelated. For example, a university department may have a brilliant set of teachers and researchers, but it would find it difficult to continue to function if there were no students. Indeed, Alasdair Smith, the vice-chancellor of Sussex university, described that scenario as one that had led him to take a pessimistic view.</p>

	<p pid="a.470.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that another factor is that businesses and universities have not learned how to live with each other, talk to each other and develop together? There are small signs of interaction&mdash;the odd professor here, the odd studentship there&mdash;but there is no concerted activity in this country to bring them together as suggested in the Lambert report.</p>

	<p pid="a.470.1/1">I have seen the Lambert report, which highlights that long-standing underlying weakness. As I said in my introductory remarks, I sense that much progress has been made in that direction, but it is starting from a very low base.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.1/2">Let me briefly run through the four headings and pose some questions to the Minister. First, on overall funding, this is not the place for me to try to score points about the funding of science. There are other forums in which we can debate that much more satisfactorily. I note that the Chancellor has considerably increased the overall envelope of science funding&mdash;I acknowledge that. It was referred to at considerable length in the Budget, within the framework of long-term science policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.1/3">I do not question the overall level of science funding, which is substantial and growing rapidly, but its emphasis. Perhaps the Government assume a little too easily that it is helpful for them to fund practical research and development that the private sector may well be willing and able to do itself, rather than basic science, which is, after all, a core function of Government. There is an issue about whether there is too much emphasis on supporting private sector R and D, whether through tax credits or direct support, rather than basic science, but I am not raising here the question of the overall spending envelope. I want to spend more time on the other two questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.1/4">The most worrying and fundamental issue is that there seems to be a long-term problem about students coming forward to study the basic sciences: physics and chemistry, and mathematics, which is closely linked. The statistics are worrying. The 15-year trend since the early 1990s shows a decline in the number of students taking those subjects at A-level of about 35 per cent. in physics, 22 per cent. in maths and 12 per cent. in chemistry at a time when further and higher education has been expanding rapidly. That has been a decline at a time of general expansion of higher education, which is worrying. I appreciate that the short-term picture may give more grounds for optimism and I shall give some of the more detailed figures that have emerged this year covering the period when the Government have been in power.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.1/5">There has been a decline in the number of people taking A-level physics from 28,800 in 1997 to 24,094 in 2005. That decline has been continuous throughout that period. Physics is the really bad story. Chemistry is more mixed. There has been a decline from 36,430 to 33,164 but over the last two years there has been a considerable improvement. In biological science the position is more or less flat. In mathematics there has been a catastrophic decline from 56,000 in 1997 to 46,000 last year, but the last two years have seen a considerable improvement from a worryingly low level.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.471.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1629" speakername="Boris Johnson" colnum="471"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h02.htm#60503h02_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.471.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is particularly worrying that the decline has been even more precipitous in the maintained sector? The students who are doing maths, physics and chemistry are increasingly in the independent sector and 40 per cent. of A grades in physics and maths A-level come from children in the independent sector. Is that not even more worrying?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.471.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="471"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h02.htm#60503h02_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.471.1/1">I was going to make exactly that point. It is ironic that the private sector, which used to be regarded as the preserve of effete generalists, is increasingly one of the few sectors of education where people do double maths, which is a necessary foundation for advanced physics. That is worrying because people in the maintained sector who have limited means are simply not getting access to teaching in those important disciplines.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/2">Various reasons have been advanced for the problem of science education and attracting students. First, students are being attracted more to vocational disciplines. There is a big growth in demand for law, medicine, architecture and so on and those choices are rational. The research into rates of return on education suggests that students in those disciplines make a higher return than students who do basic science, so the choice is rational from their point of view.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/3">The Royal Society of Chemistry also makes the point that people may just be looking for easy subjects and makes an invidious comparison, contrasting the decline in the number of chemistry students with the rapid increase in media studies students. I shall not make pejorative remarks about media studies because it is too fashionable to do so, but there is a jarring contrast between the two experiences.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/4">The basic problem relates to skills; the figures unearthed by Adrian Smith in his report two years ago still have great force and are worrying. He noted then that there was a shortage of 3,400 in the number of maths teachers. Do the Government know whether that figure is now better or worse? Adrian Smith noted, for example, that one third of all science teachers had a third-class honours degree or less and that many had no maths beyond GCSE but were trying to teach advanced-level science without having the basic skill levels. The age profile was also adverse, with a high proportion being over 50.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/5">I have only a couple of minutes left so I shall try to draw the threads together. Will the Minister update us on what has happened since the Adrian Smith report and say whether the Government are going to act on some of his more radical recommendations&mdash;such as giving greater weight to maths GCSEs and A-levels and university admission, and allowing undergraduates to teach maths in schools, using their training at that early level?</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/6">The third issue is the funding formula for university science teaching. One of the most damaging decisions to have been made in recent years was that by the Higher Education Funding Council when funding for science teaching, which used to be at the level of 2.1 per cent. of the baseline, was arbitrarily cut to 1.7 per cent. Putting it crudely, the non-science faculties seem to have ganged up on the scientists and switched a large amount of funding out of university science departments, which effectively had a cut of 20 per cent. They used a circular and damaging argument. They noted that science faculties were doing much less laboratory work and concluded that they needed less money. However, they were doing less laboratory work because they had less funding. That decision was very damaging. Is that a matter on which the Government have any say? After all, they are the main funding body for universities. The decision seems to have been taken by a Government quango and the feedback I have received is that if that decision could be reversed, it would do more than anything to improve the position of science departments in universities.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/7">I am conscious of the time and my final comment relates to the funding formula for university research&mdash;the research assessment exercise. Traditionally, it has been based on peer review and the logic of that is clear. Universities are independent and it is right that university academics should have a peer review process, but it has thrown up all sorts of damaging anomalies. Universities are sacking teaching staff to boost their research rating&mdash;Brunel university was cited recently as an example&mdash;and actively poaching research staff from other universities. Several senior vice-chancellors, Mr. VandeLinde at Warwick and the vice-chancellor of Bristol, have seriously criticised the system as being highly distorting, producing a perverse market and doing great damage to university research.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/8">I understand that the 2008 review will be conducted more subtly and the Government announced in the Budget that they will introduce a parallel shadow system based on metrics&mdash;fund-raising for university departments. If there is such a fundamental flaw in the system, why must we wait until 2013 for an improved system, if that is what the Government's recommendation proves to be, to have any effect?</p>

	<p pid="a.472.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on securing this debate and raising this important subject. He has taken a deep and long-standing interest in the matter and has a significant constituency interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/2">I shall start by setting out the context. To be fair to the hon. Gentleman, he set out the context relating to science in our universities. We currently have a strong science base and we are second only to the United States in terms of world-class research. We comprise 1 per cent. of the world's population, yet we do 5 per cent. of the world's science and produce 9 per cent. of all papers and 12 per cent. of scientific citations. That is a substantial and positive record.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/3">From the time when the Government came to power in 1997 to the end of the current spending period, we will have more than doubled spending on UK science and research. That is a substantial and sustained commitment and better than what went before. However, I hasten to add that we have no grounds for complacency. That is why, two years ago, we published our &quot;Science &amp; innovation investment framework 2004&ndash;2014&quot;. It is a strategy for the decade and aims to make Britain the most attractive location in the world for science, research, development and innovation.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/4">The hon. Gentleman referred to the research assessment exercise. Our science base is built on the excellent research carried out in our universities. University research has always been a progressive, constantly developing force and for the past 20 years the key driver of that change has been the research assessment exercise&mdash;the RAE. It has moved us to a point at which we can say with confidence that taxpayer-funded research in this country is world-class. Let me explain what I mean. Between the last two RAEs, in 1996 and 2001, the number of university departments achieving the top 5 or 5* rating rose by a very significant 65 per cent. to more than 800. Those excellent departments now employ more than half of all the researchers in the higher education system.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/5">Like the research that it evaluates, the RAE has changed and improved every time that it has been conducted, and it will continue to change in the current round. For the next exercise, in 2008, the cliff-edge effect&mdash;the difference in financial consequences between a research rating of 4 and a rating of 5&mdash;which has rightly concerned many people, will be addressed by the introduction of an institutional quality profile. There will be fewer peer review panels than in the last exercise, in 2001, and greater recognition of applied and interdisciplinary research. Those changes have been widely welcomed in the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/6">The hon. Gentleman referred to our announcement at the time of the Budget of a new stage in the development of research assessment. We are seeking to move after 2008 to a metrics-based system of assessment that continues to recognise and drive quality, but which at the same time reduces the burden that the RAE places on universities' time and staff resources. We have already established a working party, which I am pleased to report is making significant progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/7">The hon. Gentleman asked why we have to wait. We have made it clear within the review that we are conscious that significant preparations are already under way for 2008. It is therefore the Government's presumption that the 2008 RAE should go ahead, incorporating a shadow metrics exercise. However, if an alternative system is agreed and widely supported and a clear majority of UK universities favour an earlier move to a simpler system, the Government will be willing to consider that. We need to withhold our judgment for now. There does not appear to be a groundswell of support for such a move at the moment, but if there is we will be prepared to consider the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/8">I come now to the importance of strategic and vulnerable subjects, on which the hon. Gentleman rightly commented. That issue has been the focus of recent publicity. It needs to be borne in mind that one strength of our university system is university autonomy. The idea that we can plan at micro level, from the centre in Whitehall, the exact numbers of science places throughout the country is wrong. That would not serve our best interests. However, we have asked the Higher Education Funding Council to monitor whether there may be areas in which current provision seems out of step with the national need, to consider whether action may be needed and, if so, to advise on what might be done. That said, it is important to recognise, as the Roberts review did, that there is not a crisis in science in our universities. When we talk about the number of undergraduates studying science, it is important to remember that, across the board, there are 120,000 more students doing science subjects today than there were in 1997.</p>

	<p pid="a.474.0/1">Could the changes that HEFCE recommends include allowing it to restrain a university from closing a science department if it wanted to do so?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.474.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" speakername="Bill Rammell" colnum="474"  time="011:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h02.htm#60503h02_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.474.1/1">I do not think that we need that kind of central command and control. However, we have made it clear that where there is a vulnerability, where an institution is considering the position of a science, technology, engineering and mathematics&mdash;STEM&mdash;subject, there should be early intervention in the form of discussions with the institution. Indeed, that has been happening. The hon. Member for Twickenham commented on the situation at Sussex university. It is because of early intervention through HEFCE that we will not see a loss in terms of overall student places. As a result of co-operation with neighbouring institutions, the numbers will be upheld.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/2">It is important to place the issue in the national context. The hon. Gentleman commented on the recent changes. Overall in the last couple of years, there has been the beginning of a turnaround. There was an increase of 10 per cent. or more in the number of students accepted last year to study subjects such as maths, physics and chemistry, and there have been further increases in the application round this year. That is significant. We are not complacent, but it does give us grounds for cautious optimism.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/3">Another key factor is what the Government are doing to stimulate demand from students. In the longer term, that must be the area in which we make progress. Again, we set out in the Budget significant commitments to science teaching. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer made a commitment of &pound;32 million-worth of new measures over just the next two years. We are committed to increasing the number of pupils achieving level 6 in science at key stage 3 and good science grades at GCSE, raising the number of science A-level entries and increasing the percentage of teachers with a physics, chemistry or maths specialism.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/4">The hon. Gentleman commented on the quality of graduates going into science teaching. One figure that gives me a degree of encouragement relates to the proportions of people going into the teaching of physics, chemistry and maths. The number of people doing that with a 2:1 or a first-class degree has risen significantly in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/5">With regard to meeting our overall commitments, we have made it clear that we want to provide pupils with more opportunities to study three separate sciences at GCSE. We are piloting 250 after-school science clubs to offer an engaging and stretching programme of activities to key stage 3 pupils with an interest and potential in science. We are providing more continuous professional development opportunities for science teachers and technicians.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/6">Our science and engineering ambassadors initiative has a significant role to play, as have the curriculum reforms that we are introducing from this September. At key stage 4, we will maintain the breadth and depth of the curriculum, but it will have greater relevance to today's world, so that young people learn more about the use of contemporary scientific and technological developments and their benefits, drawbacks and risks. I am talking about the practical application of science in society, rather than just learning by rote. To encourage increasing numbers of young people to engage in these subjects, that must be a way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/7">Since 1997, there has been a 30 per cent. increase in the number of new science teachers, but the Government are the first to acknowledge that we need to do more. That is why we have made significant increases in the teacher training bursaries and the golden hellos, which evidence suggests are having an impact and helping us to recruit greater numbers of science graduates. We need to get the message across to young people about the significant advantages of undertaking a course of study in a STEM subject.</p>

	<p pid="a.475.0/1">I agree with the Minister's philosophy of not trying to micro-manage universities, but will he address the specific issue of the funding formula for teaching, which seriously disadvantages science departments? Are the Government addressing that?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.476.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" speakername="Bill Rammell" colnum="476"  time="011:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h02.htm#60503h02_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.476.0/1">May I just finish my point? I will then address the point made by the hon. Gentleman. I was talking about the financial benefits of taking a STEM subject. The graduate earnings premium is 30 per cent. for a STEM subject compared with 23 per cent. for a non-STEM subject. Taking a STEM subject will significantly enhance the earning capacity of a graduate over their working life. We need to get that message across to young people in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.0/2">On the hon. Gentleman's question, we have made it clear that the Government and the Higher Education Funding Council want to distribute grant to take account of variations in the actual relative costs of teaching different subjects. That is why the collection of cost information in accordance with full economic cost principles should be an important step forward. That will happen in 2008. An important related point is that if laboratory-based science is relatively underfunded, something else must be relatively overfunded. It is not enough just to argue that it would be helpful for science to receive more funding in the formula. Anyone with credibility who proposes changes to the formula also has to find sustainable and convincing evidence that other subjects are relatively overfunded.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.0/3">We are pursuing a number of o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">ther initiatives. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> raised the issue of knowledge transfer. The higher education innovation fund, whose funding envelope we have successively increased, is helping and supporting the spread of scientific ideas for practical business purposes in this country&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.477.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Anderson, on this important occasion. This is a serious debate on a serious issue, and I confirm to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Defence that I am a great admirer of our armed services and the men and women who choose to serve for our defence. I want our Army to be the best in the world and to reflect the democratic values that we cherish.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/2">Yet members of the armed forces who protect our rights are entitled to have their rights protected by us. The Army should be a model of best practice and set a benchmark from which others can learn. That is the context for the debate and we need a dialogue on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/3">We last had an opportunity in Westminster Hall to debate the subject of deaths in Her Majesty's armed forces on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-04">4 February 2003</phrase>, when the then Member for Kingston upon Hull, North, Kevin McNamara, highlighted the courage and bravery of a number of families campaigning for a public inquiry into deaths in Army barracks. Three years later, those families are still looking for answers and, as the Deepcut and Beyond families group, they have grown in number and strength. Those families were brought together by the tragic loss of children who died when serving the Crown, most of whom had brothers or sisters and some of whom had children of their own. Those soldiers joined the Army full of optimism, believing in the future, and learned to have pride in their regiments. They knew that they might have to fight for their country but they believed in the future. Somehow, something went terribly wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/4">Every family has a different story to tell. Whatever the circumstances of an individual death, each family had cause to doubt the explanation given. It did not make sense. Bereaved families did not feel that they had been told the truth, and they did not believe that those responsible for their children's deaths, whether by action or neglect, had been brought to justice or held to account. While the Army establishment closed ranks and denied there was a problem, the press drew the seemingly obvious conclusion that there was a conspiracy to cover up the truth and to allow perpetrators to go unpunished.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/5">The Deepcut and Beyond group has provided support and assistance to Army families who have experienced the traumatic and otherwise lonely upheaval of the sudden death of a child. Setting out the public case for a full inquiry, the group has developed a comprehensive agenda for change. The group is calling for civilian oversight to ensure effective investigation of complaints and deaths. It argues for structural involvement of families to ensure that lessons are learned and measures put in place to prevent future deaths. Through Daniel's Trust, bereaved families have been able to work with the independent forces helpline to give confidential advice to young soldiers suffering bullying, and have engaged directly with the officers responsible for fulfilling the duty of care.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/6">Inspired by such positive thinking, I am please to report the formation of the all-party group established on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February 2006</phrase> with the aim of providing a parliamentary focus on non-combat deaths in the armed forces, and to support the Deepcut and Beyond families group in seeking truth, justice and change. Membership of the group reflects genuine all-party backing for the families and extends throughout the United Kingdom. I was proud to be elected chair of the group, with the support of Lord Ashley as secretary and a fine panel of officers, some of whom are in the Chamber today. I am optimistic that we can assist the Government and the Ministry of Defence in rising to the challenge of Deepcut and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/7">I shall pose a number of questions and seek the support of the Minister for a number of propositions. Do we still need a public inquiry? The Minister has previously addressed that issue and is considering his response to the Surrey coroner and the recommendations of the Deepcut review conducted by Nicholas Blake, QC. The Deepcut families, who have lived with the investigation since their children's deaths, are looking in detail at the report and its findings, but the demand for a public inquiry is not going away.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/8">At the conclusion of its investigations into the four deaths, Surrey police outlined the case for a broader inquiry that would</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/9" class="indent">&quot;address the sufficiency of the Army's care regime in respect of young soldiers in training at Deepcut and beyond.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/10">It was Surrey's summary recommendation</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/11" class="indent">&quot;that the Ministry of Defence considers a broader investigation of&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/12">First:</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/13" class="indent">&quot;Whether the risks identified at Deepcut are replicated across the wider&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/14">training establishment</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/15" class="indent">&quot;and how these may relate to the issues of self-harm, suicide and undetermined deaths&quot;;</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/16">Secondly:</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/17" class="indent">&quot;How the Army's care regime may be further improved&quot;;</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/18">and thirdly:</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/19" class="indent">&quot;How independent oversight might help the Army define and maintain appropriate standards of care for young soldiers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/20">At the conclusion of a three-week inquest into the death of James Collinson, the jury returned an open verdict. Exercising his duty to report on matters where action should be taken to prevent the recurrence of fatalities, Her Majesty's coroner wrote to the Secretary of State, stating that</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/21" class="indent">&quot;because of the limited constraints of an inquest, there has to be some way of resolving the unease that there seems to be abroad about Deepcut.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/22">Expressing his respect for the armed forces, he said that</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/23" class="indent">&quot;they deserve that these matters be addressed thoroughly and independently so that rumour and speculation can be met head on.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/24">His personal view was that the MOD should take whatever steps necessary to restore public confidence in the recruitment and training of soldiers at Deepcut and elsewhere. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/25" class="indent">&quot;I personally believe that they should have nothing to fear from an inquiry held in public&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/26">Although Nicholas Blake does not back the families' call for a public inquiry, he argues for Deepcut families to be given complete disclosure of statements collected by Surrey police, as well as the opportunity to put new evidence before a judicial authority that can order fresh inquests. I welcome that proposal, but it does not address the Surrey coroner's view that an inquest will not satisfy the families or meet the public interest requirement for an effective investigation of these or other deaths. As the coroner has told the Secretary of State, his office does not have the expertise, resources or statutory powers needed to conduct such an investigation, so that alone is not the answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/27">The Minister knows that the problems that give rise to public concern and drive those pressing for an inquiry do not stop at the perimeter fence of Deepcut barracks. Truth, justice and change go together. Each theme constitutes an aspect of the public interest in holding an inquiry. In order to restore public confidence and rebuild the relationship of trust between the Army and public, the Secretary of State should consider the value of an inquiry that fully involves the families of the victims, and that is independent in character, judicial in authority and open to the public. An inquiry should be able to examine and make recommendations concerning all the agencies that need to be involved for the effective investigation of sudden deaths and all bodies that could help prevent them. It is bold; it is joined-up; it is a profoundly democratic solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/28">I want to clear up a couple of misconceptions. First, it is claimed that the Deepcut and Beyond families want 1,748 deaths to be investigated. As far back as the Adjournment debate in February 2003, Kevin McNamara pleaded with the Minister to provide statistics that would enable the headline figure of 1,748 deaths from non-natural causes between 1990 and 2003 to be broken down so that the scale of the problem could be accurately assessed. Deepcut and Beyond families repeated the point in evidence to the Select Committee on Defence, pointing out that an inquiry would be remiss if it failed to demand full disclosure of such information prior to conducting its own scoping exercise. I hope that the Minister will consider the statistical information available and see whether a breakdown can be given of the presumed causes of death and their locations.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/29">Secondly, I want to address the claim that an inquiry into Army deaths would be a disproportionate drain on the public purse. The Victoria Climbi&eacute; inquiry, headed by Lord Laming, revolutionised our thinking about child protection. It cost &pound;3.8 million. The Macpherson inquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence became the authority on institutional racism and changed the face of modern policing. It cost &pound;4.2 million. By comparison, the Army has responded to criticism of its regime for young recruits by investing an additional &pound;43 million in training. Last year alone, it spent &pound;33 million on recruitment advertising. What price can be put on restoring the confidence of mums and dads? What price can be put on justice?</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/30">The Deepcut and Beyond families group believes that a public inquiry into Army deaths, headed by a senior judge, would provide the best vehicle for achieving truth, justice and lasting change. They believe that such an inquiry would provide the best vehicle for the Government and the Army to work in partnership with families and learn from their experiences. They believe that such an inquiry, sitting in public, would provide the best opportunity to restore confidence in the Army and they urge the Government not to close their mind completely, but to keep the subject under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/31">The second question that I wish to address is what kind of independent oversight we need. I am delighted that Nicholas Blake QC placed his proposals for independent oversight at the centre of his recommendations. The review proposes introducing a legal requirement that all sudden deaths of Army personnel be referred to a coroner. It also proposes that the Ministry of Defence make funds available so that bereaved families can be advised and legally represented at inquests. Nicholas Blake has stated that failure to implement his proposals in full would shift the public interest towards a judicial inquiry, and the Minister will no doubt pay due regard to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/32">The Defence Committee has established the case for independent oversight of the armed services, and the Deepcut and Beyond families cogently put their detailed considerations to the Committee that considered the Armed Forces Bill. Let me, however, give the Minister some reassurances: the armed services have nothing to fear and everything to gain from establishing a robust mechanism for independent oversight. The Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland is recognised as a world leader in terms police accountability, and the chain of command of the Police Service of Northern Ireland has been not damaged by the ombudsman's effectiveness but immeasurably strengthened. The armed forces should set their standards of accountability at the level of a world leader.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/33">The effective operation of the armed forces does not require oversight with an independent element&mdash;it requires independent oversight full stop. The ombudsman or commissioner must be credible and able to operate without jurisdictional obstacles. His or her powers must be based on statutory authority. The commissioner should be a civilian, selected under an independent appointments procedure, who has independent tenure and their own premises outside the military estate. Legislation should guarantee sufficient funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/34">The oversight commissioner should be able to investigate any complaint referred to them and to initiate their own investigations, retrospectively if necessary, if they have reason to believe that it would be in the public interest to do so. The experience of oversight bodies in other countries suggests that problems with frivolous or vexatious complaints can be quite easily addressed through rules of procedure. The commissioner would not be in competition or conflict with the regular complaints mechanisms established through the chain of command or with other procedures that have been put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/35">The oversight commissioner will require sufficient powers so that their staff can operate effectively, including powers to enter barracks, seize documents and tap phones. Obstructing an investigation should be made a criminal offence. The commissioner should make an annual report to the Secretary of State, which should be laid before Parliament. In addition, they should publish research.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/36">The commissioner should be able to establish advisory bodies that involve people with particular expertise and skills. The experience of the Deepcut and Beyond families illustrates the value of involving families of service personnel to supplement the sources of information available to the commissioner. An independent families group could, for example, assist in establishing a lay visitor's panel to undertake inspections of barracks and military facilities. I hope that the Minister will take those comments into account when he examines proposals for the introduction of such a commissioner or ombudsman.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/37">How should we deal with deaths overseas? The Deepcut and Beyond families group has highlighted the absence of effective investigation when non-combat deaths occur overseas. The Royal Military Police are not seen as independent and lack the skills to conduct an investigation that would satisfy the requirements of the Human Rights Act 1998. There is rarely local civilian police involvement and there is no independent pathologist, no forensic expert and no opportunity for family involvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/38">Although we would expect an oversight commissioner to investigate deaths overseas when called on to do so, Nicholas Blake also looks, correctly, at strengthening existing mechanisms. Compulsory inquests or fatal accident inquiries would assist families in Scotland and Northern Ireland when the discretion of the procurator fiscal or coroner does not seem to have been exercised in the interests of further investigation. Nicholas Blake's proposal to bring the Royal Military Police under the scrutiny of Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary would lead naturally to consideration of further issues, such as the provision of adequate resources and the benefits of a human rights training programme in terms of the effective conduct of investigations into sudden and suspicious deaths.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/39">Will my hon. Friend therefore look into the manner in which non-combat deaths overseas are investigated? Will he consider meeting representatives of bereaved families to discuss their concerns and potential solutions? Many feel that the initial investigations, which sometimes took place some years ago, were totally inadequate.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/40">How far can we go in improving the exercise of the duty of care? Nicholas Blake misses the opportunity to draw a line under the recruitment of under-18s, but he makes several useful recommendations to assist the Army in exercising its duty of care, and I hope that they will be accepted as soon as possible. The Army should promote understanding and respect for human rights at all ranks, and the fundamental principle of human rights should be part of basic training.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/41">Let me mention some suggestions made by the families so that the Minister can consider them and reply in due course. First, there should be a mechanism to ensure parents' ongoing involvement in their children's welfare. Secondly, the Army should consider the means by which the Health and Safety Executive's jurisdiction can be extended to cover overseas bases and help protect against accidents. Thirdly, sustained action is needed to address the culture of alcohol abuse in the armed forces. Fourthly, attention needs to be given to shortcomings in the medical care regime and to its relationship with the chain of command, particularly where confidentiality issues arise. Fifthly, the Army should commission an independent study to monitor the experiences of soldiers who go absent without leave or who seek early discharge, with a view to publishing its findings and recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/42">Can we safeguard children and young soldiers at risk? The closed nature of the military establishment, the strict disciplinary regime and the absence of parental oversight make young soldiers particularly vulnerable to the attention of sexual predators. Deepcut and Beyond families point to the conviction in August 2003 of a former lance corporal and serial abuser, Leslie Skinner, who was initially charged with male rape and later convicted of multiple charges of indecent assault. Those offences were committed while he was employed as a non-commissioned officer trainer at Deepcut barracks in 1996 and 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/43">Leslie Skinner's history is well known, and several hon. Members want to participate in the debate, so I shall not go into detail. I note, however, that the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill, currently under consideration in the House of Lords, provides for an effective checking and vetting regime that could result in practical mechanisms for barring individuals from contact with children. It gives substance to the Government's commitment to ensuring that children stay safe, which is one of the five thematic outcomes of &quot;Every Child Matters&quot;. Although some recruits might fall outside the target group of children and young people aged between nought and 19, it is already recognised that the age range of the at-risk group might extend to 25 years where there are special or additional needs. Will the Minister take the opportunity presented by the Bill to ensure that young recruits are afforded further protection?</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/44">In a debate in the other place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-19">19 April</phrase>, Lord Ashley of Stoke recalled that almost 20 years before, when the Army's reputation was threatened by brutality, bullying and vicious initiation rites, he had proposed that there should be an independent ombudsman. He recalled how he had argued on <phrase class="date" code="1987-11-02">2 November 1987</phrase> that that would be</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/45" class="indent">&quot;the best way of transforming the Army ethos and of restoring its reputation.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-19">19 April 2006</phrase>; Vol. 680, c. 1116.]</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/46">Lord Ashley explained that the then Minister had responded to such calls with the by now familiar message that bullying is a serious offence, that it forms no part of proper service life and that the Government are clear that it cannot be tolerated.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/47">Surrey police, the Surrey coroner, Nicholas Blake and all who have had cause to look into the regime of &quot;horrendous bullying&quot;, &quot;foul abuse&quot; and &quot;sexual harassment&quot; at Deepcut barracks have expressed shock that the situation was allowed to persist for so long. The warning bells have been sounded. Proposals have been made. Now is the time for action. The Armed Forces Bill provides a timely legislative opening to introduce a series of reforms demonstrating a commitment to change that will support the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/48">In spite of all the concerns that I have raised and those that I have read about, our armed forces do us proud. They go abroad in our defence and look after our interests. Now is the time for us to look after their interests as well.</p>

	<p pid="a.483.1/1">I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase> on securing this debate. I also pay tribute to the parents of the four young recruits who died at Deepcut barracks. My comments will be expressly on the issues involving Deepcut, for those are the ones that I know best.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/2">The Deepcut parents have been forced to fight a passionate and painful campaign to get answers to questions to which they have a fundamental right to have answers&mdash;namely, how and why their children died. From the start, the Deepcut parents have conducted themselves with enormous dignity and astonishing courage. I am sure that all hon. Members recognise that and pay their respects to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/3">The publication of the Blake inquiry has been a long-awaited step in the long and slow march towards truth and disclosure. I have a strong view about where we are and what needs to happen next. The families need to be given due time to absorb the Blake report fully, and I am concerned that the Government have not yet done that. The parents remain grateful to Mr. Blake for his work in compiling his review, although they have reservations about some of his recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/4">The families are disappointed at the Government's apparent insistence that the case is somehow now closed. They have been in that position before, having been told that everything had been done that could be done and that to keep on campaigning would be futile. However, the families have kept on, and have edged ever closer to what seems to be truth. In retrospect, it seems plausible to imagine that the Government decided beforehand that the Blake review would be their last action in relation to Deepcut.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/5">My first question is therefore whether it is the Government's intention to regard the Blake inquiry as &quot;case closed&quot;. If so, it would be a bad mistake both in the public interest, for many of the reasons that the hon. Lady highlighted, and out of respect for the wishes of the parents, who after all deserve breathing space as they seek to absorb such a massive report. Des James, my constituent and the father of Cheryl James, who died at Deepcut barracks, has wondered whether he made a mistake by acting in good faith and going along with the Blake inquiry. He feels that the Government are trying to foist closure on him and the other Deepcut parents before they have even had time to absorb the report fully and publish their own conclusions.</p>

	<p pid="a.483.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, had the care, communication and co-operation between different services that Mr. Blake outlines in his report been fully in place at the time when our constituents' children died at Deepcut, we would be in a better position now? Does he acknowledge that there has been any progress in the Army, particularly on the care and communication front?</p>

	<p pid="a.484.0/1">There has been progress, but that does not take away from the need to get an answer on what happened in the past. Every time I and other hon. Members who have been involved in the campaign have pushed the Government, more information has come out. That is one reason why I am concerned that we should not pretend that Mr. Blake's inquiry is an end to the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.0/2">On the same point, Mr. Blake extracted yet more detail about the deaths and the culture at Deepcut than the parents or Surrey police were aware of. He found &quot;foul abuse of trainees&quot;, and evidence that sex had been used &quot;as a passport&quot;. Bearing in mind the limited nature of Mr. Blake's investigation, it is possible&mdash;indeed, probable&mdash;that we still do not know the whole story.</p>

	<p pid="a.484.1/1">As someone who has read the entire report, does the hon. Gentleman agree that it would be difficult now to find some of the evidence that might be needed, either because it has been destroyed or because some procedures in place at the time were, to say the least, lackadaisical? Trying to get to the truth of some of those deaths will be very difficult.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.484.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" speakername="Lembit pik" colnum="484"  time="014:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h03.htm#60503h03_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.484.2/1">I agree, but that is exactly why we need a full and independent public inquiry with the power legally to require witnesses to turn up. We are certainly not going to get the answers to which the hon. Gentleman refers if we adopt a voluntary, come-forward-if-you-dare process, which was more or less the constraint forced upon Mr. Blake.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/2">The crucial point is that Mr. Blake did not have the power to compel witnesses to stand. With the Blake review, the families have had to accept that everyone who knew details or factors relating to the deaths stepped forward voluntarily. I do not believe that that was the case, however, and it is hardly surprising that the families remain cautious about the conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/3">Before the Blake review, the families believed that a properly conducted public inquiry, with the power to compel witnesses to appear, was the only way of truly getting to the bottom of the Deepcut deaths. They continue to feel that way, so my second question is whether the Government are at least willing to hear representations from the parents about their views on the case for a public inquiry? It would be a cold-hearted Government indeed who were not willing to enter that dialogue.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/4">The Ministry of Defence is adamant that the problems that affected Deepcut so severely are things of the past&mdash;that relates to what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> said. However, according to the latest Army continuous attitude survey&mdash;the Army's own survey&mdash;8 per cent. of soldiers say that they have been bullied in the past 12 months; that is more than 7,000 personnel. Of those soldiers who complained about unfair treatment, discrimination, harassment or bullying, 77 per cent. were not satisfied with the way the complaint was handled.</p>

	<p pid="a.485.1/1">I would like to, but I know that the hon. Lady wishes to catch your eye, Mrs. Anderson, and I must be a little self-disciplined with my time keeping.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/2">In his summation, Mr. Blake expressed the hope that the lessons of Deepcut could be learned. In light of that, I am joining the calls made by other hon. Members for the Government to move immediately to establish an armed forces ombudsman, as the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood suggested. My third question is, therefore, what the Minister's view is on that recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/3">I stress that the families need time to absorb fully the contents of Mr. Blake's report. They should be given the space to take in the conclusions and recommendations. Then they will have the space and the time to make a formal response to the report. It is vital that the families receive as much information as possible about the deaths of their children. It is a scandal that the evidence given to the Devon and Cornwall constabulary in its review of Surrey police's activities has not been made available to the parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/4">We should remember that the Devon and Cornwall investigation took two years. Surrey police had plenty of time to devise a satisfactory means of disclosure but failed to do so. As a result, the Deepcut parents have still not had access to the 150-page report, a full seven months after Devon and Cornwall constabulary published a three-page executive summary.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/5">In my view there has been a deliberate culture of secrecy, with the parents being prevented from seeing that full report and the ludicrous referral of a member of the Surrey police authority, Mr. Terry Dicks, to the standards boards of England for daring to request a copy of the report. I note that the chair and the vice-chair of the authority, who have no more legal status than the authority, were given copies; that indicates that something has gone wrong with the process. My fourth question is whether the Minister will investigate the circumstances surrounding the withholding of that report and other supportive information. It was used by Mr. Blake, and it was used by Surrey police to produce a short summary, but it has not been shown to others, including the parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/6">Finally, one of Mr. Blake's chief recommendations was that</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/7" class="indent">&quot;agreement should be reached as to any further disclosure needed to enable the families of Sean Benton, Cheryl James and Geoff Gray to consider whether a fresh inquest into their respective child's death is in the interests of justice.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/8">The Deepcut affair has exposed the secretive and opaque nature of police and military culture. The parents have had to fight every step of the way to get closer to the truth of what happened to their children. To regain the trust of the Deepcut families, and, significantly, of the public, the police need to operate in an more open and transparent manner. They should share, not block, access to information contained in the Devon and Cornwall police report.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/9">I call on the Minister to work with his colleagues in the Home Office to ensure that the Devon and Cornwall police report is disclosed in full to the parents of those who died at Deepcut. Only when the parents have seen all the evidence can they decide how best to continue their campaign. As the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood pointed out, the coroner said that matters needed to be investigated thoroughly and independently and that the authorities should have nothing to fear from a full inquiry. The Minister should explain why the Government and the police are not taking that recommendation seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/10">I have not enjoyed pushing endlessly for the Government to take a more open and transparent approach towards the four tragic deaths at the Deepcut Army barracks. However, given the litany of failings exposed at each turn, I am more convinced than ever that it was right to do so. I do not enjoy the prospect of applying ever more pressure on the Government to get to the bottom of the unanswered questions and to get Ministers to share reports that have been kept secret until now, allegedly to protect individual identities, despite the fact that disclosure could easily have been arranged in a way that protected those identities.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/11">In the interests of scotching further rumours that the official story has been covered up, and to ensure that everyone can have full faith in the investigations of Surrey police and others, I ask the Minister to assure the House that he will consider full disclosure of the reports. Either way, the Government can be assured that the issue will not go away until those questions are answered.</p>

	<p pid="a.486.0/1">I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase> for securing this debate, and for her tenacious campaigning on behalf of Deepcut and Beyond. I also pay tribute to Deepcut and Beyond; I have had the privilege of meeting the group on a number of occasions in my role as a member of the Select Committee on Defence and, more recently, as a member of the Committee considering the Armed Forces Bill. That determined group of individuals has done a great public service by exposing some of the most horrendous cases of bullying and by asking questions on matters that have been covered up by the military for far too long.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.0/2">I support the armed forces not least because many young recruits come from my constituency and the north-east&mdash;and they are proud to serve in the armed forces. However, I am not proud of the way in which some people have been treated in the armed forces. The Deepcut and Beyond group of families has exposed some problems, and not only at Deepcut; as my hon. Friend said, Mrs. Farr and others are continuing their work by helping new recruits at Catterick.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.0/3">In the last Parliament, I had the privilege of being a member of the Defence Committee when it considered the duty of care that the three armed forces have for youngsters in their charge. The inquiry lasted a year and took evidence not only from families but from the three armed forces. The Committee's report is a definitive work on the way in which such youngsters are looked after. As an historic reference, some past practices were appalling. The Committee heard not only how the Deepcut families were treated but heard shocking evidence of how others had been treated and how they were dealt with afterwards. There has been an improvement in the way in which the armed forces handle things&mdash;for instance, in what they should do if people die while in the forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.0/4">Recently, I moved new clause 24 to the Armed Forces Bill, in which I called for an independent commissioner to oversee complaints against the armed forces. Without such a commissioner, the reputation of the armed forces, which has been damaged, will continue to fall. The Bill gives us the opportunity to put matters right. I withdrew the new clause because the Blake report was due to be published the following afternoon, and I did not want to pre-empt it. I was assured by the Minister that the Government would consider those issues as the Bill went through Parliament and in their response to the Blake report.</p>

	<p pid="a.487.0/1">I agree that appointing an armed forces ombudsman would be a good move. Does my hon. Friend not also agree that such a person's remit should require local police forces to provide for disclosure? Today, I received a letter from the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety saying that it was entirely a matter for Surrey police whether to disclose all the evidence to Mr. and Mrs. Gray in my constituency and to the other families of those who have died.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.487.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" speakername="Kevan Jones" colnum="487"  time="015:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h03.htm#60503h03_spnew12">
	<p pid="a.487.1/1">That is an important point. It is not only the armed forces that have no credit as a result of Deepcut; neither do the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.1/2">I welcome the fact that a new protocol allows the police to have primacy in investigating such deaths. That is an important move. Part of the problem with Deepcut was the initial investigation into the four deaths. When the families subsequently asked quite reasonable questions, they were blocked. That led to an air of suspicion. If I was in their position, I would have come to the same conclusion that they did.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.1/3">I have read the Blake report, and it is a good piece of work. My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood knows that I do not support another inquiry into the Deepcut deaths. The Blake report exposed the details of four very different cases. We should grasp its recommendations, especially that on independent oversight. Putting in place an independent commissioner or ombudsman would be a monument to the campaigning work of Deepcut and Beyond, and a fitting tribute to the four who died.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.1/4">One issue that has not received much attention is the role of the media. Blake is critical of how the media reported the deaths, especially in the early stages. It is sad that certain newspapers have not held up their hands and come clean, admitting that they made mistakes. Those mistakes not only led to confusion but hurt the families of those who died. To be fair, Blake pulls no punches in his criticism of one national newspaper.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.1/5">The British armed forces have the opportunity to regain their reputation. People should not be afraid. Other armed forces around the world, forces with which our armed forces regularly train and go to war, have independent oversight. Such oversight would ensure confidence among the young men and women who join the armed forces, and their families, that problems and complaints will be independently investigated. That will improve the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.1/6">The same arguments were put forward several years ago before we had the independent police complaints commission. Speak now to any chief constable, and they will say that it has improved the way they operate; it has not been a hindrance but has improved how they investigate and treat their recruits, and how they interact with the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.1/7">Finally, I turn to the evidence given to the Armed Forces Bill Committee by the Deepcut and Beyond families. It headed its evidence &quot;openness and transparency&quot;. That is what is needed in the British armed forces today. If during the passage of the Armed Forces Bill an ombudsman or commissioner is put in place, along with openness and transparency in respect of all information, that will go a long way towards satisfying some of the calls that there have rightly been, and it will be a fitting tribute to the sterling campaigning work of the Deepcut and Beyond families.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.488.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" speakername="Pete Wishart" colnum="488"  time="015:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h03.htm#60503h03_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.488.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Anderson. I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase> for securing the debate and for diligently looking after her fellow members of the all-party group on army deaths. Kevin McNamara is a hard act to follow, but she has done it admirably and I hope the group will go from strength to strength.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.0/2">Because of my constituency interests, I will confine my remarks to events at Deepcut barracks. I have been the constituency MP for Jim and Yvonne Collinson for the past year and have solidly backed them, and all the other families involved, in their campaign to secure a full judicial public inquiry into why their son, James, died.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.0/3">Like all the families involved in the Deepcut campaign, Jim and Yvonne Collinson want only one thing: to find out how and why their son died. Like all the families involved in the campaign, they want, as far as is humanly possible after the tragic loss of a teenage son, to move on so that they can get their lives back together; they want some sort of closure so that they can start to live the rest of their lives. Jim and Yvonne have endured much over the past few years, and in recent months their lives have been a rollercoaster; first, there was the public inquest into the death of their son James at a Surrey court, and then a few weeks ago the Blake report was published.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.0/4">I attended some of the inquiry hearings, and I found them fascinating. I know that &quot;fascinating&quot; is not a word that Jim and Yvonne would use to describe how they felt; they had to endure details about the conditions and situations that led to their son's tragic death. However, it was a fascinating inquiry; it was a very robust and thorough examination of the circumstances surrounding James Collinson's death.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.0/5">The families are the biggest stakeholders in this process, and I have spoken to Jim and Yvonne about that. It is for them that we take this issue forward, and in order to help them secure justice, we continue to call for a public inquiry, which would eventually get to the heart of the matter of how their children so tragically died.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.0/6">However, we seem to be further than ever from securing a judicial public inquiry. Following the Blake report, the Government appear to have started to dig their heels in. Ministers have suggested that it is now time to move on, and that we should leave the sorry chapter of what happened at the Deepcut barracks behind us. That is a hopeless and pious wish. How can we possibly move on when there is still a huge question mark hanging over the deaths of four young people? This issue will not go away until we finally find out what happened at Deepcut barracks that led to three young men and one young woman taking their lives. These tragic events are too serious to move on from. The campaign for a full judicial public inquiry will continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.0/7">The public inquest into James Collinson's death was significant. It was the first of four inquests held in public in front of a coroner. A jury was given the opportunity to give a verdict, and there was opportunity for counsel to cross-examine. It was a robust and thorough hearing, and we learned more and more about what happened at Deepcut barracks. However, like everything else in the history of Deepcut&mdash;like all the other 17 or so reports, investigations and inquiries looking into Deepcut&mdash;it was essentially flawed and ultimately unsatisfactory. Like all the previous inquiries, it could go so far but it could not tell us everything. The public inquest into the death of James Collinson was hampered by the fact that it had solely and exclusively to focus on the death of James Collinson. Therefore, we lost the interconnectedness with all the other deaths at Deepcut. It was as if we were examining James Collinson's death without a context. In that way, it was totally unsatisfactory in trying to find out conclusively what happened at Deepcut.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.0/8">There was a lot of new evidence about what happened. We learned more about the culture of the place; we heard allegations of bullying, and of the almost incompetent negligence that led to four teenagers handling lethal weapons, which, it was suggested, ultimately took their lives. We heard more about difficulties in the police investigations, such as the unsatisfactory manner of Surrey police's initial investigations, and the almost negligent way that some of the autopsies were carried out. However, because of the limitations of its terms of reference, the inquiry was just another milestone in respect of Deepcut. It was no more than that; it could not tell us everything.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.0/9">In common with the inquests into the other deaths, an open verdict was recorded. The jury returned that verdict. Suicide was once again ruled out, and the open verdict suggested that there is still a lot more to learn about the death of James Collinson. Hope was given to all of us who have been campaigning for a full judicial and public inquiry when the coroner, Michael Burgess, suggested that we should have such an inquiry. He gave the strongest possible suggestion that a public inquiry would be not only in the families' interests but in the interests of the Ministry of Defence and the public. It is worth reminding ourselves of what he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.488.0/10" class="indent">&quot;the MoD should take whatever steps are necessary to restore public confidence in the recruitment and training of young soldiers whether at Deepcut or elsewhere. I personally believe that they should have nothing to fear from an inquiry held in public . . . where the various issues outside the direct causation of the deaths of James and others can be explored in greater depth. I personally believe that they should have nothing to fear from an inquiry held in public . . . where the various issues (outside the direct causation of the deaths of James and others) can be explored in greater depth&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.0/11">I had a little exchange with the Secretary of State about what the coroner meant by those remarks. It is clear to me that he is saying that it would be in the MOD's interests to have a full public inquiry. I know, because it was said to Yvonne Collinson, that that is the coroner's view. It could be supported by Surrey police if officers were asked about a conversation they had at the time of that inquest.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.0/12">No sooner had the public inquest concluded than we had the Nicholas Blake report. Like everybody else, I believe that Nicholas Blake went about his business assiduously; the report is a diligent, professional piece of work that was robust and extensive. I see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> has a copy of it&mdash;all 400 pages of it. Nicholas Blake did his work well. He painted in a few pictures about what happened at Deepcut barracks; the report detailed some of the bullying that took place, and there were serious new allegations about sexual harassment. It told us a lot, but it could not tell us everything. It was like the 17 or so earlier reports in that it went so far into telling us what happened at Deepcut but could not tell us everything.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.0/13">The Blake report was hampered by the fact that it was entirely voluntary. He could not subpoena anyone to give evidence. There was no opportunity for anybody to cross-examine anything said. There was no jury; there was just Nicholas Blake and whoever he was taking evidence from. In that respect, it was ultimately flawed in its terms of reference and what it could do.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.0/14">The headline of the Blake report was his conclusion that no public inquiry was required, and his assertion that those young people were bullied to death. However, although he was good at detailing how these young people came to their deaths, he could not satisfactorily explain why they took their lives, and, looking at the evidence, it is hard to decide that.</p>

	<p pid="a.490.0/1">With respect to the hon. Gentleman, from conversations I have had with families, it is clear that sometimes we will never know what happened to their children. That is a hard fact that we may have to face. Does the hon. Gentleman think a public inquiry at this distance in time could achieve all that he is claiming it could achieve?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.490.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" speakername="Pete Wishart" colnum="490"  time="015:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h03.htm#60503h03_spnew15">
	<p pid="a.490.1/1">Of course the hon. Lady is right. The Blake report goes so far in revealing what happened, but it could not do everything. However, a public inquiry could. I believe a public inquiry is the best, most effective tool to determine and understand what happened at Deepcut barracks. I hope that the campaign for one continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/2">What was most intriguing about the Blake report was the Government's response. As I have said, they have suggested that we move on. I think it was the Minister of State for the Armed Forces, who, surprisingly, is not present today, who said that the families should have no veto on this issue. I think the families are the most important stakeholders, and their views should be paramount in respect of how we take the issue forward. I hope that the Under-Secretary who is present does not share his colleague's view; I would like to hear his view on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/3">There were good recommendations in the Blake report, and I heard Blake say in the media that if all his recommendations were not implemented in full, he would back the call for a public inquiry. That is a challenge to Government to make sure that all the important recommendations, including the key one about an ombudsman, are implemented in full.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/4">We would all agree&mdash;including the families, the Ministry of Defence and those with an interest in military issues&mdash;that we want an end to this affair. I am relatively new to the subject&mdash;I took over as Yvonne and Jim Collinson's MP at the last general election, so I have been dealing with the subject for a year&mdash;but there will be a stage when we start to put the matter behind us. In response to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase>, the best way to get a conclusion on the subject would be to have that full, public inquiry. The shadow cast by Deepcut will remain until the matter of the deaths is finally dealt with. The campaign for a full public inquiry is as strong as ever, and the furore surrounding Deepcut will not end until that public inquiry is granted.</p>

	<p pid="a.491.0/1">Thank you for allowing me to take part in this debate, Mrs. Anderson. I would like to make representations on behalf of Norma Langford, whose son Corporal Ian Holt died in Belize on non-combat duty. She gave evidence on duty of care to the Select Committee on Defence, and I am told by people who were there that she was extremely good and very eloquent. She is a doughty campaigner, and she comes to my surgeries frequently to keep me up to date on what has happened and where the campaign is at. She wrote to me recently to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/2" class="indent">&quot;Many overseas deaths have not been investigated properly; QC Blake's Deepcut Review supports this in paragraph 12.30 where he points out 'Where the Royal Military Police . . . has primacy for an investigation, the quality of the investigation may vary according to resources, training and the context of the investigation.'</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/3" class="indent">Many families have records showing the inadequacy of an investigation that has taken place overseas with only SIB/RMP&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/4">that is, the special investigation branch and the Royal Military Police&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/5" class="indent">&quot;investigating the death, and even if there have been civilian police involved families do not have access to their records.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/6" class="indent">These families feel their only hope of having the deaths investigated adequately and learning the true facts of how their family member died is to have a public inquiry.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/7">Although she says &quot;public inquiry&quot;, I am aware that she would be happy with what could be described as a thorough investigation. She ends:</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/8" class="indent">&quot;These soldiers served their country at home and abroad, my son served nine years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. Surely it is time for the Ministry of Defence to grace their deaths with a full and thorough investigation.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.491.1/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the issues raised by Mrs. Langford and others is the fact that families are not allowed to attend Army inquests? That leads to the idea that there is something to cover up. My hon. Friend may like to know that the Select Committee on the Armed Forces Bill recommends that the family be allowed to attend as a matter of course. Does he think that that would help, at least in allowing people to get the facts at an early stage?</p>

	<p pid="a.492.0/1">Yes, I entirely agree, because many people concerned feel that things have been covered up. More openness and transparency in the system would go a long way towards convincing them that everybody was doing their bit.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.0/2">My question on behalf of Norma is as follows: the Minister has stated that there will not be a public inquiry into non-combat deaths, so will the Ministry of Defence afford new investigations to families that have not had an adequate investigation, or perhaps an independent review into the deaths of their loved ones? The Select Committee on the Armed Forces Bill, of which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> is a member, suggested an independent commissioner, and that is probably the way ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.492.1/1">Thank you for allowing me to contribute to this debate, Mrs. Anderson. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase> on securing it, and on the way in which she presented her case. It has been a thoughtful and interesting debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/2">Families put their trust in the Army to care for their children, and, as we know, in many cases soldiers are children. Many are plucked straight from school, from which they could return to the comfort of their homes every night. The change is a shock in itself. The new regime can be trying to even the most hardened. We all appreciate that serving in our armed forces is no picnic. Preparing for the brutalities of war requires preparation, endeavour, grit and talent. Young men and women return from the Army, having left only a few months earlier as boys and girls.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/3">According to Amnesty International, between 1990 and 2003 some 1,748 members of the UK armed forces lost their lives through non-natural causes in or around barracks. Of those, 200 deaths were self-inflicted. Between 1984 and 2005, some 638 suicides occurred amongst members of the UK regular armed forces. Overall, the male suicide rates in the UK armed forces were statistically lower than in the general UK population. The exception was among Army males aged under 20, who had an increased risk of about 50 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/4">Often, we can only speculate on the reasons for each of those deaths, but perhaps there are a few indicators. Last year's Army continuous attitude survey found that two out of three soldiers do not feel valued by the Army, and one in four say that their morale is low or very low. Over half of all soldiers are not satisfied with their accommodation, and 44 per cent. say that Army life is worse or much worse than they expected. A staggering 8 per cent. of soldiers say that they have been bullied in the past 12 months. That equates to more than 7,000 personnel. Crucially, of those soldiers who complained about unfair treatment, discrimination, harassment or bullying in the past 12 months, 77 per cent. were not satisfied with how the complaint was handled.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/5">The deaths at Deepcut have sent shockwaves throughout the armed forces, the Ministry of Defence, the Government and indeed this House. As we know, the Blake report made 34 important recommendations and suggested that there were systemic failings. I will list five of those failings: there was poor appreciation of the needs of recruits under the age of 18; there were poor supervision levels, often as low as 1:60; there was bullying; there were high levels of dissatisfaction and extremely low morale; and, finally, there were poor grievance procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/6">So what should our response be? The Liberal Democrats have welcomed the Blake report and call for full and rapid implementation of its recommendations. There are 34 serious recommendations that require a serious and prompt response. When will we hear a full report in response? I was pleased to read that Lord Drayson has given a commitment to reporting back quickly. He said that would happen &quot;within months&quot;. Well, one of those months has already passed. I would welcome an indication of how that consideration is progressing, and roughly when we can expect a full response.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/7">The Liberal Democrats agree that a public inquiry is not necessary provided that the families have access to all the reports and evidence. In recommendation 3, Blake examines whether it is right for the UK to be one of the few countries that recruits child soldiers&mdash;that is, those under 18. We have had international criticism for that policy. The review says that recruiting needs are not a satisfactory justification, but goes on to say that the policy is justified given the inadequacies of education and training in the UK's civilian system. The report says that although the education benefits outweigh the downside of having child soldiers, a number of special safeguards are required. The first is the separation of 16 year-olds; the second is a right to resign for those still in training, even those who have passed their 18th birthday; the third and most important is that no posting to the field Army should occur before the age of 18. Do the Government intend to implement those immediately?</p>

	<p pid="a.493.0/1">I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman saying what the Liberal Democrats want to put forward, but there were two occasions on which they could have influenced the matter. First, when the Select Committee put together its report, the Liberal Democrat Member very rarely attended. The second and most recent occasion was when we considered the Armed Forces Bill. The Liberal Democrat Front Bencher rarely attended that, too, and did not put forward any recommendations, but the hon. Gentleman is now saying what the Government should do. Will he tell me why they missed those opportunities?</p>

	<p pid="a.493.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that when we quote statistics we have to be careful to reflect the trend?

	<p pid="a.494.0/1">I am sure that the trend is going in the right direction, but we cannot get away from the fact that just last year, the survey found that soldiers were dissatisfied with their accommodation.

	<p pid="a.494.2/1">I agree. That finding of the report is completely unsatisfactory and action is required in that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.2/2">Liberal Democrats also want to improve supervision levels so that vulnerable young people can be monitored and supported effectively. We support the setting up of an independent complaints commission for the armed forces. Recommendation 26 calls for the establishment of a commissioner of military complaints&mdash;an armed forces ombudsman for all the armed forces, not just for trainees.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.2/3">The Armed Forces Bill has a watered-down proposal for an independent element in redress procedures. The Blake review has a much more useful recommendation, which would address growing concern among the armed forces that their views on their conditions are just ignored. I suggest to the Minister that this is the opportunity to take an imaginative approach. Will he undertake to implement recommendation 24, which states that the Royal Military Police should be brought formally under Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary?</p>
	<p pid="a.494.2/4">Will measures to vet and train instructors be implemented, for the protection of young people? A number of important recommendations could be implemented by the Ministry of Defence now, and we are pressing for early implementation. If the recommendations of the report are fully implemented, closure may be achieved. If any good is to come from the terrible, tragic events at Deepcut, the MOD needs either to respond and transfer all resources necessary to make its under-18 training regime safe, or to consider whether it can continue to recruit such young people into the Army.</p>

	<p pid="a.494.3/1">This is the first time I have had the pleasure of serving under your chairmanship, Mrs. Anderson. I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the work she does as chairman of the all-party group, the work of which I know hon. Members support.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/2">The hon. Lady and others have understandably focused on the investigation stage of the process and what has happened since the deaths, but I shall focus on some issues raised in the Blake review, which others have mentioned, concerning events leading up to the deaths. In other words, what could the Ministry of Defence do better to avoid deaths in the first place, thus avoiding going through the investigation process?</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/3">As many hon. Members have done, I pay tribute on behalf of the Opposition to all members of our armed forces who serve their country with distinction, and to their families, who provide a great deal of support for that service. In return, we owe them a thorough debate and a thorough consideration of the Blake recommendations to ensure that they have the very best possible conditions of service.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/4">It is worth saying that the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces face a considerable challenge. As has been said, the armed forces recruit people who are sometimes from very challenging backgrounds, many of whom are under 18, and the forces have to turn them into professional soldiers. That requires a robust training regime. A regime that was not robust would not do proper service to those young people because it would subject them to difficult and challenging conditions without the proper training and without equipping them to deal with what are often life-threatening situations. A difficult balance must be undertaken. There must be a tough and robust training regime to ensure that those young people are ready for combat, but we must also ensure that the duty of care is properly fulfilled. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">The hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> drew attention to the thorough report that the Select Committee on Defence produced on the duty of care, which thoroughly considered these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/5">The Opposition support the continuation of recruitment of those who are under 18: they make a tremendous contribution to the armed forces. The Blake report said that a number of things could be done prior to recruitment as part of the recruitment process, and I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments. In at least two of the Deepcut cases, there was a known&mdash;though not known to the Army&mdash;history of self-harm. Will the Minister to comment on what progress has been made on improving the knowledge that the Army has of the medical histories of recruits? To what extent can that knowledge be better taken into account when people are recruited, either to make appropriate decisions about recruitment, or, just as importantly, if recruits are at risk and are still thought right for the armed forces, to ensure that they are given appropriate care during their training and service?</p>

	<p pid="a.495.0/1">I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but does he accept that self-harm is quite prevalent among young people in this country? The issue for those of us who have campaigned about the Deepcut Army barracks does not relate to the individual problems of a particular recruit, but to the fact that there still seems to be secrecy surrounding the facts relating to the four deaths that took place there. In our judgment at least, a degree of cover-up of the facts is still involved.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.495.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="495"  time="015:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h03.htm#60503h03_spnew28">
	<p pid="a.495.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I shall come in a few moments to some of the points about the family's view of the investigations.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.1/2">The other element of the training and supervisory regime to which attention has been drawn was the proper ratio between trainees and those in charge of their supervision. Blake notes that that ratio was at times only 1:60. In 2004, the then Secretary of State for Defence said that a target of 1:38 was being achieved. It would be helpful if the Minister told us whether that ratio is being achieved. Is it being achieved at all locations, through the day and night? If we have not yet achieved it, what progress is being made towards attaining it?</p>
	<p pid="a.495.1/3">Regarding the investigations, however well we improve and implement recruitment and training, and whatever the level of supervision, it is inevitable that there will be deaths in Army barracks in future. Some will be accidental and some will not. When they occur, we need to ensure that the right processes are in place, so that families feel that their concerns are being addressed and the investigatory process should be as open as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.1/4">Comments have been made about who has primacy in an investigation. Blake drew attention to that, and a protocol was signed on <phrase class="date" code="">7 November</phrase> that made the position clear. However, given that there were already protocols in place that did not seem to be well understood by at least some police forces, it would be helpful to know what follow-up work is taking place to ensure that the protocol of <phrase class="date" code="">7 November</phrase> is well understood in the armed forces and constabularies throughout the country. We must ensure that such information is properly communicated and well understood. If any such tragedies occur in future, that protocol should be in place right from the beginning.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.1/5">During any future investigation, the most important thing will be that families are kept fully informed and there must be transparency and openness. If that does not take place from the beginning and is neglected, as it was at Deepcut, families will suspect that there is something they are not being told and that there is a cover-up. I suspect that once they have that impression, nothing that can be done in the case of their loved ones can ever completely remove that sense of suspicion. I suspect that that is the situation now. I am not sure that anything can be done to satisfy completely the families of the four soldiers who lost their lives at Deepcut&mdash;a point to which one or two Members have alluded.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.1/6">In his statement about the Deepcut review, the Minister of State for the Armed Forces said that the Armed Forces Bill would provide the opportunity to implement a number of those changes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.496.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="496"  time="015:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h03.htm#60503h03_spnew30">
	<p pid="a.496.1/1">I am reluctant to give way, because I want to give time to the Minister to answer all queries, if the hon. Gentleman will forgive me.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.1/2">In the other place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-19">19 April</phrase>, Lord Drayson made a specific commitment. He said that the Government expected to be able to respond to all the recommendations from the Blake report within two months. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" name="Willie Rennie">the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie)</phrase> said, we are halfway through that process. It would be helpful if the Minister did not go through each recommendation in detail but gave us some idea about the progress that the Ministry of Defence has made and about whether we are on track to hear its full response to those 34 recommendations, as Lord Drayson said, by the end of May.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.1/3">The Armed Forces Bill is a vehicle to implement some of those changes. I understand that it will be back before the House in the week commencing <phrase class="date" code="">22 May</phrase>, which is only a couple of weeks away. That does not give the Ministry of Defence very long to publish any amendments to the legislation, so that Members may have a proper opportunity to study them. I should be grateful if the Minister outlined the Ministry of Defence's thinking about whether it will hit that timetable, and when in good time it intends to publish any amendments, so that the debate can take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.1/4">One thing that came out of studying the documents was that there has been a significant number of reports and investigations. A number of Members have today repeated the call for a public inquiry, and it is worth restating the Opposition's position, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1938" name="Liam Fox">my hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox)</phrase> laid out in response to the statement from the Minister of State.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.1/5">There are those who believe that a public inquiry is essential for restoring public confidence in the Army. I do not think that there is a general lack of confidence in the British Army. There may be specific anxieties, but I do not believe that a public inquiry would deal with them, nor, in particular, with some of the media reporting that would inevitably attend it. An inquiry would be a vehicle for ill-informed speculation that could make the situation worse. Given that some of the investigations were poorly handled in the first place, and given the suspicion at the beginning of the process, from the families' point of view, they may always quite understandably have a nagging suspicion that there is something that they have not been told. I am not convinced that a public inquiry would address that issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.497.1/1">If the hon. Lady will forgive me, I shall not, in order to allow the Minister time to respond.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.1/2">The Blake report into Deepcut should not be the end of the process. The end should be the Government's thorough implementation of the appropriate recommendations. A constant theme throughout the process has been the significant number of reports, and the Surrey police report stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.497.1/3" class="indent">&quot;the army has consistently identified issues of concern, but practical implementation of risk reduction measures has often not followed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.497.1/4">The finest tribute we can pay to those who have died is to ensure that the correct measures are put in place and action taken. We need to put in place systems that will address those problems, so that we never again have to debate the deaths of some very fine young people within our Army training establishments.</p>

	<p pid="a.497.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase> on securing this timely debate. She has been hard-working and assiduous in these matters for several years. I can testify that she has been hard-working and diligent from the number of questions that she has put to me. The whole House owes her a debt for the work that she has done. I acknowledge the many contributions that have been made during this important and wide-ranging debate and shall do my best to respond to as many as I can.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/2">I extend my sincere condolences to the families who have mourned that untimely loss of loved ones. I am sure that the expressions made by colleagues this afternoon underpin that. As I have emphasised to the House on many occasions, we take seriously our responsibility to ensure the well-being and safety of all our personnel. Each and every death is a tragedy in its own right. We must ensure that we learn the lessons from those tragic cases and do everything we can to ensure that such incidents do not happen again.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/3">There are approximately 190,000 people in our armed forces. Almost 102,000 are regular and full-time reserve members of the Army. Last year, almost 8,000 recruits passed through training to join the field Army. The vast majority will go on to enjoy rewarding and challenging careers in our services. They will eventually leave the Army equipped with a range of skills and experiences often far beyond their expectations when they signed up.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/4">The Army is extraordinarily successful at taking young people from all walks of life and backgrounds and quickly turning them into soldiers, positive role models and good citizens. The high-quality training that those young men and women receive delivers outstanding results, from war fighting, through peace-support and counter-terrorist operations, to a range of roles supporting the UK civilian community.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/5">That training bears fruit time and again in theatres of operation throughout a turbulent world: Iraq, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and the Balkans are all recent examples. But we must not and cannot be complacent. Many comments in today's discussion have focused on the review conducted by Nicholas Blake QC, which considered the circumstances surrounding the deaths of four young soldiers at Deepcut. The report concluded that although the Army did not cause any of the deaths, there were worrying failures to identify and address sources of risk. Importantly, Mr. Blake concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that bullying caused the deaths of those reviewed. However, he raised some important questions about the nature of the training environment at that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/6">We take those findings seriously. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces, who is, incidentally, in the Falkland Islands, made clear our response in his statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-29">29 March</phrase>. We are committed to a process of continuous improvement. The Deepcut review will add momentum to our programme of change. We fully acknowledge the weaknesses that the report identified, and appreciate the urgency required in putting them right.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/7">Several hon. Members have raised the need for a public inquiry into the deaths at Deepcut. The Deepcut review concluded that on the basis of current evidence, a public inquiry is not necessary. We share that view and, given the extensive investigations that have taken place, agree with the conclusion that nothing would be gained from a public inquiry. Considering the Deepcut review as a whole, the important thing is to learn the lessons, to continue to move forward and to provide the best possible welfare support for our young trainees.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/8">Nicholas Blake's report raised the issue of a military complaints commissioner, and it has been referred to today. We have been considering for some time how we can best ensure that our personnel have the confidence to raise a grievance and the assurance that their grievance will be dealt with quickly, effectively and fairly. Our underlying aim is for a complaints system that is right for the way in which our armed forces operate. The system must be fair, transparent, effective and prompt. It must more than anything be a system in which all service personnel have complete confidence. I am sure that everyone present shares that view.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/9">To that end, in Committee on the Armed Forces Bill we proposed improvements to our complaints system. I have no doubt that we will return to them on Report and Third Reading later this month. We are considering in detail Mr. Blake's recommendations about the complaints process. His proposal to establish a commissioner of military complaints will be rightly and properly considered under the auspices of the Bill. If colleagues will forgive me, I do not want to go any further down that track, because we will come to it on Report and Third Reading.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/10">I turn to the matter of family attendance at boards of inquiry, which currently are not open to members of the public or press, or to family members unless they are called as witnesses. As I said in Committee, there are two main reasons why families are not usually allowed to attend service inquiries. The first is that we think that having members of the public and family members at inquiries could inhibit witnesses from giving full and frank evidence. The second is that boards of inquiry could convene and adjourn several times over a number of months, possibly in different parts of the world. Ultimately, our concern is that the attendance of families at inquiries might prevent boards of inquiry from achieving their primary aims, which are to learn lessons and prevent similar incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/11">I reiterate a point that I made in Committee: a board of inquiry is not an inquest and cannot serve the same purpose as an inquest. Mr. Blake made specific recommendations concerning boards of inquiry, which we will examine carefully. I assure the House that we are considering in detail all the recommendations in the review, some of which are challenging and require significant consideration. As that work is ongoing, colleagues will understand that there is a limit to what I can say until we have carefully considered the review in its entirety. However, I am determined to see how Mr. Blake's recommendations can best be implemented without reducing the effectiveness of our necessarily robust and challenging military training environment. As soon as we are in a position to do so, we will publish in full our formal response to the Deepcut review.</p>

	<p pid="a.499.1/1">That is certainly our ambition. The Armed Forces Bill is returning to the House and if there are to be any amendments, we need to deal with them as soon as possible. That is what we are currently working to.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/2">Recently, a number of hon. Members have raised concerns on the issue of bullying and harassment in the Army, particularly regarding the troubling perception that there is a possible link between bullying and the number of non-combat deaths in the armed forces. Incidents of bullying, harassment and other inappropriate behaviour exist in society as a whole and can never be completely eliminated, but it is essential that we should do all we can to establish an environment in which they are deemed absolutely unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/3">Bullying is insidious, corrosive and totally against the principle of self-discipline and the concept of teamwork at the core of our armed forces. Soldiers are often asked to operate in a harsh environment, and training has to prepare them for that, but there is a distinct, although sometimes fine, line between a robust approach to training and to discipline and bullying. No one should be in any doubt which side of the line we expect our soldiers to tread. At every stage of their training and careers it is made clear to them all that bullying and harassment, in any form, are not tolerated. All recruits and trainees are offered clear guidance on the relevant processes so that any allegations of such unacceptable conduct can be investigated thoroughly and dealt with appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/4">It is a sad and unfortunate fact, and in our wider society, that the armed forces will never be able to eradicate the tragic incidence of suicide. We can, however, by careful management, pragmatic policies, better understanding and improved knowledge and education reduce the risks. The Army has updated its guidance and procedures on the prevention and management of suicide and self-harm. An Army suicide vulnerability risk management policy has also recently been introduced. It provides detailed and mandatory guidance to those in the chain of command about how to identify those at risk and how to manage and care for them proactively.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/5">Work on suicide risk management is continuing on a tri-service basis in relation to prevention, screening, reporting, data collection, training and education. In the past 18 months, multi-disciplinary service and civilian groups have been set up to promote good practice and mental well-being across the armed forces. We are continually working to improve the support available to individuals, especially through accessible, professional welfare services operating to common defence standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/6">More generally, we are committed to the well-being and safety of all our personnel. That is a fundamental responsibility for individuals throughout the chain of command from the moment they join the armed forces. In the early days of an individual's career, we recognise the vital role of our instructors at service training establishments. We already have work in hand to improve the training provided to them through the development of the &quot;train the trainer&quot; programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/7">Support to personnel is provided in the first instance by the military staff of the recruits' training teams. In addition, every unit has a comprehensive welfare system which is widely publicised. There is a network of agencies including chaplains, WRVS volunteers, and unit welfare officers. Personnel also have access to single service confidential helplines and the Samaritans helpline, so a range of measures are in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/8">I shall address some of the points raised by my colleagues. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood, who initiated the debate, and tell her that we continue to improve our complaints procedure, which we will make more robust. She was, perhaps, a little unfair to the Royal Military Police, who execute their duties professionally. No system is perfect, and there are glitches and difficulties from time to time, but on the whole they do a good job.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/9">I will study points one to five that my hon. Friend made and, if it helps, will willingly invite her to meet me and discuss them in detail. Perhaps we can work together to take forward her hopes and aspirations in relation to this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/10">My hon. Friend also asked about the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill. I have written to my hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills indicating that we completely support the Bill. When it is enacted, it will help us with our military training.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit pik">The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> spoke passionately about the families whom he has been supporting. I do not think that we have ever said that there is closure on this matter. We will respond to Blake, and judgments will have to be made on whether anything further can or should be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/12">I pay tribute to the important comments made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase>. He also made some excellent comments in our debates on the Armed Forces Bill, and we have benefited from his help and advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/13"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" name="Pete Wishart">The hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> raised some issues. I certainly understand the Collinson family's desire for closure. However, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> said, even a public inquiry might not tell people exactly how their children died. If it were in my power to do that, I would, but I am not certain that it is achievable.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/14">I recently wrote to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1636" name="Jim Dobbin">my hon. Friend the Member for Heywood and Middleton (Jim Dobbin)</phrase> and followed up my correspondence yesterday in further discussions with him.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/15"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">The hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> raised a number of points on behalf of the Opposition, to which I shall respond in writing if he will permit me, as I need to study some of them further. I certainly hope that we can complete our deliberations as far as Blake is concerned. If we do not manage to table amendments before the Bill is reported on <phrase class="date" code="">22 May</phrase>, we will do so in the other place and bring the Bill back in the normal way.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/16">We at the Ministry of Defence, are not simply Ministers, officials, and members of the armed forces. We are also fathers, mothers, and people with families. We intuitively understand how important it is that young people are looked after and valued, and we feel passionately about the care that we provide to them. We are acutely aware of the sensitivity of the issues raised today and of the need for us urgently to address areas of weakness.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/17">We deeply regret the death of anyone in our charge. Each family has suffered a great loss and understandably still carries a burden. No matter what is said today by me or anyone else in this House, those families will continue to have that pain and suffering for the rest of their lives. I fear that there is nothing we can do to mitigate that. I certainly share with them in that respect. I know that there is nothing that we can do to restore their loved ones to them, but we can continue to improve how we care for those who are in our charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/18">I have on my desk a mission statement, which simply says: &quot;We value our servicemen and women and their families and will do everything in our power to demonstrate that.&quot; It is the first thing that I see every morning when I walk into my office. That is why I am a Minister, and why I want to do something about the issues raised here today. Working in partnership, my colleagues and I can do something to try to ensure that the tragedies that we have talked about today&mdash;whatever their causes&mdash;may not be repeated.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.503.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1647" speakername="Diana Johnson" colnum="503"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h04.htm#60503h04_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.503.1/1">I have a cold and hay fever, so I apologise for my voice, Mrs. Anderson.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/2">I am pleased to have secured this debate, and I am very pleased indeed that my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister will respond on behalf of the Government, as I know that she has a personal commitment to good legal advice services across the whole of the United Kingdom. Before I entered the House of Commons, I worked in a law centre for many years and in the field of social welfare law. I believe that my right hon. and learned Friend worked in a law centre in north London a few years ago, so perhaps she will be able to identify with some of the comments that I shall make about law centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/3">I believe that all Members agree that access to good quality advice and legal representation when people need it is vital. I want to use my time this afternoon to say a little about the community legal service, which has been an enormous success overall and a real tribute to the Government's commitment to legal advice in this country. I also want to say something about the particular circumstances of Hull and, finally, the specific problems in respect of legal representation in Hull.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/4">The Access to Justice Act 1999 set up the Legal Services Commission and, out of that, the community legal service, which is a flagship policy for the Labour Government. It is absolutely right that the aims and objectives of the community legal service are at the centre of the Legal Services Commission. The community legal service is the framework for a comprehensive local network of good quality legal and advice services that are supported by co-ordinated funding and based on the needs of local people. By working together, the Legal Services Commission, local authorities and other agencies and funders can make the most effective use of resources, which we all know are limited, to fund services that really meet the needs of local communities, be it through private practice solicitors, advice agencies or law centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/5">The regional Legal Services Commission spent a great deal of time planning and mapping services in the different areas of the country to identify what already existed and what needed to be put in place, and I fully support the work that it did. I was still working as a lawyer in Paddington when the regional Legal Services Commission identified the needs in west London, and it was a breath of fresh air to sit down with other agencies to look at the services that were being provided and where the gaps were.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/6">Having discussed the importance of the community legal service and recognised its potential, I want to say something about Hull, which is a city that is often overlooked. It has high levels of deprivation&mdash;it is ninth in the deprivation statistics for 354 local authority areas and districts&mdash;and there is poor health, low educational achievement and a low skill base in the general population. To add to its problems, it is geographically tucked away in a corner of east Yorkshire. It is about 60 miles to Leeds and about an hour on the train to Doncaster, so people in Hull generally want to access services in Hull. They do not want to have to travel for an hour or more. It is worth saying that Hull has one of the lowest car ownership rates in the country, so public transport is another key issue. Until recently, it was not as good as it could have been.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/7">Hull is obviously a city that is ripe for good, co-ordinated advice services and representation. It has always had a good, vibrant network of voluntary and community sector advice agencies. It has an excellent citizens advice bureau, and Age Concern offers advice to older people. Mind is very active, and Choices and Rights gives advice to people with disabilities and champions getting rid of barriers that they encounter.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/8">For 15 years, Hull also had the Humberside law centre. Unfortunately, it closed just before I became a Member of Parliament, but I know about it from its reputation when I worked in law centres. I remember reading about a solicitor called Humphrey Forrest, which I thought was a striking name, who worked at the Humberside law centre. He took a case in the 1990s for trawlermen who were put out of work but received no compensation when the fishing industry in Hull collapsed. Normally, if a business collapses, people are entitled to redundancy and various other payments, but those people had received nothing. Humphrey took the case for a large group of trawlermen in Hull and succeeded in making legal history by getting redundancy payments for them. Humberside law centre had a good reputation in employment law.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/9">The centre also offered free advice and representation for disadvantaged groups in the city. It provided immigration advice and representation at tribunals, and, as I mentioned, advice on employment issues and representation at employment tribunals. Finally, it offered specialist telephone advice to agencies in Hull that dealt with people on a day-to-day basis. If they were not quite sure about the legal ramifications of someone's problem, they could contact the law centre. Overall, Humberside law centre performed a worthwhile function in the city.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/10">The centre was called Humberside law centre, not Hull law centre. It was funded by Hull city council, which has always taken a progressive approach to legal services and recognised the need to invest in advice services to get around some of the problems of social exclusion. The centre was also funded by North East Lincolnshire council, North Lincolnshire council and the East Riding of Yorkshire council. For whatever reason, the three country councils decided to withdraw funding. That left only the money from Hull city council, which was not enough to sustain the law centre. Unfortunately, it closed in 2005, and the city lost experts in social welfare law.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/11">I mentioned Humphrey's landmark case, but the law centre also had a reputation for dealing with disability discrimination cases. One case struck me, as a dog lover, as important. A woman in Hull who was hearing-impaired had a hearing dog. She was turned away from restaurants and cafes when she took her dog with her. Most restaurants and cafes now would recognise a guide dog and allow it to enter, but a hearing dog was a new thing then, and people were not aware of or did not understand the services that it provided to the owner. The law centre was able to help that person achieve recognition of the disability rights of hearing-impaired people in that city.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/12">I became an MP in 2005, and, because I had an interest in advice services I spoke to many groups in Hull who were offering advice to my constituents. At the basic level&mdash;I believe it is called level 1&mdash;the general signposting and advice services that are available in the city are good, but many organisations told me that there were few places in the city to refer constituents who had more complicated legal problems or complex issues on which they needed advice. I want to comment on a few of the areas where there are problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/13">The first area, as I believe many MPs will recognise, is immigration advice. At present there are no solicitors offering immigration advice in Hull, so constituents who want advice have to go to Doncaster, or sometimes London or Leeds. I understand that the Legal Services Commission has now entered into a contract with a firm of solicitors in Doncaster, but as I said at the outset, Doncaster is 60 miles away. I have been told that people often do not receive their travel expenses when they travel to Doncaster. Often, those people do not have a penny to their name. There may be some confusion around solicitors and disbursements. I understand that money is available to allow clients to travel to obtain advice, but my constituents are not receiving that advice or having their travel expenses repaid.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/14">We have an excellent project in Hull&mdash;the Leo Schultz project&mdash;but it cannot provide the legal representation work that is so badly needed. Its funding is under pressure because it receives funding from the Big Lottery Fund and the council, but the funding from the Big Lottery Fund depends on council funding, which is guaranteed only to November. So potentially, Hull is in a real mess with immigration advice and I think we all know that decent, good immigration advice for asylum seekers and overstayers is vital to the health of the local community; so immigration is a real problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/15">Employment is the other issue that I want to focus on. Only one private firm of solicitors in the community legal service directory in Hull offers employment advice and assistance at tribunals. That firm, Myer Wolff and Manley, said that it was exceptionally busy and might take on race, sex and disability discrimination cases if it had a solicitor available, but there is no other provision through the community legal service or any other advice body. The only other place where advice can be obtained is the citizens advice bureau. When the law centre closed, money was put aside for the citizens advice bureau to develop expertise in representation, but to date that has not happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/16">Immigration and employment representation are two key areas that have been identified in the community legal service plan as priority areas in Hull, but at the moment they are not at the level they should be. On employment particularly, the Government have introduced a great deal of new legislation to give employees rights in the workplace and we need to ensure that those employees can enforce those rights when they need to.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/17">No advice on community care is available in the city at the moment. Age Concern flagged that up to me as a matter of concern, especially for older people with mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/18">Education law is a Cinderella service. There are not many practitioners in education law but parents, particularly those with disabled children, often want good legal advice on the special educational needs options open to them and on what their children can expect.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/19">The situation with housing is better. We have the independent housing advice centre in Hull, which is excellent and offers representation work. However, again, it tells me that it misses the law centre and the back-up that it could have provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/20">In 2000, the Consumers Association said that in terms of who provides quality advice&mdash;local and specialist community advice services&mdash;law centres were considered the best. I know that Humberside law centre, despite having funding problems, as most law centres do at some stage, was quality assured. It had specialists in social welfare law. It also operated a second-tier referral approach to agencies, providing them with access to specialist help. It operated training courses for groups and organisations in the city and, importantly, it operated an educational policy to try to encourage and educate people about their rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/21">I wanted to have this debate today because I feel that we are missing a trick on representation work. I know that the community legal service has recently identified a strategy called &quot;making legal rights a reality&quot; and I believe that it is looking at community legal advice centres in urban areas which will have match funding with local authorities. I welcome that because it may be a positive way forward. However, we had a very good law centre in Hull for many years and I believe that we need something similar to carry on the work that it started and to allow my constituents to have the level of legal advice and representation that they deserve. Just because they are tucked away in a far corner of east Yorkshire does not mean that they should not have the best legal advice and legal representation that they can get. The lawyers who devote their careers to law centre work can provide that very special, holistic approach to dealing with some of the most disadvantaged people in our society and ensuring that they are able to enforce their legal rights. Sometimes they do not even know that they have a legal remedy. That is why I wanted this debate today.</p>

	<p pid="a.506.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1647" name="Diana Johnson">my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Ms Johnson)</phrase> for choosing this subject for debate today and for bringing the far corners of the city of Hull and the needs and interests of its constituents to us here in the House of Commons. She has been a breath of fresh air for her constituency and the House since her election. I have had the opportunity of being on a Standing Committee with her. It is nothing but good news that Hull has her as a Member of Parliament to bring to us and to life the issues of concern to her constituents, as she has done today.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/2">We all readily recognise a number of the things she said, particularly that there is something to be said for a law centre being based in and part of a community so that it can look around for the issues and understand the community to which it is trying to provide legal services. Humphrey Forest identified the general problem of redundancy among people who had been working in the fishing industry and sought a legal remedy for them when they might not have thought that they had any legal rights. That is telling and thought-provoking.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/3">I agree that it is unfortunate that the law centre was closed. Sometimes, adding together the individual bits of advice given, enumerating the number of cases taken on and looking at the categories they are in does not explain the whole story, and my hon. Friend has told the whole story today. I will ensure that the Legal Services Commission considers her points and responds to them fully.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/4">My hon. Friend is right in saying that we have brought in new rights, such as the right to a minimum wage&mdash;I expect that that is important in her constituency&mdash;the right for people to request flexible working hours if they have young children, and rights for people with disabilities. However, as she said, if those rights cannot be enforced, they are worthless. They may make us feel good because we introduced them in legislation, but if they are not translated into reality they are meaningless. Her point about ensuring that her constituents, who perhaps need representation but cannot afford to pay for it or who, without an educational approach, may not realise that they have those rights, is important. I want to pass on, through her, my recognition and acknowledgement of the important work done by the community organisations that she mentioned, such as the citizens advice bureau among others.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/5">We in the Department for Constitutional Affairs are committed to ensuring that high-quality legal advice services are available to those who need them but cannot afford them. Those services must be readily accessible at local level.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/6">My hon. Friend made a point about the immigration contract being given to a firm of solicitors in Doncaster, which is 60 miles from Hull and might as well be at the other end of the country for those who do not have a car, if the disbursement policy is not properly applied. I shall ensure that the disbursement issue is looked into; otherwise, the service might as well not be there. I will get the Legal Services Commission to look into the accessibility of the immigration contract and its local impact and to report back to me. I will then write to my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/7">I agree with the thrust of my hon. Friend's comments that, as the service is 60 miles away, it must be better than good in its outreach because it is not in the community. It can respond but it cannot proact. The question is how those outside services are embedded in local community organisations. I know that they work with the Leo Schultz project, which she mentioned. She also mentioned concerns about its sustainability. The organisations also work with the CAB. The question is how embedded and localised services are. I will look into that and get back to her.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/8">The Legal Services Commission has made considerable efforts to alleviate the effect of the closure of the law centre in 2005. Since then, it has let new contracts to cover the categories of law with which the law centre previously dealt. The point about a law centre is that it does not have to go for a contract; it just does the job as it is needed. That work is broader than contracts. However, the contracts that have been let include those on debt, welfare benefits and immigration, which I have mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/9">As a result of issuing new contracts to legal services providers such as Hull CAB, the number of acts of assistance to people seeking legal advice has increased by about 10 per cent. Despite the fact that the law centre is no longer there, the number of items of advice has increased. New matter starts for specialist legal advice have increased by about 10 per cent., which equates to about 4,500 new cases starting in 2005&ndash;06, compared with 4,000 in the previous year. Owing to the allocation of a new contract to Hull CAB in respect of debt, the number of matters dealt with in that category has increased significantly, from just three in 2004&ndash;05 to 119 in 2005&ndash;06. Early this year, a new immigration contract was let, and 70 cases have been taken on in Hull, but I will examine how those cases were dealt with and where they come from, and we will address those points.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/10">Legal Services Commission initiatives such as the housing possession court duty scheme and Community Legal Service Direct have continued to play a role in ensuring that my hon. Friend's constituents have access to the advice that they need. I recognise her point about the housing advice centre. Between April and December, about 200 people from Hull contacted CLS Direct for help with such matters as debt, employment and welfare benefits. Hull's housing possession court duty scheme helped about 40 people a month during 2005&ndash;06. In many instances, that advice helped to prevent people from losing their home.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/11">The Legal Services Commission and the Department for Constitutional Affairs are committed to ensuring that there is adequate provision of good legal and advice services and legal aid in Hull, and that those services are accessible to my hon. Friend's constituents. Through the recently published community legal service strategy, the commission will aim to deliver a service resolutely focused on the needs of her constituents. Services will be developed and located in accordance with local need. Priorities will be agreed locally, with the aim of targeting those who are most in need, who are often the hardest to reach. That will be the thrust of the idea of community legal advice centres and networks.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/12">Over the next few months, the Legal Services Commission will work with the relevant local authorities and with my hon. Friend in establishing the way forward for Hull. She obviously has considerable expertise in these matters, as well as a commitment to her constituents, so I will ensure that the commission draws on her involvement with local people. She will see problems coming before they occur and, on the basis of the expertise that she has developed, given her background of working in law centres and in the advice services movement generally, she will be able to help the commission to shape services.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/13">I am well aware that there have been concerns about provision of social welfare advice in Hull. However, the Legal Services Commission is trying to take a responsible and effective approach in addressing those concerns and it hopes that, despite the closure of Humberside law centre, it has made real progress in ensuring that the supply is able to meet demand. With the measures set out in the community legal service strategy, the Legal Services Commission will continue to work with everyone locally to try to improve the situation and to focus resources on delivering advice in a way that works through and with local organisations for the most disadvantaged and vulnerable people in my hon. Friend's community.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/14">My hon. Friend raised a number of points. We are not happy about a situation in which people have rights but there is unmet need, and we certainly do not want things to slip backwards rather than going forward. Therefore, we will work with her to ensure that the Legal Services Commission works with her and the local authorities so that her constituents have access to high-quality legal advice and assistance.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.510.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" speakername="Philip Hollobone" colnum="510"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h05.htm#60503h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.510.1/1">I thank Mr. Speaker for allowing me this debate, and the Minister for being here to listen to my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/2">Today marks 58 years since Israel declared its independence. Israel is a democracy, committed to western values, freedom and the rule of law, located, I am afraid, in a sea of hostile Arab states. Today also marks 58 years that Israel has been fighting for its survival against those hostile neighbours and terrorist groups who, in many cases, still refuse to recognise Israel's right to exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/3">I am thinking in particular of Hamas, the radical Islamist terrorist organisation, which won an overwhelming majority in the Palestinian elections in January. Hamas won 74 of the 132 seats in the Palestinian legislative council elections and has filled the Palestinian Authority with Ministers who, I am afraid to say, defend the deliberate killing of innocent Israeli civilians.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/4">The Hamas movement was born out of the extremist Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. It is committed to the destruction of Israel through armed struggle and the establishment of an Islamic republic of Palestine based on sharia law. Between 1989 and 2005, Hamas killed 579 Israelis, and wounded 3,235 more, in brutal acts of terrorism; some 93 per cent. of these were civilian casualties. Hamas suicide bombers have attacked Israel at least 58 times&mdash;symbolically, one for each year since Israel declared its independence in 1948.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/5">Britain should remain steadfast with regard to Hamas and should not be led to water down the three preconditions set by the Quartet on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase>. Hamas needs to understand that it needs to recognise Israel, commit to non-violence, end terrorism, and accept previous agreements and obligations signed by its Palestinian predecessors. The Minister should not waver: all three conditions must be fulfilled before Britain and the west should even consider dialogue or meetings with Hamas. The Minister must remain firm and vigilant against Hamas, and lead the international community to pressurising Hamas to commit to a two-state solution: a secure Israel living side by side with a viable state of Palestine.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/6">Hamas must end its violence and terrorism, and it is in the British national interest to promote freedom and democracy against that oppression and terror. Her Majesty's Government should not waver on any of the conditions set for the new Hamas-led Palestinian Authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/7">There are those who hope that Hamas will be moderate in office, but I am afraid that its actions show the opposite. Although it has, by and large, respected the ceasefire negotiated by Abu Mazen in February 2005, many Hamas leaders continue to defend terrorism against Israel, and they ally themselves with abhorrent regimes, themselves state sponsors and financiers of terrorism, such as Iran and Syria, that openly call for Israel to be &quot;wiped off the map&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/8">Last month, Tehran hosted a &quot;support for the Palestinian intifada conference&quot;, which was attended by Hamas's political bureau chief, Khaled Meshaal. Iran has pledged $50 million to finance the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority. Hamas is an integral part of the fundamentalist regime in Iran, which, as we all know, seeks to export terrorism and wage jihad against western democracy and values. With close links to an Iranian regime hellbent on acquiring nuclear weapons and destabilising the whole of the middle east, the Hamas Government are exposed as a regime with the same goals: destruction of Israel and an attack on western democracy and values.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/9">Hamas's Foreign Minister, Mahmoud al-Zahar, is openly an extremist and is cultivating links with Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia, rather than&mdash;as I am sure we would all wish&mdash;showing moderation to the west. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March</phrase>, Hamas's Interior Minister, Said Siyam, who is responsible for Palestinian internal security forces, publicly committed himself not to order arrests of operatives who carry out terrorist attacks against Israel. Siyam's declaration amounts to an open invitation to all terrorists, including al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Fatah militias.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/10">In effect, the Hamas regime, far from being a moderating influence, is facilitating continued terrorist attacks on Israel while disclaiming responsibility. Although the Hamas movement appears to abide by a ceasefire with Israel, the policy of the Hamas Government is to allow terrorists free rein. Hamas failed to condemn the first suicide bombing to take place after it took power in January. Instead, it called it &quot;an act of self-defence&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/11">Not only is Hamas refusing to criticise publicly acts of terrorism, but it has actually been implicated in the attacks itself. For example, an investigation into the attempted suicide bombing at the Karni crossing on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-26">26 April</phrase> revealed that it was carried out by the popular resistance committees in the Gaza strip, which are under the direction of Hamas.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/12">There are glaring inconsistencies in the messages that Hamas sends out to the western and Arab media on the issues of terrorism, Israel and negotiations. Indeed, Hamas's media strategy is to adapt its various messages to the relevant target audience. To the western media, Hamas attempts to put across a soft image; to the Arab media, including that in Palestine, Hamas presents a defiant and uncompromising image, including on issues such as terrorism, the peace process and recognition of Israel.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/13">For example, Hamas's Prime Minister, Ismail Haniya, has been labelled a pragmatist in some of the western press. Yet it was Haniya who took credit for a Hamas suicide bus bombing in 2003, which killed 23 Israelis and wounded 130. In March this year, in the Arabic press, Haniya said the following on the issue of the recognition of Israel:</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/14" class="indent">&quot;One of the basic principles of the new Government is not to surrender to international threats and to refuse to recognize Israel.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/15">However, days earlier, in the western media, he had said:</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/16" class="indent">&quot;We will respect the agreements which will ensure the establishment of a Palestinian state on the '67 lines, as well as the release of prisoners. If Israel withdraws to the '67 lines, we will formulate peace in stages.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/17">That dual message speaks for itself. Hamas continues to support terrorism, refuses to recognise Israel and shows no sign at all of accepting the notion of a two- state solution. Sadly, the evidence suggests that, far from a democratic Palestine, we could be witnessing the emergence of an Islamist state on Israel's doorstep, with vested interests from fundamentalist regimes such as Iran and Syria and terrorist groups including al-Qaeda and Hezbollah.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/18">Will Her Majesty's Government grant assurances that they will remain steadfast against Hamas and remain committed to all the preconditions set by the Quartet on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase>? Will the Minister also make assurances that Her Majesty's Government will not become lenient in interpreting the preconditions set by the Quartet? It is unacceptable when the Foreign Secretary says, as he did in Riyadh only a few weeks ago, that recognition of Israel does not mean a formal declaration by Hamas, but just a practical acceptance of the &quot;reality&quot; of the Jewish state. Hamas, in its entirety, is a terrorist organisation proscribed by the European Union. Will the Minister join me in condemning the leader of the Liberal Democrats in the EU for recently meeting with the Hamas Speaker of the Palestinian Parliament?</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/19">In conclusion, Britain should stand united with Israel against Hamas and remain vigilant that Hamas recognises Israel, ends terrorism and accepts a two-state solution based on the road map to peace.</p>

	<p pid="a.512.0/1">Thank you for calling me, Mrs. Anderson. It is a double pleasure to have you chair the debate, because you chaired another Adjournment debate earlier today&mdash;we must be the only assembly in the world that has six Adjournments a day. That debate was on Nepal, another troubled part of the world, and, since the majority of the world's conflicts come under my brief, we will no doubt share the room again.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> on tabling this Adjournment debate. It has come at a crucial time for developments in the middle east, not least because today is Israeli independence day. As he has explained, it is important that we work to ensure that that independence is protected and that the Israeli people are allowed to enjoy a life free from the threat of terrorism, violence and murder that they have faced for so long. Of course, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-25">25 January</phrase> a new Palestinian Government were elected and on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-28">28 March</phrase> the Israeli people also elected a new Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/3">As I made clear to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-25">25 April</phrase>, we recognise Hamas's democratic mandate as a result of free and fair elections, but that mandate comes with responsibilities. Democracy is about more than elections but, as I have also made clear, it is essential that the Hamas-led Government commit to non-violence, recognise Israel, and accept previous agreements and obligations, including the road map. I say that in all humility because I cannot see another way in which we will reach the two-state solution that, in my view, is absolutely vital in the middle east peace process. The road map remains the best way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/4">We are watching developments closely. Hamas needs to start to implement the three principles and to make clear the path it intends to take. Its response to the Tel Aviv suicide bomb attack on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-17">17 April</phrase> was unacceptable and reprehensible. I thought that the hon. Gentleman's explanation of the expert way in which Hamas manipulates the news media to communicate dual messages to suit its different audiences was valuable and insightful. Never underestimate it because, like Osama bin Laden, it uses the media in a clever and effective way.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/5">There has been a great deal of controversy about what we should do about pledged support and continued support for the Palestinian people. That is important, as the Palestinian people have been hugely subsidised for a long time. I have made known my sadness at going to Ramallah and seeing luxury apartments surrounding the city, despite the fact that the local economy has allegedly collapsed. One wonders where that money came from. A lot of it came from the donations that countries such as ours gave, over the years, to Yasser Arafat and, I am afraid, a lot of it was distributed to his cronies through corruption. The last people to benefit from it were the Palestinians. That rankles, and certainly goes a long way to explain why Hamas did so well in the Palestinian elections. People were looking for an organisation that would challenge corruption, which is something that we must take into account and treat seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/6">The international community and the UK will continue to support the Palestinian people and to help provide for their basic needs. The Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for International Development and the Foreign Secretary have all made it clear that the United Kingdom will continue to support the Palestinian people. Although donors have stopped direct budgetary support to the Palestinian Authority, they continue to provide support to the Palestinian people and help to provide for their basic needs. Only a co-ordinated response by the international community will achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/7">We, along with our EU partners, have a strong record of support for the Palestinian people. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-25">25 April</phrase> the Department for International Development announced a &pound;15 million payment to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. The United Kingdom alone has given &pound;147 million to the Palestinian people since 2001. That is an enormous sum of money. We want to restart our funding to the Palestinian Authority, but we cannot do that until Hamas takes the necessary steps. In the meantime, we are actively looking at how we can help meet the Palestinian people's basic needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/8">Of course, this is the hon. Gentleman's Adjournment debate and he has acquitted himself well. However, I remind him that the middle east peace process is a process, and that we should also take the opportunity to remind the new Israeli Government, for whom we have great hopes, that they must stop any action that contravenes the agreement that should be part of the road map. They must stop building illegal settlements and stop the construction of the separation barrier on Palestinian land.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/9">I have been there and I have seen for myself the damage that the separation barrier is doing. I am very much a supporter of the two-state solution, but I have heard some shocking statistics, such as that only 20 per cent. of the barrier is on or behind the agreed green line. Some 80 per cent. of the barrier is in Palestinian territory. That does not help. It does not help those of us who are passionate supporters of Israel and the Israeli people, as much as we are supporters of the Palestinians. It is very important that we recognise that what I have described is contrary to international law and threatens the viability of an agreed two-state solution.</p>

	<p pid="a.514.0/1">I thank the Minister for his remarks thus far. Although he has concerns about the location of the barrier, does he recognise that Israel never wanted to build it in the first place, but has been faced with an unprecedented scale of assault on its citizens through suicide bombing? We have had our own recent, unfortunate experience of suicide bombing in this country, but the level of such attacks in Israel is out of all proportion to anywhere else in the world. That is the fundamental reason for designing the barrier in the first place.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.514.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1763" speakername="Kim Howells" colnum="514"  time="016:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h05.htm#60503h05_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.514.1/1">I understand that completely. On my last visit to Israel I went to talk to what one might call old friends on the Israeli left who were born and brought up on kibbutzim, one of which was, if I recall rightly, on the old road to Jerusalem. They told me very reluctantly that life was a lot easier now the barrier had been built. They admitted that reluctantly because they always wanted to live alongside Palestinians. They did not want divisions. They believed that it was possible for people to live together.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/2">I understand entirely the hon. Gentleman's point. If the Israelis want to build that barrier, that is up to them, and of course that is what they have done. However, the route that the barrier takes is an extremely important issue. If it incorporates Palestinian land&mdash;as it certainly has done&mdash;there are problems, as the Israeli High Court has admitted. Sometimes it has overruled the proposed routes, saying, &quot;No, it mustn't go that way, because it's illegal.&quot; I very much hope that the Israelis, even at this point, listen to pleas from countries such as ours to reconsider that route, because it allows the wound to fester, and there have been too many festering wounds in that part of the world. I understand entirely why the Israelis have built the barrier, but hope very much that they understand that we feel strongly about the route that has been taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/3">In answer to the hon. Gentleman's specific question, the Foreign Secretary told the Foreign Affairs Committee in March that we remain committed to key Security Council resolutions Nos. 242, 338 and 1373. We believe that the Israeli Government should adhere to international law, and we remain concerned by Israeli policies on settlements and the barrier&mdash;and especially on access to Jerusalem, which threatens to cut off Palestinian east Jerusalem from the west bank. Those policies will have serious economic, social and humanitarian consequences for Palestinians, and they risk reducing the possibility of reaching a final status agreement on Jerusalem.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/4">I shall develop my argument. Although I understand the security considerations, those whom I met in the kibbutz told me that the last thing they want is an economic basket case on the borders of Israel. The Palestinian state must be economically viable, and that will require some rapid rethinking of the way in which blockades can prevent the development of the economy and so on. There has to be a balance. There is never an easy answer to the question of how to protect one's own citizens and at the same time allow the proper economic development of a neighbouring state. It is extremely important.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/5">I shall move on, as I have only a few minutes left. The hon. Gentleman asked if I would give him an assurance that we will remain steadfast against Hamas, at least with its present policies and statements. We stand fully behind the Quartet's three principles of a Hamas commitment to non-violence, its recognition of Israel and its acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including the road map. We are monitoring the situation closely. Hamas will be judged not only on its words but on its actions. If Hamas shows real political leadership and imagination, it could make the necessary change; and it should understand that if it makes that change the international community will respond.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/6">I have chosen my words carefully because I know that the hon. Gentleman feels strongly about the matter. I am sure that many in the new Israeli Government will feel that they have to make progress, but they cannot make progress for as long they adopt their present actions and words. The aftermath of the Tel Aviv bombing reminded us, if we needed reminding, of a ruthless streak in those political thoughts.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/7">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the leader of the Liberal Democrats in the European Union. We have made clear our policy on Hamas. I am sorry that the leader of the Liberal Democrats in the European Parliament chose to take the action that he did. I had hoped for a degree of solidarity, but individual Members of Parliament, including Members of the European Parliament, may view the situation differently. That is their prerogative. However, we have made our views clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/8">The hon. Gentleman also asked whether we would take steps to ensure that other British political parties and western allies abided by the same set of tests for the unreformed Hamas Government. There will be a Quartet meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">9 May</phrase> in New York to discuss the middle east peace process. We are working very closely with the Quartet and our EU partners along the lines that I have set out, so I hope that he can take some comfort from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/9">I have lost track of time, Mrs. Anderson; despite the fact that there are clocks all over the place, they tell different times. However, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that we remain committed to the principles of a negotiated two-state solution, and we continue to work towards a just, viable and lasting peace and the establishment of a viable and secure state of Palestine and a secure state of Israel consistent with the Security Council resolutions and the principle of land for peace. If Hamas can move towards the Quartet's three principles, then the peace process can advance. The only viable future for a Palestinian state lies in its having a peaceful relationship with its neighbour Israel.</p>

	<p pid="a.515.0/1">I suspect that we may have more time than the Minister imagines. I appreciate what he said about our EU partners. Does he detect any softening in the stance of our EU partners towards Israel, which could disconcert the Israelis as they confront the terrorist threat from Hamas? Traditionally, it has been the US and the UK that have remained steadfast on these issues and some of our continental neighbours have backtracked at crucial times.</p>

	<p pid="a.516.0/1">I can certainly tell the hon. Gentleman that the EU and the US, together with the other major donors, such as Japan, Canada and Norway, have suspended direct funding to the Palestinian Authority, but remain committed to supporting the Palestinian people. Those donors provide the majority of funding to the Palestinian Authority. Some other states, including those in the Arab world, view the situation in a different way, which is their prerogative, but I have not detected any breaking of ranks, if that is what the hon. Gentleman is referring to.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/2">The hon. Gentleman knows full well, because he is very familiar with this part of the world, that different Governments will have different views about how far to move in one direction, and about who to talk to and who not to talk to. There will be situations where some of the aid we give to the United Nations will have to be signed off by someone who turns out to be a Hamas representative or councillor. Inevitably, such things will happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/3">I am old enough to remember the early days of our engagement with the Provisional IRA under Prime Minister John Major. That process was fraught with difficulty and a lot of it took place in secret. I have not noticed a great breaking of ranks or people trying to engage with Hamas&mdash;or other people&mdash;in various ways. We expect the Palestinian Authority to take long-overdue action against people firing rockets into Israel, trying to provoke confrontations at the borders or identifying, recruiting and arming suicide bombers. Despite the barrier, they still get through; they got through to Tel Aviv.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/4">I have not picked up an indication that there is any desire among any of our partners or allies to break ranks in that respect. I cannot answer for other Governments. Very early on, the Russian Government met Hamas. They were very cautious about that meeting, from what I can tell. I think that Hamas got the message from Russia that the latter was very much part of the Quartet, which was helpful. However, I understand the hon. Gentleman's trepidation.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/5">As I say, the only viable future for a Palestinian state lies in its having a peaceful relationship with its neighbour, Israel. We welcome the commitment of Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas to negotiations, and we urge both sides to resume negotiations as soon as possible. We want the peace process to make real progress. The Palestinian and Israeli people suffer in the end. There ought to be enough good will there, and enough diplomatic expertise; they have been at it for long enough to make progress now on the middle east peace process.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/6">I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising the subject; it gives us the opportunity to say once again that this country, this Government and I am sure his party, too, want this terrible conflict to draw to a close so that people in that area can live in peace and stability and look forward to a decent future for their children.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/7" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/8" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at one minute to Five o'clock.</p>
