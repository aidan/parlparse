<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.450.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1637" speakername="Tom Levitt" colnum="450"  time="009:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h01.htm#60503h01_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.450.0/1">I rise both to compliment <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1877" name="John Stanley">the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)</phrase> and to complement what he has said in his speech. I compliment him on leading the delegation, on which I was proud to serve, and I have a feeling that the other Members who served on it, including the hon. Members for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) and for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway) will want to pay tribute to him for leading it with courage, strength and great passion. Indeed, his feelings about Nepal are sincere and go back a long way.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/2">I was very moved by what I saw on our visit, which was my first to the country, and I want to draw a few conclusions to complement what the right hon. Gentleman said. I should say for the record that we spent some of our time looking at aid issues and that I am a Parliamentary Private Secretary at the Department for International Development. My comments today, however, are about the political situation in the Foreign Office context.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/3">Before we went there, Nepal was showing all the signs of a failing state. It is an incredibly poor country, with per capita income at $260 a year and falling. Indeed, the figure might be only as high as that owing to the value of remittances, which come from the perhaps one quarter of all Nepalese people who now live outside the country. That says something about the situation inside the country. Some 60 per cent. of the economy of Nepal is agricultural, but that means that about 30 per cent. of the economy relies on tourism. The five-star market, as it is called, has completely collapsed. I read from figures published this week that in April alone there was a 2.2 per cent. fall in the value of the tourist economy in Nepal, which is obviously dependent on that contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/4">Nepal is also a country where there has been overt and covert censorship in very large measure. It is fortunate that we can mark today as world press freedom day, and I should like to draw attention to one or two conclusions that the Federation of Nepalese Journalists has reached about the past 15 months. Over that time, during which the king had absolute power, two journalists were killed, 88 were tortured, 11 were abducted, 282 were attacked and 707 were arrested. Similarly, 39 journalists were displaced and 250 sacked, and 108 newspapers were forced to halt publication. The Nepalese Government also blocked at least 25 news websites, raided private radio stations and banned broadcasting of news from all stations for a few months, until the supreme court stepped in to allow FM stations to broadcast news again.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/5">Not all those incidents were the responsibility of the Government of Nepal, however. The figures released by the Federation of Nepalese Journalists suggest that the Maoist forces killed at least two journalists, and assaulted and threatened many others over a 10-year period, and have continued to bar them from reporting freely from the Maoist stronghold, even though the leaders of the Maoists have time and again expressed their commitment in principle to respecting press freedom.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/6">According to one international organisation, Reporters Sans Borders&mdash;I am not sure what language that title is supposed to be in&mdash;more than half the cases of news censorship worldwide in the past year were in Nepal, with 567 incidents reported and 145 journalists physically attacked or harassed. A country where there has been no press freedom over the past 15 months or so is a difficult country for the outside world to explore.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/7">We also know that about 3,000 people were detained without trial for various durations, leading up to the abortive local elections in February. I would be interested to hear any news from my hon. Friend the Minister about whether people continue to be held without trial or whether more have been released&mdash; Mr. Nepal, who is one of the high-profile prisoners, has been released, but information about others would also be welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/8">To return to the list of hallmarks of failing states, there have also been several instances of soldiers and members of the armed police being arrested for crimes such as robbery. The ability of the Royal Nepalese army, which is one of the biggest armed forces in the world, successfully to control its vast number of new recruits is questionable.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/9">Over the period of the king's autocratic rule, we also saw the systematic replacement of non-sympathetic members of the supreme court. I understand that the new Nepalese Government have already said that that process will stop. However, I hope that it will not only stop but be reversed and that an objective means of appointing members of the supreme court in Nepal will return.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/10">Over a long period, there were also the bhands&mdash;or transport strikes&mdash;which seemed to become more and more potent, and were used by more than one element in what passes for the political process in Nepal. One of those strikes ended just before we arrived there. Nevertheless, when we travelling out to Biratnagar we saw minibuses and buses that had been newly torched and trees that had been newly felled over roads. I subsequently discovered that a gunfight between Maoist forces and the Royal Nepalese army took place in the village close to the one that we visited while we were there. Fortunately, we did not hear it or get close, but as the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling and the hon. Member for Cotswold mentioned, there was clearly a lot of intimidation going on, even outside the strikes.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/11">Throughout much of April we saw 100,000 dissenters on the streets, as the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling said. It is reported in the news today that the Nepalese Government have announced that 19 people, rather than 14, died at the hands of the military and the armed police during the days of dissent and demonstration.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/12">In response to the developing situation over the past year or so, Britain, like other countries across the world, has quite rightly stopped supplying lethal military aid to Nepal. We have continued to provide Nepal with training in human rights issues for military staff, as well as anti-mine technology and training in its use. No one would argue with that, but we need to consider whether&mdash;and if so, how quickly and in what quality&mdash;any military aid from Britain would be increased to Nepal, particularly as its problem is an internal one, rather than one from an external aggressor. The situation is made even more complex by the fact that the very people from whom protection is required are in some form of alliance with the democratic parties. I therefore suspect that the Minister will say that there is no likelihood of any early restoration of military aid in its previous form.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/13">There is a sad situation in Nepal, which is changing but getting no less sad. The threats are no less than those that the right hon. Gentleman described. In retrospect, the week that we were there was crucial for King Gyanendra. It was probably his last chance to oversee a peaceful transition of power back to the forces of democracy in a way that could have guaranteed the continuation of the constitutional monarchy. Much has happened in the past 18 months to destroy trust in the king and the position of the monarch, in his relationship not only with politicians but with the people themselves. I have mentioned the hallmarks of the failing state, many of which followed from the king's autocratic rule. They were not chance happenings but deliberate actions by the king and those acting on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/14">While we were in Nepal, the leaders of the seven-party alliance were trying valiantly to keep the lid on popular republican sentiments. My guess is that in the long term they will be seen to have failed in that. I have a sneaking suspicion that the king might no longer be in office 12 months down the road. That might be the outcome of the constitutional settlement that is now being sought. I believe that Nepal will probably fail as a constitutional monarchy because the king hung on to power for far too long, although I admit that there were very difficult circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/15">We know that the Maoists have declared a three-month ceasefire, which is welcome, but it should be regarded with some suspicion, not least because it does not cover the likely date for a general election. The monsoon season will start shortly so, as we heard from the Nepalese ambassador with whom we had a positive meeting yesterday, the first credible date for an election is in September or October.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/16">We must not underestimate the size of the task that faces the Nepalese Government. Restoring Parliament is only the first step in the long path to restoring faith in democracy. Inside Kathmandu, the threads of democracy are being maintained for as long as possible. Outside Kathmandu, for reasons mentioned by my colleagues the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling and the hon. Member for Cotswold, democracy has disappeared; and it needs to be reinstated from first principles. That cannot be done while there are forces in Nepal that seem to insist on undermining the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/17">Despite the conciliatory words of the Maoists, it is clear that we will not achieve democracy in Nepal while parts of the country are controlled by terror and intimidation and by unaccountable forces. That is the principal challenge that faces the seven-party alliance.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.454.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" speakername="Richard Ottaway" colnum="454"  time="010:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h01.htm#60503h01_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.454.0/1">During the last 40 minutes, in excellent speeches from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1877" name="John Stanley">my right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1637" name="Tom Levitt">the hon. Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt)</phrase>, we have heard as good an analysis of the situation in Nepal as one could expect to hear anywhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/2">I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman that my right hon. Friend showed admirable leadership during the visit. He ran the exercise with military precision&mdash;not once were we allowed to deviate, hesitate or turn from the programme. In my judgment, it was the most effective parliamentary delegation in which I have been involved, largely due to its composition: as well as the hon. Gentleman and my right hon. Friend, it included <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase> and two Members from the other place, Baroness Northover and the Earl of Sandwich. It was a very cohesive and effective team.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/3">I thank our ambassador to Nepal, Keith Bloomfield, and his colleagues. Our embassies are always supportive when parliamentarians make such visits. One senses that our embassy to Nepal went the extra mile on this occasion&mdash;partly because it was the embassy's idea that we should visit&mdash;but it made a special effort, which made our visit far more effective. I agree with the hon. Member for High Peak that, in a modest way, our visit might have made a difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/4">My right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling said it all in his introductory remarks. This was my second visit to Nepal; I was there in 1994 as a United Nations observer of the second general election under the old king. It is sad that those elections led eventually to the country's demise, but I have been left with a feeling of the nation's unpredictability. Every time I thought that I could see my way through the situation, something happened that made me realise that I was wrong. I would not like to put any money on what the outcome might be&mdash;on what the situation will be in a year's time.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/5">When we arrived, the protests were just beginning. They then escalated until the day of action in early April&mdash;the violence reached a level I had not expected. Two days were earmarked as days of action, but the protests went on for 12 days. Hundreds of thousands of people were on the streets: there was a shoot-to-kill curfew, yet they still went out, and some people were killed. I had not anticipated that happening. Then the king slowly and incrementally capitulated. First, he asked the political parties to appoint a Prime Minister, and then he said he would restore Parliament, whereupon everything stopped&mdash;in Iran, however, such protests led to the Shah going&mdash;and everyone seemed to be happy. That was mainly because the political parties had achieved their objective with the king, which was getting democracy. They were not for getting rid of the king&mdash;the Maoists were in favour of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/6">It was a rollercoaster ride, and the people showed a great enthusiasm for democracy. Frankly, I would be happy if in our country we were to have hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets campaigning for Parliament. <i>[Interruption.] </i>As my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold says from a sedentary position, perhaps tomorrow they will show some enthusiasm.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/7">However, to stick to the issue in hand and to refer to a point that has been made, of the various components in Nepal, the Maoists' motives is the most unclear. The Maoists control large swathes of the country with the stated aim of deposing the king and establishing a one-party state, but then they signed up to the 12-point agreement with the political parties, and now they have acquiesced in the current situation, so there has been a complete switch there.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/8">I am not sure that I would trust the Maoist parties further than I could throw them; my advice to the political parties of Nepal&mdash;and, indeed, to the British Government&mdash;is to sup with them using a long spoon. One suspects that they have entered into an agreement for short-term, opportunistic reasons. Perhaps both sides of that dispute feel they cannot win. The Nepalese army cannot beat the Maoists, and the Maoists are looking at a Royal Nepalese army that is bigger than the British Army, and they have probably reached the conclusion that they cannot beat it. Therefore, there is a stalemate of sorts.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/9">In our initial briefings after we arrived, we were told that there were three components of the situation in Nepal: the king, the political parties and the Maoists. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling said, there is also a fourth component, which is the people of Nepal. They have been through tremendous hardship. One should never underestimate their commitment to resolving this situation and to fighting for what they believe in if they feel they can achieve their objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/10">The human rights situation was of great concern to us all. We had a meeting with the foreign press delegation, and the hon. Member for High Peak has set out the breaches of human rights. While we were there, the leader of the Communist party was under house arrest for no good reason. I ask our Government to keep a close eye on that as we engage with the Nepalese Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/11">I wish to make four points on our policy. First, will the supply of military equipment to the Nepalese army be reviewed? Rightly, anything that could be used for an aggressive purpose has been withdrawn. Do we now feel that the situation has changed? We should take note of the role of the army: it was loyal to the king when he was the executive power, and one assumes that it will be loyal to the Government now that executive power has been bestowed upon them. If the Government are committed to free and fair elections, does that change the situation? Perhaps the Minister has not yet reached a conclusion on that, but it should be reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/12">Secondly, the heart of our policy should be to give full support to the Nepalese Government to hold free and fair elections. That is the only way forward; without them, the situation will collapse into anarchy. I encourage the Nepalese Government to announce a date&mdash;even if it is in September&mdash;as soon as possible to show their commitment. I hope the embassy will encourage them to do that. Thirdly, the basis of the way forward is the 12-point plan that was agreed in the early stages, in March.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/13">Fourthly, my humble advice to the Government is to stay close to the Indian Government in this. India is the nation of influence in Nepal, alongside us. In truth, because of India's proximity, it has more influence. It is also affected by the Maoist insurgency, which has spilled over into the north-east corner of that country. I think that will focus India's mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/14">Nepal is in for a very rocky time. The king has lost all credibility, and it remains to be seen whether he will survive. I do not think the incumbent has a useful role to play and his son is manifestly unpopular, so I do not know what the future holds for the monarchy. I believe in constitutional monarchy, as we have in our country, but I cannot see an obvious candidate to restore credibility in Nepal. That, however, shows the unpredictability in that country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.458.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" colnum="458"  time="010:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h01.htm#60503h01_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.458.0/1">It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Anderson. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1877" name="John Stanley">my right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)</phrase> on securing this timely debate, and on the knowledgeable and thoughtful way in which he introduced it. On my very first day in the House, I went into the Tea Room and an elderly Member said to me, &quot;Be very careful what you say in this House. There is always an expert on every subject.&quot; My right hon. Friend is exactly that expert. As I went to sleep last night, I had a vision of him towering over me, listening to everything that I said, so I must be careful in case I incur his wrath.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/2">My right hon. Friend led a worthwhile delegation to Nepal between 19 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-23">23 March</phrase>, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" name="Richard Ottaway">my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1637" name="Tom Levitt">the hon. Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt)</phrase> have said. Like my right hon. Friend, I hope that that delegation has contributed, in a very small way, to setting that country on the path on which I hope it has embarked.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/3">My right hon. Friend was absolutely right to focus on the people of Nepal, because we wish those people to continue along the path of democracy. We want their economy to recover, we want them to prosper and we want them to live in peace and harmony with each other. They are a very pleasant people&mdash;hard-working, industrious and peace-loving, as was shown by how rapidly they went from demonstrating against the authorities one day to celebrating the result of their success the next. As my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South said, in other countries there would still have been looting many days later, as was the case after the fall of the Shah of Iran and the fall of Ceausescu in eastern Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/4">Hon. Members have ably described what happened in the past, and have alluded to our great historical links with Nepal over almost 200 years, as well as our strong bonds with its people through the Gurkha connection. Those bonds will continue. That is why the British Government, as a great friend and historical ally of Nepal, should remain heavily engaged in the peace process, which we hope will go from strength to strength. I want to concentrate, in a prospective way, on one or two things that could happen in Nepal, and I want to ask the Minister a few questions about how the British Government will react and help.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/5">As has been said, before we arrived, there was a three-cornered political situation that involved the king, the Maoists and the parliamentary parties. The king, I hope, has now conceded power in a real way; it seems that there is no way back to the former situation, at least in the short term. Whether the king survives as constitutional monarch is a much more open question.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/6">The king has ceded real power, but what about the political parties? As has been said, there are seven of them, and they have vastly differing views. Some of them wanted the country to be a republic even before the current situation arose, so it is unclear what their real political aims are. But as the Minister said, interestingly, in an intervention on the hon. Member for High Peak, it is the capacity of those political parties to deliver, and whether they will remain a cohesive whole, that is the critical question.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/7">Part of the problem up to now has been the weakness of the political parties. We wish them well, and we wish them a transition into a mature phase, so that they can at least prepare for elections. The first question I want to ask the Minister is, what help will we give through the rights, democracy and inclusion fund to the people and the political parties in Nepal as they prepare for the elections? A great deal of work must be done. An interim constitution must be drawn up and the election procedure must be sorted out.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/8">I have no idea how advanced the registration of voters is. I suspect that people will probably need to start almost from scratch, but how that can be done when the Maoists control a large chunk of the country remains to be seen. The process presents considerable difficulties, and I think it unlikely that an election will take place in September or October. A more realistic timetable would mean it taking place next year, but perhaps the Minister will give us the Government's view on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/9">The third of the three groups involved is the Maoists. Much has been said about the Maoists this morning, and I have asked the Minister a series of questions on Nepal, both before and after our visit. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-26">26 April</phrase>, the Minister answered one of my questions, and it is worth quoting that answer because it gives the Government's official view of the Maoists. I asked what assessment he had made of them, and the answer was:</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/10" class="indent">&quot;The Maoists carry out widespread human rights abuses including torture, kidnap, rape, murder and extortion for money. These acts of abuse perpetrated against innocent civilians, including women and children . . . the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reported that a large number of children were being used by the Maoist forces as helpers and porters during military operations . . . We are aware that the Maoists have been involved in importing explosives and detonators into Nepal. The Royal Nepalese Army seized over 5,000kg of commercial explosives and in excess of 30,000 commercial detonators in separate operations, in March 2006, along the Nepal-India border. We cannot judge what proportion of the overall total of Maoist imports this represents.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-26">26 April 2006</phrase>; Vol. 445, c. 1152&ndash;53W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/11">There is clearly a serious threat of insurgency and it requires every effort to be made during the political process, through negotiation with the Maoists by the democratic parties, which will be coupled with activity carried out by the police and the Royal Nepalese army.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/12">As we learned in Northern Ireland from the situation involving the IRA and other paramilitaries on both sides, the solution was partially military, but it was political to a much greater extent. That is the message regarding how to deal with the Maoists. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling said, there is a real prospect that Nepal could degenerate into a fully fledged Maoist state&mdash;a very unpleasant regime, which would be very deleterious for the people of Nepal. Every effort must be made by the whole international community, through every organ we can use in Nepal, to prevent that from happening. The one achievement of today's debate should be to issue a warning about that possibility, and I hope that we can prevent it from happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/13">Moving on from the political aspects, what is to be done for the future? Mention has been made of the Royal Nepalese army, which is big and increasing in size and which comprises almost 90,000 people. It has the capability, if given the right equipment, to deal with some of the problems. The key issue was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. If the political situation moves, as we hope it will, satisfactorily towards democracy and a situation where peaceful and fair elections can be held, the British and Indian Governments, the United States and the international community will have to review their policy of not supplying any form of lethal equipment to the Royal Nepalese army.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/14">The situation is pretty dire at the moment, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling alluded to it. If the army gets information that a serious incident involving Maoists has taken place in a rural area 200 miles from the capital, Kathmandu, for example, it can take the soldiers days to get there because the army simply does not have enough helicopters to lift them into position. When the soldiers get into position, they probably will not have enough equipment to deal with the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/15">Indeed, while in Nepal, we heard of the Maoists cutting a major water pipe. When the army went to repair it, the soldiers were attacked by the Maoists and several were killed. If the situation is to be properly brought under control, the Royal Nepalese army needs to be equipped with proper communications, helicopters and night vision for the Islander aircraft so that the troops can see what is going on, as well as proper co-ordination of intelligence, particularly with the Indian authorities. Those basic things must be put in place, and must be carefully considered by the international community.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/16">Another policy that must be reviewed is that on ministerial visits. I have asked the Minister a question about those before. In the run-up to what I hope will be free and fair elections&mdash;I am sure my right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling will want to take a full part in that process&mdash;we can show the political parties and the people of Nepal that we are there to help in whatever capacity they want. The policy on ministerial visits urgently needs to be reviewed and such a visit in the relatively near future would be a helpful step to give political parties some encouragement.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/17">As the hon. Member for High Peak said, there must be a proper, independent judiciary. That is crucial. Some important judgments have been made in the past about the constitution and the role of journalists, and I hope that the political parties can now put in place a team of judges and a judicial system, in a way that is seen to be free and fair, that can act in controversial situations, which will undoubtedly arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/18">One such situation is preparation for elections. There is an urgent need to establish a fully independent electoral commission. Legal questions will arise from the work of that commission, which should be considered by a free and fairly appointed judiciary.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/19">Mention has been made of the press and the media, which are critical in any fledgling democracy. While in Nepal, we were lucky enough to meet the independent organisation of journalists, and I have no doubt that it will continue to press the political parties to allow full access to all strands of media, including independent radio, which reaches most parts of Nepal, but also television and a free press. I hope that that takes place as part of the emerging, reassuring process that follows.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.464.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1763" speakername="Kim Howells" colnum="464"  time="010:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h01.htm#60503h01_spnew19">
	<p pid="a.464.4/1">Yes, indeed. That is a situation that I am afraid we are all too familiar with in other parts of the world. I hope that the Nepali and Bhutanese Governments, and outside agencies that can work to broker a much better arrangement, will prioritise that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/2">The United Kingdom went to great lengths to persuade the king not to take power in Nepal, and, once he had, to hand it back to the political parties. In December 2004, in response to rumours of a palace coup, our ambassador in Kathmandu sought an audience with the king to forewarn him of the consequences of a takeover. The ambassador said that a palace takeover</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/3" class="indent">&quot;would put the King in the front line and the monarchy at risk, provoke violent street demonstrations and push the parties into the arms of the Maoists, divert security resource from fighting the Maoists, and risked losing international support which was posited on multi-party Government and a democratic Nepal.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/4">The accuracy of that prediction was illustrated precisely by the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling when he expressed his great fear that the real victors would be the Maoists, if we were not careful. I am afraid that that is all too true.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/5">Looking back, those words were prescient. We welcome, therefore, the king's decision to reinstate Parliament. With that announcement, the security situation has begun to improve. The parties have called off their protests and the Maoists have announced a three-month ceasefire, although the details of how it will be implemented are not yet clear. There is a prospect of a new Government with the full authority to reciprocate a ceasefire, open negotiations with the Maoists and bring an end to the conflict, which has cost the lives of some 13,000 Nepalese. That is an extraordinary number when one thinks that we lost about 3,500 people over all those years in Northern Ireland. The fact that 13,000 Nepalese have died is a terrible indictment of what has happened in that country.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/6">We do not to underestimate the considerable risks and challenges ahead. To begin with, it is imperative that the Maoists make a complete and permanent end to their violence, and commit to abandoning their arms for ever. That has been done in other parts of the world, and it can be done in Nepal.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/7">As right hon. and hon. Members have said, the Royal Nepalese army will need to undergo what amounts to a cultural shift to turn it into an accountable, professional army under civilian, democratic control. We have been working hard to achieve those ends through our efforts to promote human rights. I will come to the question of human rights, which the hon. Member for Croydon, South raised, in a moment. The political parties will need to show vision and leadership, and learn lessons from the past, and there will need to be a peace process involving the Government and the Maoists to bring the conflict to a permanent conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/8">As right hon. and hon. Members have said, the first sittings of the reconvened Parliament on 28 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-30">30 April</phrase> were landmark occasions. Parliament agreed on elections to a constituent assembly and to talks with the Maoists, which we hope will pave the way for a permanent peace settlement. As colleagues have pointed out, the UK is an old friend of Nepal, with a long history of involvement. We are already working with our key international partners such as the US and India&mdash;we have urged that work should be done with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" name="Jeremy Browne">the Indians; the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne)</phrase> raised that issue&mdash;and the EU to take full advantage of the opportunities in Nepal.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/9">In co-ordination with our EU partners, we will consider lifting the agreement not to meet Nepalese Ministers from the king's Government. If appropriate, we will look for an early opportunity for a UK Minister to visit Nepal. [Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear!&quot;] We will examine ways to ensure that the new Government are equipped for the challenges that lie ahead. As a lifelong mountain climber, I very much hope that that Minister will be me, so that I might see the Himalayas, although I must admit that I limit my climbing to the Alps these days. One can be rescued there by a red helicopter. I have not seen any of those in the Himalayas, and I am getting on a bit now.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/10">The first priority will be to establish a mutually agreed ceasefire. We welcome the Maoists' announcement of a three-month ceasefire, and urge them to make it permanent. We remain absolutely clear about the fact that the pursuit of political ends through violent means is absolutely unacceptable, as is a one-party Maoist state. In response to what the hon. Member for Cotswold said, I hope that that is a clear enough warning from the House to the Maoists. That is very important.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.4/11">The UK continues to support the transition of the Maoists back into a democratic political party participating in a multi-party democratic system. I heard the comments made by the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling with a great deal of optimism. The fact that the Marxist-Leninist party that he mentioned is now a democratic party, so much so that its leader is under house arrest&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.465.1/1">Was under house arrest. That is a great encouragement, as it shows how such parties can change.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> asked whether the Maoists in Nepal are being financed by the Chinese Communist party. Maoist parties have always been completely beyond my comprehension, as a student of the left, so I was glad to hear that they are not.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/3">The hon. Member for Croydon, South mentioned the spread of the influence of Maoist insurrectionists into north-east India. There have been problems with the Naxalite insurrectionists in that area, who have committed some brutal murders. The hon. Gentleman is right to emphasise that aspect, and we must work closely with the Indian authorities to consider those links.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/4">I am sure that most people in this country would be amazed to discover that Nepal has a large population. I initially thought that it had a population of about the same size as that of Scotland, but nobody knows how big it is. It is estimated to be between 25 million and 28 million. It is a huge population, which is very influential on India.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/5">The hon. Member for Taunton talked about developing the economy and about the need for us to become more familiar with Nepal through tourism and other means. I do not know, but perhaps the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling, as his interest continues, will be able to tell us whether Nepal might be able to supply India with electricity using hydroelectrics. Perhaps its future lies in becoming more involved in that burgeoning area of economic growth in northern India, which is not far away and with which it has many organic links and links through river valleys.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/6">Such progress is happening in Afghanistan, and the great hunger for electricity in Pakistan and India could be met by Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan&mdash;those mountainous countries in the western Himalayas&mdash;via Afghanistan. Perhaps there is a similar future for Nepal. That is an important question.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/7">The UK continues to support the transition of the Maoists back into a democratic political party, which would then participate in a multi-party democratic system, but that must be predicated on the Maoists making a demonstrable commitment to ending their violence and putting their arms beyond use for good. I make it absolutely clear that that is the only way that the Maoists will gain legitimacy in our eyes. The hon. Member for Cotswold was right to say that and the point must be emphasised.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/8">We stand firmly behind the efforts of the political parties to take the reins of government and bring an end to the Maoist insurgency. We will make every effort to ensure that they are prepared and equipped to do so, including though our development assistance and the global conflict prevention pool. We are working with our international partners on co-ordinating the international effort as closely as possible. <i>[Interruption.]</i> There is something about a clock written here&mdash;oh, I see.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/9">Several hon. Members asked about military supplies to the security forces. Following the king's takeover of power last year, we put military assistance under review and cancelled the package of military assistance that we had intended to donate to Nepal using funds from the global conflict prevention pool. At this stage, it would be premature to make any formal commitments on security assistance. Now that there is a new Prime Minister and the prospect of a new Government who will take forward negotiations with the Maoists, we will consider requests from that new Government, but so far there have been none.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/10">In the context of the new political landscape in Nepal, our conflict prevention objectives will inevitably shift. If the new Government can make progress on a peace process&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.468.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to introduce this debate on a big and important subject&mdash;probably too big for a half-hour debate. I am aware that many of the issues that are relevant to this discussion, particularly in respect of the pressures on some university science departments, are being dealt with elsewhere in the House, notably by the Select Committee on Science and Technology, which is chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1617" name="Phil Willis">my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/2">I wanted to introduce this debate for several reasons, some of which are personal. Although my constituency is not a university centre, it does have two of the biggest science laboratories in Britain. The National Physical Laboratory is Government owned and supported by the Department of Trade and Industry. Among other things, it has responsibility for the atomic clocks and, therefore, Greenwich mean time, and it houses hundreds of highly qualified physicists. The Laboratory of the Government Chemist has been privatised in recent years but retains its core function of standard-setting for chemistry. It also employs many highly qualified chemists. As a result, the Twickenham-Teddington area is populated by a substantial number of high quality, highly qualified scientists.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/3">I meet those scientists on the doorstep. They convey their anxiety about the state of science in the universities, on which they depend for their graduates and in which many of them alternate in taking university appointments. There is particular anxiety about the closure of chemistry departments in London, including those at Queen Mary's and King's college.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/4">I have a long-standing interest in science education at school level. I secured an Adjournment debate two years ago following the introduction of the Adrian Smith report on maths teaching, and I maintain a close interest in it. Although the Government have undoubtedly taken some action, I am still concerned that some of the underlying problems, which are linked to the problems of the university science sector, remain.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/5">On a personal level, I am of that generation of people who found it easiest to get into university by doing maths, physics and chemistry. I spent two years in chemistry laboratories before deciding that economics was a somewhat more amenable, perhaps easier subject. However, I have since then repaid my debt to science by having a son who is a very good post-doctoral scientist. He briefs me on the strengths of British centres of scientific excellence&mdash;for example, Imperial college, where he works&mdash;but also on some of the frustrations of academic scientific life.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/6">I mentioned my background because it has some relevance to this debate. When I studied science in the 1960s, there was a great deal of interest in the role of science, prompted mainly by the Harold Wilson Government. There was the Trend report on the future of science, out of which emerged the conventional wisdom that Britain was very good at science but not very good at applying it to wealth creation. That general idea has existed for the past 30 to 40 years, but increasingly people are questioning the underlying proposition, for two opposite reasons. One is that Britain has become better at translating science into wealth creation. There is a great deal of evidence that many good science-based industries are developing in the UK. On the other side, there are questions about whether we can continue to be so complacent about the excellence of British science. There are genuine worries on that score, but before I detail some of them, I should like to start with a positive observation.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/7">British universities certainly have a great deal to be proud of in the science field. This country has 1 per cent. of the world's population but 10 per cent. of all cited papers and 11 per cent. of cited papers that attract the greatest degree of scientific attention, and 12 per cent. of the university science prizes. An indicator has been developed to compare the performance of science faculties across Europe&mdash;obviously, there are arguments about methodology&mdash;and British universities topped the list, having six of the 10 top university departments in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/8">On several measures, Britain does very well. I recently saw a reference in <i>New Scientist</i> to the fact that Britain now may stand ahead of the United States on some measures of the standard comparators for the life sciences. There is a very good story to tell in some areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/9">Equally, there are some serious worries, on which I shall focus. As the Minister knows, much of the anxiety centres on the large-scale closure of university science departments. There have been 79 in the past six years and, in the past 18 months, there have been suggested closures of five chemistry departments, although I believe that the one at Sussex university has been reprieved. The Royal Society of Chemistry has argued that, on the basis of current policies on research funding allocation and teaching funding allocation, it would expect another 20 to close in the next 10 years. The 60 chemistry departments that we now have would be reduced by a further 20. That is on the basis of current trends&mdash;it may or may not happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/10">Those comments were sufficient to produce the reasonable consensus that was summarised by the Science and Technology Committee, which expressed in moderate language what is a growing worry in the science community. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/11" class="indent">&quot;Whilst it may be exaggerating to say that university STEM departments&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/12">that is, science, technology, engineering and mathematics departments&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/13" class="indent">&quot;are in crisis, it is clear that their numbers are experiencing a sharp decline. Since the financial situation faced by these departments is unlikely to change in the short term, it is reasonable to assume that there will be further closures. If this process continues unchecked, there is a very real possibility that the system will no longer be able to provide sufficient numbers of STEM graduates to meet the needs of the UK economy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/14">That conclusion has been reinforced by businesses. Companies such as GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca have publicly expressed their worry about the decline, particularly in chemistry. The CBI has likened the position of university science to a car crashing in slow motion. That may be an over-dramatisation, but businesses as well as academics have a view on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.1/15">What are the sources of the problem? I shall touch on four issues which are, to some extent, interconnected: first, the overall funding position; secondly, the availability of students to do science in universities; thirdly, the formula that is used for allocating funding for science teaching; and, fourthly, the basis of allocation of science research in universities. Those four things are interrelated. For example, a university department may have a brilliant set of teachers and researchers, but it would find it difficult to continue to function if there were no students. Indeed, Alasdair Smith, the vice-chancellor of Sussex university, described that scenario as one that had led him to take a pessimistic view.</p>

	<p pid="a.471.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is particularly worrying that the decline has been even more precipitous in the maintained sector? The students who are doing maths, physics and chemistry are increasingly in the independent sector and 40 per cent. of A grades in physics and maths A-level come from children in the independent sector.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.477.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" speakername="Joan Humble" colnum="477"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h03.htm#60503h03_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.477.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Anderson, on this important occasion. This is a serious debate on a serious issue, and I confirm to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Defence that I am a great admirer of our armed services and the men and women who choose to serve for our defence. I want our Army to be the best in the world and to reflect the democratic values that we cherish.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/2">Yet members of the armed forces who protect our rights are entitled to have their rights protected by us. The Army should be a model of best practice and set a benchmark from which others can learn. That is the context for the debate and we need a dialogue on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/3">We last had an opportunity in Westminster Hall to debate the subject of deaths in Her Majesty's armed forces on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-04">4 February 2003</phrase>, when the then Member for Kingston upon Hull, North, Kevin McNamara, highlighted the courage and bravery of a number of families campaigning for a public inquiry into deaths in Army barracks. Three years later, those families are still looking for answers and, as the Deepcut and Beyond families group, they have grown in number and strength. Those families were brought together by the tragic loss of children who died when serving the Crown, most of whom had brothers or sisters and some of whom had children of their own. Those soldiers joined the Army full of optimism, believing in the future, and learned to have pride in their regiments. They knew that they might have to fight for their country but they believed in the future. Somehow, something went terribly wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/4">Every family has a different story to tell. Whatever the circumstances of an individual death, each family had cause to doubt the explanation given. It did not make sense. Bereaved families did not feel that they had been told the truth, and they did not believe that those responsible for their children's deaths, whether by action or neglect, had been brought to justice or held to account. While the Army establishment closed ranks and denied there was a problem, the press drew the seemingly obvious conclusion that there was a conspiracy to cover up the truth and to allow perpetrators to go unpunished.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/5">The Deepcut and Beyond group has provided support and assistance to Army families who have experienced the traumatic and otherwise lonely upheaval of the sudden death of a child. Setting out the public case for a full inquiry, the group has developed a comprehensive agenda for change. The group is calling for civilian oversight to ensure effective investigation of complaints and deaths. It argues for structural involvement of families to ensure that lessons are learned and measures put in place to prevent future deaths. Through Daniel's Trust, bereaved families have been able to work with the independent forces helpline to give confidential advice to young soldiers suffering bullying, and have engaged directly with the officers responsible for fulfilling the duty of care.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/6">Inspired by such positive thinking, I am please to report the formation of the all-party group established on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February 2006</phrase> with the aim of providing a parliamentary focus on non-combat deaths in the armed forces, and to support the Deepcut and Beyond families group in seeking truth, justice and change. Membership of the group reflects genuine all-party backing for the families and extends throughout the United Kingdom. I was proud to be elected chair of the group, with the support of Lord Ashley as secretary and a fine panel of officers, some of whom are in the Chamber today. I am optimistic that we can assist the Government and the Ministry of Defence in rising to the challenge of Deepcut and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/7">I shall pose a number of questions and seek the support of the Minister for a number of propositions. Do we still need a public inquiry? The Minister has previously addressed that issue and is considering his response to the Surrey coroner and the recommendations of the Deepcut review conducted by Nicholas Blake, QC. The Deepcut families, who have lived with the investigation since their children's deaths, are looking in detail at the report and its findings, but the demand for a public inquiry is not going away.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/8">At the conclusion of its investigations into the four deaths, Surrey police outlined the case for a broader inquiry that would</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/9" class="indent">&quot;address the sufficiency of the Army's care regime in respect of young soldiers in training at Deepcut and beyond.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/10">It was Surrey's summary recommendation</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/11" class="indent">&quot;that the Ministry of Defence considers a broader investigation of&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/12">First:</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/13" class="indent">&quot;Whether the risks identified at Deepcut are replicated across the wider&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/14">training establishment</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/15" class="indent">&quot;and how these may relate to the issues of self-harm, suicide and undetermined deaths&quot;;</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/16">Secondly:</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/17" class="indent">&quot;How the Army's care regime may be further improved&quot;;</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/18">and thirdly:</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/19" class="indent">&quot;How independent oversight might help the Army define and maintain appropriate standards of care for young soldiers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/20">At the conclusion of a three-week inquest into the death of James Collinson, the jury returned an open verdict. Exercising his duty to report on matters where action should be taken to prevent the recurrence of fatalities, Her Majesty's coroner wrote to the Secretary of State, stating that</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/21" class="indent">&quot;because of the limited constraints of an inquest, there has to be some way of resolving the unease that there seems to be abroad about Deepcut.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/22">Expressing his respect for the armed forces, he said that</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/23" class="indent">&quot;they deserve that these matters be addressed thoroughly and independently so that rumour and speculation can be met head on.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/24">His personal view was that the MOD should take whatever steps necessary to restore public confidence in the recruitment and training of soldiers at Deepcut and elsewhere. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/25" class="indent">&quot;I personally believe that they should have nothing to fear from an inquiry held in public&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/26">Although Nicholas Blake does not back the families' call for a public inquiry, he argues for Deepcut families to be given complete disclosure of statements collected by Surrey police, as well as the opportunity to put new evidence before a judicial authority that can order fresh inquests. I welcome that proposal, but it does not address the Surrey coroner's view that an inquest will not satisfy the families or meet the public interest requirement for an effective investigation of these or other deaths. As the coroner has told the Secretary of State, his office does not have the expertise, resources or statutory powers needed to conduct such an investigation, so that alone is not the answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/27">The Minister knows that the problems that give rise to public concern and drive those pressing for an inquiry do not stop at the perimeter fence of Deepcut barracks. Truth, justice and change go together. Each theme constitutes an aspect of the public interest in holding an inquiry. In order to restore public confidence and rebuild the relationship of trust between the Army and public, the Secretary of State should consider the value of an inquiry that fully involves the families of the victims, and that is independent in character, judicial in authority and open to the public. An inquiry should be able to examine and make recommendations concerning all the agencies that need to be involved for the effective investigation of sudden deaths and all bodies that could help prevent them. It is bold; it is joined-up; it is a profoundly democratic solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/28">I want to clear up a couple of misconceptions. First, it is claimed that the Deepcut and Beyond families want 1,748 deaths to be investigated. As far back as the Adjournment debate in February 2003, Kevin McNamara pleaded with the Minister to provide statistics that would enable the headline figure of 1,748 deaths from non-natural causes between 1990 and 2003 to be broken down so that the scale of the problem could be accurately assessed. Deepcut and Beyond families repeated the point in evidence to the Select Committee on Defence, pointing out that an inquiry would be remiss if it failed to demand full disclosure of such information prior to conducting its own scoping exercise. I hope that the Minister will consider the statistical information available and see whether a breakdown can be given of the presumed causes of death and their locations.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/29">Secondly, I want to address the claim that an inquiry into Army deaths would be a disproportionate drain on the public purse. The Victoria Climbi&eacute; inquiry, headed by Lord Laming, revolutionised our thinking about child protection. It cost &pound;3.8 million. The Macpherson inquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence became the authority on institutional racism and changed the face of modern policing. It cost &pound;4.2 million. By comparison, the Army has responded to criticism of its regime for young recruits by investing an additional &pound;43 million in training. Last year alone, it spent &pound;33 million on recruitment advertising. What price can be put on restoring the confidence of mums and dads? What price can be put on justice?</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/30">The Deepcut and Beyond families group believes that a public inquiry into Army deaths, headed by a senior judge, would provide the best vehicle for achieving truth, justice and lasting change. They believe that such an inquiry would provide the best vehicle for the Government and the Army to work in partnership with families and learn from their experiences. They believe that such an inquiry, sitting in public, would provide the best opportunity to restore confidence in the Army and they urge the Government not to close their mind completely, but to keep the subject under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/31">The second question that I wish to address is what kind of independent oversight we need. I am delighted that Nicholas Blake QC placed his proposals for independent oversight at the centre of his recommendations. The review proposes introducing a legal requirement that all sudden deaths of Army personnel be referred to a coroner. It also proposes that the Ministry of Defence make funds available so that bereaved families can be advised and legally represented at inquests. Nicholas Blake has stated that failure to implement his proposals in full would shift the public interest towards a judicial inquiry, and the Minister will no doubt pay due regard to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/32">The Defence Committee has established the case for independent oversight of the armed services, and the Deepcut and Beyond families cogently put their detailed considerations to the Committee that considered the Armed Forces Bill. Let me, however, give the Minister some reassurances: the armed services have nothing to fear and everything to gain from establishing a robust mechanism for independent oversight. The Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland is recognised as a world leader in terms police accountability, and the chain of command of the Police Service of Northern Ireland has been not damaged by the ombudsman's effectiveness but immeasurably strengthened. The armed forces should set their standards of accountability at the level of a world leader.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/33">The effective operation of the armed forces does not require oversight with an independent element&mdash;it requires independent oversight full stop. The ombudsman or commissioner must be credible and able to operate without jurisdictional obstacles. His or her powers must be based on statutory authority. The commissioner should be a civilian, selected under an independent appointments procedure, who has independent tenure and their own premises outside the military estate. Legislation should guarantee sufficient funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/34">The oversight commissioner should be able to investigate any complaint referred to them and to initiate their own investigations, retrospectively if necessary, if they have reason to believe that it would be in the public interest to do so. The experience of oversight bodies in other countries suggests that problems with frivolous or vexatious complaints can be quite easily addressed through rules of procedure. The commissioner would not be in competition or conflict with the regular complaints mechanisms established through the chain of command or with other procedures that have been put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/35">The oversight commissioner will require sufficient powers so that their staff can operate effectively, including powers to enter barracks, seize documents and tap phones. Obstructing an investigation should be made a criminal offence. The commissioner should make an annual report to the Secretary of State, which should be laid before Parliament. In addition, they should publish research.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/36">The commissioner should be able to establish advisory bodies that involve people with particular expertise and skills. The experience of the Deepcut and Beyond families illustrates the value of involving families of service personnel to supplement the sources of information available to the commissioner. An independent families group could, for example, assist in establishing a lay visitor's panel to undertake inspections of barracks and military facilities. I hope that the Minister will take those comments into account when he examines proposals for the introduction of such a commissioner or ombudsman.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/37">How should we deal with deaths overseas? The Deepcut and Beyond families group has highlighted the absence of effective investigation when non-combat deaths occur overseas. The Royal Military Police are not seen as independent and lack the skills to conduct an investigation that would satisfy the requirements of the Human Rights Act 1998. There is rarely local civilian police involvement and there is no independent pathologist, no forensic expert and no opportunity for family involvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/38">Although we would expect an oversight commissioner to investigate deaths overseas when called on to do so, Nicholas Blake also looks, correctly, at strengthening existing mechanisms. Compulsory inquests or fatal accident inquiries would assist families in Scotland and Northern Ireland when the discretion of the procurator fiscal or coroner does not seem to have been exercised in the interests of further investigation. Nicholas Blake's proposal to bring the Royal Military Police under the scrutiny of Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary would lead naturally to consideration of further issues, such as the provision of adequate resources and the benefits of a human rights training programme in terms of the effective conduct of investigations into sudden and suspicious deaths.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/39">Will my hon. Friend therefore look into the manner in which non-combat deaths overseas are investigated? Will he consider meeting representatives of bereaved families to discuss their concerns and potential solutions? Many feel that the initial investigations, which sometimes took place some years ago, were totally inadequate.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/40">How far can we go in improving the exercise of the duty of care? Nicholas Blake misses the opportunity to draw a line under the recruitment of under-18s, but he makes several useful recommendations to assist the Army in exercising its duty of care, and I hope that they will be accepted as soon as possible. The Army should promote understanding and respect for human rights at all ranks, and the fundamental principle of human rights should be part of basic training.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/41">Let me mention some suggestions made by the families so that the Minister can consider them and reply in due course. First, there should be a mechanism to ensure parents' ongoing involvement in their children's welfare. Secondly, the Army should consider the means by which the Health and Safety Executive's jurisdiction can be extended to cover overseas bases and help protect against accidents. Thirdly, sustained action is needed to address the culture of alcohol abuse in the armed forces. Fourthly, attention needs to be given to shortcomings in the medical care regime and to its relationship with the chain of command, particularly where confidentiality issues arise. Fifthly, the Army should commission an independent study to monitor the experiences of soldiers who go absent without leave or who seek early discharge, with a view to publishing its findings and recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/42">Can we safeguard children and young soldiers at risk? The closed nature of the military establishment, the strict disciplinary regime and the absence of parental oversight make young soldiers particularly vulnerable to the attention of sexual predators. Deepcut and Beyond families point to the conviction in August 2003 of a former lance corporal and serial abuser, Leslie Skinner, who was initially charged with male rape and later convicted of multiple charges of indecent assault. Those offences were committed while he was employed as a non-commissioned officer trainer at Deepcut barracks in 1996 and 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/43">Leslie Skinner's history is well known, and several hon. Members want to participate in the debate, so I shall not go into detail. I note, however, that the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill, currently under consideration in the House of Lords, provides for an effective checking and vetting regime that could result in practical mechanisms for barring individuals from contact with children. It gives substance to the Government's commitment to ensuring that children stay safe, which is one of the five thematic outcomes of &quot;Every Child Matters&quot;. Although some recruits might fall outside the target group of children and young people aged between nought and 19, it is already recognised that the age range of the at-risk group might extend to 25 years where there are special or additional needs. Will the Minister take the opportunity presented by the Bill to ensure that young recruits are afforded further protection?</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/44">In a debate in the other place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-19">19 April</phrase>, Lord Ashley of Stoke recalled that almost 20 years before, when the Army's reputation was threatened by brutality, bullying and vicious initiation rites, he had proposed that there should be an independent ombudsman. He recalled how he had argued on <phrase class="date" code="1987-11-02">2 November 1987</phrase> that that would be</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/45" class="indent">&quot;the best way of transforming the Army ethos and of restoring its reputation.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-19">19 April 2006</phrase>; Vol. 680, c. 1116.]</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/46">Lord Ashley explained that the then Minister had responded to such calls with the by now familiar message that bullying is a serious offence, that it forms no part of proper service life and that the Government are clear that it cannot be tolerated.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/47">Surrey police, the Surrey coroner, Nicholas Blake and all who have had cause to look into the regime of &quot;horrendous bullying&quot;, &quot;foul abuse&quot; and &quot;sexual harassment&quot; at Deepcut barracks have expressed shock that the situation was allowed to persist for so long. The warning bells have been sounded. Proposals have been made. Now is the time for action. The Armed Forces Bill provides a timely legislative opening to introduce a series of reforms demonstrating a commitment to change that will support the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/48">In spite of all the concerns that I have raised and those that I have read about, our armed forces do us proud. They go abroad in our defence and look after our interests. Now is the time for us to look after their interests as well.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.484.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" speakername="Lembit pik" colnum="484"  time="014:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h03.htm#60503h03_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.484.2/1">I agree, but that is exactly why we need a full and independent public inquiry with the power legally to require witnesses to turn up. We are certainly not going to get the answers to which the hon. Gentleman refers if we adopt a voluntary, come-forward-if-you-dare process, which was more or less the constraint forced upon Mr. Blake.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/2">The crucial point is that Mr. Blake did not have the power to compel witnesses to stand. With the Blake review, the families have had to accept that everyone who knew details or factors relating to the deaths stepped forward voluntarily. I do not believe that that was the case, however, and it is hardly surprising that the families remain cautious about the conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/3">Before the Blake review, the families believed that a properly conducted public inquiry, with the power to compel witnesses to appear, was the only way of truly getting to the bottom of the Deepcut deaths. They continue to feel that way, so my second question is whether the Government are at least willing to hear representations from the parents about their views on the case for a public inquiry? It would be a cold-hearted Government indeed who were not willing to enter that dialogue.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/4">The Ministry of Defence is adamant that the problems that affected Deepcut so severely are things of the past&mdash;that relates to what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> said. However, according to the latest Army continuous attitude survey&mdash;the Army's own survey&mdash;8 per cent. of soldiers say that they have been bullied in the past 12 months; that is more than 7,000 personnel. Of those soldiers who complained about unfair treatment, discrimination, harassment or bullying, 77 per cent. were not satisfied with the way the complaint was handled.</p>

	<p pid="a.485.1/1">I would like to, but I know that the hon. Lady wishes to catch your eye, Mrs. Anderson, and I must be a little self-disciplined with my time keeping.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/2">In his summation, Mr. Blake expressed the hope that the lessons of Deepcut could be learned. In light of that, I am joining the calls made by other hon. Members for the Government to move immediately to establish an armed forces ombudsman, as the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood suggested. My third question is, therefore, what the Minister's view is on that recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/3">I stress that the families need time to absorb fully the contents of Mr. Blake's report. They should be given the space to take in the conclusions and recommendations. Then they will have the space and the time to make a formal response to the report. It is vital that the families receive as much information as possible about the deaths of their children. It is a scandal that the evidence given to the Devon and Cornwall constabulary in its review of Surrey police's activities has not been made available to the parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/4">We should remember that the Devon and Cornwall investigation took two years. Surrey police had plenty of time to devise a satisfactory means of disclosure but failed to do so. As a result, the Deepcut parents have still not had access to the 150-page report, a full seven months after Devon and Cornwall constabulary published a three-page executive summary.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/5">In my view there has been a deliberate culture of secrecy, with the parents being prevented from seeing that full report and the ludicrous referral of a member of the Surrey police authority, Mr. Terry Dicks, to the standards boards of England for daring to request a copy of the report. I note that the chair and the vice-chair of the authority, who have no more legal status than the authority, were given copies; that indicates that something has gone wrong with the process. My fourth question is whether the Minister will investigate the circumstances surrounding the withholding of that report and other supportive information. It was used by Mr. Blake, and it was used by Surrey police to produce a short summary, but it has not been shown to others, including the parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/6">Finally, one of Mr. Blake's chief recommendations was that</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/7" class="indent">&quot;agreement should be reached as to any further disclosure needed to enable the families of Sean Benton, Cheryl James and Geoff Gray to consider whether a fresh inquest into their respective child's death is in the interests of justice.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/8">The Deepcut affair has exposed the secretive and opaque nature of police and military culture. The parents have had to fight every step of the way to get closer to the truth of what happened to their children. To regain the trust of the Deepcut families, and, significantly, of the public, the police need to operate in an more open and transparent manner. They should share, not block, access to information contained in the Devon and Cornwall police report.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/9">I call on the Minister to work with his colleagues in the Home Office to ensure that the Devon and Cornwall police report is disclosed in full to the parents of those who died at Deepcut. Only when the parents have seen all the evidence can they decide how best to continue their campaign. As the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood pointed out, the coroner said that matters needed to be investigated thoroughly and independently and that the authorities should have nothing to fear from a full inquiry. The Minister should explain why the Government and the police are not taking that recommendation seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/10">I have not enjoyed pushing endlessly for the Government to take a more open and transparent approach towards the four tragic deaths at the Deepcut Army barracks. However, given the litany of failings exposed at each turn, I am more convinced than ever that it was right to do so. I do not enjoy the prospect of applying ever more pressure on the Government to get to the bottom of the unanswered questions and to get Ministers to share reports that have been kept secret until now, allegedly to protect individual identities, despite the fact that disclosure could easily have been arranged in a way that protected those identities.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/11">In the interests of scotching further rumours that the official story has been covered up, and to ensure that everyone can have full faith in the investigations of Surrey police and others, I ask the Minister to assure the House that he will consider full disclosure of the reports. Either way, the Government can be assured that the issue will not go away until those questions are answered.</p>

	<p pid="a.486.0/1">I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase> for securing this debate, and for her tenacious campaigning on behalf of Deepcut and Beyond. I also pay tribute to Deepcut and Beyond; I have had the privilege of meeting the group on a number of occasions in my role as a member of the Select Committee on Defence and, more recently, as a member of the Committee considering the Armed Forces Bill. That determined group of individuals has done a great public service by exposing some of the most horrendous cases of bullying and by asking questions on matters that have been covered up by the military for far too long.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.0/2">I support the armed forces not least because many young recruits come from my constituency and the north-east&mdash;and they are proud to serve in the armed forces. However, I am not proud of the way in which some people have been treated in the armed forces. The Deepcut and Beyond group of families has exposed some problems, and not only at Deepcut; as my hon. Friend said, Mrs. Farr and others are continuing their work by helping new recruits at Catterick.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.0/3">In the last Parliament, I had the privilege of being a member of the Defence Committee when it considered the duty of care that the three armed forces have for youngsters in their charge. The inquiry lasted a year and took evidence not only from families but from the three armed forces. The Committee's report is a definitive work on the way in which such youngsters are looked after. As an historic reference, some past practices were appalling. The Committee heard not only how the Deepcut families were treated but heard shocking evidence of how others had been treated and how they were dealt with afterwards. There has been an improvement in the way in which the armed forces handle things&mdash;for instance, in what they should do if people die while in the forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.0/4">Recently, I moved new clause 24 to the Armed Forces Bill, in which I called for an independent commissioner to oversee complaints against the armed forces. Without such a commissioner, the reputation of the armed forces, which has been damaged, will continue to fall. The Bill gives us the opportunity to put matters right. I withdrew the new clause because the Blake report was due to be published the following afternoon, and I did not want to pre-empt it. I was assured by the Minister that the Government would consider those issues as the Bill went through Parliament and in their response to the Blake report.</p>

	<p pid="a.492.1/1">Thank you for allowing me to contribute to this debate, Mrs. Anderson. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase> on securing it, and on the way in which she presented her case. It has been a thoughtful and interesting debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/2">Families put their trust in the Army to care for their children, and, as we know, in many cases soldiers are children. Many are plucked straight from school, from which they could return to the comfort of their homes every night. The change is a shock in itself. The new regime can be trying to even the most hardened. We all appreciate that serving in our armed forces is no picnic. Preparing for the brutalities of war requires preparation, endeavour, grit and talent. Young men and women return from the Army, having left only a few months earlier as boys and girls.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/3">According to Amnesty International, between 1990 and 2003 some 1,748 members of the UK armed forces lost their lives through non-natural causes in or around barracks. Of those, 200 deaths were self-inflicted. Between 1984 and 2005, some 638 suicides occurred amongst members of the UK regular armed forces. Overall, the male suicide rates in the UK armed forces were statistically lower than in the general UK population. The exception was among Army males aged under 20, who had an increased risk of about 50 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/4">Often, we can only speculate on the reasons for each of those deaths, but perhaps there are a few indicators. Last year's Army continuous attitude survey found that two out of three soldiers do not feel valued by the Army, and one in four say that their morale is low or very low. Over half of all soldiers are not satisfied with their accommodation, and 44 per cent. say that Army life is worse or much worse than they expected. A staggering 8 per cent. of soldiers say that they have been bullied in the past 12 months. That equates to more than 7,000 personnel. Crucially, of those soldiers who complained about unfair treatment, discrimination, harassment or bullying in the past 12 months, 77 per cent. were not satisfied with how the complaint was handled.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/5">The deaths at Deepcut have sent shockwaves throughout the armed forces, the Ministry of Defence, the Government and indeed this House. As we know, the Blake report made 34 important recommendations and suggested that there were systemic failings. I will list five of those failings: there was poor appreciation of the needs of recruits under the age of 18; there were poor supervision levels, often as low as 1:60; there was bullying; there were high levels of dissatisfaction and extremely low morale; and, finally, there were poor grievance procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/6">So what should our response be? The Liberal Democrats have welcomed the Blake report and call for full and rapid implementation of its recommendations. There are 34 serious recommendations that require a serious and prompt response. When will we hear a full report in response? I was pleased to read that Lord Drayson has given a commitment to reporting back quickly. He said that would happen &quot;within months&quot;. Well, one of those months has already passed. I would welcome an indication of how that consideration is progressing, and roughly when we can expect a full response.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/7">The Liberal Democrats agree that a public inquiry is not necessary provided that the families have access to all the reports and evidence. In recommendation 3, Blake examines whether it is right for the UK to be one of the few countries that recruits child soldiers&mdash;that is, those under 18. We have had international criticism for that policy. The review says that recruiting needs are not a satisfactory justification, but goes on to say that the policy is justified given the inadequacies of education and training in the UK's civilian system. The report says that although the education benefits outweigh the downside of having child soldiers, a number of special safeguards are required. The first is the separation of 16 year-olds; the second is a right to resign for those still in training, even those who have passed their 18th birthday; the third and most important is that no posting to the field Army should occur before the age of 18. Do the Government intend to implement those immediately?</p>

	<p pid="a.493.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that when we quote statistics we have to be careful to reflect the trend? The trend of army solider satisfaction with accommodation is most definitely one of improvement; there is much higher satisfaction now than there was in 1997, when this Government took over.</p>

	<p pid="a.494.3/1">This is the first time I have had the pleasure of serving under your chairmanship, Mrs. Anderson. I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the work she does as chairman of the all-party group, the work of which I know hon. Members support.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/2">The hon. Lady and others have understandably focused on the investigation stage of the process and what has happened since the deaths, but I shall focus on some issues raised in the Blake review, which others have mentioned, concerning events leading up to the deaths. In other words, what could the Ministry of Defence do better to avoid deaths in the first place, thus avoiding going through the investigation process?</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/3">As many hon. Members have done, I pay tribute on behalf of the Opposition to all members of our armed forces who serve their country with distinction, and to their families, who provide a great deal of support for that service. In return, we owe them a thorough debate and a thorough consideration of the Blake recommendations to ensure that they have the very best possible conditions of service.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/4">It is worth saying that the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces face a considerable challenge. As has been said, the armed forces recruit people who are sometimes from very challenging backgrounds, many of whom are under 18, and the forces have to turn them into professional soldiers. That requires a robust training regime. A regime that was not robust would not do proper service to those young people because it would subject them to difficult and challenging conditions without the proper training and without equipping them to deal with what are often life-threatening situations. A difficult balance must be undertaken. There must be a tough and robust training regime to ensure that those young people are ready for combat, but we must also ensure that the duty of care is properly fulfilled. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">The hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> drew attention to the thorough report that the Select Committee on Defence produced on the duty of care, which thoroughly considered these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.3/5">The Opposition support the continuation of recruitment of those who are under 18: they make a tremendous contribution to the armed forces. The Blake report said that a number of things could be done prior to recruitment as part of the recruitment process, and I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments. In at least two of the Deepcut cases, there was a known&mdash;though not known to the Army&mdash;history of self-harm. Will the Minister to comment on what progress has been made on improving the knowledge that the Army has of the medical histories of recruits? To what extent can that knowledge be better taken into account when people are recruited, either to make appropriate decisions about recruitment, or, just as importantly, if recruits are at risk and are still thought right for the armed forces, to ensure that they are given appropriate care during their training and service?</p>

	<p pid="a.495.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I shall come in a few moments to some of the points about the family's view of the investigations.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.1/2">The other element of the training and supervisory regime to which attention has been drawn was the proper ratio between trainees and those in charge of their supervision. Blake notes that that ratio was at times only 1:60. In 2004, the then Secretary of State for Defence said that a target of 1:38 was being achieved. It would be helpful if the Minister told us whether that ratio is being achieved. Is it being achieved at all locations, through the day and night? If we have not yet achieved it, what progress is being made towards attaining it?</p>
	<p pid="a.495.1/3">Regarding the investigations, however well we improve and implement recruitment and training, and whatever the level of supervision, it is inevitable that there will be deaths in Army barracks in future. Some will be accidental and some will not. When they occur, we need to ensure that the right processes are in place, so that families feel that their concerns are being addressed and the investigatory process should be as open as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.1/4">Comments have been made about who has primacy in an investigation. Blake drew attention to that, and a protocol was signed on <phrase class="date" code="">7 November</phrase> that made the position clear. However, given that there were already protocols in place that did not seem to be well understood by at least some police forces, it would be helpful to know what follow-up work is taking place to ensure that the protocol of <phrase class="date" code="">7 November</phrase> is well understood in the armed forces and constabularies throughout the country. We must ensure that such information is properly communicated and well understood. If any such tragedies occur in future, that protocol should be in place right from the beginning.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.1/5">During any future investigation, the most important thing will be that families are kept fully informed and there must be transparency and openness. If that does not take place from the beginning and is neglected, as it was at Deepcut, families will suspect that there is something they are not being told and that there is a cover-up. I suspect that once they have that impression, nothing that can be done in the case of their loved ones can ever completely remove that sense of suspicion. I suspect that that is the situation now. I am not sure that anything can be done to satisfy completely the families of the four soldiers who lost their lives at Deepcut&mdash;a point to which one or two Members have alluded.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.1/6">In his statement about the Deepcut review, the Minister of State for the Armed Forces said that the Armed Forces Bill would provide the opportunity to implement a number of those changes.</p>

	<p pid="a.496.1/1">I am reluctant to give way, because I want to give time to the Minister to answer all queries, if the hon. Gentleman will forgive me.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.1/2">In the other place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-19">19 April</phrase>, Lord Drayson made a specific commitment. He said that the Government expected to be able to respond to all the recommendations from the Blake report within two months. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" name="Willie Rennie">the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie)</phrase> said, we are halfway through that process. It would be helpful if the Minister did not go through each recommendation in detail but gave us some idea about the progress that the Ministry of Defence has made and about whether we are on track to hear its full response to those 34 recommendations, as Lord Drayson said, by the end of May.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.1/3">The Armed Forces Bill is a vehicle to implement some of those changes. I understand that it will be back before the House in the week commencing <phrase class="date" code="">22 May</phrase>, which is only a couple of weeks away. That does not give the Ministry of Defence very long to publish any amendments to the legislation, so that Members may have a proper opportunity to study them. I should be grateful if the Minister outlined the Ministry of Defence's thinking about whether it will hit that timetable, and when in good time it intends to publish any amendments, so that the debate can take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.1/4">One thing that came out of studying the documents was that there has been a significant number of reports and investigations. A number of Members have today repeated the call for a public inquiry, and it is worth restating the Opposition's position, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1938" name="Liam Fox">my hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox)</phrase> laid out in response to the statement from the Minister of State.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.1/5">There are those who believe that a public inquiry is essential for restoring public confidence in the Army. I do not think that there is a general lack of confidence in the British Army. There may be specific anxieties, but I do not believe that a public inquiry would deal with them, nor, in particular, with some of the media reporting that would inevitably attend it. An inquiry would be a vehicle for ill-informed speculation that could make the situation worse. Given that some of the investigations were poorly handled in the first place, and given the suspicion at the beginning of the process, from the families' point of view, they may always quite understandably have a nagging suspicion that there is something that they have not been told. I am not convinced that a public inquiry would address that issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.497.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase> on securing this timely debate. She has been hard-working and assiduous in these matters for several years. I can testify that she has been hard-working and diligent from the number of questions that she has put to me. The whole House owes her a debt for the work that she has done. I acknowledge the many contributions that have been made during this important and wide-ranging debate and shall do my best to respond to as many as I can.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/2">I extend my sincere condolences to the families who have mourned that untimely loss of loved ones. I am sure that the expressions made by colleagues this afternoon underpin that. As I have emphasised to the House on many occasions, we take seriously our responsibility to ensure the well-being and safety of all our personnel. Each and every death is a tragedy in its own right. We must ensure that we learn the lessons from those tragic cases and do everything we can to ensure that such incidents do not happen again.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/3">There are approximately 190,000 people in our armed forces. Almost 102,000 are regular and full-time reserve members of the Army. Last year, almost 8,000 recruits passed through training to join the field Army. The vast majority will go on to enjoy rewarding and challenging careers in our services. They will eventually leave the Army equipped with a range of skills and experiences often far beyond their expectations when they signed up.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/4">The Army is extraordinarily successful at taking young people from all walks of life and backgrounds and quickly turning them into soldiers, positive role models and good citizens. The high-quality training that those young men and women receive delivers outstanding results, from war fighting, through peace-support and counter-terrorist operations, to a range of roles supporting the UK civilian community.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/5">That training bears fruit time and again in theatres of operation throughout a turbulent world: Iraq, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and the Balkans are all recent examples. But we must not and cannot be complacent. Many comments in today's discussion have focused on the review conducted by Nicholas Blake QC, which considered the circumstances surrounding the deaths of four young soldiers at Deepcut. The report concluded that although the Army did not cause any of the deaths, there were worrying failures to identify and address sources of risk. Importantly, Mr. Blake concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that bullying caused the deaths of those reviewed. However, he raised some important questions about the nature of the training environment at that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/6">We take those findings seriously. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces, who is, incidentally, in the Falkland Islands, made clear our response in his statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-29">29 March</phrase>. We are committed to a process of continuous improvement. The Deepcut review will add momentum to our programme of change. We fully acknowledge the weaknesses that the report identified, and appreciate the urgency required in putting them right.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/7">Several hon. Members have raised the need for a public inquiry into the deaths at Deepcut. The Deepcut review concluded that on the basis of current evidence, a public inquiry is not necessary. We share that view and, given the extensive investigations that have taken place, agree with the conclusion that nothing would be gained from a public inquiry. Considering the Deepcut review as a whole, the important thing is to learn the lessons, to continue to move forward and to provide the best possible welfare support for our young trainees.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/8">Nicholas Blake's report raised the issue of a military complaints commissioner, and it has been referred to today. We have been considering for some time how we can best ensure that our personnel have the confidence to raise a grievance and the assurance that their grievance will be dealt with quickly, effectively and fairly. Our underlying aim is for a complaints system that is right for the way in which our armed forces operate. The system must be fair, transparent, effective and prompt. It must more than anything be a system in which all service personnel have complete confidence. I am sure that everyone present shares that view.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/9">To that end, in Committee on the Armed Forces Bill we proposed improvements to our complaints system. I have no doubt that we will return to them on Report and Third Reading later this month. We are considering in detail Mr. Blake's recommendations about the complaints process. His proposal to establish a commissioner of military complaints will be rightly and properly considered under the auspices of the Bill. If colleagues will forgive me, I do not want to go any further down that track, because we will come to it on Report and Third Reading.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/10">I turn to the matter of family attendance at boards of inquiry, which currently are not open to members of the public or press, or to family members unless they are called as witnesses. As I said in Committee, there are two main reasons why families are not usually allowed to attend service inquiries. The first is that we think that having members of the public and family members at inquiries could inhibit witnesses from giving full and frank evidence. The second is that boards of inquiry could convene and adjourn several times over a number of months, possibly in different parts of the world. Ultimately, our concern is that the attendance of families at inquiries might prevent boards of inquiry from achieving their primary aims, which are to learn lessons and prevent similar incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/11">I reiterate a point that I made in Committee: a board of inquiry is not an inquest and cannot serve the same purpose as an inquest. Mr. Blake made specific recommendations concerning boards of inquiry, which we will examine carefully. I assure the House that we are considering in detail all the recommendations in the review, some of which are challenging and require significant consideration. As that work is ongoing, colleagues will understand that there is a limit to what I can say until we have carefully considered the review in its entirety. However, I am determined to see how Mr. Blake's recommendations can best be implemented without reducing the effectiveness of our necessarily robust and challenging military training environment. As soon as we are in a position to do so, we will publish in full our formal response to the Deepcut review.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.499.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1657" speakername="Don Touhig" colnum="499"  time="015:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h03.htm#60503h03_spnew34">
	<p pid="a.499.1/1">That is certainly our ambition. The Armed Forces Bill is returning to the House and if there are to be any amendments, we need to deal with them as soon as possible. That is what we are currently working to.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/2">Recently, a number of hon. Members have raised concerns on the issue of bullying and harassment in the Army, particularly regarding the troubling perception that there is a possible link between bullying and the number of non-combat deaths in the armed forces. Incidents of bullying, harassment and other inappropriate behaviour exist in society as a whole and can never be completely eliminated, but it is essential that we should do all we can to establish an environment in which they are deemed absolutely unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/3">Bullying is insidious, corrosive and totally against the principle of self-discipline and the concept of teamwork at the core of our armed forces. Soldiers are often asked to operate in a harsh environment, and training has to prepare them for that, but there is a distinct, although sometimes fine, line between a robust approach to training and to discipline and bullying. No one should be in any doubt which side of the line we expect our soldiers to tread. At every stage of their training and careers it is made clear to them all that bullying and harassment, in any form, are not tolerated. All recruits and trainees are offered clear guidance on the relevant processes so that any allegations of such unacceptable conduct can be investigated thoroughly and dealt with appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/4">It is a sad and unfortunate fact, and in our wider society, that the armed forces will never be able to eradicate the tragic incidence of suicide. We can, however, by careful management, pragmatic policies, better understanding and improved knowledge and education reduce the risks. The Army has updated its guidance and procedures on the prevention and management of suicide and self-harm. An Army suicide vulnerability risk management policy has also recently been introduced. It provides detailed and mandatory guidance to those in the chain of command about how to identify those at risk and how to manage and care for them proactively.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/5">Work on suicide risk management is continuing on a tri-service basis in relation to prevention, screening, reporting, data collection, training and education. In the past 18 months, multi-disciplinary service and civilian groups have been set up to promote good practice and mental well-being across the armed forces. We are continually working to improve the support available to individuals, especially through accessible, professional welfare services operating to common defence standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/6">More generally, we are committed to the well-being and safety of all our personnel. That is a fundamental responsibility for individuals throughout the chain of command from the moment they join the armed forces. In the early days of an individual's career, we recognise the vital role of our instructors at service training establishments. We already have work in hand to improve the training provided to them through the development of the &quot;train the trainer&quot; programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/7">Support to personnel is provided in the first instance by the military staff of the recruits' training teams. In addition, every unit has a comprehensive welfare system which is widely publicised. There is a network of agencies including chaplains, WRVS volunteers, and unit welfare officers. Personnel also have access to single service confidential helplines and the Samaritans helpline, so a range of measures are in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/8">I shall address some of the points raised by my colleagues. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood, who initiated the debate, and tell her that we continue to improve our complaints procedure, which we will make more robust. She was, perhaps, a little unfair to the Royal Military Police, who execute their duties professionally. No system is perfect, and there are glitches and difficulties from time to time, but on the whole they do a good job.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/9">I will study points one to five that my hon. Friend made and, if it helps, will willingly invite her to meet me and discuss them in detail. Perhaps we can work together to take forward her hopes and aspirations in relation to this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/10">My hon. Friend also asked about the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill. I have written to my hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills indicating that we completely support the Bill. When it is enacted, it will help us with our military training.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit pik">The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> spoke passionately about the families whom he has been supporting. I do not think that we have ever said that there is closure on this matter. We will respond to Blake, and judgments will have to be made on whether anything further can or should be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/12">I pay tribute to the important comments made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase>. He also made some excellent comments in our debates on the Armed Forces Bill, and we have benefited from his help and advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/13"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" name="Pete Wishart">The hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> raised some issues. I certainly understand the Collinson family's desire for closure. However, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> said, even a public inquiry might not tell people exactly how their children died. If it were in my power to do that, I would, but I am not certain that it is achievable.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/14">I recently wrote to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1636" name="Jim Dobbin">my hon. Friend the Member for Heywood and Middleton (Jim Dobbin)</phrase> and followed up my correspondence yesterday in further discussions with him.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/15"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">The hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> raised a number of points on behalf of the Opposition, to which I shall respond in writing if he will permit me, as I need to study some of them further. I certainly hope that we can complete our deliberations as far as Blake is concerned. If we do not manage to table amendments before the Bill is reported on <phrase class="date" code="">22 May</phrase>, we will do so in the other place and bring the Bill back in the normal way.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/16">We at the Ministry of Defence, are not simply Ministers, officials, and members of the armed forces. We are also fathers, mothers, and people with families. We intuitively understand how important it is that young people are looked after and valued, and we feel passionately about the care that we provide to them. We are acutely aware of the sensitivity of the issues raised today and of the need for us urgently to address areas of weakness.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/17">We deeply regret the death of anyone in our charge. Each family has suffered a great loss and understandably still carries a burden. No matter what is said today by me or anyone else in this House, those families will continue to have that pain and suffering for the rest of their lives. I fear that there is nothing we can do to mitigate that. I certainly share with them in that respect. I know that there is nothing that we can do to restore their loved ones to them, but we can continue to improve how we care for those who are in our charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/18">I have on my desk a mission statement, which simply says: &quot;We value our servicemen and women and their families and will do everything in our power to demonstrate that.&quot; It is the first thing that I see every morning when I walk into my office. That is why I am a Minister, and why I want to do something about the issues raised here today. Working in partnership, my colleagues and I can do something to try to ensure that the tragedies that we have talked about today&mdash;whatever their causes&mdash;may not be repeated.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.510.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" speakername="Philip Hollobone" colnum="510"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h05.htm#60503h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.510.1/1">I thank Mr. Speaker for allowing me this debate, and the Minister for being here to listen to my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/2">Today marks 58 years since Israel declared its independence. Israel is a democracy, committed to western values, freedom and the rule of law, located, I am afraid, in a sea of hostile Arab states. Today also marks 58 years that Israel has been fighting for its survival against those hostile neighbours and terrorist groups who, in many cases, still refuse to recognise Israel's right to exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/3">I am thinking in particular of Hamas, the radical Islamist terrorist organisation, which won an overwhelming majority in the Palestinian elections in January. Hamas won 74 of the 132 seats in the Palestinian legislative council elections and has filled the Palestinian Authority with Ministers who, I am afraid to say, defend the deliberate killing of innocent Israeli civilians.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/4">The Hamas movement was born out of the extremist Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. It is committed to the destruction of Israel through armed struggle and the establishment of an Islamic republic of Palestine based on sharia law. Between 1989 and 2005, Hamas killed 579 Israelis, and wounded 3,235 more, in brutal acts of terrorism; some 93 per cent. of these were civilian casualties. Hamas suicide bombers have attacked Israel at least 58 times&mdash;symbolically, one for each year since Israel declared its independence in 1948.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/5">Britain should remain steadfast with regard to Hamas and should not be led to water down the three preconditions set by the Quartet on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase>. Hamas needs to understand that it needs to recognise Israel, commit to non-violence, end terrorism, and accept previous agreements and obligations signed by its Palestinian predecessors. The Minister should not waver: all three conditions must be fulfilled before Britain and the west should even consider dialogue or meetings with Hamas. The Minister must remain firm and vigilant against Hamas, and lead the international community to pressurising Hamas to commit to a two-state solution: a secure Israel living side by side with a viable state of Palestine.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/6">Hamas must end its violence and terrorism, and it is in the British national interest to promote freedom and democracy against that oppression and terror. Her Majesty's Government should not waver on any of the conditions set for the new Hamas-led Palestinian Authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/7">There are those who hope that Hamas will be moderate in office, but I am afraid that its actions show the opposite. Although it has, by and large, respected the ceasefire negotiated by Abu Mazen in February 2005, many Hamas leaders continue to defend terrorism against Israel, and they ally themselves with abhorrent regimes, themselves state sponsors and financiers of terrorism, such as Iran and Syria, that openly call for Israel to be &quot;wiped off the map&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/8">Last month, Tehran hosted a &quot;support for the Palestinian intifada conference&quot;, which was attended by Hamas's political bureau chief, Khaled Meshaal. Iran has pledged $50 million to finance the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority. Hamas is an integral part of the fundamentalist regime in Iran, which, as we all know, seeks to export terrorism and wage jihad against western democracy and values. With close links to an Iranian regime hellbent on acquiring nuclear weapons and destabilising the whole of the middle east, the Hamas Government are exposed as a regime with the same goals: destruction of Israel and an attack on western democracy and values.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/9">Hamas's Foreign Minister, Mahmoud al-Zahar, is openly an extremist and is cultivating links with Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia, rather than&mdash;as I am sure we would all wish&mdash;showing moderation to the west. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March</phrase>, Hamas's Interior Minister, Said Siyam, who is responsible for Palestinian internal security forces, publicly committed himself not to order arrests of operatives who carry out terrorist attacks against Israel. Siyam's declaration amounts to an open invitation to all terrorists, including al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Fatah militias.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/10">In effect, the Hamas regime, far from being a moderating influence, is facilitating continued terrorist attacks on Israel while disclaiming responsibility. Although the Hamas movement appears to abide by a ceasefire with Israel, the policy of the Hamas Government is to allow terrorists free rein. Hamas failed to condemn the first suicide bombing to take place after it took power in January. Instead, it called it &quot;an act of self-defence&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/11">Not only is Hamas refusing to criticise publicly acts of terrorism, but it has actually been implicated in the attacks itself. For example, an investigation into the attempted suicide bombing at the Karni crossing on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-26">26 April</phrase> revealed that it was carried out by the popular resistance committees in the Gaza strip, which are under the direction of Hamas.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/12">There are glaring inconsistencies in the messages that Hamas sends out to the western and Arab media on the issues of terrorism, Israel and negotiations. Indeed, Hamas's media strategy is to adapt its various messages to the relevant target audience. To the western media, Hamas attempts to put across a soft image; to the Arab media, including that in Palestine, Hamas presents a defiant and uncompromising image, including on issues such as terrorism, the peace process and recognition of Israel.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/13">For example, Hamas's Prime Minister, Ismail Haniya, has been labelled a pragmatist in some of the western press. Yet it was Haniya who took credit for a Hamas suicide bus bombing in 2003, which killed 23 Israelis and wounded 130. In March this year, in the Arabic press, Haniya said the following on the issue of the recognition of Israel:</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/14" class="indent">&quot;One of the basic principles of the new Government is not to surrender to international threats and to refuse to recognize Israel.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/15">However, days earlier, in the western media, he had said:</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/16" class="indent">&quot;We will respect the agreements which will ensure the establishment of a Palestinian state on the '67 lines, as well as the release of prisoners. If Israel withdraws to the '67 lines, we will formulate peace in stages.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/17">That dual message speaks for itself. Hamas continues to support terrorism, refuses to recognise Israel and shows no sign at all of accepting the notion of a two- state solution. Sadly, the evidence suggests that, far from a democratic Palestine, we could be witnessing the emergence of an Islamist state on Israel's doorstep, with vested interests from fundamentalist regimes such as Iran and Syria and terrorist groups including al-Qaeda and Hezbollah.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/18">Will Her Majesty's Government grant assurances that they will remain steadfast against Hamas and remain committed to all the preconditions set by the Quartet on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase>? Will the Minister also make assurances that Her Majesty's Government will not become lenient in interpreting the preconditions set by the Quartet? It is unacceptable when the Foreign Secretary says, as he did in Riyadh only a few weeks ago, that recognition of Israel does not mean a formal declaration by Hamas, but just a practical acceptance of the &quot;reality&quot; of the Jewish state. Hamas, in its entirety, is a terrorist organisation proscribed by the European Union. Will the Minister join me in condemning the leader of the Liberal Democrats in the EU for recently meeting with the Hamas Speaker of the Palestinian Parliament?</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/19">In conclusion, Britain should stand united with Israel against Hamas and remain vigilant that Hamas recognises Israel, ends terrorism and accepts a two-state solution based on the road map to peace.</p>

	<p pid="a.512.0/1">Thank you for calling me, Mrs. Anderson. It is a double pleasure to have you chair the debate, because you chaired another Adjournment debate earlier today&mdash;we must be the only assembly in the world that has six Adjournments a day. That debate was on Nepal, another troubled part of the world, and, since the majority of the world's conflicts come under my brief, we will no doubt share the room again.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> on tabling this Adjournment debate. It has come at a crucial time for developments in the middle east, not least because today is Israeli independence day. As he has explained, it is important that we work to ensure that that independence is protected and that the Israeli people are allowed to enjoy a life free from the threat of terrorism, violence and murder that they have faced for so long. Of course, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-25">25 January</phrase> a new Palestinian Government were elected and on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-28">28 March</phrase> the Israeli people also elected a new Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/3">As I made clear to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-25">25 April</phrase>, we recognise Hamas's democratic mandate as a result of free and fair elections, but that mandate comes with responsibilities. Democracy is about more than elections but, as I have also made clear, it is essential that the Hamas-led Government commit to non-violence, recognise Israel, and accept previous agreements and obligations, including the road map. I say that in all humility because I cannot see another way in which we will reach the two-state solution that, in my view, is absolutely vital in the middle east peace process. The road map remains the best way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/4">We are watching developments closely. Hamas needs to start to implement the three principles and to make clear the path it intends to take. Its response to the Tel Aviv suicide bomb attack on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-17">17 April</phrase> was unacceptable and reprehensible. I thought that the hon. Gentleman's explanation of the expert way in which Hamas manipulates the news media to communicate dual messages to suit its different audiences was valuable and insightful. Never underestimate it because, like Osama bin Laden, it uses the media in a clever and effective way.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/5">There has been a great deal of controversy about what we should do about pledged support and continued support for the Palestinian people. That is important, as the Palestinian people have been hugely subsidised for a long time. I have made known my sadness at going to Ramallah and seeing luxury apartments surrounding the city, despite the fact that the local economy has allegedly collapsed. One wonders where that money came from. A lot of it came from the donations that countries such as ours gave, over the years, to Yasser Arafat and, I am afraid, a lot of it was distributed to his cronies through corruption. The last people to benefit from it were the Palestinians. That rankles, and certainly goes a long way to explain why Hamas did so well in the Palestinian elections. People were looking for an organisation that would challenge corruption, which is something that we must take into account and treat seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/6">The international community and the UK will continue to support the Palestinian people and to help provide for their basic needs. The Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for International Development and the Foreign Secretary have all made it clear that the United Kingdom will continue to support the Palestinian people. Although donors have stopped direct budgetary support to the Palestinian Authority, they continue to provide support to the Palestinian people and help to provide for their basic needs. Only a co-ordinated response by the international community will achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/7">We, along with our EU partners, have a strong record of support for the Palestinian people. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-25">25 April</phrase> the Department for International Development announced a &pound;15 million payment to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. The United Kingdom alone has given &pound;147 million to the Palestinian people since 2001. That is an enormous sum of money. We want to restart our funding to the Palestinian Authority, but we cannot do that until Hamas takes the necessary steps. In the meantime, we are actively looking at how we can help meet the Palestinian people's basic needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/8">Of course, this is the hon. Gentleman's Adjournment debate and he has acquitted himself well. However, I remind him that the middle east peace process is a process, and that we should also take the opportunity to remind the new Israeli Government, for whom we have great hopes, that they must stop any action that contravenes the agreement that should be part of the road map. They must stop building illegal settlements and stop the construction of the separation barrier on Palestinian land.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/9">I have been there and I have seen for myself the damage that the separation barrier is doing. I am very much a supporter of the two-state solution, but I have heard some shocking statistics, such as that only 20 per cent. of the barrier is on or behind the agreed green line. Some 80 per cent. of the barrier is in Palestinian territory. That does not help. It does not help those of us who are passionate supporters of Israel and the Israeli people, as much as we are supporters of the Palestinians. It is very important that we recognise that what I have described is contrary to international law and threatens the viability of an agreed two-state solution.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-03a.514.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1763" speakername="Kim Howells" colnum="514"  time="016:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060503/halltext/60503h05.htm#60503h05_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.514.1/1">I understand that completely. On my last visit to Israel I went to talk to what one might call old friends on the Israeli left who were born and brought up on kibbutzim, one of which was, if I recall rightly, on the old road to Jerusalem. They told me very reluctantly that life was a lot easier now the barrier had been built. They admitted that reluctantly because they always wanted to live alongside Palestinians. They did not want divisions. They believed that it was possible for people to live together.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/2">I understand entirely the hon. Gentleman's point. If the Israelis want to build that barrier, that is up to them, and of course that is what they have done. However, the route that the barrier takes is an extremely important issue. If it incorporates Palestinian land&mdash;as it certainly has done&mdash;there are problems, as the Israeli High Court has admitted. Sometimes it has overruled the proposed routes, saying, &quot;No, it mustn't go that way, because it's illegal.&quot; I very much hope that the Israelis, even at this point, listen to pleas from countries such as ours to reconsider that route, because it allows the wound to fester, and there have been too many festering wounds in that part of the world. I understand entirely why the Israelis have built the barrier, but hope very much that they understand that we feel strongly about the route that has been taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/3">In answer to the hon. Gentleman's specific question, the Foreign Secretary told the Foreign Affairs Committee in March that we remain committed to key Security Council resolutions Nos. 242, 338 and 1373. We believe that the Israeli Government should adhere to international law, and we remain concerned by Israeli policies on settlements and the barrier&mdash;and especially on access to Jerusalem, which threatens to cut off Palestinian east Jerusalem from the west bank. Those policies will have serious economic, social and humanitarian consequences for Palestinians, and they risk reducing the possibility of reaching a final status agreement on Jerusalem.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/4">I shall develop my argument. Although I understand the security considerations, those whom I met in the kibbutz told me that the last thing they want is an economic basket case on the borders of Israel. The Palestinian state must be economically viable, and that will require some rapid rethinking of the way in which blockades can prevent the development of the economy and so on. There has to be a balance. There is never an easy answer to the question of how to protect one's own citizens and at the same time allow the proper economic development of a neighbouring state. It is extremely important.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/5">I shall move on, as I have only a few minutes left. The hon. Gentleman asked if I would give him an assurance that we will remain steadfast against Hamas, at least with its present policies and statements. We stand fully behind the Quartet's three principles of a Hamas commitment to non-violence, its recognition of Israel and its acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including the road map. We are monitoring the situation closely. Hamas will be judged not only on its words but on its actions. If Hamas shows real political leadership and imagination, it could make the necessary change; and it should understand that if it makes that change the international community will respond.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/6">I have chosen my words carefully because I know that the hon. Gentleman feels strongly about the matter. I am sure that many in the new Israeli Government will feel that they have to make progress, but they cannot make progress for as long they adopt their present actions and words. The aftermath of the Tel Aviv bombing reminded us, if we needed reminding, of a ruthless streak in those political thoughts.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/7">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the leader of the Liberal Democrats in the European Union. We have made clear our policy on Hamas. I am sorry that the leader of the Liberal Democrats in the European Parliament chose to take the action that he did. I had hoped for a degree of solidarity, but individual Members of Parliament, including Members of the European Parliament, may view the situation differently. That is their prerogative. However, we have made our views clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/8">The hon. Gentleman also asked whether we would take steps to ensure that other British political parties and western allies abided by the same set of tests for the unreformed Hamas Government. There will be a Quartet meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">9 May</phrase> in New York to discuss the middle east peace process. We are working very closely with the Quartet and our EU partners along the lines that I have set out, so I hope that he can take some comfort from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/9">I have lost track of time, Mrs. Anderson; despite the fact that there are clocks all over the place, they tell different times. However, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that we remain committed to the principles of a negotiated two-state solution, and we continue to work towards a just, viable and lasting peace and the establishment of a viable and secure state of Palestine and a secure state of Israel consistent with the Security Council resolutions and the principle of land for peace. If Hamas can move towards the Quartet's three principles, then the peace process can advance. The only viable future for a Palestinian state lies in its having a peaceful relationship with its neighbour Israel.</p>
