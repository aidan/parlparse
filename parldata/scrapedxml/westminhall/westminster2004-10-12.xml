	<p pid=".1.3/1">I am very pleased to have the opportunity to bring the matter of public telephones to the Minister's attention and to give him the chance to reply to a number of points. It is also a pleasure to see so many hon. Members here today; they obviously have the interests of their constituents at heart.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/2">At the end of August, a constituent telephoned me&mdash;whether from a phone box I know not&mdash;to draw to my attention to the notice in a phone box in Ponfaen, a small village at the top of Honddu valley in the community of Merthyr Cynog in my constituency, indicating that British Telecom wished to close that facility unless objections were made. At the time, I thought it was an ad hoc proposal, but after further investigation it turns out that BT wishes substantially to restructure its payphones business. Indeed, BT proposes the closure of 33,000 of the 77,000 phone boxes throughout the country. By no means would it have been it a one-off closure.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/3">As a result of that telephone call, I wrote to all the community councils in my constituency, telling them that BT might propose closing the public telephones in their areas and that they should participate in the consultation. I indicated that if they wanted to keep their payphones, it was essential that they make representations.</p>

	<p pid=".1.4/1">It is important to make clear that community councils, parish councils and planning authorities have an absolute veto over such closures. The message has to be got across that it is not one of those consultations that just goes into the ether. If the councils have objections and make them, those objections stand.</p>

	<p pid=".1.7/1">Yes; I thank the hon. Gentleman for making that point. Ofcom is going to look once more at the universal service obligation. This question comes round once every three or four years. Previously, Oftel was responsible, but the report that resulted from that consultation showed that only 17 people replied to it. I urge Ofcom, as Oftel has become, to ensure that consultation on alterations to the universal service obligation is much wider and more proactive. It would be a sad state of affairs if town and community councils, and parish councils in England, lost the ability to object, even if there were substance to their objections.</p>

	<p pid=".2.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. As he rightly says, the review of the universal service obligation is critical. Does he not think it extraordinary that BT is pre-empting the review and pushing ahead with the decimation of the payphone network just as the review is taking place?</p>

	<p pid=".2.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that. It seems untimely that a major restructuring of the payphone business is being suggested at the same time as Ofcom is consulting on the future of the universal service obligation. If it is BT's intention to more than decimate its service, it might have been wise to wait until after the review. Some believe that people's ability to object may be limited.</p>

	<p pid=".2.2/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I think that Ofcom would find some of the things that have been said surprising. Although it is reviewing the public service obligation, it is not, as I understand it, considering removing the veto by local authorities.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.2.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1324" speakername="Roger Williams" colnum="2"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h01.htm#41012h01_spnew7">
	<p pid=".2.3/1">I am very pleased to be reassured by the Minister on that point. However, I presume that the fact that the universal service obligation is to be reviewed means that everything is open. Certainly, we will be making representations on the basis that our power of veto will not be removed. In my constituency, some 114 for the 272 payphones are proposed for closure. I am concerned about BT's decision to remove such a substantial number of payphones not only from my constituency in Wales but throughout the country. Those phones can be essential, even life-saving.</p>
	<p pid=".2.3/2">Let me give an example; the economy of the Llanwrtyd Wells area in my constituency&mdash;which has no mobile phone coverage at all&mdash;is dependent on forestry. When a life-threatening accident took place there, it was only because the local people knew the location of a payphone box and were able to get to it quickly that they were able to summon an air ambulance to take the victim to hospital. That saved his life.</p>

	<p pid=".2.4/1">I thank my hon. Friend for giving way, and congratulate him on securing this important debate. It seems that BT has failed to make a specific economic case against any individual kiosk, but it has blamed mobile phones for cutting the business from under its feet. Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the key issues is that mobile phone coverage in rural areas is extremely patchy and that emergency, life-saving phone calls must be allowed to continue? For that reason, the kiosks need to remain.</p>

	<p pid=".2.5/1">I thank my hon. Friend for making that point. I am sure that all of us who represent rural areas will vouch for that experience. I do not consider that payphone boxes are the only solution to the problem; I am taking part in a campaign in my constituency to improve the coverage of mobile phones. However, that does not do away with the need for payphone boxes. One could argue that we do not need payphone boxes in town where mobile phone coverage is perfect, but we certainly do. Getting a good communication system depends on bringing together all the available technology.</p>

	<p pid=".3.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. Is not the economic argument that is used against many of our rural phone boxes the same as that used for the lack of improvement to mobile phone coverage? Providers are saying that they cannot be bothered to go into rural areas because it does not make them enough money. They must accept that rural areas need to have a service delivered one way or another.</p>

	<p pid=".3.1/1">My hon. Friend shares a constituency boundary with me in the Teme valley, a very remote area. Sometimes, in winter, it is entirely cut off from vehicular traffic. A sound communication system, using all the technologies that are available, is essential for people living in such areas; that is one of the issues that I shall come on to. Everybody expects a good communication system, and without one we will not be able to encourage young people to make their homes in such areas and to work there.</p>

	<p pid=".3.4/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend, and I am sure that we will allow him to make progress. It is not simply a question of offering a choice of a variety of services. In Cornwall, we are about to lose up to 200 of 1,000 payphone boxes. That will have a significant impact. In the remote rural areas in my constituency, including the Isles of Scilly, a lot of those boxes are used by people who have no choice. They do not have mobile phones and they do not have phones at home. Social policy should be the justification for keeping them.</p>

	<p pid=".3.5/1">My hon. Friend is right. He brings his great experience of island dwellers&mdash;something that I do not have&mdash;to the debate. As he says, public telephone boxes were put under a universal service obligation at the time of privatisation because it was anticipated that not everybody would have a land-line, but thought that everybody should have access to communications. A number of people either do not have land-lines or have land-lines on systems that are not sound, which often break down. Our experience is that it now takes longer than ever to get BT to undertake those repairs.</p>
	<p pid=".3.5/2">I want to bring to the Minister's attention the fact that payboxes are used by up to 8,000 children a year to call abuse lines. Those children do not want to use the telephones in their homes because they are concerned that they will be overheard or that their parents, or whoever may be abusing them, could trace those calls. That is another reason why there should be access to public call boxes.</p>
	<p pid=".3.5/3">People who live in rural areas believe that they are losing services. It is an incremental process, but the quality of their lives is getting lower. There is no incentive to encourage people to stay in rural areas and find work or create jobs and employment if they do not have a good communications system. Often, people who have made money in other areas come to rural areas and, with the wealth that they have generated elsewhere, access services that are outside the means of local people. To take away payphone boxes would be another example of that problem. As a responsible company that is bound by the universal service imperative, BT has every obligation to ensure that that does not happen when it considers removing its payphones.</p>
	<p pid=".3.5/4">I have met and talked extensively with BT and have brought representatives of community councils from my constituency to talk to BT, and representatives of other local authorities. So far, I have no reason to doubt BT's intention to make the consultation exercise a genuine one. BT has made it clear to me that if objections are received through the local planning authority, it will have no alternative but to keep the relevant payphones open. That point has been raised by other Members, but has not been made clear.</p>

	<p pid=".4.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way.</p>
	<p pid=".4.0/2">I was fortunate enough to be able to advise local parishes and planning authorities in my part of Somerset of their right of veto, which we heard about earlier, and thereby save 21 boxes. Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the Exmoor national park authority was not notified of that process by British Telecom because BT did not recognise it as a local planning authority? That is quite amazing. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it would have been better if BT had been aware of how its own consultation process works?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.4.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1324" speakername="Roger Williams" colnum="4"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h01.htm#41012h01_spnew17">
	<p pid=".4.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising that point, which he raised with me before the debate. I did not check the situation with my national park authority, although I understand that all objections should go through the planning department of Powys county council. I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman has secured the retention of 21 payphones in his constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".4.1/2">I have information that although Members of Parliament were all consulted on this matter, Assembly Members were not individually consulted. Perhaps BT does not recognise the existence of national parks or the Welsh Assembly. I have raised this matter with BT and it has now had meetings with representatives of the National Assembly for Wales; it has rectified the problem, albeit at a late stage in the consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".4.1/3">The universal service obligation was imposed on BT in 1984 as a means of ensuring that the monopoly that the company enjoyed at the time of privatisation and the imminent commercial benefits of privatisation were balanced with a number of the responsibilities that BT had held as a state-owned company. One of those responsibilities was to provide a certain amount of payphone coverage throughout the country as an alternative to land-lines.</p>
	<p pid=".4.1/4">BT is still by far the largest provider of land-lines in the UK, and it is only right that that monopoly should be accompanied by a certain degree of corporate responsibility. However, the changing nature of the telecoms industry since privatisation and the huge surge in mobile phone usage over the past five years have affected the profitability of payphones and rendered certain aspects of BT's obligation unsustainable.</p>
	<p pid=".4.1/5">BT Payphones is a wholly independent subsidiary of the BT group, responsible for its own budgets and revenue flows and, we are told, unable to seek subsidies from other more successful subsidiaries of the business. I am not sure whether that is the case; perhaps the Minister can help us by explaining that in relation to competition policy. BT Payphones are already cross-subsiding some of the loss-making payphones with the more profitable ones. However, the losses are such that BT predicts that if nothing is done to restructure the business, the whole BT payphone network could be at risk. BT has made that claim, and I take it in good faith, but perhaps the Minister could address the issue. Such a situation would not be in anyone's interests, and it is imperative that something be done to redress the balance of responsibilities, should BT's dire warnings prove substantial.</p>
	<p pid=".4.1/6">The universal service obligation is reviewed every three to five years, to take account of the changing nature of the market. Within the next month or so, Ofcom will launch its first review. The last was carried out by Oftel, and few people responded to the consultation. Ofcom is likely to take into consideration the distortion to the payphone market created by mobile phone technology. Although it is impossible to pre-empt the outcome of the consultation, it is not unreasonable to expect the rules and regulations to be somewhat relaxed to save the company and its finances.</p>
	<p pid=".4.1/7">As the regulations now stand, BT is entitled to remove any payphone where there is another within 100 m. If, as is often the case in rural communities, there is no other payphone within 10 miles, let alone 100 m, BT has to alert the local authorities and consult the public by placing a notice in the payphone. As we know, people have a period of time in which to object, and any objections that go through the local planning authority are a veto on the closure.</p>
	<p pid=".4.1/8">In our case, consultation was taken through August. I made representations to BT and the period was extended into September, because even the most active local authorities are sometimes not in a position to carry out the consultation and make representations. The veto achieved by residents and local authorities may be good news in the short term, but it is not a sustainable result in the long term. The local communities in most need of the services, such as those in the very rural areas, stand at the most risk of losing their public call box in the long run.</p>
	<p pid=".4.1/9">Objections lodged to local authorities because the payphone provides good shelter during a thunderstorm or lights up the centre of the village are not reasonable grounds for keeping payphones open. They do nothing to substantiate the sound objections of those communities that depend on the facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".4.1/10">I am concerned that the massive closures are being considered just before the Ofcom consultation has been covered. If, as a result of this or future consultations, rules and regulations surrounding the universal service obligations are relaxed&mdash;that is likely to be the case&mdash;local communities could stand to lose the payphones that they so badly need.</p>
	<p pid=".4.1/11">BT can do more to have dialogues with local authorities, not only at the time of proposed closures, but in the interregnum periods, to find out ways in which such services can be maintained. Local authorities are already looking for ways in which they can keep post offices open, but payphone facilities should also be included. Many local residents groups and community councils in Wales already take it upon themselves to clean and maintain local payphones and it is likely that many local authorities would welcome the opportunity of added responsibilities if they valued the presence of payphones themselves. That would obviously be something that local authorities would have to take into consideration and they would also have to understand the costs involved. It is not for us to indicate what responsibilities local authorities might wish to take on, but this is an opportunity for us to ensure that local authorities have the necessary powers.</p>

	<p pid=".6.0/1">What my hon. Friend has not explained so far is that local authorities cannot, at this stage, argue with BT with regard to its policy and the reason why that policy undermines the viability of the boxes themselves. The minimum charge is 30p and often people without any change have a lot of coinage swallowed up. It is an expensive option and a lot of people lose a lot of money trying to use phone boxes, as I discovered recently on St. Agnes on the Isles of Scilly. Local authorities cannot properly engage with BT's policy and the expensive nature of the service.</p>

	<p pid=".6.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for raising that point. It reinforces the point that I am making to the Minister, which is that BT should be in consultation with local authorities and the Local Government Association on these matters. My information is that BT has not consulted as fully as it could with local authorities or local authority associations. The process would be of benefit to BT and would indicate how local authorities see the opportunities for making the service more substantial and more sustainable.</p>
	<p pid=".6.1/2">As I understand it, the working partnerships or subsidies by local authorities are currently illegal under privatisation legislation. It is essential that the Government look again at legislation surrounding competition law to allow those sustainable partnerships to take place. A partnership could take many forms and it is not up to me today to indicate what form it would take. That is best determined at local level. For instance, local authorities could explore the option of paying BT a fixed rental to cover the cost of the network. BT could enter into any number of arrangements with local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".6.1/3">My reservation, as far as BT Payphones is concerned, is not that BT is being unreasonable in wanting to restructure its business, run a successful company and be responsible to its shareholders in a loss-making market. My grievances are that, as a business that prides itself on innovation, BT has been particularly lacking in innovation when it comes to finding solutions to this problem. It embarked on a programme of draconian action, decreeing that it was going to cut the payphone network by almost half in terms of the existing coverage, without exploring any options on a more local level to show its willingness to sustain this vital service and honour its duty under the universal service obligation.</p>
	<p pid=".6.1/4">BT has made little or no attempt to contact local government associations, which are ideally placed to identify which options would be most keenly supported by certain authorities. Nor did it make any effort, for the purpose of finding a workable solution, to contact district and borough councils, which dispose of the kind of funding that would realistically be needed to undertake such partnerships. Such a partnership would tie in particularly well with the functions of local authorities in promoting tourism in their area. In future, BT should therefore be urged to explore such options with local authorities and appropriate bodies before it makes planned closures.</p>
	<p pid=".6.1/5">My purpose today is to ensure that rural areas have viable communication systems. As in towns, some of that system will be provided by public call boxes, some by mobile phones and some by land-lines. The elimination of public call boxes will lead to social exclusion, danger to residents and visitors alike, and to large swathes of the countryside becoming less attractive places for young people to work and set up home. Certainty about the continuation of land-line provision would be beneficial, because if payphones are being undermined by changes in the universal service obligation, a number of us are concerned about the long-term effect of that on the provision of land-lines to very remote rural areas. Being certain about land-line provision, and an improvement in mobile phone coverage, would contribute to the provision of a satisfactory communication system.</p>
	<p pid=".6.1/6">I hope that the Government will use their influence to encourage mobile phone operators to extend their coverage and work with local authorities&mdash;especially in national parks&mdash;to identify safe and satisfactory sites for relay masts. Even with all the profitable avenues explored, the market will eventually fail to maintain phone boxes that are vital to vulnerable communities.</p>
	<p pid=".6.1/7">The universal service obligation is currently being carried by BT Payphones cross-subsidising their socially important boxes from those situated in more densely populated areas. At the moment it is illegal for local authorities to support that infrastructure because at the time of privatisation it was seen as unfair to any competition. That point no longer stands; no new public call boxes are springing up in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid=".6.1/8">The problem is to maintain the really important phone boxes as part of an overall system that includes land-lines and mobiles. The way forward is to encourage private and public partnerships, in which the private sector provides technology and the public sector integrates services such as cash collection by means of existing employees. In order to allow this vital public service to continue to serve the community, I call on the Government to use their powers to allow such partnerships to flourish.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.8.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1248" speakername="John Stanley" colnum="8"  time="09:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h01.htm#41012h01_spnew21">
	<p pid=".8.1/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1324" name="Roger Williams">the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> for initiating this important debate. I was first alerted to the fact that BT was engaged in a major national cull of public payphone boxes by the good people of Edenbridge in my constituency, where the town positively erupted on BT's disclosure that it was going to try to remove approximately one third&mdash;four out of 13&mdash;of the payphones from that town. I took up the issue with the chief executive of BT and he gave me an extremely interesting&mdash;and what I found to be an extraordinary&mdash;reply:</p>
	<p pid=".8.1/2" class="indent">&quot;If the local community and council still feel that the retention of the payphones is an issue, we could offer to keep them where they are, however we would need some contribution from a third party.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".8.1/3">Mr. Ben Verwaayan, in this letter to me of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-12">12 July</phrase>, made no reference whatever to the supposed veto in the consultation. He was advancing a policy on behalf of BT that amounted to &quot;Pay up or lose it&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".8.1/4">Mr. Verwaayan went on to quote BT's prices, call box by call box, for allowing us to keep our payphones in Edenbridge. The cheapest was &pound;311 a year and the most expensive was &pound;1,284 a year. Quite how Mr. Verwaayan made his calculations was never revealed, but I have to say that I found that an extraordinary policy from a company that is supposedly under a public service obligation.</p>
	<p pid=".8.1/5">The pay-up-or-lose-it policy did not appear to endure long within BT because a matter of hours before I was due to appear on national television to discuss the issue, the director of BT Payphones, Mr. Paul Hendron, came pounding round to see me in the House of Commons and offered me a completely different proposition. As the two local authorities concerned&mdash;Sevenoaks district council and Edenbridge town council&mdash;had objected, he proposed that he would not override their objections and said that the payphones could remain. I asked him to repeat that assurance. He did. I asked him to repeat it again. He did, and I hold BT to the triple assurance that I have been given.</p>
	<p pid=".8.1/6">It may interest hon. Members to learn that Mr. Hendron proved to be very informative about the situation in my constituency. I did not know how many payphones BT had. He told me that there were 120 in my constituency. I certainly did not know how many, in BT's view, were making losses. He told me that 44 payphones&mdash;about one third&mdash;were. He then gave me an interesting computer-printed, payphone-by-payphone schedule of those 44, which BT had divided into two categories. One category was headed &quot;Social&quot; and included 29 payphones, all of which were making losses. BT said that it would keep them for the time being. The other category was headed &quot;Removals&quot; and listed the other 15 of the 44 loss-making payphones, all of which BT was trying to remove. It was illuminating information, and I have sent it to all the local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".8.1/7">The problem that I, the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire and other hon. Members face in our constituencies reflects the national policy issue, which is whether there should continue to be a national system of public payphones. Ultimately, it is a matter not for Ofcom but for the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. I put this central issue to the Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-12">12 August</phrase>, when I asked:</p>
	<p pid=".8.1/8" class="indent">&quot;please could you tell me whether or not it is the Government's policy that there should continue to be a comprehensive network of public payphones available in Britain. If so, please tell me what action the Government will take to ensure this.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".8.1/9">The response I received from the Secretary of State was totally inadequate. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-27">27 August</phrase>, she replied that she was sorry to hear of my concerns and that the matters raised were the responsibility of the Office of Communications, Ofcom, as the independent regulator acting under the terms of the Office of Communications Act 2002 and the Communications Act 2003. That was a total abdication of responsibility. It is time that the Government came clean about whether their policy is that there should continue to be a national system of public payphones. I expect the Minister in response to this debate to come clean on that fundamental point of Government policy.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.9.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1185" speakername="Alan Reid" colnum="9"  time="10:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h01.htm#41012h01_spnew22">
	<p pid=".9.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1324" name="Roger Williams">my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> on securing this important debate.</p>
	<p pid=".9.0/2">Despite the fall in usage, largely due to mobile phones, payphones are still widely used. In many rural areas such as my constituency, mobile phone reception is patchy and access to a payphone in an emergency is still important. I emphasise the point made by my hon. Friend that children who need to make a call without their parents knowing often use a payphone. ChildLine notes that many of the calls that it receives from the victims of child abuse are made from payphones. Payphones are still important, and as with many emergency services, we appreciate payphones only when we need them.</p>
	<p pid=".9.0/3">BT wants to remove 52 payphones from my constituency, and the Kintyre peninsula seems to have been singled out for particular attention. If BT gets its way, there will be no payphone on the A83 down the west side of the peninsula between the village of Muasdale and the town of Campbeltown, a distance of 15 miles. Glenbarr, Bellochantuy, Tangy and Kilkenzie will all be left without a payphone. On the east side of the peninsula, if BT gets its way, there will be no payphone on the 11-mile stretch of road between Peninver and Carradale. The villages of Saddell and Torrisdale are to lose their payphones, and that will leave drivers who break down with a long walk, as mobile phone reception in that area is poor.</p>
	<p pid=".9.0/4">BT makes the points that payphone usage has declined and that the payphones on its hitlist are making losses. It is important to note, however, that BT has a universal service obligation and that its shareholders knew this when they bought shares in the company. They went into it with their eyes open.</p>
	<p pid=".9.0/5">The veto held by local planning authorities and community and parish councils is important. I was pleased to hear the Minister's intervention, and I hope that in his winding-up speech he will provide an absolute assurance that the veto will remain when Ofcom reviews the communications industry later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".9.0/6">I note from BT's correspondence that it claims that the Competition Act 1998 means that its payphone business as a whole must break even so that users of busy payphones subsidise users of little-used ones. However, Ofcom's direction designates BT as the universal service provider, not BT Payphones, which makes BT's insistence that BT Payphones cannot be subsidised from the rest of the BT business a little dubious. Ofcom should investigate BT's claim during the review, and I hope that the outcome will be that BT can subsidise its payphone business from the rest of its business.</p>
	<p pid=".9.0/7">It is vital that a council's right of veto remains. By the process that Ofcom has put in place for objections to the removal of payphones, notices are posted on payphones giving a 42-day notice period for users to send an objection to the local council. However, the same 42-day notice period also applies for the council to submit an objection to BT. That clearly gives the council no time to consider objections that the public make. We need two notice periods; the first in which users can object to the council, followed by a further period in which the council can consider those objections and put in a submission to BT.</p>
	<p pid=".9.0/8">In my area, BT seems to have found difficulties identifying which community councils have been affected. Ofcom's order allows BT to ask the local planning authority to forward the notice to the community council, but there is an important question; when does the 42-day period start? In my area, BT voluntarily extended the consultation period, but it should be made clear in the rules that the period should start when the community council actually receives the notice from BT.</p>
	<p pid=".9.0/9">The right of community and parish councils to veto the removal of the last payphone is a vital safeguard, otherwise large swathes of rural Britain will be left without a payphone, with dire consequences in an emergency.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.10.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1018" speakername="Robert Key" colnum="10"  time="10:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h01.htm#41012h01_spnew23">
	<p pid=".10.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1324" name="Roger Williams">the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> on his good fortune in the ballot, which secured this debate. In my constituency, there are more than 100 villages outside Salisbury, and 181 payphones. I was notified by British Telecom on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-21">21 June</phrase> that it planned to remove 23 telephones, that it would maintain 124 profitable ones and that it was prepared to keep 34 loss-making ones.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/2">So far, the debate has been rather unfair to BT, and I shall say why I think that that is the case before suggesting what the challenge really is. The consultation undertaken by BT as a universal service provider was exemplary, and there is no question but that it fulfilled its obligation to ensure that all the local planning authorities and parish councils were aware of what was proposed. However, the statistics are revealing, and when I went through the figures with which BT provided me, I realised that there was a problem. Among the telephones that BT proposed to remove, several were in areas where one could not get the alternative mobile service. That is the real problem. I wrote to the head of public and parliamentary affairs on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-01">1 July</phrase>, but when I received a response 11 weeks later my question on that particular conundrum was not answered.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/3">It is fair enough to point out that the public service obligation should be met more widely than by BT alone. Of course it is true that when it took up the challenge and was privatised, BT was all that there was. Now there is a complete change in communications, and the mobile industry is coming forward. For obvious commercial reasons, the mobile industry does not want to have a public service obligation, and who can blame it? But that means that someone must decide whether we really want to have available a universal service of some sort. That all comes down to who will pay the subsidy; that is the bottom line. It is not entirely fair to blame BT for that.</p>

	<p pid=".11.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is making an important point, but does there have to be a subsidy? Someone travelling outside the UK can access any service provider on their roaming service, but in the UK we have the frustration of being told that there is a signal but we are not allowed to access it because of an exclusive contract. Should not Ofcom review that?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.11.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1018" speakername="Robert Key" colnum="11"  time="10:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h01.htm#41012h01_spnew25">
	<p pid=".11.1/1">Of course it should. It is important that it does. That is an option, but who should actually pay? It is all very well saying, as BT does, that there are all sorts of other things, such as advertising. Frankly, that is not a realistic proposition. On any day, only three people and 65 cows will walk past an advertisement on a phone box in Alvediston.</p>
	<p pid=".11.1/2">Local people might subsidise the service through the council tax, but the maintenance costs are substantial. BT gave me the service costs of the boxes, and I was surprised at the expense involved. The average cost of maintaining a payphone is &pound;1,650 a year. That is a substantial sum if one has only a few pence a day. I am sure that the situation is not quite as bad as in the old days of pressing buttons A and B and a large copper penny going in&mdash;clunk&mdash;but it is an expensive proposition.</p>
	<p pid=".11.1/3">Perhaps the Government should subsidise payphones as a public service. They will ask why they should. Perhaps there should be premium rates, but why should people in rural areas have to pay two or three times as much per call, particularly at a time when BT has been reducing the actual call cost, extending the time available&mdash;its preferred policy&mdash;or advertising? This is a real problem, and the Government have an opportunity to encourage Ofcom to think more radically than it has.</p>
	<p pid=".11.1/4">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate. I do not want to hog the floor, as many other people wish to speak. My main point is that we should not just blame BT. The problem exists because of technological change, and Ofcom must come up with some imaginative proposals for the Government to review and come to a conclusion on. That is the right way forward if we are to ensure that there is universal provision. It is a great irony, at a time when international as well as national communications have never been more available to people, that there is a real problem of who will pay for the parts of the United Kingdom that have a sparse population and are, therefore, an unattractive commercial proposition.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.12.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1237" speakername="Robert Smith" colnum="12"  time="10:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h01.htm#41012h01_spnew26">
	<p pid=".12.0/1">I very much welcome this debate and congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1324" name="Roger Williams">my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> on securing it. It has highlighted an important issue. Like him, I expect many phone box closures in my constituency. BT has proposed closing more than one third of them&mdash;39 phone boxes. On one 25-mile stretch of road from Alford to the Lecht, it wants to reduce the number of phone boxes from eight to one. I wonder whether it has taken into account in its modelling the knock-on effect of closing the one next door, or does it look at each one in isolation in the current network? That is an important aspect that it needs carefully to consider.</p>
	<p pid=".12.0/2">As I said in an intervention, it is important to get across the message in respect of the veto that community councils and planning authorities have. Many constituents meet me in the street and tell me that they object to a phone box going, or to BT reneging on and changing its mind about what they thought was an implicit promise at privatisation that the network would be maintained, but they ask, &quot;What is the point of writing?&quot; The point is that if they write to their community council and if the community council represents their views, the phone box will not close. As it is a rare consultation in which it is still the case that objections are absolute if they come through the right means, this debate is very important in highlighting to people that that veto exists. In Scotland, particularly, the fact that the deadline has been extended to <phrase class="date" code="">22 October</phrase> gives people the chance to get their objections in now that the cycle of meetings is back on.</p>
	<p pid=".12.0/3">The fundamental part of this debate is the conundrum that although in a sparsely populated area a phone box will be more difficult to maintain and there will be fewer users, it is in the sparsely populated area that a phone box is more of a lifeline. The fact that it is not economic does not reduce its lifeline potential. As has been said, it is important to take into account the lack of mobile phone coverage and the fact that many people use pay-as-you-go mobile phones. In an emergency, if they have run out of pay-as-you-go, there is the phone box.</p>
	<p pid=".12.0/4">The stretch of road that I mentioned leads to a ski resort. In bad weather in the winter, it is important to have a safety net.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.12.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/922" speakername="Matthew Green" colnum="12"  time="10:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h01.htm#41012h01_spnew27">
	<p pid=".12.1/1">An important point about safety is that the Ordnance Survey maps used by hill walkers show where payphones are. Most people will use the same maps over the next five to 10 years&mdash;they do not buy maps that frequently&mdash;and if a lot of phone boxes are removed, they may well go down a hillside to what they believe is the nearest box and discover that there are none there. That could lead to people losing their lives.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.13.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1237" speakername="Robert Smith" colnum="13"  time="10:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h01.htm#41012h01_spnew28">
	<p pid=".13.0/1">That is an extremely important point. To be fair, I think that BT contacted Members in Scotland during the consultation to let us know, but the local authorities feel aggrieved at how they were approached. They were not approached formally, through the chief executive, and had to spend ages trying to decipher and make usable the maps with which they were provided. Although Ordnance Survey maps might have payphones marked on them, my local authority felt that the BT maps were not up to scratch.</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/2">One of the questions addressed in the question and answer sheet that was provided to community councils was:</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Will you be maintaining payphones where there is poor mobile coverage?&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/4">BT's response was:</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Whilst we are currently working with mobile operators to improve their coverage, we cannot be held responsible for their blackspot areas.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/6">However, BT can be held responsible for finding out where those areas are and, from that, identifying which phone boxes provide a vital function in filling that blackspot. That is an important part of the feedback loop.</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/7">I finish by reinforcing <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1018" name="Robert Key">the point that the hon. Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key)</phrase> made about going forward with the USO and hearing the Government's plan to protect such a vital network. In the case of post offices, the Government have had to intervene to protect rural areas. There is a concern that rural areas are being neglected. Almost by definition, the USO exists because people are not confident that the market will provide the service. On the whole the USO will have to be paid for and it is important that we should pin that down. I am slightly concerned that we are using the average cost of a phone box. Presumably the marginal cost is crucial, because there will be overheads whether or not there are a lot of phone boxes in urban areas. In the consultation by Ofcom, it is important that we remember the implicit promise both that universal services would still be protected when markets were brought to bear and that rural areas in particular would be protected from the damage of competition.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.13.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1345" speakername="Richard Younger-Ross" colnum="13"  time="10:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h01.htm#41012h01_spnew29">
	<p pid=".13.1/1">Briefly, does my hon. Friend agree that the industry, rather than the taxpayer, should bear the costs?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.13.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1237" speakername="Robert Smith" colnum="13"  time="10:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h01.htm#41012h01_spnew30">
	<p pid=".13.2/1">That is a question that is still to be considered. In the end, the costs have to be paid. In some universal services the taxpayer picks up the cost, but in other cases, such as energy, the user gets the universal service through cross-subsidy. There is probably a serious debate to be had on whether the cross-subsidising unit is too small. Is it wrong that the phone boxes are cross-subsidising? Since the industry was privatised and there was meant to be a burden on one player, perhaps all the players operating in the market could be levied to ensure that the universal service is maintained, as in the potential legislation on the postal service. However, it is extremely important to establish in the consultation that rural areas deserve to be connected to the rest of the United Kingdom and that the universal service must be protected.</p>

	<p pid=".14.0/1">I add <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1324" name="Roger Williams">my congratulations to the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> on bringing forward this important debate. It is particularly relevant to my constituency, which is one of the most sparsely populated in England, and to the north-east of England as a whole, where some 700 phone boxes are threatened by BT. However, I support what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1018" name="Robert Key">my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key)</phrase> said: we are not here to attack BT all the time. BT inherited a legacy, but technological change has made that legacy hard to maintain. It is right that we should address our comments not only to the Minister&mdash;there has to be Government direction&mdash;but to Ofcom, because it is up to Ofcom to come up with a proper solution.</p>
	<p pid=".14.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1237" name="Robert Smith">The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith)</phrase> talked about the significance of public call boxes in rural areas. Like him, I am concerned that the boxes that are being targeted in my constituency are situated where there is no mobile phone coverage at all. It is utterly wrong that all forms of telecommunication should be removed from those areas.</p>
	<p pid=".14.0/3">Part of the solution lies with mobile phone coverage. Parts of some substantial communities in my constituency still have no mobile phone coverage because the mobile phone companies argue that there is not enough revenue from them. The companies generally do not want the expense of putting up masts, although some do, and that is the irritating thing. For instance, when the disastrous foot and mouth epidemic hit my constituency&mdash;particularly in the part of it in which mobile phone and, indeed, television coverage is very poor&mdash;I noticed that some vets and Ministry officials had three mobile phones, because if they could not get reception on O2, they might get it on Orange and if they could not get it on Orange, they might get it on Vodafone. It seems to me that one of the keys to solving that problem is giving our mobile phones the ability to roam as they do abroad. That would extend the coverage of mobile phones hugely.</p>
	<p pid=".14.0/4">The Minister has a responsibility to crack the problem. The veto that community councils have about the removal of phone boxes, while existing, will in reality become complete nonsense. It will not be possible for a community council to say no to the removal of a hugely loss-making service. It defies belief that a community council will be able to maintain that power. So we need new solutions and the matter requires the intervention of the Minister. It requires Ofcom to come up with some imaginative solutions about the future.</p>

	<p pid=".14.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1324" name="Roger Williams">my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> on making what was undoubtedly the best speech about public telephones that I have ever heard in this Chamber.</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/2">I will talk specifically about my constituency, because my hon. Friend made the points about Wales as a whole. Montgomeryshire stands to lose 91 of its 210 payphones&mdash;more than one third of the network. I acknowledge that BT faces great financial pressures with regard to those payphones and that the advance of mobile phone technology has had a negative impact on public payphone usage. However, to use that as a justification for eliminating public payphone provision in parts of Montgomeryshire would be like the Royal Mail cutting some of its rural postal deliveries on the basis that many people use e-mail and so do not need a postal service anymore.</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/3">Therefore, I ask that BT be sensitive to the peculiarities of our, and other, rural regions. Under current plans, Powys and Montgomeryshire will lose more phone boxes than any other region in Wales. As much of Montgomeryshire is not covered by mobile phone networks, it seems clear that those regions have a particular need to maintain phone boxes.</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/4">As we heard, public payphones are a vital means of contact in cases of emergency. In fact, when I had what nearly amounted to a fatal accident in 1998, it was in an area with no mobile phone reception, so it was a close call. Had the accident been any worse, my chances of survival would have been so marginal that a payphone could have made the difference between life and death. Therefore, I speak from experience.</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/5">On some routes in Powys, it is possible to travel for 20 miles without a usable phone signal. The removal of public payphones will create communication black holes in Montgomeryshire that are beyond the range of mobile phones. In my judgment, and from my experience, that will inevitably lead to some loss of life&mdash;though not in large numbers&mdash;and definite suffering in emergency situations. I do not think that those blind spots are acceptable.</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/6">The good news is that British Telecom does not find those blind spots acceptable either. It commented recently that:</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/7" class="indent">&quot;the Provision of Service guidelines indicate that we provide public telephone service to any member of a community who does not have access to a landline or mobile telephone&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/8">In that respect, much of Montgomeryshire&mdash;indeed, much of mid-Wales&mdash;must qualify. I hope that BT will take that into consideration.</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/9">In fact, there is a case for increasing the number of phone boxes, not reducing it. I will be satisfied if BT maintains the number of call boxes in areas where mobile phone coverage is poor or non-existent. Naturally, BT will cite economic reasons for the reduction. I was interested in what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1185" name="Alan Reid">my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid)</phrase> said about whether it is the payphone part of the company, or BT as a whole, that needs to break even. We have been told that it is the payphone side. Will the Minister clarify which is the case?</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/10">I have received many letters of protest about BT's plans from councils such as Penybontfawr community council, Machynlleth town council and Cadfarch community council. Particular representations have been made about the removal of the phone kiosk facility in Hirnant. It is a small community set in a deep narrow valley and there is no hope of getting mobile phone coverage in that area. If the BT payphone is removed, there will be no access to a payphone for a minimum of two and a half miles in any direction. Llanfihangel residents consider their phone box a lifeline, again because there is no mobile phone coverage. Those examples are typical throughout my constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/11">My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire highlighted the importance of payphones for child protection. Even when there are mobile phone signals, one must accept that the payphone is sometimes a lifeline between children in need and those who can help them.</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/12">Ultimately, the problem is that a private company is charged with providing what is, in essence, a public service. Our task is to reconcile BT's financial needs with the provision of adequate communications coverage for the people of Montgomeryshire. However, I thank BT for attending a useful meeting with my hon. Friend and me on <phrase class="date" code="">15 October</phrase>, in which we were reassured that reasonable objections to payphone closures will be taken seriously and will trigger reconsideration. We were also told that BT will not remove any payphone without the agreement of the local council. We hope that BT will stick to its word.</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/13">I seek from the Government progressive debate with all the stakeholders. BT has a long-established reputation in Montgomeryshire, and the local community is generally supportive of the firm's activities in mid-Wales. So far, BT has been responsive to our questions and points, for which I thank it again. If it interacts closely with local communities in my constituency, as it has said it would, I am sure that the issue can be resolved happily. All I ask is that the Minister assures us that, if there is an impasse, or if I and other right hon. and hon. Members have serious concerns, he will be willing to hold discussions that seek to resolve those issues in the interests of the local community.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.16.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/760" speakername="Malcolm Bruce" colnum="16"  time="10:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h01.htm#41012h01_spnew33">
	<p pid=".16.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1324" name="Roger Williams">my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams.)</phrase> The number and range of speeches have shown that this is a very live issue that is causing much concern, although, to be honest, I am somewhat surprised by the lack of participation of Labour Members, apart from the Minister. I cannot believe that not one of the 400-odd Labour Members is concerned about their phone box closures. For those who have expressed concern, there are several key issues.</p>
	<p pid=".16.0/2">In my case, BT and the local manager informed me before the notices went out that the consultation was about to begin. To be fair, whatever the criticisms about what is proposed, BT has gone through the process fairly well, although I do not believe that it widely advertised the right of veto, which would have seriously undermined its objectives and is a right that people should be aware of. In some cases, there probably will be no objection. One constituent phoned me to say, &quot;Thank God they are finally closing that phone box. It is continually being vandalised and is a target for all sorts of other problems.&quot; Some closures will therefore be acceptable, but others will cause considerable concern.</p>
	<p pid=".16.0/3">Some of BT's arguments are a little disturbing. The first and most obvious argument relates to the development of mobile phones and the implication that, as most people have a mobile phone, it is reasonable to review the provision of public phone boxes. As has been said, the irony is that BT is removing most of the boxes from rural areas where mobile phone coverage is weakest, which destroys the validity of that argument.</p>
	<p pid=".16.0/4">I do not believe that roaming resolves the issue, but it is a central point in any case. The protection of the exclusive contract has run its course, whatever the original justification for it. I understand that Ofcom is reviewing it. Given that most people have used roaming outside the United Kingdom, they will become more and more irritated by their inability to access roaming in the UK. Ofcom should address that issue. I would be interested to know if the Government have a particular view on the issue, which is important.</p>
	<p pid=".16.0/5">Another issue is that of emergency calls. BT says that only 7 per cent. of 999 calls come from phone boxes. I do not know how many 999 calls there are, but I suspect that 7 per cent. of a large number is still a large number. It could also be a matter of life and death. Are we saying that, for commercial reasons, 7 per cent. of the population can die in an emergency? That cannot be acceptable.</p>
	<p pid=".16.0/6">Something that falls short of a 999 emergency, such as a car breakdown or a missed rendezvous, is a personal emergency. It is an embarrassment, or a cause of confusion. People will worry and the person concerned will want to make contact. One would not dial 999 to say, &quot;Can you tell my mother I've missed the bus?&quot; It is not a 999 issue, but it is important for a mother waiting for a 14-year-old girl. That is when call boxes are really useful.</p>
	<p pid=".16.0/7">British Telecom acknowledges that the biggest users of public payphones are in the 14 to 24 age group&mdash;the most vulnerable people. Those telephones are also used by callers to ChildLine, for all kinds of reasons, in urban as well as in rural areas. Of course, it cannot be argued that every phone box must be protected just in case a child is about to be abused in the neighbourhood. However, removal seems a matter of real concern.</p>
	<p pid=".16.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/922" name="Matthew Green">My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green)</phrase> made an important point about Ordnance Survey maps. The marking of important services on those maps is part of a long and hallowed tradition. That is not to argue that, because something is on an Ordnance Survey map, it must never be removed, but, particularly in rural areas where people are walking, hiking or travelling in other ways, the comprehensive withdrawal of the services in question, as opposed to the occasional withdrawal and the warning that goes with it, destroys the value of such maps.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.17.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" speakername="David Heath" colnum="17"  time="10:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h01.htm#41012h01_spnew34">
	<p pid=".17.0/1">If one starts from the premise that what is needed is a publicly accessible emergency communication system across rural areas&mdash;setting aside the commercial considerations&mdash;one will start with a map not entirely dissimilar from the present one. If we take a social view of the importance of local phone boxes, we start from the right premise. If we take a commercial view, we start from the wrong premise.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.17.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/760" speakername="Malcolm Bruce" colnum="17"  time="10:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h01.htm#41012h01_spnew35">
	<p pid=".17.1/1">That is a fair intervention, provided that we add the rider that we mean not only 999 emergencies, but the others that I have identified. My understanding is that BT has said that it could replace call boxes with emergency telephone provision for 999 services. That would be preferable to nothing at all, and would meet the needs of walkers in emergencies, but would not meet the less-than-emergency but still urgent need for call boxes.</p>
	<p pid=".17.1/2">The question is: who pays? BT has said that provision should be contained within its call box structure. I understand that there is no legal requirement for that. If the Minister has a view, it will be helpful to know. There is an argument that the industry, including providers besides BT, should be involved, not least because companies whose ambitious, grandiose plans for providing public call boxes all over the country were never fulfilled have left BT as the overwhelmingly major provider. Outside Hull, 1,400 boxes out of 140,000 are provided by someone other than BT.</p>
	<p pid=".17.1/3">BT is at present thinking about removing 10,000 of its 138,000 call boxes. As far as I can see, the cuts are pretty evenly distributed. I was interested that every constituency example was remarkably similar. From a Scottish Parliament briefing that I received, I find that, if BT has its way, 10,000 will be removed across Britain. Funnily enough, 1,000 will be removed from Scotland. It so happens that we have 10 per cent. of the population. However, we have 40 per cent. of the land area. The question arises whether the criterion should be where the phone boxes are or where the people are.</p>
	<p pid=".17.1/4">There is something not quite right about the approach that is being used. It does not ring true as a genuine call box by call box review. It looks more like an approach based on the need to get rid of 10 per cent. and on finding out where the loss-makers are. The approach to the issue cannot be about profitability. BT has acknowledged that by announcing how many unprofitable boxes it proposes to keep. This is a matter of accessibility.</p>
	<p pid=".17.1/5">It may be that some remote call boxes are used only rarely, but that the circumstances of their use make them a vital lifeline. I know of many instances, although this is no comfort to BT, of people using phone boxes in a way that does not generate revenue. It is standard practice in rural parts of my constituency for a child who gets off a bus at the end of the road a mile or two from the farm to phone, let the phone ring three times and hang up. That means, &quot;Mum, I'm waiting for you to pick me up at the phone box.&quot; That is an important service. It is not profitable to BT but its withdrawal would cause problems.</p>

	<p pid=".18.1/1">Frankly, that does not surprise me. One of my constituents even conducted an entire Open university distance learning course from his local phone box. He has now managed to secure that box as a piece of personal heritage from BT, which has been very co-operative.</p>
	<p pid=".18.1/2">The spirit in which the debate has been conducted demonstrates genuine concerns and issues. It acknowledges that BT is not being completely philistine and hard-headed about the matter, but recognises that we are not where we should be. The general appeal that I make is for BT to back off just now, to recognise that this is a serious issue, to ask Ofcom to think a little more about the universal service obligation, to deal with the roaming issue&mdash;although that does not resolve the matter&mdash;and to return to the scheme when people feel that there is cause for rationalisation. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1185" name="Alan Reid">My hon. Friends the Members for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid)</phrase> and for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) described specific problems in their areas. Logic tells us that there might be a case for moving every third box if it has very low use, but there is no logic in leaving 11 or 15 miles of road with no box at all.</p>
	<p pid=".18.1/3">My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine and I share one such area. The most celebrated phone box in Aberdeenshire at the moment, for reasons of local campaigning, is at the Kildrummy inn. That used to be in Gordon, is currently in West Aberdeenshire and, thanks to the boundary commission, is returning to Gordon. That makes it a very fought-over and fought-for phone box. The serious point is that it is on the road that leads up to the ski resort. There are boxes every two or three miles, but the proposal is to remove most of them. Logic dictates that there might be a compromise, by which one or two would be removed and two or three kept.</p>
	<p pid=".18.1/4">We urge BT to back off and to recognise that the concerns expressed today are serious and genuine. We understand its problem, and there is no lack of constructive engagement with that, but there is a need for a solution that genuinely meets the concerns and needs of rural communities and is fair.</p>
	<p pid=".18.1/5">On the point about <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/724" name="A J Beith">the real cost, my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)</phrase> raised a number of points in his representations, and particularly picked up on the point about the &pound;1,400 or &pound;1,500 cost. He said that he did not believe that many of the boxes proposed for closure in his area cost anything like that, and that he did not see why he should have to pay the cost of frequently vandalised boxes in urban areas, which is spread across the piece, when the boxes in his area do not cost a great deal to maintain.</p>
	<p pid=".18.1/6">This has been a good and important debate. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that he cannot hide entirely behind Ofcom on this. We recognise the regulator's role, but views have been expressed constructively and vehemently by too many Opposition Members here. We should like to know not only Ofcom's view but the Government's view on how to deal with the problem.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.19.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/880" speakername="Michael Fabricant" colnum="19"  time="10:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h01.htm#41012h01_spnew38">
	<p pid=".19.0/1">This has been an interesting and important debate. As has been pointed out, it is surprising that apart from the Minister, of the 460 or 470 Labour MPs in Parliament not one has chosen to take part in this debate, which affects not only rural but urban areas. In Lichfield, if one has a Vodafone phone, one does not get Vodafone coverage. I hope that Vodafone might be listening, and will provide such coverage. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/760" name="Malcolm Bruce">the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce)</phrase> said&mdash;I absolutely agree with him&mdash;if roaming were possible in the United Kingdom, that would not be an issue because I could access other mobile phone operators through my phone.</p>
	<p pid=".19.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1324" name="Roger Williams">the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> on introducing this debate, which is on an important issue.</p>
	<p pid=".19.0/3">Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1248" name="John Stanley">my right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)</phrase>, I received a letter from BT informing me that there would be phone box closures in my constituency. That brought a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, because it reminded me&mdash;it might similarly remind others here today&mdash;of the Government's recent handling of post office closures. They passed the buck on that, and I hope, as the hon. Member for Gordon said, that the Minister will not choose to pass the buck today and blame it all on Ofcom, just as the Secretary of State has blamed post office closures on the Royal Mail.</p>
	<p pid=".19.0/4">Let us be clear about the universal service obligation imposed on BT by the Communications Act 2003, which was passed only last year. It clearly says that BT</p>
	<p pid=".19.0/5" class="indent">&quot;are required to ensure the adequate provision of public call boxes and call box services throughout the UK to meet the reasonable needs of end users&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".19.0/6">We heard <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1143" name="Lembit pik">the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> say that, in his constituency, this can be a matter of life and death. There have been instances in all our constituencies when people have not had mobile phones with them or where mobile phone coverage was not available, and the emergency services have been summoned in time only through the use of an available call box.</p>
	<p pid=".19.0/7">Ofcom's current assessment is that BT cannot and should not discriminate against vulnerable consumers, as we have heard today, because they may rely on payphones to access telecommunications. The Minister clearly agrees. In the <i>Daily Express</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-18">18 August</phrase>, he said:</p>
	<p pid=".19.0/8" class="indent">&quot;not everyone can afford a mobile or home phone&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".19.0/9">He is, of course, right. BT and the Government must ensure that payphone users have access to competitive services equal to that of fixed-line users. Closing more than 9,000 call boxes does not fulfil this brief, or the requirements laid on BT by the Communications Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".19.0/10">There is still a real demand for payphones. Some 587 million calls a year are made from payphones, 9 per cent. of which are emergency calls made from call boxes, as we heard today. Moreover, many disadvantaged and minority groups use payphones extensively. A study carried out by Oftel in 2003, before Ofcom was founded, found that asylum seekers and non-white ethnic groups use payphones and PayCards regularly to make international calls to their homes and their loved ones, to keep costs down. The same survey found that more than 2 million adults use payphones regularly to call 0800 numbers. That point has not be raised today, but let us not forget that one cannot call an 0800 number free of charge from one's mobile phone. That is an important issue.</p>
	<p pid=".19.0/11">Some 39 per cent. of regular payphone users also have mobile phones, but mobile operators either charge for calls to freephone numbers, as I just said, or bar access altogether, so even if one is willing to pay, one cannot get through. Moreover, as we have heard, universal mobile coverage has still not been achieved, and I doubt that it will be achieved, because of the topography of the British isles. In rural and some urban areas, there are still large holes in the network, so there is no question of choice; consumers must use fixed-line phones. BT payphones therefore provide an important source through which people can access this service.</p>
	<p pid=".19.0/12">I fear that BT's removal of more than 9,000 phone boxes will disproportionately affect certain sectors of society&mdash;those who are deprived for one reason or another&mdash;as well as urban users and those in rural areas. I do not believe that the Government should pass the buck or allow those who cannot afford a mobile phone to be so disadvantaged. I shall quote the Minister again, if I may, as he has the disadvantage of having a constituency that is not very far from mine, so I get to see the same newspapers occasionally. In the <i>Coventry Evening Telegraph </i>on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-16">16 August</phrase> this year, he said:</p>
	<p pid=".19.0/13" class="indent">&quot;the main thing is if they are taking away payphones, they ought to do it with some concern for areas where it will have a social impact. We need to make sure that we do not disproportionately hurt people who are already disadvantaged.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".21.3/2">A point that no one has raised, which is not trivial, is that 2,900 of the 9,000 call boxes that are to go will be the traditional red ones. Those red telephone boxes are a part of our heritage and are recognised as such by millions of people all over the world. The red telephone box is a great British icon. BT, of course, sees the matter rather differently. It states that</p>
	<p pid=".21.3/3" class="indent">&quot;the fact that a phone box is red is irrelevant as we plan our removals based on usage levels and the size of the community it serves&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".21.3/4">That is a pure logical argument, but I do not think that the type of phone box should be irrelevant. We should try to protect our phone boxes&mdash;particularly our red phone boxes&mdash;in historic areas. I have a plea for a particularly nice type of historic area&mdash;cathedral cities, such as Lichfield.</p>

	<p pid=".21.4/1">The hon. Gentleman has raised a new point, which was brought to my attention by a constituent in New Radnor, who claimed that the six telephone boxes under threat there are all listed red telephone boxes. British Telecom now tells me that it is unable to close any telephone box that is listed.</p>

	<p pid=".21.5/1">That is a very interesting and revealing point. I do not know whether I should reveal this, but I think I will. Several examples have been given of ways of using phone boxes without getting a connection, such as children ringing three times. I heard from an hon. Member, before the debate, that he was actually conceived in a red phone box, so an important issue is involved.</p>
	<p pid=".21.5/2">We have heard from several hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury, about the financial aspect of the matter. Each phone box apparently costs on average &pound;1,650 a year to maintain. Clearly that is a problem. However, the removal of so many call boxes is going too far. The Government must not allow BT to forget, as they allowed the Post Office to forget, that it is a universal public service provider.</p>
	<p pid=".21.5/3">The Minister gave an assurance, in an intervention, that that right of veto would not be taken away and that Ofcom is not considering that. That is not what Ofcom has said to several Opposition Members. Will the Minister make it clear whether the veto will still stand after the Ofcom consultation has been completed? It is now reviewing the universal service obligation, and that review will start next month. The consultation will last 12 weeks and will cover the whole issue of objections by public bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".21.5/4">I will not make an excuse for raising the issue of post office closures again, because I believe that the closures were shambolic. The Government must not be allowed to pass the buck to Ofcom. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling said, the Minister must come clean. BT is a public service provider, just like the Post Office. Will the Minister give Opposition Members an assurance that our payphones are safe in Government hands?</p>

	<p pid=".22.0/1">In the limited time available, I have several issues to deal with and shall try to cover as many as I can of the points that have been raised.</p>
	<p pid=".22.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1324" name="Roger Williams">the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase>, who has raised an enormously important issue. Not only his constituents, but mine and those of other hon. Members, will be concerned about it. This has been a good debate and some important points have been raised. British Telecom needs to listen to the real concerns that have been expressed by hon. Members and take some of them on board when it next seeks to carry out consultations with local authorities and others about how call box closures take place.</p>
	<p pid=".22.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1018" name="Robert Key">The hon. Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key)</phrase> made a good point. He said that we should not just blame BT, that there is a wider problem of the growth in mobile phone use, and that Ofcom needs to look at the issues in an innovative way. He is right about that. For some time, the business conducted by public call box providers&mdash;especially BT&mdash;has been under increasing pressure. Mobile phone use has increased and call box use has decreased proportionately. Telecommunication is, of course, a privatised industry. Companies seek to make profits and that has led to call box operators deciding to scale back the provision of call boxes and remove some that they regard as underutilised or uneconomic.</p>
	<p pid=".22.0/4">Regulation of call box provision is a matter for the independent regulator, the Office of Communications. The Government set the broad overall framework, but the detailed regulation is entirely a matter for Ofcom. It always amazes me that we get Conservatives saying that we ought to privatise things, put them in the private sector, get the Government off people's backs and end Government interference, and then, as soon as things are privatised and there is an independent regulator, they say that the Government are passing the buck because they are not interfering enough. That is politics, but it is not serious; it is knockabout politics. What we are dealing with is a serious issue and people need to get a clear view of the way forward.</p>
	<p pid=".22.0/5">Over the past five years, it is certainly true that mobile phone penetration has increased to cover most of the population, except for the very young, some of the very old and those who are unable to afford a mobile phone or who have made a conscious decision&mdash;who can blame them?&mdash;not to have one. That has caused a sustained reduction in call box use and, from a commercial perspective, reduced the revenue that BT gets from payphones. However, the provision of public call boxes should not be seen just as a commercial venture that is part of BT's business.</p>
	<p pid=".22.0/6">The Government and Ofcom see the need to protect the provision of call boxes as an important means of social and economic inclusion. Although usage has been declining, call boxes are still well used by significant proportions of the population. The overall numbers may be small and users may be from particular groups, such as the young and low-income users, but they are people to whom there is an obligation, and that needs to be recognised.</p>
	<p pid=".22.0/7">The tension between the commercial and the public service issues was conveyed very well by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1143" name="Lembit pik">the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase>, who said that we were talking about a private company with a public service obligation. We know that that private company has a real problem. Hon. Members do not want to lose their local call boxes&mdash;they do not want to lose that public facility&mdash;so Ofcom is undertaking a broader consultation about how we look at the public service obligation. I hope that the consultation, which is coming up shortly, will involve more than 17 people replying to Ofcom and that it will be ensured that hon. Members can voice in their concerns about the way in which the public service obligation operates.</p>

</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.23.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1138" speakername="Mike O'Brien" colnum="23"  time="10:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h01.htm#41012h01_spnew46">
	<p pid=".23.1/1">Will the hon. Gentleman excuse me? I have only three and half minutes left to reply and there is quite a lot I have to get through.</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/2">The call box network is protected by the universal service obligation and a right to object, in limited circumstances, on the part of local authorities. BT and Kingston, the providers of call boxes, fund that network, but Ofcom now needs to consider through a wide consultation how we can maintain reasonable access to call boxes for members of the public and how we can protect that network. The Government want broad accessibility of call boxes to the public, particularly to those groups who need them. I want to be clear on that.</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/3">I am also concerned by some of the points raised during the debate about BT's method of consulting on the issue, particularly in not making it clear to some local authorities that they have&mdash;effectively&mdash;a right of veto and can exercise that right. BT needs to take those points on board and to listen to the strong concerns expressed here. In the letter I saw about particular call boxes, I do not recall a reference to that veto, but I will look at that letter again. I think that, when they get told about proposals to close call boxes, Members of Parliament also need to be aware that there is a right of veto. That awareness needs to be raised.</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/4">The stories that we heard about the way that BT responded to&mdash;at least initial&mdash;inquiries by hon. Members are a matter of concern. BT needs to make sure that the consultation is carried out properly. The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire also pointed out that consulting more widely with local authorities and with the LGA might well be in BT's interests when considering whether we can find a way forward. I hope that it will listen to that recommendation.</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/5">On the consultation that is taking place, I have asked for the situation in relation to the veto to be double-checked with Ofcom today. I must be clear about what it said. Removing the veto is not one of the options that it is considering. However, it is a consultation. Therefore, it may well be that others&mdash;perhaps BT&mdash;say that Ofcom ought to consider removing the veto. While Ofcom are not putting that forward as one of its options for change at this point&mdash;I am told by my officials who spoke to Ofcom today that it is right that removing the veto is not something that Ofcom is considering&mdash;it is possible that others may ask it to do so in the future. Therefore, my recommendation to all hon. Members is that when the consultation takes place, they should get in their two-pennyworth and make sure that they state their view about how the veto should be sustained in the long-term. It is certainly an issue.</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/6">We believe that the universal service obligation is fundamental to the regulation of telecommunications in the UK. It means that basic telephone services should be available to everyone on reasonable request and at an affordable price. That includes the provision of call boxes. Accordingly, the provision of call boxes has been included in the Department of Trade and Industry's Electronic Communications (Universal Service), Order 2003, which was made under the Communications Act 2003. It sets out the framework for Ofcom to set out the detail of call box regulation. It preserves the provision of call boxes to meet the reasonable needs of end users in terms of geographical coverage, numbers of call boxes and quality of service.</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/7">One of the concerns raised is about rural areas. Before I close, I will say a word on that. BT should recognise that there are areas that mobile phones do not cover. There are areas that particular providers of mobile phone services are unable to access. In other words, there are blackspots. Therefore, it is necessary to have some call box coverage in those areas.</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/8">The way in which the rules for removing a call box operate means that there needs to be a 42-day consultation period. Where it is the case that the local council has not been made aware by BT of its right to veto a closure, and has therefore not been able to make a recommendation in the 42-day period, I hope that BT will consider allowing the local council to raise the issue with it subsequently and take on board the local council's concern that a call box should not be closed.</p>

	Osteoporosis (Dorset)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.25.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1266" speakername="Robert Syms" colnum="25"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h02.htm#41012h02_spnew0">
	<p pid=".25.1/1">This is an important debate, particularly for the 3 million people affected by osteoporosis, for many of my constituents in Poole and for other people in Dorset, where we have a high age profile. It is a major problem in the area.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/2">Osteoporosis affects one in three women and between one in 12 and one in eight men over the age of 50. Over the next 50 years, it is predicted that the level of osteoporosis will double, mainly because of the ageing population.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/3">Osteoporosis is often passed off as a normal facet of ageing, rather than a serious condition that requires treatment. However, without treatment, osteoporosis can be painful and debilitating. Every two minutes, someone has a fracture due to osteoporosis, resulting in more than 200,000 fractures a year. Sometimes, those are a major factor in mortality. Nearly one in five people who suffer a fracture die within a year. The cost to the national health service and the wider economy is between &pound;1.7 billion and &pound;1.8 billion a year.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/4">As well as causing considerable pain, osteoporosis has major implications for NHS resources. More than 800,000 hospital bed nights each year are accounted for by patients with hip fractures in England alone. Patients with spinal fractures visit their GP an additional 14 times in a year following a fracture. Osteoporosis will have a major and growing impact on the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/5">Apart from the overall situation, osteoporosis has a tremendous impact on individuals. Broken bones due to osteoporosis can result in pain, deformity, depression, anxiety, social isolation and death. Up to one in three hip fracture patients die within a year, and some surveys show that 80 per cent. of elderly women at high risk of hip fracture would rather die than have a bad hip fracture and lose their independence. Fear of falling and breaking bones can prevent women from enjoying a normal retirement, and osteoporosis can prevent patients from doing many ordinary daily activities.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/6">Osteoporosis is a preventable condition. Strong bones can continue to be built up to the age of 35. Therefore, the earlier in life that a healthy lifestyle is adopted, the greater the benefits. Key risk factors include lack of physical activity, smoking, excessive alcohol, and low calcium and vitamin D intake.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/7">The difficulty nationally with osteoporosis is that it tends to form part of lots of other strategies. The Government have a preventing falls strategy and there is a national service framework for older people. Osteoporosis is a part of both. However, it is sometimes not the focus, and remains under-prioritised. That is one of the reasons why I want to raise the issue in the House of Commons, and I am glad to see the Minister of State here today.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/8">My interest was increased by a visit to the offices of Osteoporosis Dorset, a local charity partly funded by the Dorset and Somerset strategic health authority, which funds the osteoporosis prevention officer, Mrs. Carol Jones. I met the chairman, Group Captain John Rees. They went through some of the things that they do. I intend to point out what can be done, because prevention and work in the community are important in dealing with the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/9">Osteoporosis Dorset was established in 1992 to reduce the incidence of fractures in the county. From its inception, it has received support from the Dorset health authority. Its scientific advisory group developed a clear strategy built around the rubric &quot;Prevention through education&quot;, using a high-risk-group approach. The groups were defined as women with early menopause before 45 years; men and women on long-term corticosteroids; patients presenting with low-trauma fractures; residential care home residents, for whom Osteoporosis Dorset has been instrumental in introducing hip protectors; and elderly people living at home, the strategies for whom have included falls templates, calcium and vitamin D, and hip protectors.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/10">Much work and money was dedicated to piloting the ideas and developing protocols for the management of those groups of individuals at high risk of osteoporosis. In addition, the charity formed a nurse network known as the Bone Alliance, which trained practice nurses&mdash;at no cost to the individual or practice&mdash;in how to support their patients. That local organisation does a lot of excellent work in advising GPs. One point that has been raised with me is that, because osteoporosis is not part of the GP contract, GPs do not necessarily pay it adequate attention. In Poole, the organisation helps to make up for that by providing information and expertise. It has also developed a network of osteoporosis patient peer support groups, as well as securing funding from the Department of Health to become one of eight national pre-retirement health check pilot sites, details of which it is working on. We benefit greatly from the work of the charity and its local organisation.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/11">One of the major benefits of Osteoporosis Dorset is that, early in its existence, it came across hip protectors, which were developed in Denmark and are widely used on the continent. They are useful devices. I shall show how and try to explain for <i>Hansard. </i>They give protection to people who are at risk of fracturing their hips, help to absorb the shock if they fall over, and provide additional protection during recovery if they have to have hip surgery. They cost only &pound;32 plus VAT each, and Poole primary care trust is very good in that it provides them for people living in homes in the Poole area. I understand that some neighbouring primary care trusts do not provide them.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/12">Let me demonstrate. Essentially, they are pants with pads on either side&mdash;not the most stylish items in the world, but very practical. They do an excellent job in providing protection for those in homes whose hips are at risk from falls. This practical idea could be rather more widely used in order to save people the agony that results from falling and breaking their hips.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/13">There are many other ways in which we could tackle osteoporosis. There is no formal national screening programme for it, which means that, apart from certain groups such as those taking corticosteroids, and thus receiving regular screening, most patients are unaware that they have osteoporosis and are diagnosed only when they suffer fractures. One million women in the UK are identified for possible treatment, most commonly at the time of fracture.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/14">A screening programme ought to be considered. That would be a way of identifying those who are prone to osteoporosis. A range of treatments can be used: bisphosphonates, non-hormonal drugs that help to maintain bone density and reduce fracture rates; calcium and vitamin D supplements, which can reduce the risk of hip fractures; hormone replacement therapy for women; and selective estrogen receptor modulators, drugs that act on the bone in a similar way to oestrogen and help to maintain bone density.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/15">There have been developments. I noticed an article in the <i>Daily Mail</i> on <phrase class="date" code="">5 October</phrase> about a drug called Bonviva, a bisphosphonate that is being developed by Roche, and which would have to be taken monthly by those with osteoporosis. One problem is that, although some 650,000 women currently receive drug treatment for the condition, there is evidence that not all of them take the drug as often as they should. It would be beneficial if there were a pill that could be taken once a month and slowly released the drug into the blood stream.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/16">I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on drug treatment for the condition. There could be substantial savings in having a range of drugs; I have pointed out the cost of some of the treatments for osteoporosis. It is a preventable condition that has not received the attention that it needs in order to be given priority by the relevant parts of the national health service. It forms part of the preventing falls strategy and the national service framework for older people, but has not received the focus that it ought to have. I know that the National Osteoporosis Society does very good work, and Osteoporosis Dorset also does good work, but the matter requires a greater focus from the Government. We ought to consider whether to carry out more screening and put more investment into prevention, so that we not only save considerable sums of money, but avoid the tying up of substantial numbers of hospital beds as a result of people going in with fractures.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/17">As we have heard, people with one fracture often get further fractures, which can cause problems. We ought to revisit the GP contract on this matter, and GPs ought to regard osteoporosis as a greater priority. The topic is important. Fractures impact greatly on the lives of older people. If we are serious about saving money and improving the quality of life of some of our elder citizens, the condition should be treated as a higher priority by the Government and the NHS. If it were and we invested more in prevention, we could reduce the number of cases of osteoporosis substantially.</p>

	<p pid=".27.0/1">Before we proceed, I would like to place one matter on the record. The hon. Gentleman produced an exhibit and described it articulately, tastefully and with care for the record. I would not wish it to be thought that the fact that I allowed him to do so should be regarded as a precedent in any way.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.27.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1332" speakername="Rosie Winterton" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health"  colnum="27"  time="11:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h02.htm#41012h02_spmin0">
	<p pid=".27.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1266" name="Robert Syms">the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms)</phrase> on securing the debate. I know that many of the issues that he raised are of great importance to his constituents and to him. He set out clearly many of the facts and figures relating to osteoporosis. I share his concern that we should do everything we can to reduce the suffering caused by the condition. I hope that I shall be able to reassure him that the Department of Health, the national health service and other key stakeholders have put in place a programme to do just that. I hope that I can illustrate that we are making the matter a priority and will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/2">The hon. Gentleman mentioned screening. In 2000, the NHS plan announced an initiative to identify five pilot sites in England to provide advice and health checks for people entering retirement. That was managed by the Health Development Agency and ran from 2001 to 2003. As he is aware, South and East Dorset primary care trust, in collaboration with Osteoporosis Dorset, a well respected charitable trust, were involved in one of the five national pre-retirement health check pilots for women aged between 56 and 65.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/3">The aim of the pilots was to identify risk factors and to implement strategies to reduce the risk of osteoporosis fractures, heart attacks, stroke and diabetes. Following the pilots, a major implementation programme has been put in place at the Health Development Agency, using the evidence from the pilot phase, so that practitioners and policy makers can focus services on those particular age groups.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/4">My Department and the Welsh Assembly Government have asked the National Institute for Clinical Excellence to develop clinical guidelines and technology appraisals on what is effective in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, the assessment of fracture risk and the prevention of fractures in individuals at high risk&mdash;the hon. Gentleman highlighted the preventive aspect&mdash;and the assessment and prevention of falls in older people.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/5">The technology appraisals of prevention and treatment of osteoporosis include consideration of five osteoporosis drugs, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. The appraisal is split into two parts: primary and secondary prevention. The primary prevention part is due to be published in September 2005, after which the second part will be published, although we do not yet have a date for that. The appraisals are designed to give doctors the latest evidence-based information on the most effective treatments for osteoporosis. However, it is also important to patients and carers to have access to clear, authoritative advice on both the sort of care that might be best for them, and the standards of care they can expect from the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/6">The fracture risk guideline, which is due to be completed in June 2005, will look at all groups recognised to be at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. It will examine the interventions that can be used to prevent fractures and cover primary care, secondary NHS health care and the professionals who have direct contact with and make decisions about the care of high-risk individuals. The guideline will also look at areas where collaboration is needed between primary and secondary NHS services. Fracture risk would apply because of the very issues that the hon. Gentleman highlighted about the need to provide ongoing preventive care and to ensure that primary and secondary care services work closely together.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/7">The falls guideline is due to be completed in November this year. It will provide recommendations for good practice that, again, are based on the best available evidence of clinical and cost-effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/8">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the national service framework for older people. I hope that we might consider the appraisals and the guidelines as building on the work on standard six of the NSF, rather than think of them as separate. That is certainly one of the key policy drivers on osteoporosis. The framework sets clear milestones for the planning and development of integrated falls services and requires that such services should be established across all health and social care systems by April 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/9">Good progress is being made across the country in implementing that, but the decisions are sometimes local, in line with &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power&quot;. However, the Department will monitor the April 2005 milestone through the strategic health authorities. We are also collecting information from a sample of health and social care communities on all the NSF standards to enable us to assess progress on implementation. That information will feed into the Healthcare Commission's in-depth review of progress on the framework. That is what we are doing to ensure that we can drive through the proposals and have a consistent service across the country.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/10">I congratulate and pay tribute to all the staff and stakeholders in the Dorset health economy for their commitment to delivering and improving osteoporosis services for local people. As the hon. Gentleman said, osteoporosis services in Dorset are co-ordinated through a partnership between the Dorset health community and Osteoporosis Dorset. The Dorset and Somerset strategic health authority has assured me that that model of service provision is working extremely well and has resulted in the county being perceived as one of the lead areas in developing innovative, evidence-based approaches to fracture reduction. I am sure that he and his constituents are proud of that long-term arrangement, which has been operating in Dorset since 1992.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/11">I have been assured that the details necessary to maintain an ongoing arrangement are at present being agreed by the Bournemouth Teaching primary care trust, which is the NHS organisation leading the relationship with Osteoporosis Dorset, on behalf of all primary care trusts in Dorset. I am also assured that all the primary care trusts in the Dorset and Somerset strategic health authority area are committed to delivering on this high-priority national service framework milestone and are developing integrated osteoporosis strategies as part of their overall falls strategy. I am informed that plans are being implemented to ensure that the integrated falls service, which was developed by primary care trusts in line with local partners, is in place by March 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/12">I have been illustrating some of the ways in which, nationally, we are setting the milestones and, locally, there is implementation. The hon. Gentleman asked about GP contracts. It is true that in a sense osteoporosis did not make it into the quality and outcomes framework, perhaps because there was not enough evidence-based information to make that possible. I have reviewed some of the issues around that. We are trying to build that information consistently by reviewing the pilot studies, the NICE guidelines and how we implement national service frameworks, and an independent review group is considering the GP contract and how new indicators can be included from April 2006 if new evidence emerges in those areas.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/13">I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that the increase in spending in the NHS overall&mdash;particularly the amount of money that is allocated at local level through devolved decision making&mdash;is allowing the development of extra services and ensuring that we can fund many of them. That is not to say that we are in any way complacent about what needs to be done.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/14">I note the hon. Gentleman's comments about, and vivid illustration of, hip protectors&mdash;I now completely know what they look like&mdash;for people with osteoporosis, and I understand his desire for more consistency in how they are funded and provided locally. Current NICE draft guidelines on prevention and treatment of falls consider the use of hip protectors, but conclude that the evidence is not strong enough to support a firm recommendation for their use as an effective preventative measure for all people with osteoporosis. However, that appraisal is still in progress. Hip protectors are available free if they are provided by the NHS following an individual assessment of clinical need. I know that all NHS organisations in Dorset continue to make provision for that as necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/15">I reiterate that I do not underestimate the enormous burden of this debilitating disease. As the hon. Gentleman said, about 310,000 osteoporotic fractures occur each year. There is absolutely no doubt that, because of the ageing UK population, that number is set to increase. He was right to point to work that still needs to be done regarding preventive measures such as diet. The issue of how we can use diet more effectively to prevent some of the conditions that arise from poor diet is being considered in the public health White Paper.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/16">It is only by collective and collaborative work across sectors and professions and, of course, by properly engaging with older people that we will be able to make a difference to people's lives. We need to work at a national level, build on the best practice that has been illustrated so vividly and excellently in Dorset, and consider what further measures can be taken, not least by examining relevant public health issues.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/17">I hope that my comments have given the hon. Gentleman some assurance that we take this issue seriously and that we are working towards the clear goal of doing everything we can to reduce the effects of osteoporosis and to prevent it from occurring in the first place.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.31.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/896" speakername="Michael Foster" colnum="31"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h03.htm#41012h03_spnew0">
	<p pid=".31.1/1">I welcome the opportunity to raise this important matter in this Chamber. I am pleased that so many of my colleagues have turned up today to make their concerns known as well. I wish to put on the record my support and appreciation of the work undertaken by the local police. Forgive me for being parochial for just a moment or two, but the leadership of Chief Superintendent Simon Adams, who is the divisional commander of South Worcestershire, the work tackling antisocial behaviour in Warndon villages of Sergeant Chris Allen, the community engagement in St. Johns of Police Constable Tina Dodd, and the local knowledge that community support officer Lee Russell has gained just by walking his beat, and that he uses to cut crime in Warndon, are just a few examples of the really good work that our local police force does in a difficult and challenging job.</p>
	<p pid=".31.1/2">However, this debate centres on finance, to which I now turn. The nomination process for the financial year 2004&ndash;05 has left a challenge that must be met by West Mercia in its budget setting for 2005&ndash;06: a notional reduction of &pound;517,000. That point was clearly made to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Industry and the Regions and me at a meeting with the local police authority. Unfortunately, she cannot be here at this moment. If hon. Members look at the Annunciator, they will see exactly why.</p>
	<p pid=".31.1/3">The Association of Police Authorities has recently highlighted the fact that police authorities will need a 5.5 per cent. increase in their budgets next year just to maintain current levels of service. That is largely due to the cost of salaries and the commitments arising from the unfunded police pension scheme, about which I shall say more later. I understand that the rate of so-called police inflation is increasingly recognised, and I would welcome any observations that the Minister has on the matter that may help West Mercia and other police authorities in their financial planning.</p>
	<p pid=".31.1/4">West Mercia shares the position of other police authorities. The 2004&ndash;05 budget requirement of &pound;165.8 million will need to increase by &pound;8.9 million, or 5.4 per cent, to maintain current policies. Broadly speaking, &pound;5.3 million is due to increased pay and other inflation, &pound;1.2 million is for police pension commitments and &pound;1.9 million is for unavoidable commitments, such as salary increments following the increase in the number of police officers and the local government pension contributions for the civilian staff. An increase of only 3 per cent. in police grant&mdash;&pound;3.2 million&mdash;would leave a shortfall of &pound;5.7 million to be found from the council tax, which would have to increase by 9.8 per cent., raising the band D rate to &pound;151.14. I repeat that those figures are for maintaining the status quo. They make no provision for matters pressing on West Mercia such as improved custody facilities, improvements to call handling and increased calls to tackle antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".31.1/5">Before I press the Minister on areas where I hope that she can use her influence to help West Mercia, I would like to spend some time exploring the background to the funding problems and try to shed some light on them. It has been said in some Government quarters that West Mercia is a high-spending police authority. Let me put the record straight. The average spend per head of population for 2004&ndash;05 for all police authorities is &pound;182.82. West Mercia is the fourth lowest at &pound;141.97. Even taking just the shire forces, the average spend per head is &pound;151, and West Mercia is well below that. Narrowing the field even more to include just the most similar forces as our comparator, the average is &pound;143.07&mdash;still higher than West Mercia. There is no way that one could describe West Mercia as a high-spending, profligate authority.</p>

	<p pid=".32.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this debate. He is absolutely right to compare West Mercia with other rural forces and not with urban forces. Will he deal with the issue of sparsity in his speech? Although it may not be a factor in Worcester, it certainly is in Herefordshire, parts of Shropshire and parts of Worcestershire. In reality, the &pound;2.3 million that the constabulary receives from the Government to account for the sparsity factor has not increased in line with inflation in recent years. Does he hope that it will in future, and does he agree that the money should be ring-fenced to deal with the real issues of policing in rural areas?</p>

	<p pid=".32.1/1">I shall obviously have to call immediately for a leak inquiry. Information must have gone from my office to that of the hon. Gentleman because he makes the exact point that I want to make later in my contribution.</p>
	<p pid=".32.1/2">The council tax band D levels show that West Mercia portrays itself in an unfavourable light. The 2004&ndash;05 precept is &pound;137.69, which is higher than the national average of &pound;126.33, higher than the shire force average of &pound;121.12 and higher than the most similar force average of &pound;123.06. We must accept that council tax is higher for West Mercia. Having established that it is not a high-spending police authority, why is it necessary for it to be a relatively high precept-levying authority? The answer lies in the third part of the funding triangle&mdash;Government grant per head of population. In West Mercia's case, I would call it the Bermuda triangle, because things seem to go missing in it.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.32.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1340" speakername="David Wright" colnum="32"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h03.htm#41012h03_spnew3">
	<p pid=".32.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that West Mercia finds itself in its current position partly because of the brave decision that the police authority took about two years ago to recruit hundreds of new police officers? I understand that the current force strength stands at about 2,400 officers. That was a brave decision, and I hope that the Government and the Minister will respond by ensuring that the authority, having taken that decision, is provided with a good platform of grant in future.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.32.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/896" speakername="Michael Foster" colnum="32"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h03.htm#41012h03_spnew4">
	<p pid=".32.3/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. In fact, I think that those police officer numbers are at the highest level since the constabulary was formed in 1967, which is testimony to what my hon. Friend describes as a brave local decision.</p>
	<p pid=".32.3/2">The average Government grant for all police forces is &pound;138.11 per head, while West Mercia's is &pound;92.24. Shire forces average &pound;107.16 per head, and most similar forces average &pound;99.07 per head. This is the core of the problem. If West Mercia received the all-force average Government grant per head of population, it would receive an additional &pound;53.6 million to spend. If it received the shire force average, it would have &pound;17.4 million more to spend, and if it received the most similar force average Government grant per head it would get &pound;7.9 million more to spend each and every year.</p>
	<p pid=".32.3/3">We must view that information in the context of what I have already explained is a requirement to spend an extra &pound;8.9 million next year just to stand still. Raising &pound;1 million from council tax only would limit the increase to &pound;2.38, or 1.7 per cent. All the police forces in England and Wales that surround West Mercia receive a higher Government grant per head than West Mercia. I believe that the Minister will agree that crime does not respect local administrative boundaries, even though funding seems to. In the small island state that we live in, people do not understand why postcode lotteries still exist.</p>
	<p pid=".32.3/4">As a resident and council tax payer in West Mercia, I accept&mdash;as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1340" name="David Wright">my hon. Friend the Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase> has mentioned&mdash;that local decisions have also been made to increase council tax to pay for additional police services. For example, the 2002&ndash;03 budget proposed to recruit an additional 300 police officers, all funded locally. Indeed, that contributed to the council tax increase of 33.1 per cent. experienced that year but&mdash;significantly, because of the manner in which council tax capping has been used this year&mdash;the decision also has annual council tax consequences.</p>
	<p pid=".32.3/5">Using figures supplied by the police authority, I estimate the additional marginal cost of activity associated with employing those 300 officers to be &pound;4.28 on council tax. That is in addition to the direct employment costs identified back in 2002&ndash;03. Deducting the whole cost of employing those 300 officers from the police budget would see the band D precept reduce to &pound;119.10, saving some &pound;18.59 over the year. That brings the council tax below the national force average, the shire force average and the most similar force average.</p>
	<p pid=".32.3/6">However, at a philosophical level, should that decision be held against West Mercia in council tax capping decisions? I have a real problem with arguing that it should. Delegating to local people powers to improve their local police force is a way of empowering them to respond to local need and it provides a mechanism to give greater democratic accountability to the police force. I find it difficult to argue the case that local people should be penalised for actively seeking a local solution to what they consider to be local problems.</p>

	<p pid=".33.0/1">I want to reiterate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1340" name="David Wright">the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase>. According to the figures that I have seen, there has been an increase of something like 30 per cent. in staff numbers at West Mercia over the past seven years. We now have 4,000 police officers and support staff, whereas before we had 3,100. The benefits are obvious for all to see. There are 40 additional police officers patrolling the streets of my constituency. There are 21 community support officers in Telford and Wrekin and I have just written a letter to the Minister encouraging her to fund more. How many letters has <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/896" name="Michael Foster">my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster)</phrase> had from constituents complaining about the increase in the precept of West Mercia police? Perhaps he will also tell us how many letters he has received from ordinary local council tax payers objecting to the increase in the council tax levied by his council.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.34.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/896" speakername="Michael Foster" colnum="34"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h03.htm#41012h03_spnew6">
	<p pid=".34.0/1">I confess that I have indeed received one letter complaining about the 2002&ndash;03 police precept increase. It was a case that I know that the police authority is well aware of and it has involved a prolonged exchange of correspondence. However, I have received numerous letters from my constituents applauding the work that the police are doing in cutting antisocial behaviour and crime generally. They far outweigh the single letter that I received in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/2">My hon. Friend makes an important point about staff numbers increasing, because it is not just the increase in police officer numbers that is relevant; the civilianisation of the police force, which means that more operational officers can go on the beat, is also an important way in which we can manage the resources that we have.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.34.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1058" speakername="Peter Luff" colnum="34"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h03.htm#41012h03_spnew7">
	<p pid=".34.1/1">Just for the record, I have had a lot of letters complaining about the increase in precept.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.34.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/896" speakername="Michael Foster" colnum="34"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h03.htm#41012h03_spnew8">
	<p pid=".34.2/1">I take that point on board. I am not in a position to dispute it one way or the other. Of course, it matters that the police authority undertook proper consultation. Community policing boards agreed to the precept increase and that was supported by an opinion poll survey conducted in January 2002 among 500 residents of West Mercia, which found that 71 per cent. of people supported adding 50p a week to their council tax specifically to pay for 300 extra officers. That figure rose to 81 per cent. when people were asked about adding 30p to recruit 100 extra officers. Only 19 per cent. were not in favour of any increase at all.</p>
	<p pid=".34.2/2">Having established, I hope, that West Mercia is a low-spending force, albeit with a relatively high council tax precept as a result of the low level of Government grant, it is worth looking at whether West Mercia uses those resources efficiently. The most recent baseline report produced by Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary identifies West Mercia as delivering high levels of performance. It has consistently more than delivered the efficiency targets demanded of it. Some &pound;16.5 million of efficiency gains has been delivered over the past five years. The HMIC report ranks the strategic management and the performance management of the force as excellent. It states that the authority has a strong record of effective budgetary control. I am doubly delighted about that because I know that at least two of my former students work in that department at the police authority&mdash;but no doubt the director of finance, Mr. Stephen Howarth, would also like to claim some credit for that.</p>
	<p pid=".34.2/3">West Mercia has one of the best performing estate management functions in the country. PricewaterhouseCoopers suggested in its external audit letter of 2002&ndash;03 that the force's report was one of the best that the auditor had issued. The force collaborates nationally and regionally to ensure best practice and procurement, and has consistently used civilian staff to release police officers for operational duties. Crime is falling in West Mercia, especially in the South Worcestershire division with which I am most familiar. The most recent figures for the city of Worcester show that between April and August 2004, compared with the same period last year, robbery was down by 59 per cent., vehicle crime down by 34 per cent., burglary down by 11 per cent. and violent crime down by 2 per cent. Of the violent crimes committed, 72 per cent. are detected. In the police performance monitoring report 2003&ndash;04, produced last month, West Mercia shows year-on-year improvement or above average performance in citizen focus, reducing crime, investigating crime, promoting public safety, providing assistance and resource usage&mdash;in short, all six performance measures that the Home Office uses.</p>
	<p pid=".34.2/4">However, like me, West Mercia wants the force to improve on what it does. That is why I should like to press the Minister for help with several matters. Let me make it quite clear that in calling for her assistance, I do not want to hear from her that salvation lies in a financial fairy godmother dressed in orange who, slapper-like, promises to take everyone to the ball&mdash;that is the Lib Dem way. Nor do I want to be fobbed off by revelations that some fantasy island exists far, far away, paved with cash to pay for more police funding&mdash;that is the Conservative way. I live in the real world, and I want real help.</p>
	<p pid=".34.2/5">First, the Minister will know of my support for West Mercia's bid for 40 extra community support officers. Achieving success in that bid will help to overcome some of the funding shortfalls that I highlighted earlier. Will she assure me that she will look favourably on that bid? I understand that such bids are usually heavily oversubscribed, and the Minister might be tempted to prioritise areas that do not yet have CSOs. I ask her, however, not to ignore those forces that took up the challenge to begin with and helped to pioneer the deployment of CSOs.</p>
	<p pid=".34.2/6">The second matter is the police grant for 2005&ndash;06. I hope that I have convinced the Minister of our case for increased grant, but I am well aware of the three-year formula freeze. I ask the Minister to consider granting area cost adjustment to West Mercia in the medium to long term, which would raise an extra &pound;1.7 million on this year's figures if we received the same rate as neighbouring Gloucestershire. I also ask her to examine more closely the details of the formula. For example, low incomes as calculated through the working families tax credit could be used as a deprivation indicator, rather than just income support claimant counts, which count only the unemployed. Such a change was, interestingly, made for the education formula spending share last time it was reviewed.</p>
	<p pid=".34.2/7">Will the Minister use her influence over colleagues at the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in discussions about local government finance? The following bodies had nominated or designated budgets this year: Herefordshire unitary authority, Hereford and Worcester combined fire authority, Telford and Wrekin council, and West Mercia police authority. It is glaringly obvious that there is a geographical bias unwittingly built into the system, as all those bodies lie in the West Mercia area. That reinforces the case that colleagues and I have made on behalf of Worcestershire county council over several years. For 2004&ndash;05 a standard increase in grant of 3.25 per cent. was paid to all police forces, meaning that none lost out comparatively. I know that the Home Office is under pressure to scrap such a floors-and-ceilings scheme, but I ask for such floors to be adopted again in the short term so that West Mercia is not penalised any further.</p>
	<p pid=".34.2/8">Thirdly, West Mercia currently receives the welcome rural sparsity grant that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1013" name="Paul Keetch">the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch)</phrase> mentioned. It was first set up in 2001 and was ring-fenced to protect forces such as West Mercia. It brings in &pound;2.3 million. Given what I said about the police grant, I ask the Minister to retain the grant as it is and not to incorporate it into the mainstream police grant. The rural sparsity grant exists because of the known higher cost of policing in rural areas. A small matter that has been pointed out is that, since its creation in 2001, the rural sparsity grant has not been increased in line with inflation. The Minister may want to correct that.</p>
	<p pid=".34.2/9">Finally, I urge the Minister to consider what I call nationalisation of the police pension scheme to avoid instability in levying council tax. Like all other forces, West Mercia funds its pension liabilities itself. Of course, that can vary from year to year depending on the age and the retirement profile of police officers. If that responsibility were taken away from the force and funding allocated centrally, local council tax payers would not see so much variation in council tax increases each year.</p>
	<p pid=".34.2/10">It is not doom and gloom in West Mercia&mdash;far from it. Crime is falling; police numbers are at record levels; CSOs are patrolling our streets and helping to tackle antisocial behaviour using the new tools. Divisions such as South Worcestershire are at the forefront of best practice in combating antisocial behaviour, including the use of dispersal zones. There is a real sense of ambition to press ahead to meet even greater challenges and to improve performance further. In the background, there are the financial constraints that I described. We want the Minister to use whatever influence she can to help West Mercia achieve even more.</p>

	<p pid=".36.0/1">Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am glancing around to see how many colleagues are trying to catch your eye. I make it three more before we cut off at 3 o'clock, so we have a bit longer than we thought.</p>
	<p pid=".36.0/2">Having said that, there is, in many senses, not a great deal left to say; <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/896" name="Michael Foster">the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster)</phrase> said most of it. However, what is worth saying is worth repeating and I intend to do that, in part at least. I congratulate him on securing the debate. A number of us applied for it and he won the prize, so he got the opportunity to make the important points first. On that issue there is, largely, consensus in the three counties.</p>
	<p pid=".36.0/3">I do not agree with a couple of the things that the hon. Gentleman said. I will get them out of the way at the beginning so that I can return to a spirit of consensus. First, I regret the national policy points that he made, because there is genuine disagreement between the three parties about how to fund the overall level of public service expenditure. The issue that we are debating is not national policy, which is irrelevant; it is how the national pot is split between the geographical areas. That is the crucial issue. I happen to think that he is wrong about Conservative party policy and that his Government's policy is wrong, but that is irrelevant.</p>
	<p pid=".36.0/4">The issue is: how do we get a fair share of what the Government who are in power make available? The hon. Gentleman made the point about the obvious geographical issue so powerfully towards the end of his speech. If all those authorities are being capped, nominated, warned and threatened, something has gone wrong with the system.</p>
	<p pid=".36.0/5">The other thing that I disagreed with was the implication that the hon. Gentleman was led on to by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/747" name="Peter Bradley">his hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Peter Bradley)</phrase> that the level of council tax is acceptable. I have had many letters of protest from my constituents&mdash;I do not know how many off the top of my head, but 20, 30 or 40, which is quite a lot&mdash;complaining about the level of the council tax increase and always highlighting the police grant as one of the most unacceptable increases of all. So there is resistance to further council tax increases and we need to recognise that people on low and fixed incomes&mdash;across the country but certainly in my constituency&mdash;cannot tolerate further significant real-terms increases in council tax across any of the component precepting authorities. We must work towards a system in which they do not have to face those large increases.</p>

	<p pid=".37.0/1">For the record, there have been complaints in my constituency about the level of council tax, but they are directed at the local authority and not at West Mercia police authority. I doubt that there is a single Member here, or anywhere else in West Mercia, who made representations to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister that West Mercia should be capped.</p>

	<p pid=".37.1/1">I am grateful for that clarification. In Worcester and Wychavon, we are lucky that the district councils have kept the increase in line with inflation for their own precepting. However, the police precept is growing every year. If it increases in absolute and relative terms each year, clearly it becomes more of a problem and a bigger component of the council tax.</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/2">Let us get back to areas that we agree on. The trouble is that the situation is &quot;Here we go again&quot;.

	<p pid=".37.3/1">I will speak for Herefordshire as well. I will happily speak for the whole of West Mercia, because we agree that there is a shared problem of considerable dimensions.</p>
	<p pid=".37.3/2">I agree with what the hon. Member for Worcester said in his comprehensive opening remarks. We have a very efficient and well run police authority. I, too, pay tribute to our new chief constable, Paul West, who is an outstanding chief officer; to chief superintendent Simon Adams, a truly excellent policeman whom the hon. Gentleman and I share as divisional commander; and to my local district inspector, Steve Booker, a first rate policeman who looks after Wychavon. We are very lucky in the officers that we have, but the problems are there and they are very real.</p>
	<p pid=".37.3/3">The hon. Gentleman gave some figures, but I do not think that he gave the following. If I am repeating the ones that he gave, I am sorry, but the point is that all our neighbouring police authorities receive more from Government than we do. Not surprisingly, the West Midlands&mdash;the biggest&mdash;receives &pound;150.01 per head of population; Gwent receives &pound;130.01; North Wales receives &pound;117.48; Cheshire receives &pound;109.76; Dyfed-Powys receives &pound;105.09; Staffordshire receives &pound;104.27; Gloucestershire receives &pound;103.88; Warwickshire receives &pound;97.07; and poor old West Mercia at the bottom receives &pound;92.24, which is by far the lowest&mdash;the ring in the middle of the doughnut. Even dragging us up to Warwickshire's apparently low level would give us an extra &pound;5 million in central Government grant. By my calculation&mdash;which differs slightly from that of the hon. Gentleman&mdash;bringing us up to the average for most similar forces, which is probably the best measure to use, would give us an extra &pound;6.83 million. That would be a significant bonus.</p>
	<p pid=".37.3/4">Nationally, police authorities are saying, &quot;Please can we have a 5.4 per cent. to 5.5 per cent. grant increase this year?&quot; I would ask for that on behalf of West Mercia, too. The Government are talking about increasing grants to public authorities in line with inflation. Governments have always done that; this Government are doing it and the previous Government did it. The trouble is, however, that such grants are largely grants to pay salaries and pensions, and salaries and pensions go up by more than inflation. The figure that the Government should use as the measure by which they increase grants is the increase in average wages, because it would be fairer. The problem of police pensions, rightly highlighted by the hon. Member for Worcester, compounds the problem. I share his plea to keep the floors and the ceilings. They are crucial to resolving this problem and their removal would be devastating for West Mercia constabulary.</p>
	<p pid=".37.3/5">I want to make the point about neighbours again. The hon. Gentleman rightly talked about area cost adjustment. It is iniquitous that we do not receive that adjustment. When I canvass and knock on doors in my constituency, I am amazed by the number of West Midlands police officers whom I find living in Droitwich. The West Midlands, which gets area cost adjustment for the extra cost of recruiting and paying officers, gets that money and then takes them from the West Mercia area. I always love meeting police officers, but it always galls me to think that such a police officer is judged by the Government to be worth more than a similar officer living next door but working for a different police authority.</p>

	<p pid=".38.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman know that in my part of Herefordshire, wonderfully commanded by Kevin Bentley, the divisional commander, we have officers working for Gloucestershire constabulary? It is not only Warwickshire and the West Midlands that receive the adjustment but Gloucestershire and Cheshire. Once again, when compared with our neighbours we are being badly treated.</p>

	<p pid=".38.1/1">It is a delight to agree with the hon. Gentleman. He is absolutely right, and there is no justification for maintaining that discrimination when all the other forces around us are getting so much more.</p>
	<p pid=".38.1/2">My figures for the amount we would receive at Gloucestershire's level of area cost adjustment are the same as those of the hon. Member for Worcester&mdash;about another &pound;1.7 million, which would make a big difference. I have received encouraging reassurances from the Minister about the rural sparsity grant. It is an important grant, which we must maintain.</p>
	<p pid=".38.1/3">Pensions lie at the heart of the difficulty. Perhaps the Minister will say something in her winding-up speech about the Government's overall plans for police pensions. West Mercia does not face a unique problem; it is shared across the whole country. It is a difficult nettle to grasp, but unless it is grasped soon, it threatens to undermine the whole system of police funding for the foreseeable future. The issue is important not just in West Mercia but across the country.</p>
	<p pid=".38.1/4">I am sceptical, in the best sense of the word, about community support officers. I would rather have real police officers than two-thirds police officers. My chief constable is working firmly, clearly and authoritatively to persuade me that I am wrong. He may yet persuade me; I am not yet there.</p>

	<p pid=".39.0/1">May I put this right? They are not substitutes, proxies or semi-police officers. They are what they say they are: community support officers. They play a crucial role in the community. As I said earlier, we have 21, with more to come, in Telford and Wrekin. They have been widely welcomed, not only when they were introduced but ever since, for the presence and reassurance they provide and for the work that they do to address low-level crime, which has such a high-level impact on community life.</p>

	<p pid=".39.1/1">I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. It is a point of view; it is not one that I happen to share. I would rather have real, fully-fledged police officers with all the powers available to them. I will not get into a debate about community support officers now; we are talking about West Mercia.</p>
	<p pid=".39.1/2">However, given that we have such people and that the Government want them to exist in greater numbers, I want us to have a reasonable whack of them. I have written in support of the bid from the West Mercia constabulary for additional community support officers. How much better would it be if we were offered extra police officers instead?</p>

	<p pid=".39.2/1">There is an important point here. Our main beef is the unfairness of the current system and the way in which central funds are distributed. Does my hon.

	<p pid=".40.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is being most generous, as he always is. The chief constable has made it clear to me and to other Members in meetings that CSOs count as civilian staff in the West Mercia force calculations.

There is no hidden bureaucracy in terms of civilianisation&mdash;they are counted in that way.</p>

	<p pid=".40.3/1">I did not suggest that there was, and if the hon. Gentleman thought that I did, that was quite wrong. Those people are obviously low-level police officers, although they may count as civilians, but I would rather have a fully-fledged policeman or woman. I would rather pay a little extra and get somebody fully qualified, with all the powers of arrest and detention that these people ought to have. This is a separate debate, but if there are extra policing resources, whatever shape they take, we want our fair share. <i>[Laughter.] </i>I am sorry if hon. Members find that amusing, but I think that they would find it equally amusing if I backed a bid for community support officers without making it clear that I would rather we did not have them. I would rather have police officers.</p>

	<p pid=".40.5/2">We have had a welcome increase in police officers over recent years, but that has been paid for by council tax payers. There is a limit to what the council tax payer can bear. In my judgment, we have the absolute minimum level of policing in West Mercia. It is true that we live in a relatively low-crime area. There has apparently been some success, although detection rates could improve.</p>
	<p pid=".40.5/3">A stack of crimes goes on in Wychavon, which I know about, and which the police tell me that they do not have the resources to police. They range from fly tipping to immigration to driving offences related to illegal gangmaster activity. If we had the resources, we could deal with those offences. We need more police officers, and I do not think that the council tax payer should have to pay for them. It is about time that Government&mdash;not this Government, but Government in general&mdash;gave Worcestershire the fair deal that it has lacked for so long.</p>

	<p pid=".40.6/2">This is a vital issue for the whole of West Mercia. I want to remind the Minister, who does not come from particularly nearby, what West Mercia is. The name derives from the Welsh marches, so we are men of the marches. In Bewdley in my constituency, there is even still an area called Catchem's End, which is just the English side of the River Severn. We believe that that was the last place where the Welsh could be caught on their way back to Wales. Or was it the last place where they could catch the English on the way back to England?</p>

	<p pid=".41.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman very much for that intervention. I wonder whether he also knows that the Mercians invaded Wessex and Northumbria and almost took Bamburgh castle. However, we are not campaigning in that sort of way. All that we want, as has been said by so many hon. Members, is absolute fairness across the board, so that the West Mercia police can have the same crack of the whip as other like authorities. I shall not go into the figures; I shall be just a little parochial, as was the hon. Member for Worcester, and mention some improvements that have happened in my local patch.</p>
	<p pid=".41.1/2">The 300-officer increase across the area has been of tremendous benefit. Although people still do not see as many police officers around as they would like to, they are beginning to see more than they did. The police are able to enforce an alcohol-free zone, and to do more about antisocial behaviour. However, people still complain to me about the lack of police presence.</p>
	<p pid=".41.1/3">The limitation on the way in which the police can tackle the drug problem is alarming. I have driven around the constituency with policemen and they have shown me the light on outside a house that means that the drug dealer is in there and is ready to deal, but they cannot tackle him under those circumstances. The problem of pensions has been mentioned, as has that of custody facilities. I believe that there is one facility in West Mercia&mdash;not in my patch&mdash;that is full by 2 pm on a Saturday. Call handling is improving, but needs to do so more, and more help is needed to counter antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".41.1/4">I acknowledge that we get a rural sparsity grant, and reinforce the comments that have been made: we must keep it. West Mercia is a slightly odd selection in that it is largely rural but has some fairly big cities and many moderate-sized market towns. It is a difficult area to police. I do not quite understand the floors and the ceilings, but I take the point that they are essential for us, so they must be kept.</p>
	<p pid=".41.1/5">Historically, West Mercia is a low-cost and highly efficient authority, as has been confirmed by Her Majesty's inspectorate. It provides good value for money. It has more than achieved efficiency savings in the past few years; the authority actually put in a restrained precept last year. It is almost another example of an authority being penalised for efficiency and economy. There is also an understandable local feeling that if the economies had not been made and the precept had not been restrained, we probably would not have suffered so much.</p>
	<p pid=".41.1/6">To conclude, we must maintain the sparsity grant and the floors. Area cost adjustment should be considered, as it is in so many other instances in which the counties are disadvantaged. I disagree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1058" name="Peter Luff">the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff)</phrase> about community support officers. They are uniformed bodies who are very obvious around the place. As they count as civilian staff, they are a tremendous addition. They certainly do a very good job in my area, and I ask for support for the bid for the extra 40 CSOs.</p>
	<p pid=".41.1/7">West Mercia has a very high number of civilian staff, which does release the uniformed officers. I praise it for that. The crucial problem, however, is that the Government grant per head is one of the lowest, so the proportion paid by local taxpayers is much higher than the average. Policing is such an important issue for the Government that I long to hear whether the Minister will address our problems in West Mercia.</p>

	<p pid=".42.0/1">When I was elected in 2001, I calculated that I probably represented one of the least policed areas of the country. At that time, before the increase, West Mercia had the second lowest number of police per head of population in the country. My constituency of 63,000 electors had only 63 police officers, which was about half the average for West Mercia. I am delighted to say that when West Mercia decided two years ago to raise council tax by 33 per cent. in order to recruit an extra 300 officers&mdash;a decision that I fully supported&mdash;my constituency gained 22 extra officers. That increase of a third was thanks not to Government funding but to a local decision bravely taken by the chief constable and the police authority. I believe that that decision had the support of every Member to whom I have ever spoken, which might put into perspective for the Minister just how far down the scale West Mercia is when it comes to police numbers. London has something like seven times as many police officers per head of population as my constituency does. Admittedly, we are a low-crime area, but we still need policing. Given shift systems and the like, it does not take a genius to work out that not many police officers are on duty in my area at any one time.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/2">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/896" name="Michael Foster">the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster)</phrase> clearly said&mdash;I am delighted to congratulate him on securing this very timely debate, and congratulate other Members who have spoken&mdash;the basic problem is that the grant for West Mercia is much lower than for almost any other police authority, including the comparators. That is the basic root of the problem. However, several other issues have compounded it, some of which I shall discuss. Of particular concern is the way in which West Mercia ended up being nominated for next year, which caught even the Home Office by surprise.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/3">We have heard that even a standstill for next year might need a 9.8 per cent. council tax rise because of the effects that have been discussed. This would clearly put West Mercia in line to be nominated or capped next year as well, which is of considerable worry. As we have heard, the force needs to address some very important matters, particularly in relation to custody suites, or cells as most of the public call them&mdash;&quot;custody suites&quot; is a very modern term. There are no custody suites in my constituency at the moment. The force has had to close them, quite rightly, because of modern requirements for handling prisoners.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/4">If someone is arrested in Ludlow, the nearest custody suite is Shrewsbury. It takes two police officers 50 minutes to drive that person to the custody suite, log them in and do all the necessary work. It takes two officers away for several hours&mdash;I have already said how few officers there are in my constituency&mdash;just to take an offender to the custody suite. There are plans to install a new custody suite at Leominster in Herefordshire&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1318" name="Bill Wiggin">The hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Wiggin)</phrase> does not appear to be here. Leominster is just down the A49 and about 10 to 15 minutes from Ludlow, which would make a significant difference to the number of police who can be active in my constituency. They can be back in the area much quicker if they need to make arrests. However, that custody suite is not in next year's funding proposals for a 5.5 per cent. increase and a possible 9.8 per cent. rise in council tax, about which we have heard. Things that are very necessary will not happen as a result.</p>

When the Minister for Local and Regional Government met the police authority to discuss the matter, I understand that one of the factors that he took into account was the fact that complaints had been made about the size of the rise. I believe that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister received one complaint about the size of the rise&mdash;from just one person&mdash;yet that one complaint seemed significant to the Minister for Local and Regional Government.</p>
	<p pid=".43.3/3">There is a problem with the Government's tactics. They announced that there would be potential capping to keep authorities' spending down; then, to ensure that council tax was kept low, the Chancellor gave extra money to local authorities. That money pulled them all down a couple of percentage points. However, the money went only to local councils; it did not go to police authorities. That fact was missed by the ODPM, which went ahead with the capping without realising that it would not help the police authorities&mdash;which it clearly cannot do, because it comes from a different funding pot.</p>
	<p pid=".43.3/4">I am concerned that exactly the same will happen next year. If West Mercia has to look for a 9.8 per cent. rise in council tax, it will be told that it must be kept down. Ministers from the ODPM have already made it clear that it should be lower this year than last, and I am sure that they will hammer it down. I am also sure that, just before the projected election next year, the Chancellor will hand over some cash to make council tax even lower. I can see it happening; but it will not affect police authorities if it is done then as it was done this year, and the police authorities could find themselves caught out.</p>
	<p pid=".43.3/5">I reiterate the plea that we heard earlier about area cost adjustment. I regularly canvass police officers in my constituency who work for West Midlands police. They freely admit that they prefer to live in Shropshire, although some experienced officers later come to work for West Mercia police. Those officers get the area cost adjustment for working in the West Midlands police area while living in the West Mercia area. It is clear that West Mercia should have an area cost adjustment. I hope also that the Minister will keep and increase the sparsity grant, which has not kept pace with inflation since its introduction. It was welcome then, but at best it is now in danger of stagnation. In time, that will further increase the problems for West Mercia.</p>
	<p pid=".43.3/6">Finally, we are debating the subject today because of a national political problem over council tax. West Mercia has been nominated for next year, but that is down to the fact that the Government have become very nervous about the level of council tax. Until they get to grips with council tax, scrapping it and replacing it with something fairer that is based on the ability to pay, they will continue to have such problems and to deprive local forces of the ability to take their own decisions. I am sure that every Member backs the idea of local police authorities being able to take decisions for themselves about the number of police and how to pay for them, rather than being brought to heel, so to speak, by Ministers in London who act for national political reasons, without any judgment on the way those local forces are run.</p>

	<p pid=".44.2/1">I shall be extremely brief because many of the points have been made. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/896" name="Michael Foster">the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster)</phrase> on landing this debate, which is a matter of great interest to all our constituents, and on having assembled all the Members for Shropshire for the first time since <i>Shropshire Life</i> got us together on the green. I also congratulate him on excluding <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1143" name="Lembit pik">the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase>, who muscled in on the photograph.</p>
	<p pid=".44.2/2">In connection with such matters of great <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1275" name="Richard Taylor">historical note, I remind the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> that one of the kings of Mercia, who was obviously of the soft left, made it policy to chop off the hand of any Welshman caught the wrong side of Offa's dyke. However, his successor, who perhaps came from the middle way, chopped their heads off.</p>
	<p pid=".44.2/3">We have heard a lot of figures and the hon. Member for Worcester clearly elucidated the situation. The brutal figure for West Mercia is &pound;92.24 but in the case of North Wales police&mdash;at the bottom of the hill where I live&mdash;every resident receives &pound;117.48. That is a brutal, simple fact. We are not complaining about the global sum of money, but about the unfairness of the distribution system, which goes back to before the Government came to power, to the advanced ideas of West Mercia about civilianising&mdash;a ghastly piece of jargon&mdash;which basically meant replacing police officers answering telephones with civilians. Of the 4,000 staff, 2,600 are civilians and 1,400 are officers. West Mercia is being penalised for its advanced thinking from several years ago. Will the Minister look at the situation?</p>

	<p pid=".45.0/1">The hon. Gentleman made what is, I am sure, an innocent mistake. The police officer complement, as I understand it, is 2,424, not 1,400, although there are 1,602 police staff. Well over 50 per cent. of those employed by West Mercia are actually police officers.</p>

	<p pid=".45.1/1">I am grateful for that contribution, but the figures I mentioned were those that I jotted down when I went with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1058" name="Peter Luff">my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff)</phrase>. I am sure that we can sort them out later but, regardless of which figures are right, my point is that West Mercia replaced police officers with civilians early on and is now being penalised because of the way the system has been built.</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/2">When I wrote to the Home Secretary, I received a kind response from the Minister of State that contained a paragraph that I should like her to elucidate. The letter said:</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/3" class="indent">&quot;You say that the West Mercia Constabulary is unfairly funded as their grant per head of population is different to neighbouring forces. We do not distribute funding on this basis. Grant varies between authorities with a range of socio-economic characteristics reflecting a range of relative policing needs. There are no objective grounds to suggest that West Mercia is unfairly funded&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/4">But to anyone paying council tax, &pound;92.24 as compared with &pound;117.48 is unfair. That bears down disproportionately on my poorest constituents, who are the ones who write to me about the global area of council tax. I take a middle way between <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/747" name="Peter Bradley">the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Peter Bradley)</phrase> and my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire.</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/5">I have had a lot of letters complaining about the global level of council tax, but which do not mention the precept especially, but it is worth pointing out that 300 extra officers were all funded by increases in council tax, and not from central Government. In the next line of the letter the Minister rather gives things away. She states:</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/6" class="indent">&quot;I recognise that formula changes implemented in 2003&ndash;04 did shift resources in favour of more urban areas.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/7">That, bluntly, means that there was a shift by central Government, which did not favour rural areas. The Minister must acknowledge that, so I ask her to reply with reference first to the civilianisation, which went ahead very early in West Mercia, and secondly, to the clear shift of central Government money from rural to urban areas.</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/8">I entirely endorse <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/922" name="Matthew Green">the comments made by the hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green)</phrase> on cells. The cells in Market Drayton and Oswestry were closed about five years ago, which caused considerable upset in the area. The people who were put in those cells were, frankly, what one would call low-tech cases. Nearly all of them were people who had had too much to drink. I entirely endorse the practice of taking more dangerous cases off to high-quality custody suites, but it is ridiculous that two policemen should be driving people around Shropshire in a van. In one case someone went from Oswestry to Shrewsbury to Telford and ended up in Worcester, which is nonsensical.</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/9">I should like the Minister to examine the health and safety regulations on cells. We have an excellent new chief constable, who is carrying out a review of the matter. I hope that the Minister will give him a helping hand, so that the cells can be reopened for the low-tech cases that I referred to.</p>

	<p pid=".46.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/896" name="Michael Foster">the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster)</phrase> on securing not only the debate but the support of hon. Members representing constituencies in Worcestershire, Shropshire and at least half of Herefordshire, and on achieving a degree of consensus about what is obviously an important local issue. I speak of a degree of consensus because it clearly frayed at the edges with the occasional difference of opinion and some forays into the subject of the heptarchy and its doings, which I am not sure are entirely relevant to the subject of the West Mercia police authority.</p>
	<p pid=".46.0/2">What clearly unites hon. Members from the part of England in question is the feeling that they are not being given a fair deal for their police authority, and that they want things to improve. They are right to bring that matter forward today, and I have a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu because I remember all too clearly similar debates about different parts of the country, taking place over years&mdash;not least when I was the chairman of a police authority in the era of capping, when there were no increases in police numbers, and when the Home Secretary was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/974" name="Michael Howard">the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase>. We remember, and recognise the difficulties.</p>
	<p pid=".46.0/3">Most hon. Members were astonished, after last year's capping announcement, to find that a police authority had apparently been plucked out of the air for the nomination. It is a great shame that there was not a separate debate on the police authorities in the context of the capping debate, because it would have been extremely useful to bring out some of the issues then in a way that the brief statement on local authorities and police authorities did not make possible.</p>
	<p pid=".46.0/4">When we study the position of West Mercia police authority, and the fact that it has been nominated, and consider what the hon. Member for Worcester said about the other local authorities in the area which were capped or nominated at the same time, we can draw only two reasonable conclusions. Either the people of West Mercia have collectively lost the use of their critical faculties with respect to their local authority members, or somehow the formula is wrong. Some hon. Members may doubt it, but I suspect that the latter is the case.</p>
	<p pid=".46.0/5">When I consider policing authorities across the country, I notice that we are also asked to believe that every police authority&mdash;they are not usually the most profligate authorities or the most cavalier in their use of public resources&mdash;has apparently in the past year taken leave of its senses and incorporated a substantial council tax increase. Indeed, the average increase for all 43 authorities was 11.7 per cent. We must either believe that police authorities as a class have taken leave of their senses, or that there may be something wrong with the Government formula for distributing grant and providing for local authorities. I think that the latter is the case.</p>
	<p pid=".46.0/6">I am not speaking as an advocate for West Mercia&mdash;my responsibilities lie elsewhere&mdash;but I have looked at the way in which it spends its money. Is it spending appropriately? Yes, as far as I can see. Is it using its resources well? Yes, as far as I can see, and as far as Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary, the Audit Commission and everyone else who has investigated can see. Is it spending, empirically, a high amount on policing? No, it is not. The fact that it is not is transparent from the figures that we have all been given. Is it following the Government's intentions? Yes it is: it is employing the extra police officers whom the Government boast of having employed. If one looks at the Government paper, &quot;Policing: building safer communities together&quot;, one can see the Minister smiling on the front page and boasting about the real achievements that continue to be made, such as the fact that the number of police officers has risen to an historic high. That is true, and I congratulate the Government on that, but she cannot will that end and not will the means by which to support it, which is what West Mercia has done by increasing its precept to pay for extra police officers.</p>
	<p pid=".46.0/7">If one looks at the figures for West Mercia&mdash;I have just done some back-of-the-envelope calculations based on those figures&mdash;one can see that the spending per head on policing is instructive, because it has risen substantially over the seven years of Labour Administration: it has gone from &pound;92.30 to &pound;133.31. That is an increase of just over &pound;41, or about 42 per cent. That is great. That is doing the job that the Government were elected to do, and which they promised to do. However, the Government spending for West Mercia over the same period has gone from &pound;76.74 per person to &pound;90.04. That is a rather more miserly increase of &pound;13.30, which is about 17 per cent. The contribution from council tax payers&mdash;here is the rub&mdash;has gone from &pound;15.56 in 1996&ndash;97 to &pound;43.27 last year. That is an increase of &pound;26.71, or 170 per cent. That is the difference: Government spending is up 17 per cent., while council tax payers' contributions are up 170 per cent.&mdash;a tenfold percentage increase. That is why people get upset.</p>
	<p pid=".46.0/8">I accept what hon. Members around the Chamber have said&mdash;that they have had very few letters criticising the police precept, because people generally want their money to be spent on policing. People do not see why they should spend extra money and not get anything to show for it: they are happy to pay to see extra officers on the street, but they are not happy to pay a council tax increase that is out of all proportion to the benefit that they derive from it. I must say that council tax increases often appear to be entirely arbitrary.</p>
	<p pid=".46.0/9">There is a deep, dark secret in this place, which is that the three major parties in this House agree to a large extent about what we want to happen with policing. There is a degree of consensus that would, were it to be known outside, entirely ruin the careers of some of our colleagues. We understand what is needed and we want extra police officers. Some hon. Members have reservations about community support officers. As far as I am concerned, they are a useful adjunct to, but not a replacement for, police officers&mdash;that is the view that we have always taken. We want to see investment for efficiency. We want police officers to be given tools that keep them on the streets rather than in police stations filling out forms. I think that we all agree on that.</p>
	<p pid=".46.0/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/922" name="Matthew Green">My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green)</phrase> and others spoke about custody suites. They are important because if a police officer has to travel to put an arrested person into custody, that is a huge disincentive to making an arrest. When arrests are made, police officers are effectively taken off the streets while they travel to the nearest custody suite, which can be a long way in rural areas.</p>

	<p pid=".48.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. Will he support the initiative to issue on-the-spot fines that the Government have had under trial? In cases of low-level crime such as those to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1153" name="Owen Paterson">the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase> referred, such fines would free up custody centres and would mean that time would not be spent conveying people who would otherwise be arrested from the scene of the crime to the custody suite or police station, and then further afield.</p>

	<p pid=".48.1/1">The answer to that question is yes, but with reservations. We have debated the initiative in statutory instrument Committees, and the Minister knows that I have strong reservations about its effectiveness when it comes to children over 10. We still need to see evidence that it is effective in reducing recidivism. Only if it does that is it effective. If a fine by means of a fixed penalty notice, rather than an arrest, does not deter someone from committing crime again, we must rethink. However, that obviously has a value in reducing police time. We are clear about that.</p>

	<p pid=".48.2/1">The point about on-the-spot fines, though, is that many of the people arrested and in custody suites on Friday and Saturday nights are drunk and disorderly, and they cannot be given an on-the-spot fine and be left on the streets to continue to be drunk and disorderly. One whole point of the police action is to take them away and put them in a cell, if only to recover from the state into which they have got themselves. Such offences are clearly not suitable for on-the-spot fines.</p>

	<p pid=".48.3/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. The biggest deterrent to crime is the expectation of being caught, which increases when people know that there are enough police officers to do the job. To have enough police officers, we have to have the budget to pay the police officers. That is the simple arithmetic of the matter.</p>
	<p pid=".48.3/2">There will be strains on any police authority budget. We know about the issues of wages and pensions. I was promised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1079" name="David Maclean">the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean)</phrase> when I went to see him in 1996&mdash;I remember this well&mdash;that by January there would be a solution to the police pensions problem, but that has never happened. It did not happen under the previous Conservative Government and it has not happened under this Government. We still have a huge difficulty with that.</p>
	<p pid=".48.3/3">We can have our arguments about our ideas for police reform. I should like to see a bolder move towards a national police force that takes away national functions and leaves chief constables to fight local crime effectively and concentrate on local issues. That is my party's view. I would also have a different system of financing, which might be better or worse. We could have a political debate on that, but it is not today's question. It would be right to have a relationship between local areas and the chief constable, for example through some form of minimum policing contracts&mdash;local contracts that provide for a minimum number of police. That is particularly important in rural areas that abut urban areas, where we so often see the rural police officer absorbed into the city environment to fight crime. That happens for perfectly understandable reasons, but the people in rural areas feel that they are deprived of their police cover.</p>
	<p pid=".48.3/4">All those are matters for debate, but our real concern today is that the problems are not just in West Mercia, although it has particular characteristics. It is a largely rural force; it does not have a large city; it suffers as a result of the formula; it is outside the area cost adjustment. I must say that I do not agree with simply extending the area cost adjustment to take in another police force area; the problem is the system, not the fact that it does not happen to cover the particular authority in question. More importantly, however, a huge problem is looming next year. We know that a gap is coming, we know what demands there will be on the Home Office's overall budget and we know that, at the moment, it cannot meet the demands of the police service. That is where the Minister needs to focus her attention. How do we close that &pound;350 million gap that the police authorities recognise, without laying off officers&mdash;a tragedy at a time when we are finally getting more officers on the streets&mdash;or the civilian staff who allow the police officers to do the job for which we pay them? That is the difficulty that the Government face, and I have not yet heard any sort of answer on it. Perhaps we will not hear that until the next Budget.</p>

	<p pid=".50.1/1">Mr. Deputy Speaker, I thought that my comment would probably provoke a response. I shall rapidly move on to the substance of my comments.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/2">Today's debate has highlighted the similarities between the problems of West Mercia and those of Thames Valley, which is the area that I represent. The clear connections between them identify a difference that the Government will need to deal with. West Mercia was set up in 1967 in exactly the same way as Thames Valley was set up. The areas were rural in the way that our grandfathers would have understood the term: deep countryside, market towns, county towns and very little else. Since that time, the population and infrastructure in areas such as West Mercia and Thames Valley have developed proportionately far more than in other areas of Britain, but, historically, expenditure on policing, particularly on police numbers, has not kept pace with that level of development.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/3">The hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members have identified particular complaints. The area that I represent, which is on the edge of London but not within London&mdash;without London or Birmingham weighting allowances&mdash;has all the things that highlight police areas that have problems. There are difficulties with recruitment and retention. Other police forces are more attractive, and the number of police per head of population is proportionately low. It is no surprise that Dyfed-Powys just over the border from West Mercia has the highest clear-up rate in the country, as it also has the highest rate in England and Wales of police per head of population.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/4">This is not rocket science. The problem that the hon. Gentleman identifies and that I hope the Minister will deal with&mdash;it is a non-partisan issue&mdash;is how to succeed in moving the civil servants at the Home Office into making police area assessments that are not 25 years behind the times. That is one of the key problems in policing areas such as West Mercia or my own area, Thames Valley.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/5">I was interested to hear the hon. Gentleman say that policing had been a success in the past 12 months. It is certainly true that crime rates have been coming down, but the overall position in respect of violent crime in West Mercia since 1998&ndash;99 is absolutely horrific, with a rise of 195 per cent. between 1998&ndash;99 and 2003&ndash;04. The rates may be coming down for the first time, but they are certainly not going down to the levels that existed before 1998&ndash;99, or before the Labour Government's election to office in 1997. It seems that that considerable challenge is not being met.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/6">Hon. Members, particularly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1058" name="Peter Luff">my hon. Friends the Members for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff)</phrase> and for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), have commented on the necessity for fairness in the allocation of money. I agree that the burden of the 300 extra police officers has been put entirely on the precept, and that that is an unsustainable and unattractive prospect. One only has to look at how the council tax police element has been treated since 1996&ndash;97 to see an all too familiar pattern of whacking rises, which were interrupted in 2000&ndash;01 to 2001&ndash;02 by the imminence of a general election, when cash was suddenly made available. The amount spent in those two years went up from &pound;74.06 to only &pound;78.50. That form of stop-go funding is dependent only on the extent to which the Government think that the electorate will punish them. In the long term, such funding is unsustainable. I wait to hear from the Minister how the Government intend to deal with those points.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/7">I conclude with the wider issue, which is whether we have enough police officers to do the job. I believe that the answer is clear from this debate. We do not. If we wish to move towards the forms of neighbourhood policing that have been successful in other countries in achieving reductions in crime, we will have to fund the necessary police officers to do the job.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/8">That is why my party carried out its study two years ago of what was required. It concluded that 40,000 extra police officers in England and Wales were required to achieve proper neighbourhood policing, that CSOs cannot be a substitute for that&mdash;even though I am sure they play a useful role&mdash;and that, if we want to achieve a reduction in crime, we will have to put the funding in.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/9">That is why we committed ourselves to increasing the police force by 40,000 officers. We intend to carry out that promise. It will take several years to achieve&mdash;officers cannot be recruited overnight&mdash;but we are deeply committed to the plan, because it is the only way in which the electorate in West Mercia, or anywhere else, will see a proper benefit from the money that they pay in tax in relation to the police.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/10">That is the challenge. I fear that the Minister will not be able to meet it. The truth of the matter is that the Home Secretary has been carpeted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer over the issue of expenditure on policing. He has failed to persuade the Prime Minister to back him up&mdash;indeed, the Prime Minister now seems to be rather supine in the face of the Chancellor. Real savings could be identified in the Home Office by grappling with issues such as immigration and asylum. Until all those things happen, the extra money for the real increase in police numbers that we need will not be available. In the meantime, it is the poor old council tax payer who will be required to pick up a burden that, frankly, going by the figures, is intolerable.</p>

	<p pid=".51.0/1">I will endeavour to deal with as many points raised by Members as I possibly can. This has been a lively and interesting debate and I want to congratulate, in particular, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/896" name="Michael Foster">my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster)</phrase> on obtaining the debate. I am sure that all of his colleagues would join me in that. I am delighted that, on the whole, Members have concentrated on the particular matter of West Mercia, on which there is a degree of cross-party concern. Later, I might come on to some of the more provocative comments made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/924" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase>, although I will try to restrict myself&mdash;tempted as I am&mdash;to concentrating on the issues that we are debating.</p>
	<p pid=".51.0/2">Like the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, I am not that familiar with the West Mercia area, although I had the recent pleasure of attending an extremely good event organised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1340" name="David Wright">my hon. Friends the Members for Telford (David Wright)</phrase> and for The Wrekin (Peter Bradley). We got together to discuss antisocial behaviour with local police officers, the local authority and local residents. I was hugely impressed by the commitment of all parties in that area, not just to tackling antisocial behaviour, but to dealing with residents' fear of crime. Certainly the feedback that I have received is that that is beginning to bear fruit. I am absolutely delighted that antisocial behaviour powers are increasingly being used and I congratulate my hon. Friends on taking the initiative in organising that event.</p>
	<p pid=".51.0/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester has done an excellent job in setting out the police authority's case and he has given us a great deal of factual information. However, I want to confirm to Members that the background to the position in West Mercia is that there has been significant extra investment in policing, both by the Government and indeed locally by council tax payers. The increases in police strength, community support officer numbers and police staff levels all reflect the increasing investment that local people wanted to see to provide more safety and more security in their communities. That is reflected nationally. We now have the largest number of police officers that we have ever had in this country: there are nearly 140,000 police officers, and together with 4,000 community support officers they provide that essential reassurance.</p>
	<p pid=".51.0/4">So although there will be issues about particular areas, levels of funding, the distribution of the grant and the way in which it is calculated, I ask all hon. Members to bear it in mind that those issues exist against the background of a significant investment in policing over the past few years. Every Member, as a constituency Member, will begin to notice that their constituents are telling them that, while they still want to see more police officers, they are beginning to see the difference on the ground, in their communities.</p>
	<p pid=".51.0/5">Clearly there is much more to be done. I am not for a moment complacent about our record. That is why we had the five-year strategic plan, why we shall issue a White Paper very soon and why we shall issue the next edition of the national policing plan. We shall continue to try to ensure that our police service is as efficient as it can be and that we get the best productivity out of the investment that we make.</p>
	<p pid=".51.0/6">I was disappointed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1058" name="Peter Luff">the contribution of the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff)</phrase>, who appeared simply to cleave to the past and to a traditional way of doing things. I say to him that, if we are to get the best value out of public investment in our public services&mdash;including investment in policing&mdash;we must be more creative about the way in which those services work. We must use science, technology and civilianisation and we must implement work force modernisation to free up police officers to work on the front line. I was disappointed by his statement, which I would characterise as an old-fashioned view of the world. I ask him to open up his horizons and to be a bit more creative.</p>

	<p pid=".53.0/1">The Minister has raised a provocative and important point. West Mercia constabulary has been at the forefront of innovation in policing. It was at the forefront of thinking outside the box and being modern and it is now being penalised for its pioneering approach. I am all in favour of being modern, but that must mean selectively modern. Modernity is not good for its own sake.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.53.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/737" speakername="Hazel Blears" colnum="53"  time="15:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h03.htm#41012h03_spnew48">
	<p pid=".53.1/1">I do not for a moment dispute West Mercia's excellent record as an efficient police authority. I was referring to the hon. Gentleman's personal views rather than to the performance of West Mercia, and was making a plea for him to be a bit more open-minded about the way in which public services in this country are conducted.</p>
	<p pid=".53.1/2">On the settlement for West Mercia last year, Members will know that we did our best to maximise the amount of police grant that was available. We got &pound;140 million from other Home Office budgets. So we were not terribly popular in the Home Office but we garnered as much as we could for the police general grant because we know that it is a top priority for the public. We then put an extra &pound;100 million from specific grants into the general grant and we decided&mdash;exceptionally&mdash;that we would have a standard rate of general grant increase of 3.25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".53.1/3">That decision benefited West Mercia. If we had implemented the funding formula in full, the force would have received a grant of &pound;106.4 million, but because of the floor of 3.25 per cent., it received &pound;107.7 million. It received &pound;1.3 million more because <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1153" name="Owen Paterson">the floor was there. The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase> referred to the letter that I sent him that showed that we had provided the floors and, therefore, that West Mercia had received slightly more funding than the formula would have given it. Although the formula has been changed and, if it were implemented, would shift resources towards urban areas that have greater needs for policing, so far it has not been implemented because we took the exceptional decision last year to provide the 3.25 per cent. flat-rate settlement that protected West Mercia.</p>
	<p pid=".53.1/4">Today I heard a plea that we should continue to have those floors so that West Mercia will be protected in future. We are keen to return to a position where we can have some floors and ceilings, but obviously I understand the plea from authorities that are in a similar position to West Mercia that they should not be unduly penalised as a result of the reintroduction of floors and ceilings.</p>
	<p pid=".53.1/5">Clearly, I am not in a position to go into detail today about this year's police settlement. I will make an announcement about that in November, but I hear the strong plea. It was one of the reasons why, last year, we made that flat-rate settlement rather than implementing the funding formula. Members will know that authorities such as my own lost money. Greater Manchester lost &pound;6 million. The West Midlands was &pound;26 million adrift and the Metropolitan police were &pound;54 million adrift. We are concerned that we use the flat-rate increase rather than floors and ceilings. I am sure that hon. Members will understand that other areas have difficulties as well.</p>
	<p pid=".53.1/6">This year, West Mercia was nominated on its budget increase. The reasons for that were that we were concerned to ensure that we had reasonable council tax increases. Concern was expressed, particularly by people on fixed incomes, about the level of council tax increases. Therefore, criteria were set around which people would either be nominated or designated on their budgets. We had had some large council tax increases in the preceding years and the measures that we took this year brought down the police precept from about 26 to 28 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04 to about 12 per cent. this year. The average total council tax increases were brought down to 5.9 per cent., compared with 12.9 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04. There was a need to exert that pressure on council tax, but I entirely understand why the three police authorities that found themselves on the wrong side of the criteria came in and made representations. I was present with my right hon. Friend from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Local and Regional Government, to hear them. West Mercia made a good case on the grounds of its efficiency and performance but unfortunately the criteria were set and there were no exceptional reasons to enable us to depart from the decision to nominate its budget in that case.</p>
	<p pid=".53.1/7">I cannot go into great detail about the settlement for next year, but we want to bring back the floors and ceilings if we can. We are working hard to maximise the amount we have for policing because we know that it is a top priority for the public. We have considered the information about the costs in the system from the Association of Police Authorities and from the Association of Chief Police Officers. I reject the phrase &quot;police inflation&quot;, but I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester about the committed costs for pay, pensions and increments. In drawing up the police settlement we are taking those costs into account as far as we can.</p>
	<p pid=".53.1/8">Inevitably, every organisation has fixed costs. I say to every police authority, including West Mercia, that they must consider different ways of carrying out their business in order to get as much productivity as they can out of the investment made so that they can meet their costs. I do not underestimate the challenges to the police authorities in doing that, but inevitably every organisation&mdash;public or private&mdash;must try to face up to such costs.</p>

	<p pid=".54.1/1">I am not going to give way as I have only four minutes in which to address the issues raised.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/2">Hon. Members raised the issue of the rural sparsity grant, and I am happy to confirm that it will remain in its present form for next year and there will be no change to the formula that underpins it. The rural fund will not be increased in line with inflation. The decision was made that, where there are any extra funds, we want to put them into the general police grant that can be spent at the discretion of forces. We are constantly under pressure to give people local discretion, but the main fund will recognise the particular pressures in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/3">I am delighted to tell hon. Members that this Government are making progress on police pensions. Unlike previous Governments we issued a consultation document, which came out in December 2003, and we have proposed a system whereby employers' and employees' contributions will go into a fund, pensions will be paid out of it and a central Government top-up will smooth out the volatility in the current system, which has been a real difficulty for police authorities. When there is a spike of people retiring, it is quite difficult to meet those pressures. Police authorities know when people are due to retire, so there should be an element of forward planning, but the system will be much better with a central fund whereby Government take the volatility and uncertainty out of the system. We hope to proceed in that manner. I hope that hon. Members acknowledge that, if achieved, that will be a significant step forward.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/4">My hon. Friends the Members for Worcester, for Telford and for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1275" name="Richard Taylor">The Wrekin, together with the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase>, have pressed me on the application for additional CSOs. I am delighted that Members feel CSOs are making a significant contribution. They patrol for 70 per cent. of their time, and that is why they are different from police officers. They are not extracted to go to court and give evidence and they are not taken off to do other jobs; they are there to reassure the public, and that is why they are such a vital part of our police service. The comments of the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire about their not being real police officers or being two-thirds of a police officer are very derogatory. I believe that they provide a good service.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/5">I have heard the pleas of my hon. Friends, and I will be looking closely and carefully at the submission from West Mercia for extra CSOs. I have applications from across the country, but I will bear in mind the points made forcefully by hon. Friends.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/6">I was delighted that the hon. Member for Wyre Forest acknowledged the complexity of floors and ceilings. His contribution was very refreshing. The contributions made about the possibility of shooting Welsh people in Hereford sounded to me like terribly antisocial behaviour, and I have no doubt that steps will be taken with regard to that.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/7">I am delighted to have had the opportunity to respond to all hon. Members' concerns. I see how important policing is to their local communities, and I am glad that they have taken the time and effort to attend and make representations. All I can confirm to them is that I shall bear in mind everything that they have said this afternoon when making decisions about the police settlement, and I am sure that we shall have the pleasure of debating the subject in future.</p>

	Woodlands (Article 4 Directives)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.56.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/873" speakername="Huw Edwards" colnum="56"  time="15:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h04.htm#41012h04_spnew0">
	<p pid=".56.1/1">I was intrigued by the Minister's comment about Welsh people near the end of her speech. I wonder what comments were made against Welsh people during the previous debate.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/2">It is a privilege to raise an issue that affects not only Wales but parts of England: the sale of woodlands and the use of article 4 directives. The matter was drawn to my attention by two constituents, Mr. Bill Butler and Colonel Brian Ruddy, who attended my surgery in Monmouth a few months ago. Their concern was to protect woodlands in their local area&mdash;Catbrook in my constituency&mdash;but from the diligent research that they have undertaken it is clear that the campaign that they have successfully started has nationwide implications, which is why I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise the matter.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/3">In 1999, I secured a debate on a similar subject, concerning the sale of large-scale woodlands in Chepstow Park wood in my constituency. Following that debate, there was a successful resolution of that issue. The main aim of my contribution today is to highlight the environmental impact that the subdivision and sale of woodland can have, particularly in areas of outstanding natural beauty, and the selling practices of companies such as Woodland Investment Ltd.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/4">I would like the subdivision and sale of woodlands to be included in the Government's current consultation on the subdivision and sale of agricultural land, and to ensure that the planning process in England and Wales is responsive to the subdivision and sale of woodlands through the use of article 4 directives and sections 84 and 85 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which gives special protection to areas of outstanding natural beauty.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/5">I hope that guidance similar to that which has been given to local authorities in England&mdash;to the credit of the Minister's Department&mdash;will be given by the National Assembly for Wales to local authorities in Wales. One my main aims is to urge the Forestry Commission to consider seriously the disposal of forestry and woodland areas and to ensure that they are not sold to companies such as Woodland Investment Ltd., which are likely to subdivide and to sell them off in small plots.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/6">Mr. Bill Butler and Colonel Brian Ruddy drew my attention to a potential threat to local woodlands in Catbrook, a lovely village in the Wye valley area of outstanding natural beauty. Their concern arose from the siting of signs stating &quot;Woodlands for Sale&quot; in what is known locally as Ninewells wood. These signs are commonly found on roadsides throughout England and Wales. I was intrigued by a similar sign that appeared beside the A40 just north of Monmouth relating to woodland known as Hayes Coppice on the border of my constituency and that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1013" name="Paul Keetch">the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch)</phrase>, with whom I have discussed the matter.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/7">Those &quot;Woodlands for Sale&quot; signs have been erected by Woodland Investment Ltd. It advertises small plots of woodland for sale through the internet. It is believed that potential buyers are urged to own a piece of Britain's beautiful countryside and advised that they can use the wood for a variety of purposes such as holding family reunions or the siting of caravans. In planning terms, those activities would require a change of use from agricultural forestry to recreation. However potential buyers are not informed of that. One of the main purposes of the debate is to highlight the need for a potential change of use, and the directives that local authorities should give in such cases.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/8">The woodlands in Catbrook had been subject to a local dispute. Local residents sought to purchase a 25-acre wood. Unfortunately, they lost out in an auction and the company that bought it subsequently sold it on to Woodland Investment Ltd. The company established a new entrance to the wood and constructed a hard-standing area. The question is whether it needed planning permission to do that. I understand that Monmouthshire county council is deciding whether to take enforcement action. Purple marks on trees were evident and contractors informed local residents that the wood was to be sold off in small plots.I ask the Minister and his advisers to be good enough to look at the website of the company&mdash;<a href="http://www.woodlands.co.uk">www.woodlands.co.uk</a>&mdash;and to consider whether the advice that it gives requires the Government and the Welsh Assembly to update the planning system, so that it can respond to this new, internet-type sale. We had a public meeting in Catbrook village hall, which was well attended. One of the contributors to that meeting was my predecessor, Mr. Roger Evans, whose expertise in planning law I acknowledge. He had advised us all to ask the local authority, Monmouthshire county council, to apply article 4 directives to save that wood and other woods in my constituency in which similar signs are going up, and which are being advertised for sale on the internet. There are woods in the Cross Ash area and in Hayes Coppice, just north of Monmouth.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/9">On the woodlands.co.uk website, the question is asked,</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/10" class="indent">&quot;What sort of things can I do with my woodland?&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/11">The answer is quite intriguing:</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/12" class="indent">&quot;You can walk, climb, make camp fires, study wildlife or work with wood. You can camp there and have family reunions, christenings and bonfire night parties. With your own wood you can do things that aren't possible in 'public woods'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/13">I wonder what that is a reference to.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/14" class="indent">&quot;For many woodland owners there is the satisfaction of owning a small piece of the British countryside and being able to manage it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/15">I do not think that anybody would question that as an objective. However, it is the non-forestry, non-woodland functions that most concern my constituents.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/16" class="indent">&quot;Potential buyers are advised that they are not able to build a house on the woodland&mdash;but you can build for forestry purposes&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/17">For example, one could erect</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/18" class="indent">&quot;a steel shipping container as a shed that could be used if you were to engage in forestry work.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/19">It is said that</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/20" class="indent">&quot;These are very secure and surprisingly cheap (under &pound;1,000 for 1690 sq feet). This has the advantage that they can be installed quickly and moved within the wood . . . should the planners object to the siting, they can be relocated.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/21">My constituents are rather horrified at the idea that local woods could be subdivided into small plots, with shipping containers located willy-nilly throughout them in case people want to engage in woodland work, with the proviso that they had better move on should the planners try to catch up with them. Another question that is asked is,</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/22" class="indent">&quot;Can I park a caravan?&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/23">to which the answer is:</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/24" class="indent">&quot;The 28 day planning rule means that you can park a caravan in your wood and use it for 28 days in the year. Many people leave a caravan in their woodland for longer but this can only be done if there are no objections from neighbours. A white caravan in a wood does &quot;shout&quot; so it is sensible to paint caravans in dark green or brown.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/25">Again, that idea causes great concern to my constituents. As well as P and O shipping containers, we are to have caravans painted in brown or green dotted around the woodlands of the Wye valley.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/26">A number of issues arise from the marketing and sales practices of Woodland Investment Ltd. Woodland sites are often subdivided and then given new names, so we see advertised on the website woods that have unrecognisable names. They do not appear on the Ordnance Survey map. They are a creation of the marketing of the company.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/27">The price of woodland sold in sub-plots through the internet is often considerably higher than the price that one might pay at auction. Ninewells wood is being advertised for sale at &pound;4,000 per acre, compared with a maximum auction price of about &pound;2,000. There is also a clear effort to minimise the planning limitations and the permitted development rights associated with using small woodland sites for such activities as family reunions, the parking of caravans and steel containers, and the dangerous practice of having bonfire parties.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/28">There have been serious fires in the Wye valley in recent years and the fire service faces major problems in combating forest fires. When we hear of forest fires, we think it inconceivable that the planning system permitted people to buy small woodlands and to have bonfire night parties. It would be an irresponsible policy to condone. Potential purchasers might also have unrealistic expectations of the viability of harvesting the wood from small sub-plots.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/29">My constituents respect the wish of people to own a bit of woodland to engage in small-scale forestry. However, they are seriously concerned about the sale of woodland for non-forestry purposes. That matter has been stressed to me in correspondence from the Woodland Trust, which encourages people to invest in small woodland sites, but does not accept the principle that they should be used for non-forestry work.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/30">There has been a history in England of the subdivision and sale of agricultural land. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/986" name="Alan Hurst">My hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Hurst)</phrase> and the hon. Members for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) and for Wealden (Charles Hendry) have raised the matter in the House. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning issued a written statement on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-19">19 April</phrase> that acknowledged the problems associated with the subdivision and sale of agricultural land, with the erection of caravans and access to roads, and concern about the buyers of small lots being misled into believing that they could do more with the plot than would normally be allowed under the planning system. The same concerns about the subdivision and sale of agricultural land apply to the subdivision and sale of woodland.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/31">The consultation that the Government have undertaken should be extended to cover woodlands. In answer to a written parliamentary question, my right hon. Friend stated that no concern had been expressed about the subdivision and sale of woodland. That is why I submitted to him the letters to Monmouthshire county council and to me from constituents expressing concern about the subdivision and sale of woodland.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/32">We believe that we may have been the first to identify the threat to woodlands as a result of that practice. I fully acknowledge those hon. Members who have identified the threat, especially from a company called Gladwish Land Sales, from the subdivision and sale of agricultural land in England.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/33">According to Mr. Brown, one of my constituents who lives by Ninewells wood:</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/34" class="indent">&quot;The local environment is rich with wildlife, flora and fauna, some of which are very rare species. The wood is a breeding site for the nightjar&mdash;an internationally endangered species . . . the wood should be harvested and then allowed to return to natural ancient woodlands.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/35">He and his neighbours care deeply about the local wood. They hoped to purchase it in order to protect it, but they lost out.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/36">Mrs. Heidi Broughton, the agent of Woodland Investment Ltd., has been particularly offensive to Mr. Brown and his wife. She said that, if they were to cause any more trouble, the company would bring in the travellers. The company has already established a hard-standing area and a gateway to the woods, which we believe was done without planning permission and is contrary to planning regulations. Such threats are highly irresponsible, and I hope that Woodland Investment Ltd. will apologise to my constituents and withdraw the threat unequivocally.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/37">It is essential to stress that the environment will be threatened if local woods are split up. There is a threat to biodiversity from the siting of caravans and the holding of family reunions and bonfire parties. The planning response in England has been to apply article 4 directives. Those relate to article 4 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, which gives planning authorities the power to override permitted development rights. Wealden district council has applied article 4 directives. Several sites in the Wealden district council area are within an area of outstanding natural beauty. Charnwood district council in Hertfordshire has also applied article 4 directives. My constituents and I have urged Monmouthshire county council to apply article 4 directives to all the potential sites in Monmouthshire in the Wye valley area of outstanding natural beauty.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/38">The advice given by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to local authorities acknowledges the problems, and states that local authorities should act swiftly and pre-emptively. It gives advice on the measures in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 to speed up enforcement action following a breach of planning control, and to enable a planning authority to issue a temporary stop notice when a breach of planning control is first identified without having to serve an enforcement notice .</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/39">I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to talk to his colleagues, the Ministers in the National Assembly for Wales, to ensure that similar guidance is given to local authorities in Wales. Carwyn Jones, the Minister, stated that the position is being monitored in Wales. I hope that one outcome of today's debate is that more pressure will be put on the National Assembly for Wales to recognise the potential threat that those practices pose throughout Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/40">Furthermore, it should be acknowledged that local authorities must be more informed of their duty under sections 84 and 85 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. I had the privilege of serving on the Committee that dealt with that legislation and participated in the debates. That Act requires positive and effective action to be taken by the Government and local authorities to protect areas of outstanding natural beauty. Section 84 states that local planning authorities have the power to</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/41" class="indent">&quot;take all such action as appears to them expedient for the accomplishment of the purpose of conserving and enhancing the natural beauty of the area of outstanding natural beauty or so much of it as is included in their area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/42">Section 85 requires Ministers of the Crown, public bodies, statutory undertakers and any persons holding public office to</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/43" class="indent">&quot;have regard to the purpose of conserving and enhancing the natural beauty of the area of outstanding natural beauty.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/44">In the inventory maintained by the Countryside Council for Wales, Ninewells wood is classified as semi-natural ancient woodland. The purpose of the AONB classification is to protect and to enhance the natural beauty and amenity of the Wye valley, including its physical, ecological and cultural landscape, and to promote the quiet, informal enjoyment of the Wye valley by the general public, but only so far as it is consistent with the first objective. I contend that local authorities, including Monmouthshire county council, need to mindful of the overriding duty to protect AONBs.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/45">The Forestry Commission and I have been in correspondence about the matter. It has recently come to light that the commission is intent on disposing of a number of woodlands that do not deliver a significant public benefit. The sale of woodlands in Wales is expected to raise about &pound;1.8 million. I am concerned that the commission could sell to companies such as Woodland Investment Ltd, which may then subdivide those sites and dispose of them separately. I would not have thought that it was within the raison d'&ecirc;tre of the Forestry Commission to allow woodlands to be degraded as the result of inappropriate activities on woodland sites. My hon. Friend the Minister and his ministerial colleagues in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Welsh National Assembly should consider the implications.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/46">I urge the Minister to consider the main policy objectives that I identified at the outset. They are to consider the environmental impact of the sale and subdivision of woodland, especially in AONBs; and to include the subdivision and sale of woodlands in the Government's consultation on the subdivision and sale of agricultural land. Although woodlands are fundamentally different, there are similarities, but it would take much longer for woodland to recover should there be any degradation as a result of subdivision and sale. The other objective is to ensure that the planning processes in England and Wales are responsive to subdivision, through the use of article 4 directives and sections 84 and 85 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/47">Following my Adjournment debate on the proposed sale of Chepstow Park wood in 1999, Forestry Commission policy was changed, and the wood was saved from development as a holiday village complex. I am grateful to those of my constituents who attended the public meeting, who have written to me on the subject and who are in London today. I am especially grateful to Brian Ruddy and Bill Butler for their diligent research in identifying the implications of the subdivision and sale of woodlands. The issue affects not only my constituency, but has implications for the whole country. I will do the best I can, using the facilities that Parliament gives me, to protect the beautiful woodlands of the Wye valley. I hope that, in his response, the Minister will offer some reassurance.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.61.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/800" speakername="Paul Clark" colnum="61"  time="15:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h04.htm#41012h04_spnew1">
	<p pid=".61.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/873" name="Huw Edwards">my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards)</phrase> on securing this debate and on putting so succinctly the issues that have arisen in his constituency. As he rightly said, the future protection of our woodlands is relevant not only to his constituency but to the entire country. He has also drawn attention to the sensitivity of woods and forests. His constituents complained about the possible threats to the amenity of woodland. Those threats include shipping containers used for storage and the penetration of woodland by cars and caravans. I take the point that such actions can damage existing trees and the tree root system, and can be intrusive and unsympathetic to the landscape.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/2">I have read very closely the Ninewells conservation group's report on the area to which my hon. Friend referred. I congratulate the chairman and the secretary of that organisation and others involved on presenting an informative document for consideration by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and for today's debate. We recognise the concerns. We rely on vigilant local communities and amenity groups, as well as on local authority and Government agencies, to defend the safety and continuity of our attractive woodland, wherever it is.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/3">My hon. Friend referred to the statement on agricultural land in April by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning, in which he said that farmland was being sub-divided into small plots for sale over the internet and explained why that was bad news for the appearance of the countryside, a matter to which I shall refer later.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/4">My hon. Friend has done a great service in raising the profile of this issue. When my right hon. Friend the Minister made his statement, the significance of splitting sites into plots was particularly relevant to agricultural land. At the moment, agricultural land is of more concern in England than woodland. Although the Secretary of State has considered several requests to approve article 4 directives involving woodland, especially in the south-east and the west midlands, the sub-division of woods does not yet appear to be the large-scale problem that it is for former fields and meadows. Having said that, the issues facing planners are the same, regardless of whether farmland or woodland is being sub-divided&mdash;a point that my hon. Friend made.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/5">Woodland is a precious rural asset. Its landscape, wildlife and forest products are of benefit to everyone, even where there is no particular public access to a given wooded area. Insensitive and unauthorised activities can lead to an unwelcome change in the appearance of woodland.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/6">Woodland, too, could suffer neglect, especially if plots are bought as a long-term investment in which there is little commercial incentive to maintain the trees properly. The Minister for Housing and Planning spelled that out in his statement when he explained how the appearance of the countryside could change. As with farmland, plot sales of woodland might create fear in those who live nearby that development is inevitable. I certainly picked up on that concern when reading submissions from my hon. Friend's constituents to him and to the county council.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/7">I take this opportunity to outline some of the relevant parts of the law governing the use of forest land and to provide clarification. Hon. Members will be aware that the key concept&mdash;the trigger for planning control&mdash;is whether something is development. That is the nub of the issue. Some types of activity do not amount to development unless they are so frequent that they have an impact on the local amenity and bring about an unauthorised change of use. The following examples&mdash;my hon. Friend referred to some of them&mdash;are not usually seen as development: brief events such as a bonfire or an outdoor party, picnics, barbecues, family gatherings, even the parking of a car, do not amount to development. Other activities that are normally deemed to be development and which therefore fall under planning controls include, for example, the erection of buildings, fencing an area and the creation of access roads. However, there is a third category, to which my hon. Friend has alluded. Some development is given a permitted development right&mdash;a general planning permission that removes the need to make a planning application.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/8">In the context of woodland, several of those rights could be relevant. The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 allows for the stationing of caravans, camping, works necessary for the purposes of forestry, and the staging of events on no more than 28 days&mdash;in some cases, 14 days&mdash;unless the land is a site of special scientific interest. I note that the area to which my hon. Friend refers adjoins the SSSI site of Cleddon Bog. The fact that, although it is not itself a SSSI, it adjoins one, might be relevant to a planning application, but that is a matter for the local authority.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/9">As for shipping containers, bearing in mind what might happen with regard to planning applications and enforcement action, I do not want to speculate about any particular plot sale advertisement and the suggestions made in it. However, a container could be treated as a building for development control purposes. It is a matter for the local planning authority to assess whether development is going on and whether it is lawful. That might involve taking into account other indicators of what is happening on the site.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/10">There are circumstances when placing a caravan on land may change the principal use of the land. For that reason, use of the land for an occupied caravan generally requires planning permission. However, there are exceptions, one of which, under schedule 2 to the order, covers use of land for one or two nights by a person travelling with a caravan, subject to an annual limit of 28 days on the given land. It is not permitted to spend a full 28-day period, but various periods of one or two nights up to a maximum of 28 days are permitted.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/11">As for gates and fences, those can be permitted development. A planning application is not required for the construction or alteration of a gate, fence, wall, or other means of enclosure, provided that it does not exceed 1 m in height, if it is adjacent to a highway used for vehicular traffic. I just wanted to clarify some of the points raised by my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/12">Any permitted development right can be withdrawn, if there are strong planning grounds, under article 4 of the order. Such directions may be used if there is a significant, specific and credible threat to an important amenity. My hon. Friend is right that we are consulting about changes to make it easier for article 4 directives to be used. We have been in official discussions with Members of the National Assembly for Wales to ensure that there is understanding about this. In addition, temporary stop notices are a provision of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. We have discussed their implementation with Welsh colleagues.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/13">Time defeats me. There are several other relevant aspects, such as areas of outstanding natural beauty. New provisions on planning statements afford greater cover for ancient woodlands. That approach is relevant and it is worth considering. My hon. Friend has strongly highlighted the environmental impact and the woodland issues. We are seriously considering extending consultation on article 4 to woodland, and I thank my hon. Friend for taking the opportunity in this debate to raise such important issues.</p>

	Sea Defences (Essex)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-12.64.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1315" speakername="John Whittingdale" colnum="64"  time="16:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041012/halltext/41012h05.htm#41012h05_spnew0">
	<p pid=".64.1/1">I am grateful for this opportunity to debate an issue of enormous importance to my constituents, particularly those living in the Maldon district.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/2">Essex has more than 275 miles of sea walls. Perhaps up to one third of those are within my own constituency and a significant part of the rest lie in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/901" name="Mark Francois">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois)</phrase>, whom I am pleased to see in this debate. Last year, he and I attended the service in Chelmsford cathedral to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the great floods, which resulted in more than 100 deaths in Essex. All of us are very conscious, therefore, of the ever-present threat from the sea.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/3">That threat is increasing for several reasons. Climate change is leading to rising sea levels, the rate of which some estimate at around 30 cm a century. On top of that, the land is sinking at about the same rate, owing to the tilt that results from settling following the retreat of the ice age some 15,000 years ago. Although there may be some disagreement about the precise rate at which that is happening, there is no doubt that the combined effect of those two processes is that the sea level is rising relative to the land in Essex. The Government's estimate of the rate is about 6 mm every year. At the same time, salt-marsh is being steadily eroded, at about 1 per cent. a year. That not only destroys an enormously important natural habitat, but results in the loss of its value in absorbing the wave and tidal energy, thus increasing the pressure elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/4">According to a recent parliamentary answer that I obtained, the Environment Agency assessed 86.6 per cent. of the flood defences in Essex as fair or better. However, that figure is deceptive, since it includes fluvial as well as tidal defences. A recent engineer's report that I have seen rated the sea defences at Steeple Wick, Mayland creek and Tollesbury in my constituency as very poor, with a residual life of less than five years. At Mayland and Maylandsea, where there is a significant population, the defences are also rated as poor. Maldon district council has expressed concern about the threat to the Southminster branch railway line, which passes uncomfortably close to the high water mark at Stow creek on the Crouch estuary.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/5">According to parliamentary answers, 63 miles of Essex sea wall&mdash;about 23 per cent. of the total&mdash;have been raised and improved in the past 20 years. Of that total, however, just 0.62 miles have been improved in the past five years. In 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2003, no improvement took place at all. Instead, there have been a succession of studies: the Roach and Crouch estuary strategy study, which cost &pound;400,000, the Colne and Blackwater estuary strategy study, which cost &pound;400,000, the Stour and Orwell estuary strategy study, which cost &pound;350,000, the Essex coastal habitat management plan, which cost &pound;50,000, and the Essex shoreline management plan, which cost about &pound;250,000.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/6">In April, the Environment Agency published a report entitled &quot;Maintenance of Uneconomic Sea Flood Defences: A Way forward&quot;. The report concentrates on Essex, where, it says:</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/7" class="indent">&quot;the combination of rising sea levels and foreshore erosion, which threatens the sustainability of defences and gives rise to loss of intertidal habitat, together with many uneconomic seawalls mean that action is urgently required.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/8">The report states that</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/9" class="indent">&quot;the cost of maintenance of many existing defences along stretches of the Essex coast and estuaries exceeds the benefits.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/10">The report therefore proposes to classify each length of sea wall into one of four categories.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/11">For those defences in category 4, the report recommends that the Environment Agency should begin withdrawing maintenance as soon as possible. In those cases, it states that landowners should be informed of the anticipated residual life, the existing standard of defence and the condition of the structures at the earliest opportunity. Landowners will be able to apply to the Environment Agency for permission to maintain defences on their land at their own expense. An alternative is to apply for countryside stewardship intertidal habitat creation payments, but the paper also makes it clear that there is no legal requirement or general provision for compensation to be paid.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/12">At present, we have no firm indication of how much land is affected, but in the Crouch/Roach estuary system, the Environment Agency has estimated it at 389 hectares. It is worth noting that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs consultation document &quot;Making Space for Water&quot;, published in July, states that on a national assessment, it is estimated that up to 500,000 hectares of agricultural land are currently behind potentially non-viable flood defences and are therefore candidate areas for restoration and realignment policies.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/13">Although I do not dispute the logic of the Department's approach, it raises an awful lot of questions. Landowners are not convinced of the method used to calculate either the cost of maintaining the defences or the value of the land lost if they are abandoned. The method of economic appraisal undervalues heritage, environment and community assets such as footpaths. The phased introduction of the single farm payment will make the process even more confusing.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/14">There is real suspicion, too, that policy is being driven in large part by the habitats directive, and that greater concern is being paid to the preservation of wildlife habitat than to the preservation of agricultural land for food production or our heritage. It seems extraordinary that there is a raft of protections for a reed bed providing habitat for birds, together with a requirement for the provision of compensatory habitat should it be lost, while a grade 1 listed building has no legal right to protection nor do its occupants have any entitlement to rehousing in the event of its flooding.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/15">The failure to carry out almost any improvement works to sea defences in the past five years may well be explained in part by the directive requirement that compensatory habitats should be provided. At one time it appeared that even maintenance work would trigger the same requirement, and I should be grateful for the Minister's confirmation that that is not the case.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/16">The priority points-scoring system used by DEFRA to assess projects is also set so that no flood defence scheme in the whole county of Essex qualifies. What is more, it is distorted in favour of fluvial works rather than coastal defence. On the one occasion when it appeared likely that a scheme would score sufficiently, the Government promptly raised the threshold. The position will be made worse by the abolition of the Essex local flood defence committee and its incorporation into a regional committee including Norfolk and Suffolk. That will mean that future decisions will be taken by a body that is more remote and has little knowledge of the particular problems in the county.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/17">The option that causes most controversy&mdash;managed realignment&mdash;will have a part to play, which most landowners and farmers accept. There have already been a number of small-scale trials of managed retreat in my own constituency: at Northey island, St. Lawrence and Tollesbury. However, the Minister might be aware that a recent proposal to create 170 hectares of wetland at Weymarks in Bradwell had to be withdrawn because of the strength of public opposition. At the very least, therefore, people need to be convinced that the alternative options have been fully considered before managed realignment takes place.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/18">Where landowners choose to maintain the walls themselves, they need to be able to do so easily without having to obtain myriad consents, which drives up costs and leads to lengthy delays. Although in the Maldon district the council has been supportive of landowners and not insisted on planning permission for maintenance work, that is not always the case elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/19">We also need to examine more carefully the effect of dredging for aggregates, which may exacerbate the problem. In Holland, there is a moratorium on dredging within 20 km of the coast, whereas here dredging may take place from 5 km out. The effect may well be to accelerate the loss of salt-marsh. Where dredging takes place in ports and harbours, the sediment is usually dumped at sea. It would be relatively easy instead for it to be used to replenish frontages, as happens in Holland. There, more than 9 million cu m of beach recharge takes place each year, compared with just 2 million cu m here.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/20">Where realignment does take place, it needs to be planned and managed, not left to be determined by chance wherever the defences happen to fail. A breach in the wrong place could do more damage than good to the estuary. Nor can we necessarily rely on natural processes to create salt-marsh. In some areas, all that has resulted is an expanse of mudflat, which has done little to mitigate the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/21">We should also recognise that the decision to abandon land that has, until now, been defended carries with it a responsibility to compensate the owners who are affected. Realignment results in public benefit in the form of sustainable defences, creation of habitat and protection of economic assets. Landowners are therefore entitled to payment in recognition of the positive environmental benefits. In &quot;Making Space for Water&quot;, the Government suggest that payment might be available through the environmental stewardship agri-environmental scheme, but that is time limited and it may not be sufficient, particularly if entitlement to single farm payment on the land is lost.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/22">It is, of course, right that there should be proper consultation and study before the strategy for maintaining our sea defences is agreed, but that consultation has been going on for long enough. Defences in Essex are deteriorating and there is a real fear that the Government's approach is one of abandonment by stealth. My constituents want action. That means clarity on managed retreat, reasonable compensation where retreat is shown to be appropriate, and prompt and proper expenditure on flood defences that will be retained.</p>

	<p pid=".67.4/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1315" name="John Whittingdale">my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale)</phrase> for securing the debate and for introducing it so ably.</p>
	<p pid=".67.4/2">I, too, recall the cathedral service that my hon. Friend referred to, when the congregation was addressed by county councillor Ray Howard. He spoke movingly of his experience as a boy living on Canvey Island on that fateful night in 1953. It is important for Ministers to appreciate that sea defences and protection against flooding remain emotive issues in Essex to this day. That is evidenced by the presence this afternoon of four Essex Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/996" name="Bernard Jenkin">my hon. Friends the Members for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin)</phrase> and for Castle Point (Bob Spink), which includes Canvey Island. In our county, we take these issues seriously. I want to drive that home to the Minister.</p>
	<p pid=".67.4/3">Given that, it is a shame that Ministers have decided to abolish our Essex local flood defence committee. The system has operated successfully for many years. It was in no way broken, so it is a shame that the Government have deemed it necessary to fix it. Last year, I led a delegation to see the Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment on these matters. That delegation included County Councillor Ray Howard and County Councillor Tracey Chapman, who has specific responsibility for those matters at County hall. We did our best to impress upon the Minister the need to retain our local committee in Essex. While I stress for the record that he gave us no guarantees, we left his office rather hopeful.</p>
	<p pid=".67.4/4">Therefore, I am sure that Ministers will understand our collective disappointment at the decision to merge us with Norfolk and Suffolk on these matters. In those places, the issues are, in some respects, somewhat different. I do not believe that that decision was undertaken for any practical reason. I believe that it was taken simply to fit in with the Government's wider regional agenda. Therefore, I deprecate it. I suspect that it will be no more popular in Norfolk and Suffolk than it is in Essex, so I want to take the opportunity to look the Minister in the eye and tell him, respectfully, that I genuinely believe that he and his fellow Ministers have made a mistake.</p>
	<p pid=".67.4/5">In the brief time remaining, I want to stress one further point about the maintenance of sea walls, which was touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford. In recent years, there has been considerable confusion about the interplay between the habitats directive and the granting of consent to undertake traditional maintenance work on existing sea walls. It would be pernicious if the Government were to withdraw funding for sea defences in some areas&mdash;essentially, leaving it to local farmers&mdash;and then so to tie those farmers up in environmental red tape that they were not allowed to maintain the walls, even if they elected to do so at their own expense. Like my hon. Friend, I would be grateful if the Minister clarified the fact that traditional maintenance does not require compensatory habitat to be provided&mdash;indeed, that formal planning permission is not required for traditional maintenance to be undertaken in the normal way.</p>
	<p pid=".67.4/6">Finally, I stress that in this area there are important environmental issues, which we all recognise, but that safety remains paramount. We in Essex have not forgotten the lessons learned from the great flood of 1953. We are still conscious of the risks. I hope that others, including those in positions of authority, will remain conscious of those risks in all that they decide to do.</p>

	<p pid=".68.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1315" name="John Whittingdale">the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale)</phrase> on securing this debate. I know from the numerous parliamentary questions that he has tabled that he takes a keen interest in this issue and is very active on behalf of his constituents.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/2">I start by apologising on behalf of the Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment, who usually speaks on flooding issues. He is unable to be here today because he is representing the UK at the conference on the convention on international trade in endangered species.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/3">I will set out some points about the wider context of Government policies before coming to some of the specific issues raised by the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, and by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/901" name="Mark Francois">the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois)</phrase>. The Government have provided a major increase in investment in funding for flood defence and flood risk management over recent years, which is set to continue. I think that that increase is recognised across the board. Total Government expenditure will exceed &pound;478 million this year and will rise to over &pound;564 million next year. That is an increase of &pound;252 million a year against the 1997&ndash;98 level. However, as the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford said, there will never be enough funding to meet every flood and coastal defence need. We have to spend taxpayers' money in ways that maximise the benefit of our investment. We need to make sure that the Government's provision for flood defence is spent where it is needed most, protecting people and their homes and possessions from the trauma of flooding.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/4">In the face of all the natural, economic and other pressures that we face, including those of climate change, sea-level rise and the sinking of the eastern part of south-east England, the response cannot be automatically to carry on defending every last inch of coastline to the same standard. We need to consider the cost of maintaining existing defences against the benefits that that work provides. Those evaluations must be applied to flooding from rivers and the sea, in Essex and beyond. If the cost of maintenance exceeds the benefits, it is difficult, if not impossible, to justify spending public money on doing that, knowing that there are well justified schemes waiting to be brought forward for many vulnerable communities.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/5">Allowing sea walls to be breached can have significant environmental and conservation benefits. The hon. Member for Rayleigh may not be aware of this, but I originate from Norfolk, which was also traumatised by the terrible floods of 50 years ago, so I am aware of the importance, in the consciousness and memories of the people of East Anglia, of the trauma of that flooding. I think that he would accept that, in some ways, managed retreat can help to avoid catastrophic flooding of the type that occurred then, which we hope not to have to witness again.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/6">Inter-tidal areas in front of defences are coming under increasing pressure as sea levels rise and coastal squeeze takes place. I stress, however, that the policy is to consider the economic justification of maintenance, and that the withdrawal of maintenance by the Environment Agency does not automatically mean that walls will be breached, as landowners might carry on maintaining them.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/7">DEFRA has published a recent policy statement on uneconomic flood defences to assist the agency in preparing its strategic assessment of flood defence needs. It incorporates the classification of existing sea walls into one of four categories: those with a clear economic case for continued maintenance; those that protect internationally designated environmental features from the damaging effect of tidal flooding; those not in the first two categories, for which maintenance is justified on a precautionary basis because the effects of withdrawal are uncertain; and those not in the first three categories. Category 4 walls are likely to protect only agricultural land, or land of little economic or social value.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/8">The Environment Agency will work with English Nature in adopting that structured approach to considering the justification of future maintenance of all coastal sea walls through a comprehensive series of estuary strategies and shoreline management plans. If the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford will allow me to, I promise to write to him, and to the hon. Member for Rayleigh, about some of the details of the points system that he raised.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/9">Essex estuary strategies are in preparation. Coupled with a revised Essex shoreline management plan, they will provide the information and framework necessary for making the best medium to long-term decisions. The full programme of strategy development in Essex is planned to be complete by 2007.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/10">The presumption is that the agency will not continue to maintain category 4 defences and that the withdrawal process should begin as quickly as possible. However, where, as a result of the studies, defences are assigned to category 4, the agency will withdraw maintenance only after full discussion with the landowners affected and will always ensure that sufficient notice is given, so that landowners can consider their options and factor them into future business plans.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/11">Landowners will have the option to maintain the sea walls at their own expense, subject to consent from the Environment Agency. Where the landowner proposes to continue the existing maintenance regime, there are unlikely to be grounds for refusal. Where the landowner decides not to maintain the wall or fails to gain the agency's consent to do so, their options could include applying for agri-environment payments to create inter-tidal habitats, and selling or leasing the property for habitat creation, for example. In many cases, sea walls for which there is no maintenance justification may have a substantial residual life of several years. It will not be a case of the agency refusing maintenance one day, and inundation the next.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/12">We cannot undertake to defend all areas for all time whatever the cost, not least in the face of climate change. The coastline is dynamic and we need to let it move where we can for economic and environmental reasons. This is not a new policy; it is a truth that has been recognised by successive Governments. For example, the 1993 strategy for flood and coastal defence in England and Wales, issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and by the Welsh Office, stated:</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/13" class="indent">&quot;to attempt to protect every inch of coastline from change would not only be uneconomic but would work against the dynamic processes which determine the coastline and could have an adverse effect elsewhere and on the natural environment&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/14">The 1993 strategy also emphasised the need to consider a range of flood management options, including setting back the existing line of defence.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/15">I assure hon. Members that we will take rational and precautionary decisions on future maintenance regimes and that landowners will be able to consider an alternative arrangement if the decision is made to withdraw maintenance. Those principles will be fundamental to our approach.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/16" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid=".68.1/17" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at twenty-two minutes past Four o'clock.</p>
