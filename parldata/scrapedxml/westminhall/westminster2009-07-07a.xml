<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-07a.183.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" speakername="Denis MacShane" colnum="183"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090707/halltext/90707h0001.htm#09070755000477">
	<p pid="a.183.3/1">Thank you, Sir Nicholas. Any debate that you chaired, even if it consisted of only one speaker, would be interesting.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.3/2">We are here to discuss the steel industry. I am glad that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Regional Economic Development and Co-ordination is to reply, because those of us who know her in her role as the Minister for Yorkshire and the Humber know of her dedication and her hands-on, let's-go-and-see-what-can-be-done approach. I hope that at the end of this debate she can convey the message to her colleagues in Government that we need a slightly better co-ordinated response than we have had until now.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.3/3">I asked for this debate because the announcement of hundreds of steel industry redundancies in my constituency and in the neighbouring constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1814" name="Angela Smith">the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Ms Smith)</phrase> is causing deep distress and concern, particularly as it appears that many of the redundancies will be compulsory. Much of the previous reduction in steel industry employment in south Yorkshire and elsewhere has been on a voluntary basis, but this situation is serious indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.3/4">There are many aspects of the crisis, but the basic message is simple: under the Conservatives, Britain lost its coal-mining industry; under Labour, Britain must not lose its steel-making industry. I wish to make a series of concrete proposals that I hope will stave off the worst of the impact of job cuts. I do so not with false hope nor a promise of what is beyond the power of the Government, the company or unions to deliver, but I have been raising concerns about steel across the board for the past two or three years, particularly in the past year as the worldwide recession began to develop.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.3/5">Let us be clear: this is not a made-in-Britain crisis. Exports are plunging faster in Germany, unemployment is rising faster in Spain and America, and the economy of Japan may shrink by up to 12 or 15 per cent. On comparative terms, difficult as it may be for some to understand, Britain is perhaps better placed than most of our big OECD partners. But have we got sufficient grip in responding to the crisis in the steel industry? Has there been sufficient co-ordination and co-operation between Government Departments&mdash;I have to say politely that I do not think that that is the case&mdash;or, indeed, between the company and the union?</p>
	<p pid="a.183.3/6">Corus has to ask itself hard questions. Would its dealings with the Government not have been more fruitful if, instead of its go-alone approach, it had co-operated fully with the main steel union community to work out common positions? The outgoing chief executive officer of Corus, Mr. Philippe Varin, and the new CEO, Kirby Adams, are open and friendly. They meet with MPs, and they put their cards on the table. I am not making a personal criticism, but a structural approach in which the company and the union spoke as one to the Government could have borne better fruit.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.1/1">No, I really want to finish because other colleagues from steel communities want to speak on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.1/2">What must the Government do? I ask my right hon. Friend the Minister to open a channel of communication with Ministers to plug them into the scandal of the overly high prices that our electricity companies charge to industrial users. If hon. Members look at <i>Hansard</i> from <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-08">8 June 2006</phrase>, at column 382, they will see that I asked the then Secretary of State for Department of Trade and Industry, now my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to take action regarding the fact that electricity prices for industry were much lower in Germany in the UK&mdash;and they still are and no action has been taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.1/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-22">22 January</phrase>, as can be seen in <i>Hansard</i>, I asked the then Energy Minister, now the Minister of State, Department of Health, my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1910" name="Mike O'Brien">the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase>, what could be done, given the rapid decline in oil prices, to get electricity prices down. I do not want to read out the answer that I received, because it was not adequate. I have repeated that point in the House, in letters to Ministers and in private conversations with them, but there has been no grip on this problem of Britain's having much higher electricity charges than the rest of Europe, which has cost the jobs of steelworkers. I ask my right hon. Friend the Minister to put effective pressure on her ministerial colleagues who are responsible for the oversight of these wretched utility companies and ensure fair prices for steel.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.1/4">We also need joined-up government with the Department of Work and Pensions. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1918" name="John Healey">the Member for Wentworth (John Healey)</phrase> and my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough had a good meeting with Lord Mandelson and his ministerial team last month. We asked for a senior civil servant in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to be placed in executive charge of co-ordinating Government activity across Departments. Can the Minister tell us the name of that person, and if not will she write and let me know?</p>
	<p pid="a.186.1/5">One bit of co-ordinated activity would be to use all the DWP's funds, not as stretcher-bearers to help those who have lost jobs, but instead to create in-work training schemes so that some workers can be kept on the company payroll on training or community help schemes, rather than going out the door.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-07a.187.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" speakername="Denis MacShane" colnum="187"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090707/halltext/90707h0001.htm#09070755000487">
	<p pid="a.187.0/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. I wish that the civil servants in Whitehall would read these debates and that Ministers would act on the points made by Back Benchers who are a lot closer to the steel industry than others. I will come on to that point in a second.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/2">Undoubtedly, we need to think differently. There is a sense that, in terms of industrial support policy, we are on tramlines that have not altered for the last 25 years: any job reduction is good and anything that a company wants to do has to be accepted, and the Government are powerless, as if decisions about electricity prices or tariffs or how to ladle out public funds to support people in difficulties are immutable things that, like the weather, cannot be altered. The Government must understand their responsibilities and act.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/3">We need to see what can be done to use DWP funds to keep some workers&mdash;not all&mdash;on the company payroll in training or community help schemes, rather than have them go out the door. In particular, the role of the Communitas training outfit, which has specialised knowledge of steel, needs to be highlighted. I understand that there will be a meeting with Communitas later today, and I hope that the Minister can assure me that the Government will act to press Corus to co-operate fully with it, because that is the only training organisation that originates from the steel community. There are plenty of private training organisations and all the quangos that get a lot of Government money, and I am sure that they do God's work in their own way, but Communitas can do the steel industry's work better than anyone else. Corus must be told that, if it is to get Government help, it must co-operate with Communitas.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/4">In particular, the &pound;5 million that has been announced to help steel must be used jointly with the union and Communitas and must not be a blank cheque given to Corus to use for its own purposes while men go out the door. That &pound;5 million is welcome, but it needs to be increased. The paltry sum of &pound;5 million for thousands of steelworkers contrasts sadly with the new wages of &pound;9 million announced for the new boss of the Royal Bank of Scotland, even though this bank is under Government supervision. Can my right hon. Friend understand&mdash;I do not ask her to comment on it&mdash;the outrage of families who now have to face the dole while the Government sign off on a &pound;9 million pay package for this greed-soaked bankster? This not a moral maze; it is immoral, and the sense of injustice at the double standard, whereby the rich in the City are protected while the steelworkers of south Yorkshire are sacrificed, should not be underestimated.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/5">In talks with Ministers&mdash;my right hon. and hon. Friends and colleagues&mdash;they all insist on their ideological commitment that there is not much to be learned from European Union, where different and more innovative policies to support steel are in place. I have heard all the reasons and excuses from Ministers, both at the Dispatch Box and in meetings, but they increasingly sound hollow. When the upturn comes, and it will, we will find ourselves importing steel from Germany, the Netherlands and France because we will have lost the capacity and the will to make steel across the board in Britain. Why are other Governments leading and the British Government lagging? Can we look, for example, at stock-piling some steel products to be sold, at a profit, when the upturn comes?</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/6">If a full-scale Dutch or German-style wage subsidy is ruled out, why not a temporary exoneration of social charges on the wage bill, as in Sweden? The Government's refusal not to follow a single European model but to incorporate some of the better ideas from Europe makes the UK much more expensive now for steel operations. Why are we not able to help with credit insurance? Without accessible credit insurance the cost of raw materials and electricity is even higher for Corus. These are arguments about the need to help the industry, though the industry could help itself by working jointly with the Community union and presenting a common approach based on showing the jointly decided priorities to Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/7">Steel is not like other industrial production. A steel plant cannot be moth-balled. The electric arc furnaces of the south Yorkshire steel industry are a key component in the new green economy, for which my right hon. Friend the Minister is a wonderful ambassador and enthusiastic advocate. But does she understand that Rotherham and Stocksbridge consume about 1.5 million tonnes of scrap metal a year? Where are all the unused, derelict cars going to be stored if they are not swallowed up as scrap by the electric arc furnaces of our region? Are they to be stacked up on street corners?</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/8">We marvelled last week at the new roof at Wimbledon, which was made with Rotherham steel. It did not bring Andy Murray quite enough luck, but it will still be there next year, as I hope will he. Half of the steel made in Rotherham goes to the car industry in the UK. If Nissan, Honda and other car manufacturers can no longer source steel in Britain because steel has gone under, they will relocate to the continent to be closer to suppliers of steel as Governments there have been willing to think out of the box and put in place pro-steel job policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/9">The 800 jobs threatened in south Yorkshire represent about &pound;3 million in local demand. There is a lot of talk about family policy these days. The best family policy is, and always will be, a secure job with fair pay so that a home can be created and children supported as they grow up. That is now under threat for too many steel communities in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/10">Labour Members know the devastation that was caused to towns and communities when the Tories shut down the pits. My right hon. Friend the Minister represents those communities in south Yorkshire, and I am confident that she will do all in her power to help, but so far we have had more words than concrete action. It is not too late. If Labour loses steel, Labour loses power. It is as simple as that.</p>

	<p pid="a.191.2/1">I shall speak briefly, Sir Nicholas.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/2">I congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" name="Denis MacShane">the Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane)</phrase> on securing this very important and timely debate. He made a convincing case for more Government support for the UK steel industry without, as he said, offering false hope. In my constituency as in many others, the dramatic drop in steel demand has had a tragic impact on workers and families. The job cuts announced by Corus in January have led to more than 500 losses at Corus in Llanwern, with the mothballing of the hot-strip mill. That has been a devastating blow for the very loyal and dedicated work force, who have stuck with Corus through thick and thin, not to mention the knock-on effects on contractors and suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/3">During the present recession, steel has been hit more quickly and more severely than expected. We all understand that the industry faces extreme difficulties, but before the recession, companies such as Corus were making extremely healthy profits and I agree with my right hon. Friend that we must avoid, where possible, short-term decisions that affect the long-term future of the steel industry as a whole. In the past, knee-jerk reactions have affected sites such as Llanwern in my constituency and we should do everything that we can to avoid that now.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/4">As chair of the all-party group on steel and metal, I thank my right hon. Friend the Minister for Business, Innovation and Skills for agreeing to come to a meeting of the group before the recess. That follows up the steel summit held by the group in May, at which representatives of the industry and the unions had the opportunity to voice their concerns and have a full and frank discussion with the Secretary of State. I look forward to my right hon. Friend the Minister reporting back on progress made on the issues that we discussed, including, as has been mentioned, action to stimulate demand for steel through the construction and automotive sectors and the car scrappage scheme; assistance with trade credit insurance; and security for energy purchases and prices. It is clear that the burden being placed on the industry by energy companies is unreasonable and unfair; I am thinking especially of the demands to pay up front. That problem could worsen as the country emerges from recession. Traditionally, most bankruptcies occur when companies' working capital increases as they start to ramp up production. If energy suppliers continue to demand those payments up front, that will put an even greater strain on resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/5">Most crucial is the retention of skills in the industry. It would be helpful if the Minister responding to this debate talked about that. It would also be helpful to have her feedback on the commitment made during the steel summit about working groups with industry and the Department to consider the issues in detail. It would be useful to know what progress has been made on those groups and how often they have met.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/6">Other European countries are helping their industry through problems such as that relating to trade credit insurance and are offering, for example, generous arrangements for short-time working. We need to ensure that we have a level playing field to allow us to compete. We need progress on the measures now, because the benefits in all the areas that we have discussed today will undoubtedly take time to filter through to the industry. Momentum will certainly gather with measures such as action to stimulate demand, but every day is crucial, and we need help to come as soon as possible for communities such as mine in Newport, East.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.0/1">It is good, Sir Nicholas, to see you in the Chair. May I add my words of commendation to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" name="Denis MacShane">the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane)</phrase> for securing what has been a timely debate and for his typically forthright remarks. Although our views of history may not be entirely shared, I enjoyed his line&mdash;I suspect that most here this morning will not have noticed it&mdash;of saying that the BBC was a force of conservatism. That was particularly entertaining. However, I agree with him on the question of protectionism. If it does not embarrass him too much, may I say that I think we agree on that?</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/2">The country has been producing steel for longer than almost any other nation. As the home of the industrial revolution, Britain retains a strong reputation for quality of finish, especially in the production of higher value products, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1814" name="Angela Smith">the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Ms Smith)</phrase> rightly pointed out. However, we are far from being the largest producer, as we heard this morning. Indeed, figures show that Germany, Italy, Spain and France now produce more than the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/3">Even before the recession, there was a worrying decline in UK steel production. In 1997, output stood at 18.5 million tonnes, a level retained for much of the 1980s and 1990s. Since then, however, production has fallen. At the beginning of 2008&mdash;before the recession&mdash;output stood at 13.5 million tonnes. That was a 27 per cent. fall in steel production, but it occurred during a period of global growth. Will the Minister explain why, during those years of growth, steel production in the UK fell so far and so fast?</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/4">Allied to that fall is the fact that energy prices have badly affected heavy industry. As the right hon. Member for Rotherham pointed out, steel production is self-evidently energy-intensive. Energy prices have a tremendous impact on the competitiveness of UK steel producers and their suppliers; yet, despite that, the Government's data show that average industrial electricity prices rose by 111 per cent. in real terms over the past five years; and, as a number of hon. Members said, average industrial gas prices rose even further&mdash;by more than 130 per cent. in real terms. Those rises have outstripped rises in most of those countries with which our steel producers must compete. Will the Minister explain why UK industrial energy prices have risen so much, especially when compared to those of many of our competitors? What does she say to those in the industry who blame the Government for failing to address the problem before it became a crisis?</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/5">Members rightly spoke of the value of steel production to the UK economy. As a passionate supporter of manufacturing, Sir Nicholas, you will know that access to working capital is vital. It is the lifeblood of major industries. That is why, last November, the Conservative party set out its plan for a single national loan guarantee scheme. Worth about &pound;50 billion, it would be available to all sectors and to all viable businesses, irrespective of their size. By making the rules common and clear, we believe that such a scheme would ensure that businesses had access to the working capital that they clearly need.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/6">In contrast to that, a plethora of ideas has been announced by the Government. My worry is that, to date, they have all too often failed to deliver the actual finance. I take the automotive assistance programme as an example. Car production is a crucial consumer of steel, so helping that trade would not only help the car plants but help the steel workers of Sheffield and Rotherham.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/7">In January, Lord Mandelson announced the automotive assistance programme, telling us that it was open for business. Since then French, German and American Governments have delivered financial aid, specifically to their car producers. The money is in their bank accounts. However, despite the promises of Lord Mandelson, not a single penny has been received by British car firms. Why not? Ministers talk about providing real help. Why, under the present Government, are our car firms the last to receive the help that they have been promised? Perhaps the Minister can tell us.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/8">The recession has hit steel hard. The sharp falls in construction, and in automotive and allied engineering production, have led to a sharp reduction in demand for steel. Those sectors represent two thirds of the UK market for steel. In that difficult context, it is not surprising that Corus has recently been struggling to cope. Hence, the company decided in January to mothball some facilities and to cut 3,500 jobs, including 2,500 in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/9">As we heard earlier, it is the recent announcements about compulsory jobs cuts on Teesside, and in Scunthorpe and Rotherham that are of most concern. It is clear that the company takes a rather different view to the Government. They believe that the upturn is a long way off. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-25">25 June</phrase>, the chief executive of Corus, Kirby Adams, told the BBC that the recovery</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/10" class="indent">&quot;appears to be some time off, so it is vital that we take this proportionate and responsible action now. We have to achieve long-term, sustainable competitiveness in a global and over-supplied steel market.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/11">In response to Corus's announcement, the Government have offered &pound;5 million to help to retain key jobs. It would help Members if the Minister could tell us what that means in practice, and who will and will not be helped. Also, what commitments has the company made in return for that &pound;5 million of aid?</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/12">Furthermore, it would be very helpful to hear from the Minister what strategic interest the Government place in continued UK steel production. Some have said that Lord Mandelson does not consider steel to have strategic industrial importance. Is that Government policy?</p>

	<p pid="a.201.0/1">As always, Sir Nicholas, it is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. I congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" name="Denis MacShane">the Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane)</phrase> on securing what is, as has been recognised, a very important debate. He demonstrated his considerable expertise in the matter as well as concern for all constituents affected. I also thank him for his kind opening remarks about my work, particularly as Minister for Yorkshire and the Humber. The many contributions today, especially by colleagues from the Yorkshire and the Humber region, demonstrate the keen effect on the region of the recent announcements by Corus, although I am obviously aware that other regions have been affected too. We all feel strongly about the knock-on effect that the recently announced reductions in output and employment have had on individuals and their families, on our communities and, as right hon. and hon. Members have said, on suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/2">My right hon. Friends the Members for Rotherham and for Wentworth (John Healey) and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1814" name="Angela Smith">the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Ms Smith)</phrase> met recently with the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, and have a follow-up meeting in the not-too-distant future. I hope that I can illustrate that there has been a focus within Government on this issue to establish what can be done to reflect the many concerns raised today by all hon. Members, many of whom referred to the fact that this is a global issue and that steel companies across the world have made huge cuts in output in an attempt to weather the storm of collapsing demand for, and prices of, steel, during a period of de-stocking. Obviously, the UK sector is not immune and has had to cut employment in an attempt to reduce costs and balance supply with demand. Short-term working and pay freezes have also been introduced across the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1631" name="Mark Prisk">The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk)</phrase> asked about previous falls in steel production during the period of growth. The explanation relates to some of the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough. During that period of growth, the UK steel industry exploited some of its strengths by concentrating on high-value-added steels. Some of the basic bulk steels were being produced more cheaply in emerging economies, such as China, India and those in central and eastern Europe. That was the reason for the change during that time.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-07a.202.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" speakername="Rosie Winterton" colnum="202"  time="010:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090707/halltext/90707h0004.htm#09070755000504">
	<p pid="a.202.1/1">I am going to come to that point, which was also raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/2">Right hon. and hon. Members set out the number of recently announced redundancies, which, as I have said, are tragic for individuals and their families and for communities. Corus currently employs about 24,500 people in the UK, but after the reductions, that could fall to about 20,000 or less. However, a substantial UK steel business will remain, which we must not lose sight of, if we are to do many of the things that right hon. and hon. Members have mentioned today. Some steel businesses have mothballed plant and equipment and some complete closures have been avoided. It is the job of the Government and others to look at what we can do to assist in such times.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/3">Let me reiterate how important the steel industry is to our economy. My right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central referred to some of the work that the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills has been doing. He will also recall that the Prime Minister and I recently visited Sheffield Forgemasters, which again shows how much importance we attach to the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/4">Let me return to the wider issue of Government support. Obviously, to start with, we considered how to protect the wider UK economy. That is why we intervened in the banking industry. In January, the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills set out a number of ways to help businesses. Along with regional development agencies and local government, we decided to bring forward billions of pounds worth of infrastructure, to which both right hon. and hon. Members have referred. We are increasing capacity in the motorway and rail network, improving and building new social housing and primary and secondary schools, to which my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1805" name="Elliot Morley">the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley)</phrase> referred, focusing on hospitals, energy efficiency, carbon capture and many other green technologies. Such development is vital for stimulating the demand for steel.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/5">In the meetings that Corus had with Ministers, a number of key requests were made. First, there was the fiscal stimulus, and the need to promote the demand for steel by intervening and bringing forward investment. Secondly, Corus mentioned trade credit insurance, which could be used by not just itself but customers and suppliers. We introduced the trade credit insurance top-up scheme as a direct response to the industry's requests. A third request from Corus related to trade credit insurance and energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/6">My right hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham raised the issue of energy supplies. Although wholesale electricity prices are falling, the effect will take time to feed through, particularly for those who are locked into long-term agreements. In one case, Corus is looking to negotiate a long-term agreement with Electricit&eacute; de France. Officials from my Department have met separately with both companies to encourage them to reach agreement. There was a meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-03">3 July</phrase>, and I will write to Members when I know the outcome. Although commercial decisions are involved, we are considering what we can do to encourage companies to make a mutually successful agreement in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/7">I want to address the issue of what we are doing with regard to the &pound;5 million offer that has been made to Corus. Moreover, let me mention the support that has been made available to those who, unfortunately, will be made unemployed as a result of the recent announcement. Many hon. Members talked about the train-to-gain initiatives, including one worth &pound;2 million at the Corus Scunthorpe site to support apprenticeship programmes. There has been support for apprenticeships at the Rotherham and Teesside plants and support for Corus employees at the Redcar site. All those plants are being supported by train to gain. It is vital that regional development agencies, the Learning and Skills Council and Jobcentre Plus work together to continue to provide that support, which has already been effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/8">However, following discussions involving the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Prime Minister, we are considering ways in which we can effectively use the &pound;5 million of training support. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1732" name="Jessica Morden">the Member for Newport, East (Jessica Morden)</phrase> said, how do we ensure that when the upturn comes, the people who are working in our steel industry, particularly in Corus, are fully equipped, trained and skilled to take advantage of the available markets? I have met with the trade unions, Yorkshire Forward and Corus in the Yorkshire and Humber area. However, wider discussions are going on, and we are saying that &pound;5 million is on the table. We want to consider the points raised by right hon. and hon. Members today. We want to know what Corus can offer in the areas of proper training, skills and job guarantees in exchange for the Government and RDAs working to provide that assistance. That is not a meaningless offer; it is a very real offer and one that has not been made in the past. During previous recessions, Governments stood by and let people sink or swim. They did not say, &quot;This is what we can do in terms of a fiscal stimulus.&quot; They did not have regional development agencies, which the Conservative party intends to scrap. The RDAs provide vital help for people, communities and businesses during such times.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.1/1">No, I will not, because I have only three more minutes. As I said, those are the issues that we are taking forward at this point in time. Questions have been raised about ProAct in Wales. Obviously, certain offers have been made, but so far there has been no take-up. As for the money we have on offer to Corus, we want to ensure that we get good results for the employees of the companies. We want to ensure that it can continue to exist so that the suppliers and the communities can also benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/2">My right hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham asked what was happening in the Department. We have a range of staff working in the Department from the sector unit, the regional policy unit, and the skills and innovation teams. I will pass on the points that have been made about energy prices. I have already had discussions with the Secretary of State and Minister of State for Energy and Climate Change, and I will pass on the points that were raised in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/3">Let me assure all right hon. and hon. Members that we do see a future for the UK steel industry. There is a huge commitment to it. I hope that the interventions that have already taken place and those that are still to take place&mdash;at regional, national and international levels&mdash;will demonstrate that we are a Government who are committed to helping people during these difficult times and looking to stimulate demand for steel in the future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-07a.213.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" speakername="Mark Field" colnum="213"  time="011:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090707/halltext/90707h0006.htm#09070755000523">
	<p pid="a.213.1/1">There is nothing too sinister. Perhaps I should put on the record my own involvement with the only profession of which I was ever a part. I did not spend long as a lawyer, but I read law at university and became a lawyer afterwards, when I took great pains not to join the Law Society, which I thought an appalling organisation at that time. It was inward-looking and there seemed to be constant bickering among its members. One does not have to be a great philosopher to suggest that many such professional organisations have, to an extent, been a conspiracy against the public at large, although that is a simplistic view. The Law Society has come out of itself in recent years&mdash;indeed, both the Law Society and the Bar Council have recognised that, as well as being a trade union for professionals, they have a much more important role to play in relation to the public at large, in reflecting some of the concerns that the public have rightly had about the profession.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/2">I take the hon. Gentleman's comments on board, but the way in which this problem has applied to professionals has pained me. I am not making a cheap point about the National Union of Teachers or the teaching profession; I think the same applies to many of our professions, which have been far too inward-looking in the past. That goes back to an era when there was far less chopping and changing and rapid advancement for people who were able to move out of one social group into another. We now live in a much more mobile society, and amen to that, but too many of our professions have taken too long to catch up with those changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/3">I want to touch on what is happening in the city of Westminster, where we have in place an education commission that is carrying out a six-month-long investigation into how we might improve educational outcomes in Westminster schools. It is due to report its findings in mid-September. The commission is chaired by Professor David Eastwood, who used to be the chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for England and is now the vice-chancellor of the university of Birmingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/4">Like many inner-London areas, Westminster is highly polarised. It is fair to say that a significant proportion of parents send their children to schools in the independent sector, rather than state schools; none the less, the Conservative-run Westminster city council is passionately concerned to ensure that we raise standards and make more valid choices. There have been some ongoing problems with state education in inner London, one of the biggest being that articulate, educated, middle-class parents have voted with their feet and sent their children to school outside the state sector. That is a key reason why the state sector in London generally struggles, although there are some fantastic success stories such as, in my constituency, the primary schools Hampden Gurney and St. Peter's in Eaton square. The successful secondary schools in Westminster tend to be girls schools such as the Greycoat school on Horseferry road, which is a stone's throw from here, and St. Marylebone school. In both of those schools, it has been a long-standing head teacher who has helped to raise standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/5">In the private sector, my constituency has some of the finest schools, such as Westminster school and the City of London boys and girls schools. Those schools recognise the ongoing commitment and responsibility they have to utilise some of their facilities for the purposes of other maintained schools. That is very much part and parcel of the ethos of living in our highly polarised area of central London.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/6">The education commission's work has revealed a problem with the ability of local authorities to get involved in improving standards when schools become academies. We have two academies in Westminster, one of which, Pimlico, is in my constituency. Authorities have an ongoing responsibility for pupil welfare, but they have no way of tackling poor teaching standards if academies are not doing well. Raising achievement of Westminster children, particularly those in the state sector, is a major priority for the city council's children's services department and its partners. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness has rightly said, education is a main way of improving the lives of individuals. In turn, the community benefits through the social and economic contribution that those educated children&mdash;the parents of the future&mdash;are then able to make. A significant number of children in Westminster do not achieve their full potential for a number of reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/7">We have living in the city of Westminster as a whole about 40,000 people under the age of 19, 20,000 of whom are school pupils; 79 per cent. are from ethnic backgrounds other than white British and 68 per cent. speak English as an additional language. In total, more than 150 languages are spoken by children attending Westminster schools. Our educational settings in Westminster include 12 children's centres; four maintained nursery schools; 40 primary schools, 26 of which are voluntary aided; six secondary schools, five of which are voluntary aided; four city academies, and two special needs schools. However, as an inner-London borough, Westminster also experiences high levels of migration from and to other London boroughs and the rest of the UK&mdash;population churn. What I say in this regard applies to any inner-London area and indeed to many inner-city areas, and it is what I wanted to put on the record today. The mobility of the population, including significant cross-borough flows in terms of the use of health and education services, presents significant challenges and underlines the complexity of service delivery and the importance of information sharing.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/8">Beyond teaching standards, there is a growing issue that needs to be addressed; I wanted to put it on the record, although I appreciate that it is slightly outside the scope of this debate. That issue is the future of genuine parental choice at primary school level. In my constituency in Westminster, we have a large number of voluntary aided schools that prioritise children from a Christian background, whether Roman Catholic or Church of England. That could be a barrier to parents of children who come from non-Christian backgrounds. For example, 78 per cent. of schools achieving above average progress in English and 70 per cent. of schools achieving above average progress in maths are voluntary aided faith schools, either Church of England or Roman Catholic.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/9">That is a problem to which there is no easy solution. In many respects, such schools are great and successful institutions and, in the process of trying to provide a level playing field for all of our children, we do not want to see standards reduced in any way; we want to see standards raised for all children in the future. I appreciate that the problem may not yet have come across the Minister's desk in her relatively short tenure in her position, but it is a very important matter, particularly in many of our inner cities. In such areas, there has been significant depopulation in the past decades, but those sorts of schools&mdash;the voluntary aided schools, which obviously have a long-standing tradition&mdash;remain in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/10">I hope that the Minister will give considerable thought to how we can try to raise the standards of all pupils, so that all of them, even those who do not come from a Roman Catholic or Church of England background, can still aspire. I know from my dealings with particular head teachers of voluntary aided schools in my constituency that they try to ensure, as far as possible, that more and more children from outside those faiths have an opportunity to go to those schools. However, the opportunities for those children are clearly not as great as they would be if there were more community schools that had a local reputation as strong as the voluntary aided schools that I have referred to.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/11">Sir Nicholas, thank you for allowing me to speak in this very important debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness made some very valid points and I look forward to engaging on the subject not just with the Minister who is here today, but hopefully with future Conservative Ministers, because education is the key issue. Without an education system that works for the future, there will be difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/12">I have some worries, even in the longer term, about the maintenance of the knowledge economy given our demographics, which will become an even bigger problem in the decades ahead. The competitive advantage that we have as a country has been based on having great knowledge. Obviously, we have the benefit of the English language, which is the global language and which will assist us to a large extent, but we need to ensure that we have an educated work force. I am not talking just about the elite, although I personally believe that we also need to educate our elites to the highest standards to become global players. More important in many ways are the 40 to 50 per cent. of people who will never go to university but who will still need to be educated, re-educated and trained right the way through their life. If we do not get school education right and ensure that we have teachers of the calibre needed to ensure that education is of the highest standard, we will find that those people are effectively tossed on to something of a scrap heap for much of the rest of their lives. That is not only unaffordable but ethically and morally unjustifiable.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/13">We have discussed some very crucial issues today. I am encouraged that my own party feels strongly about them and there will be some radical changes, even in the light of the importance that must be rightly placed on the economic problems that will be the big, black cloud over much of public policy and politics in the next decade. I am obviously also interested to hear the current Government's thinking on how we can ensure the provision of the highest teaching standards for all our children, who will obviously have an important part to play in making sure that our economy and our country can recover their previous position in the decades to come.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-07a.216.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" speakername="Annette Brooke" colnum="216"  time="011:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090707/halltext/90707h0006.htm#09070755000525">
	<p pid="a.216.1/1">I also start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase>. He expressed some very interesting ideas, many of which I agree with. There are probably other areas that he talked about where I would place a slightly different emphasis. None the less, the important thing that we will agree on in this debate is that we need not only an adequate supply but a full supply of highly qualified entrants into the teaching profession. It is how we attack that issue that we need to debate today.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/2">I started thinking about this debate by focusing on the quote that the hon. Gentleman used, when he said that</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/3" class="indent">&quot;the quality of an education system cannot exceed the quality of its teachers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/4">That must be fundamentally true. Starting at the top, the quality of leadership is of prime importance in any school setting.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/5">The Ofsted figures for 2008-09 quoted in the debate pack, which are about the effectiveness of teaching and learning in meeting the full range of learners' needs, show that 29.1 per cent. of primary schools were judged to be satisfactory and 1.8 per cent. were judged inadequate, while 32.1 per cent. of secondary schools were judged satisfactory and 1.8 per cent. were judged inadequate.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/6">We can look at the downside and say that roughly a third of schools are judged to be either satisfactory or inadequate. Alternatively, we can look at the upside and say that two thirds of schools are good or outstanding. We must celebrate the excellent teaching that exists and the progress that has been made. However, if I was writing a report on teaching standards, I think that I would conclude that we can and must do much better.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/7">The recent Ofsted report on standards of English in schools states:</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/8" class="indent">&quot;There is a significant gap between the most effective schools and the rest. The most effective provide a dynamic and productive English curriculum. However, too much English teaching is no better than satisfactory and too many pupils are not able to make the progress they need to catch up.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/9">In other words, it is particularly the most disadvantaged pupils who are suffering.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/10">We know that about 20 per cent. of children are leaving primary school with inadequate literacy and numeracy. Only half of pupils leave secondary school with five good GCSEs, including English and maths, while 85 per cent. of poor white boys fail to achieve that benchmark. Furthermore, 55 per cent. of schools in the poorest areas fail to achieve the Government benchmark of 30 per cent. of their children obtaining five A to C GCSE grades.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/11">Ofsted's annual report for 2007-08 says that too many children and young people are receiving services that are &quot;patently inadequate&quot;, especially those who are from disadvantaged backgrounds. That is despite the fact that there have been broad improvements across schools, children's services and further education.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/12">The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness touched on the issue of how we can get rid of teachers who are less than satisfactory. I think that the Government have probably taken a step in the right direction with the proposal for a teacher registration system. Of course there are poor teachers and the renewal of a licence to teach&mdash;a system similar to those that already exist in other professions and even, in a sense, for MPs&mdash;would help to eradicate those teachers who should not be in schools. However, I always have fears about Government initiatives. In principle, the teacher registration scheme is a good idea, but will it turn into a bureaucratic nightmare that takes up head teachers' time and ends up proving to be very costly? It needs to be done properly, and we need to focus on raising the status of the profession.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/13">We need to look at the context in which individual teachers find themselves, as well as the overall picture. We are right to focus on entrance to the profession, because we are suffering from a long-term problem that has not been tackled satisfactorily. It is true that we have all kinds of initiatives which probably do not amount to much over time, but, if one looks at the statistics, it appears that the old Teacher Training Agency&mdash;now the Training and Development Agency for Schools&mdash;did not meet the Government's targets for filling places.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/14">Only since April this year have predictions changed. For obvious reasons&mdash;the extra supply of graduates&mdash;all places in all subjects will be filled. Even then, there probably will not be enough physicists and chemists to meet the demand because too many biologists have been recruited. We have seen a rise in the level of qualifications held by applicants, and that is to be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/15">There are alternative routes into teaching. Most people think that the Teach First scheme is impressive. It has raised the status of the teaching profession, and I agree that the entry, even for a relatively short time, still can make a great contribution. Unfortunately, in the scale of things, the number involved is very small.</p>

	<p pid="a.218.5/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. In our recent schools paper, which was passed at our last party conference, we make the point that individual schools should have more power, including the ability to offer higher pay to those who teach shortage subjects. We need to look at pay and conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.5/2">Moving on quickly, I often feel that there is patchy support for newly qualified teachers in this country. Some teachers experience good induction. On a recent visit to Canada with the Children, Schools and Families Committee, I learned that newly qualified teachers receive two years of support, which is much more than we offer.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.5/3">The Department for Children, Schools and Families secondary school curriculum and staffing survey for 2007 shows that only 56 per cent. of pupils in secondary modern schools were taught maths by a teacher with an appropriate post A-level qualification, compared with 73 per cent. in 11-to-16 comprehensives and 88 per cent. in grammar schools. For English, the figures were 66, 74 and 94 per cent. It is a real problem that many young people are not being taught by people with specialist qualifications, and the situation is worse in the most deprived areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.5/4">The survey reveals that children in the poorest areas of the country are least likely to be taught by well-qualified teachers, which indicates not only that there is a need for more highly-qualified teachers, but that there is a particular shortage in the toughest schools. In response to comments made earlier in the debate, I would like to point out that training is needed to deal with challenging behaviour. It is not quite as easy as walking into a job. I am a former teacher, and I have taught in both the state and independent sectors.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-07a.219.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" speakername="Annette Brooke" colnum="219"  time="011:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090707/halltext/90707h0006.htm#09070755000535">
	<p pid="a.219.3/1">I will continue with my speech so that other people have an opportunity to make theirs.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.3/2">A parliamentary question last year revealed that an increasing number of training teachers are having to re-sit basic maths tests. This reinforces some of the points that were made earlier. Since 2001, trainee teachers made 20,000 failed attempts at numeracy tests, and the average number of attempts needed to pass the literacy test has increased by 16 per cent. We all subscribe to raising standards, but, unless the Government play their full part in ensuring good quality entrants to the profession in the first place, some schools and pupils will be disadvantaged.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.3/3">I wonder why the Government's new &pound;10,000 golden handcuff for teachers applies only to secondary schools. Do we not need to attract the best applicants into primary schools in challenging areas, given the importance of basic literacy at the very start?</p>
	<p pid="a.219.3/4">Far more could be done with continuous professional development, and I hope that the new licence to teach will address that, albeit rather belatedly. Since the 2007 survey that I referred to, the problem has not gone away. As Professor John Howson of Education Data Surveys wrote only last week in his most recent assessment of the labour market for teachers, English and art remain two of the more perplexing subjects, with high vacancy numbers compared with the number of trainees. For English, the estimate is that fewer than 1,800 trainees may be competing for more than 2,400 vacancies. It is staggering that we have that shortage, given current market conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.3/5">On lack of training, the Government have followed rather than led. The inclusion agenda, which I am fundamentally in favour of, has been promoted ruthlessly since 1997, but the basic training for teachers has only now been introduced. Teachers coming through the teacher training programme before 2011 will not have received that extra training.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.3/6">[John Cummings <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p pid="a.219.3/7">On standards in general, we need to untangle what real progress has been made from people's lack of confidence that standards have remained constant. We really need Ofqual to be independent. We Liberal Democrats are seriously concerned about whether Ofqual will be genuinely independent and accountable to Parliament, rather than just to the Secretary of State. We have a number of proposals for an educational standards authority, which would guarantee that genuine independence.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.3/8">In conclusion, although I take on board the point about teaching standards, we need to look at a range of barriers that stop children succeeding. Although a lot of progress has been made in respect of the failure to identify and resolve educational problems in early years, the standard of teaching at that stage still has to be developed much further. For example, one in five teachers in the early years foundation stage have only a level 2 qualification. In other words, we have got the most important part&mdash;the starting point&mdash;topsy-turvy and not everybody is able to access higher-level qualifications. On inadequate and inconsistent funding for schools and college with high levels of educational disadvantage, we advocate a pupil premium that would enable money to be found to pay staff higher salaries, if the head teacher and the governors chose to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.3/9">Infant class sizes are too large. The failure to plan properly this year has resulted in 10,000 pupils being in classes with more than 30 pupils. On class size, the Government made a commitment to fund state schools at the same levels as independent schools. What happened to that?</p>
	<p pid="a.219.3/10">In too many schools, leadership and governance is not effective enough. Government targets and micromanagement distort priorities. Teachers are undermined by this centralised approach. The Education and Skills Bill gave Ministers more than 150 new powers. I agree with the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness that all our schools and colleges must have the freedom to innovate.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.3/11">The inappropriate offering of the curriculum, leading to pupils' needs not being met, has made teaching difficult. Teacher training to the national curriculum means that teachers have lost the confidence to be innovative. So we are in a vicious circle at the moment that we need to break out of, because, as hon. Members have said, people remember an inspirational teacher throughout their lives, and we must ensure that we have many more inspirational teachers for children from all backgrounds.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-07a.221.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1429" speakername="Nick Gibb" colnum="221"  time="012:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090707/halltext/90707h0007.htm#09070755000536">
	<p pid="a.221.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase> on securing this important debate and on his excellent, informative speech. I agree with most of the thoughtful speech made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase>, who is clearly passionate about standards and schools in his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/2">The standard of teaching that pupils receive is one of the most decisive and important factors in determining the success of their education. A good teacher can make an enormous difference. The Sanders and Rivers study, mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness, which took place in Tennessee and examined the effect a teacher could have on academic performance, found that if two average ability eight-year-olds were given different teachers, one a high performer and one a low performer, the children's academic performance would diverge by more than 50 per cent. within just three years. Other studies from the UK and the USA have produced similar findings. The Institute for Public Policy Research concluded that a good teacher could improve a child's academic performance by more than a grade level. Those studies show that attracting high-calibre people to the teaching profession is a prerequisite to raising standards, and that in turn means a career in teaching needs to be seen as an interesting and desirable option for top graduates and those who have made a successful career in other fields.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/3">According to Lord Adonis, one key objective of the Teach First programme, which other hon. Members have mentioned, is to reconnect the teaching profession to the top universities. Partly, this undoubtedly comes down to pay. If excellent teachers, including those with prized qualifications such as maths or science degrees, are to be attracted and retained by the profession, they need to be paid in a way that is commensurate with their value to schools. That is why schools&mdash;particularly academies&mdash;should be given the freedom to pay good teachers more.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/4">No one should be in any doubt that we have in our schools in this country some able, highly qualified, highly motivated and first-class teachers. On Mondays, when I visit schools around the country, I meet dedicated teachers with a genuine vocation who are transforming the lives of the children they are teaching. Britain would not be the fifth most successful economy in the world if this were not true. But as my hon. Friend rightly said, we have to be cautious about the future. We need to accept that we face huge challenges. One in five children leaving primary school after seven years are still struggling with reading and 40 per cent. are leaving school without having achieved five or more good GCSEs. Half of all children who qualify for free school meals fail to achieve a single GCSE above grade D.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/5">There are many reasons for these challenges, including the curriculum and ideologically driven pedagogy emanating from the education establishment, but a factor must also be the barriers that mean not enough highly qualified young people are choosing teaching as a career. The first and perhaps most serious of these barriers is pupil behaviour. In March 2008, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers carried out a survey examining this issue. It found that 29 per cent. of all teachers have been punched, kicked or bitten by their pupils. Nearly one in 10 teachers said they had been injured by an aggressive or violent pupil. Crucially, nearly two thirds of teachers said they had considered leaving the profession because of aggressive pupils, verbal abuse and the threat of violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/6">In 2008, the NASUWT compiled a dossier that detailed the violence that teachers had faced, some of which verged on the horrific, including attacks on teachers using knives and scissors and even attacks on pregnant teachers. In light of that, research by the think-tank, Policy Exchange, which found that the principal factor deterring undergraduates from a career in education was</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/7" class="indent">&quot;the fear of feeling unsafe in the classroom&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/8">seems perfectly understandable. Unless the standard of behaviour in our schools improves, the teaching profession will not become a truly welcoming environment for talent.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/9">At the moment, teachers often find it difficult to enforce high standards of behaviour because they lack the powers that they need to keep discipline in the classroom. Teachers should be given far wider powers to search for and confiscate items that are banned by the rules of the school, and not just specified items on a narrow list. We Conservatives joined forces with the Liberals on that point during the Committee stage of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/10">We would allow schools to require home-school contracts to be signed as a condition of admission to a school, which is something long opposed by Labour Ministers over the last 12 years until the 11th hour of this Administration in last week's White Paper. We should abolish the exclusion appeal panels, to enhance the standing of head teachers by removing the ability to second-guess their decisions on discipline. These expensive, stressful and time-consuming appeals procedures are a deterrent for heads, who need to be able to expel persistently disruptive pupils. If a head teacher's decision to exclude a pupil from his or her school were overturned subsequently on appeal, allowing the child to return, that would be in complete defiance of the head teacher's wishes. This system completely undermines the head teacher's authority. I believe that these changes would enhance the ability of staff to keep order in their schools and would help to make teaching a more rewarding profession for prospective teachers.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/11">Of course, the behaviour of pupils is not the only issue. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> said, the curriculum is another important contributory factor, putting off the more academic teacher. The trends toward modularisation, thematic teaching, an outcomes or competence-based curriculum and so-called applied learning all reduce the time spent on engagement with formal, academic knowledge.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/12">The overall standard of many qualifications has been reduced over time, making them less academically challenging and therefore less interesting for able teachers who have a passion for their subject. One subject that has suffered most from this problem is science, particularly at secondary level. Students studying for science GCSEs have in recent years been asked whether they sweat through the skin or the liver and whether they look at the stars through a synthesiser or a telescope. A report by Ofqual in March this year found that the standard of GCSE physics had fallen between 2002 and 2007. Fewer topics were covered and there was a reduction in the number of questions that required complex calculations or several steps to reach an answer. There was also a general reduction in the mathematical demands made of candidates. These findings reinforce the conclusions of a growing body of independent academics, such as Professor Peter Tymms of the university of Durham and the Royal Society of Chemistry, who have demonstrated that the academic standard of science qualifications has fallen over the years.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/13">In addition to that problem, the new 21st-century curriculum replaces the study of scientific concepts with the study of the relationship between science and wider society. That leads to students debating stem cell research without the developed knowledge of biology that they need to appreciate the issues. The Ofqual report specifically picked out that issue when it said that</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/14" class="indent">&quot;candidates were required to discuss the advantages and drawbacks of CCTV, mobile phones and the internet. These may be interesting considerations, but they did not add to the candidates' knowledge and understanding of physics.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/15">In reality, those are not even particularly interesting considerations. Goodness knows whether, in 20 years, we will even have mobile phones or CCTV. They replace the richness and complexity of scientific understanding with a pseudo, superficial learning. The drop in the standard of some science qualifications, with the movement away from teaching scientific concepts, creates a curriculum that is less likely to attract candidates with a genuine passion for their subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/16">That problem is borne out by research into teacher specialisms. An investigation by the university of Buckingham in June 2008 found that 24 per cent. of state schools had no teachers with a specialism in physics. It also found that the number of applicants for physics postgraduate certificate in education courses had dropped by 27 per cent. in 2006. That problem is particularly acute in science, and affects subjects across the curriculum. In June 2008, a paper produced by the National Foundation for Educational Research found:</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/17" class="indent">&quot;Across all subjects, the proportion of lessons being taught by teachers with relevant post A-Level qualifications was slightly lower in 2007 (79 per cent.) than it had been in 2002 (83 per cent.).&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/18">If we want to reverse that trend and encourage more graduates with relevant degrees into teaching, we must revive the academic value of the curriculum so that it is firmly focused on knowledge, concepts and ideas. At the same time, we must work to encourage individuals with a real affinity for their subject into the profession.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-07a.235.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" speakername="Jim Knight" speakeroffice="The Minister for Employment"  colnum="235"  time="012:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090707/halltext/90707h0009.htm#09070755000551">
	<p pid="a.235.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1717" name="Siobhain McDonagh">the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh)</phrase> on securing the debate. I am sorry that she has, as we have just heard, a long list of complaints, and that she feels that the people who work in Mitcham jobcentre are ill equipped and have, at times, a poor attitude. I pay tribute to the 54 staff who work there. They deal with 3,000 claimants a month and, according to the measures that I have seen, they do a good job in one of the top-performing jobcentres in one of the top-performing districts in the country. That is why my hon. Friend's remarks are of great concern to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/2">In the period in which she has represented her constituents my hon. Friend has, I know, had by and large a good relationship with the jobcentre; she has visited several times and has been assiduous in representing her constituents there. I hope that she will continue to feel able to raise individual cases directly with the local manager. Obviously, staff are currently dealing with an increased footfall of people coming to use the services, as a result of the global recession.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/3">The most devastating effect of any recession is its impact on families and individuals. When someone loses their job it can create a domino effect, leading to uncertainty around home life and putting stress on relationships. It can be a very worrying time, which is why the Government put such emphasis on getting people back into work. Similarly, for people trying to get back on their feet, people who have been out of work for a long period, or those who need help in finding appropriate child care or managing a health condition, the recession can make those first steps into a job just a little harder, as competition for work increases.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/4">For the Government, unemployment will never be a price worth paying. That is why we have invested an additional &pound;3 billion in Jobcentre Plus services since November. That extra money means that Jobcentre Plus has been able to recruit 7,000 staff and will add a further 9,000 to its work force by October. Staff have been recruited on the basis of local need.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/5">In the last decade unemployment in Mitcham fell to historically low levels. At its lowest point, at the end of 2007, 2.1 per cent of the local population was unemployed. As a result of the global recession, that has crept up; it now stands at 3.8 per cent. However, it is worth noting that although youth claimant unemployment has increased by 1 per cent., long-term youth claimant unemployment has fallen by 75 per cent. since 1997, which shows that Jobcentre Plus is turning even young people around quickly and getting them back into work. The employment rate has risen in Mitcham by 5.6 per cent., and the number claiming lone parent benefit has fallen by 16 per cent. A long list of statistics shows that in Mitcham, as elsewhere in the country, the service has been effective in helping people back into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/6">As I said, the number of staff in Mitcham has been increased from 44 to 54. As of yesterday, it extended its opening hours by one hour and will now stay open until 6 pm, Monday to Friday. Those additional resources mean that, despite increased demand for services in Mitcham, new claimants still get a first interview within three days and new claims will be processed in just over 10 days. Investment in Mitcham will continue. A further nine staff have been recruited and are expected to start work before September.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/7">We have demonstrated that Jobcentre Plus is able to adapt to current economic circumstances and deal with the increased number of customers. Indeed, despite twice as many people claiming jobseeker's allowance as claimed it two years ago, benefits are paid sooner and half of new claimants still leave JSA within three months. Significantly, the changes that we made over the past decade meant that when the recession hit we were able to respond to the new demands, delivering all the new help that has been developed as well as the ongoing support that we are giving to disadvantaged groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/8">We are determined not to repeat the mistakes made in previous recessions, when many people were left to fend for themselves and expectations on them were lowered. For example, in the early 1980s, the conditionality for unemployment benefit was relaxed so that it was no longer necessary to register at a jobcentre to receive benefit, and it is estimated that the claimant count in 1986 would have been as much as 4 percentage points higher if that had not been the case. A similar increase in the claimant count today would equate to about &pound;4.5 billion of benefit expenditure. It is estimated that the active measures that we have taken during the recession have resulted in unemployment being 500,000 lower than would have been the case if we had done nothing.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/9">I am concerned that my hon. Friend feels that people in Mitcham and Morden are not getting the high level of support that she and I would want. Mitcham Jobcentre Plus has four lone parent advisers. I know that lone parents are a great concern of my hon. Friend; she regularly speaks about them in the House. Those advisers are specially qualified, and trained to recognise the particular barriers faced by lone parents and to help them gain access to additional support so that they can get back into work. A vast programme of comprehensive training helps Jobcentre Plus advisers to understand the pressures on lone parents; it includes a one-day workshop delivered by the lobby group Gingerbread, which has particular expertise in the subject. It seeks to break down stereotypes and educate advisers on the particular child care problems that lone parents face.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/10">The Government are committed to ensuring that their policies support the well-being of children and families. Only last week, in the other place the Government introduced a series of amendments to the Welfare Reform Bill that do just that. They set in primary legislation the fact that the well-being of a child must be taken into account when a jobseeker's agreement or action plan is drawn up with a parent, and that victims of domestic violence will be exempt from meeting jobseeker's allowance conditions for the first three months. We have included a commitment in the Bill that those conditions will not be extended to parents of children under three years of age.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-07a.239.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1905" speakername="Edward Vaizey" colnum="239"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090707/halltext/90707h0009.htm#09070755000554">
	<p pid="a.239.1/1">I am grateful, Mr. Cummings, for the opportunity to raise this important issue; it has affected thousands of people who have lost millions of pounds in savings. I think that this is the first time that the matter has been raised properly in the House, and it provides an opportunity for a Treasury Minister to respond to the issues, although it is a mild disappointment that we have only half an hour for this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/2">In November last year, I was contacted by Peter Howard, a constituent of mine, who bought a structured savings product from NDFA financial advisers and subsequently lost all the money that he invested&mdash;&pound;50,000&mdash;when Lehman Brothers, which it transpired had backed the product, was declared bankrupt. Structured products are a type of bond tied to the performance of other investments and sold by specialised subsidiaries based in tax havens. I do not pretend to understand the full complexity of the products&mdash;if I did, I would probably be living in a tax haven myself.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/3">A number of issues arise out of Mr. Howard's personal catastrophe and that of many thousands of British citizens like him. First, NDFA, and other financial advisers, had advertised the structured product as 100 per cent. capital secure. Even I, with my layman's understanding of financial products, understand what that means and, more importantly, what it is meant to mean to those considering buying such a product. Investors were led to believe that their savings would be entirely safe. Comments such as, &quot;100 per cent. capital secure&quot;, &quot;full return of capital maturity&quot; and &quot;capital growth without risk to your capital&quot; are found 17 times in some plans, as opposed to one misleading, confusing and complicated risk warning found in the middle of the accompanying documentation.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/4">Secondly, the fact that the product was backed by Lehman Brothers was hidden. When Mr. Howard bought the product, Lehman Brothers was already in trouble, and its involvement would have been a material fact that could have affected his decision to invest. Thirdly, many investors who expressed any concern about the return of capital, or asked their advisers whether there was any risk, however remote, to their capital, were told&mdash;misleadingly&mdash;that the product was covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/5">As I have mentioned, Mr. Howard is not alone; 6,000 British investors have lost their savings, and the total amount saved and lost is &pound;200 million. A Mr. Moist invested &pound;200,000 that he had made from the sale of his business. He told his Member of Parliament that he asked his adviser, Lloyds bank, what would happen if the bank went bust, and was told not to worry. Others have lost their nest eggs, redundancy payments and lump sums from their pensions. It is a personal catastrophe for many thousands of individuals. Many colleagues have constituents who have been affected, which is why a longer debate would have been preferable. Any constituent who has contacted their Member of Parliament should not be concerned by their absence today&mdash;many have been in touch with me, and we are in constant communication on the matter. They will be following up this debate. Fifty-four hon. Members have signed my early-day motion 1432 on this subject, which reveals the extent of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/6">Indeed, this is a global phenomenon, with tens of thousands of people affected and street demonstrations in places as far afield as Hong Kong and Hamburg. I first contacted the Treasury on this matter in November 2008, and finally received a reply, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-15">15 April 2009</phrase>, from Lord Myners, the Financial Services Secretary. Colleagues will not be surprised that the letter begins:</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/7" class="indent">&quot;I am sorry for the delay in replying&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/8">He then states that the</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/9" class="indent">&quot;FSA is working closely with PwC, the Lehman administrators, to gain a full understanding of the numbers of investors affected by this issue&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/10">The letter goes on to set out the standard procedure for investors who feel that they have been misled: to complain to the firm that sold them the product and then to the financial ombudsman&mdash;in other words, the Treasury washed its hands of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/11">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-27">27 October 2008</phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1422" name="Andrew Robathan">the Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan)</phrase> also wrote to the Treasury, and received a reply on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-22">22 April 2009</phrase>, again from Lord Myners, in which he elaborated and said that the Financial Services Authority was</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/12" class="indent">&quot;considering the marketing material and risk disclosures in communications issued for the products affected...The FSCS protects investors against fraud and negligence by authorised investments companies and financial advisers, but not poor investment performance&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/13">I slightly admire Lord Myners' use of the phrase, &quot;poor investment performance&quot;. It reminds me of the &quot;Monty Python&quot; sketch about a dead parrot. &quot;Poor investment performance&quot; is an understatement when someone invests &pound;200,000 in a product advertised as 100 per cent. capital secure and then wakes up some weeks later to find that their investment is worth precisely zero. But &quot;poor investment performance&quot; is the phrase that the Treasury likes to use in this case.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/14">In a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-04">4 December 2008</phrase>, the FSA makes it clear that people who have lost their money in this way</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/15" class="indent">&quot;are not eligible to claim for compensation from the FSCS&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/16">because their contract was with the financial adviser and not with Lehman Brothers. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-19">19 March 2009</phrase>, the FSA indicated what it was doing to investigate the matter. NDFA, in Mr. Howard's case, had maintained that it had been told by Lehman Brothers that it was prohibited, under EU law, from naming it as the underlying provider of the product. The FSA states that it is</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/17" class="indent">&quot;currently looking in detail at marketing literature...at the adequacy and sufficiency of the risk and product disclosure&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/18">although it continues to maintain that the FSCS does not cover this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/19">NDFA has tried to defend itself by attacking the investors who have lost money, saying that their campaign is an attack on the financial services industry at large, which should give us all cause for concern. Too right! As <i>BusinessWeek </i>reported on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-06">6 May</phrase>, Lehman Brothers Treasury sold $35 billion of dubious bonds to small investors in Europe and Asia. It reports that brokers in Asia</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/20" class="indent">&quot;plied small investors, a few of them mentally ill, with free digital cameras and flat-screen televisions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/21">That is not the way that we want the financial services industry or financial advisers to behave. So this is an attack on the industry and NDFA and other cavalier advisers like them. NDFA and other advisers sold these products and they cannot simply walk away. As another adviser put it,</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/22" class="indent">&quot;we also don't run with terms which seem too good to be true... Both Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers pushed for business and offered fantastic terms but we declined&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/23">The product was inherently unsafe, devised by a greedy bank and misleadingly sold by greedy financial advisers to people for whom it was inherently unsuitable.</p>
