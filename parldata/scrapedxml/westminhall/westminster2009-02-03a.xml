<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-03a.220.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" speakername="Jo Swinson" colnum="220"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090203/halltext/90203h0010.htm#0902037000583">
	<p pid="a.220.1/1">I am pleased to have secured this debate, and I welcome the opportunity to put concerns to the Minister on behalf of my constituents. However, it is regrettable that so long after the identification of the problems with the tax credit system, mistakes are still occurring and even getting worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/2">Difficulties with tax credits cause stress and heartache at the best of times, but in this time of economic hardship, sudden demands for repayment could be enough to push many families over the financial edge. It is therefore more important than ever that the Government act to reduce the misery caused to families across Britain by the maladministration of tax credits.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/3">The fundamental problem with the administration of tax credits is that the system is too complicated. It is not only claimants who find it difficult to understand what their entitlements are; Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs officials have found the system so difficult to administer that an endless catalogue of mistakes has resulted in the loss of more than &pound;14 billion of public money through overpayments, fraud and error since April 2003. If the system is not simplified, that figure will surely continue to rise. In this short debate, I will highlight three major problems with tax credits: overpayments, underpayments and the worrying non-claiming of tax credits by many who are eligible.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/4">In 2006-07, one in five families claiming tax credits was overpaid, which means that some 1.2 million families were overpaid a total of &pound;1.1 billion by HMRC. In the past four years, nearly 2 million families have been overpaid more than once, and some 60,000 have been overpaid three or more times. Although the Government have acknowledged that there is a problem, the figures indicate that it has not been addressed. On the contrary, it has got worse: 400,000 more families were overpaid last year than the year before. The parliamentary ombudsman has referred to the situation as systematic maladministration.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/5">Let us be clear about the situation that people are in. After filling in all the forms and providing all the information requested, their lives are made a little easier by tax credit payments. Then one day, out of the blue, a letter drops through the door demanding the repayment of a large sum. Understandably, many families are shocked and anxious when they read such a letter.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/6">The average overpayment in 2006-07 was &pound;916, which is a considerable amount, especially when one considers that most claimants are families on low incomes. For many families, the overpayment is several thousand pounds, which is an unthinkable sum for a working family to have to find suddenly. Some of my constituents have been in that situation. One constituent wrote to me and said that they were &quot;traumatised&quot;. That is an intense word to use, but it describes what people feel when a financial bombshell is suddenly dropped on them. Dealing with the tax credit office can involve many phone calls and letters. A common feeling was summed up by one of my constituents who wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/7" class="indent">&quot;I am completely frustrated and disillusioned.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/8">Elizabeth O'Brien is a single mother in my constituency. When her son left school in 2005 and she continued to receive tax credits, she immediately contacted the tax credit office, both by phone and in writing, to check whether she was still eligible. Despite her efforts to keep the tax credit office informed of her situation, she was eventually overpaid &pound;1,982.92.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/9">Mrs. O'Brien was distressed when she came to my surgery and explained that she was having difficulty affording the repayments. She has even had to cancel her monthly &pound;8 union subscription. It is somewhat ironic that the policies of a Labour Government are leaving people unable to afford their union dues. Although the tax credit office was responsible for Mrs. O'Brien's overpayment, it refused to write it off so, at the rate of &pound;25 a month, she will be paying for the tax credit office's mistake until 2015. That is not an isolated case. The need for continual updates to claimants' information has caused huge difficulties. Surely it would be simpler to have a system of payments fixed on a six-monthly basis to reduce the risk of miscalculation.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/10">The system is so complex that even the tax credit office cannot seem to work out how much people are due. Another couple in my constituency, Mr. and Mrs. MacMillan, have received a number of contradictory letters. I have copies of two award notices&mdash;from <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-10">10 November 2006</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-06">6 December 2006</phrase>&mdash;that list exactly the same income for the couple, but give different award amounts. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-10">10 November</phrase>, the award was &pound;3,026.06, but less than a month later, using exactly the same information, the award was calculated as more than &pound;1,000 lower, at &pound;1,897.66. If the tax credit office cannot decide how much people are due, how on earth can ordinary people be expected to work it out? That, however, is exactly what the Government ask people to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/11">It is not uncommon for scanning or input errors at the tax credit office to result in overpayments. My constituent, Mrs. Gallacher, was overpaid almost &pound;5,000 after the tax credit office incorrectly recorded her and her husband's income as &pound;340 rather than the correct amount of about &pound;30,000. Although she had provided accurate information from the start, she did not spot the tax credit office's mistake, and the overpayments continued for more than two years. Mrs. Gallacher is a carer and her husband is a teacher. They have had to remortgage their house and are struggling on their current income, so the repayments demanded by the tax credit office are making life even more difficult for them. Like many others, they are unable to sell their home because of the present market. I wrote to the tax credit office about their case in December, but have so far received no response, and the money continues to be recovered. That couple now face the possible repossession of their home as a result of those problems. I would be grateful if the Minister would agree to look into that particular case and get an answer for my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/12">More generally, I ask the Minister to offer all claimants a statutory right of appeal against overpayments and to write off overpayments that result from official errors. If nothing else, that might be an incentive for the tax credit office to get things right. In cases in which the tax credit office, not the claimant, has made an error, surely the office should carry the burden of proof, instead of expecting claimants to identify its mistakes.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/13">Another of my constituents, Clare Robertson, was able to resolve problems with an overpayment, but then found, when she went to the cash point one day, that &pound;6,000 had been put into her account with no explanation or warning. Given her past experience, she was understandably suspicious. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/14" class="indent">&quot;I was yet again left in a state of shock and disbelief. Not being able to obtain any details relating to the transaction until Monday morning I once again had a worrying weekend. It transpired that the money was an automatic pay in from Tax Credits for an amount oustanding! I feel the manner in which this institute deals with people's lives and emotions is disgusting. First of all I am facing legal proceedings with an amount of approximately &pound;10,000 now I receive &pound;6,000 with no explanation or warning. I don't think my nerves can take much more.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/15">These cases demonstrate that whether a mistake has been made by the claimant or the tax credit office, and even when the claimant has diligently contacted the tax credit office to point out its mistakes, the claimant is still made to suffer, often through many years of repayment. At a time when the Government are keen to be seen as cracking down on benefit fraud, this system provides a disincentive to claimants to demonstrate honesty in coming forward when a mistake has been made. More and more families are being taken to court over this issue by HMRC, and the average number of court cases each month in this tax year is nine times higher than that in the previous year. Between April and October 2008, 5,697 families were taken to court to recover money that was lost through overpayments, and all at the expense of the taxpayer. Not only is HMRC so cavalier with taxpayers' money that it pays out too much to more than a million families, but it then compounds its mistakes by starting thousands of costly court actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/16">Overpayments are not the only problem&mdash;there are also many underpayments. Since 2003, 3.3 million people have been underpaid tax credits; again, those mistakes have often happened multiple times. Some 555,000 families have been underpaid more than once, and 82,000 have been underpaid three times or more. In 2006-07, 135,000 families were underpaid by more than &pound;1,000, and 326,000 families on an annual income of less than &pound;15,000 were underpaid. Missing out on &pound;1,000 of income would be extremely difficult at the best of times, but in the current economic climate, the impact will be felt even more deeply. Hard-pressed families deserve that money and need it to buy basic groceries and children's clothes, and to pay essential household bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/17">In 2004-05, HMRC estimated that only 61 per cent. of eligible families claimed working tax credit and that 82 per cent. claimed child tax credit. Some of the people who are not claiming simply do not know that they are eligible, while others say that the claim procedure is too complicated. Perhaps most worryingly still, others, including some of my constituents, have claimed tax credits in the past but have decided not to do so again because they had such a bad experience the first time. A system that was meant to help people has proved so frustrating and worrying, and caused so much misery, that people are now reluctant to claim. That is a truly damning indictment of the tax credit system.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/18">In 2001, when the Government announced the introduction of the working tax credit and the child tax credit, the then Paymaster General, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" name="Dawn Primarolo">the right hon. Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo)</phrase>, announced in a press release:</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/19" class="indent">&quot;The Government is delivering on its promise to introduce a new streamlined system of tax credits&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/20">and</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/21" class="indent">&quot;will provide a secure stream of income for children, whether parents are in or out of work&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/22">However, it became clear early on that the system was not as streamlined as promised, and in 2005 the right hon. Lady announced:</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/23" class="indent">&quot;The Government has looked to learn from the early operation of the system and will continue to do so.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/24">The cases I have described and many others like them clearly demonstrate that, more than three years on, the complexity of the tax credit system is still a fundamental flaw. If the Government's objective was to provide a secure income stream for families with children, they have, by their own standards, failed. As the cases I have cited show, claimants feel anything but secure. Why has the application system not been simplified to eradicate the problems that the tax credit office is having in processing them correctly? Given the complexity of a system in which nine out of 10 families are eligible for some means-tested tax credits, would not it be more sensible and cost-effective to use the existing universal benefits system? Will the Minister at least consider an official review of the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the present system?</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/25">I conclude with the words of one of the many people who have suffered at the hands of the tax credit system. After one of my constituents had the particularly harrowing experience of receiving a letter from the tax credit office demanding &pound;17,000, she wrote to me stating:</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/26" class="indent">&quot;I wish I had never received family tax credits and not because I do not think it's a wonderful concept, but because of the way it is implemented. This has to stop.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/27">I quite agree, and I look forward to the Government's response.</p>
