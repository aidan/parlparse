	<p pid="b.77.2/1">Motion made, and Question proposed, That the sitting be now adjourned.&mdash;[Tony Cunningham.]</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.77.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" speakername="Tony Lloyd" colnum="77"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h01.htm#60301h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.77.3/1">A few moments ago, I was concerned because we had no Minister with us. I think that the odds were 15 to 2 on him appearing on time.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.3/2">This debate is rightly entitled &quot;Regional Casinos&quot; because the compromise reached before the last general election when the Gambling Bill went through Parliament was that the number of regional casinos&mdash;the largest to be allowed to operate&mdash;would be restricted to one. Previously, there had been considerable debate about numbers. It may help if I say at the outset that a partial objective of this debate is to argue the case that it is in the interest of Britain as a whole that we increase the number of regional casinos, rather than restrict their number to one. That would allow a better scale of response to the experimentation that they represent.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.77.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1972" speakername="John McFall" colnum="77"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h01.htm#60301h01_spnew1">
	<p pid="b.77.4/1">Does my hon. Friend accept that there is a compelling case for having eight regional casinos? That would give local authorities unparalleled opportunities for local regeneration. If they engage the local communities who go along with the process, that would be best for the people and the authorities.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.77.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" speakername="Tony Lloyd" colnum="77"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h01.htm#60301h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.77.5/1">My right hon. Friend invites me on to territory that I will certainly get to later on. His point is central to the case throughout the whole nation; we need to consider the numbers. For the record, it is worth reminding Members that the Government have established a casino panel chaired by Professor Stephen Crow. On the instructions of the Secretary of State, it will ensure that locations satisfy the need for the best possible test of social impact, which may require a range of locations of different kinds, such as seaside resorts, edge-of-town developments or inner city centres. Those locations will also include areas in need of regeneration, as measured by unemployment and other social deprivation data, that may be likely to benefit from a new casino.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.5/2">It is worth restating that point because it is the framework within which the case for Manchester can be put&mdash;I want to put the case for my own city as a location of a regional casino&mdash;but it is also the basis for the case that says that one regional casino will not be enough, as    <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1972" name="John McFall">my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (Mr. McFall)</phrase> argued. I would like to put the case that we should move towards the eight casinos to which my right hon. Friend referred, which was the number in the Gambling Bill when it was first put before the House.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.77.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" speakername="Graham Stringer" colnum="77"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h01.htm#60301h01_spnew3">
	<p pid="b.77.6/1">I am following the profound logic of what my hon. Friend is saying. Does he agree that it is not possible to test the social impact in just one place? A seaside town is very different from a major city. London is different from the rest of the United Kingdom. Suburban areas are different, and Scotland is different. The logic of testing social impact implies up to eight regional casinos, so that we can understand what would happen.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.78.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" speakername="Tony Lloyd" colnum="78"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h01.htm#60301h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="b.78.0/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. He will share the logic of the case for a casino in Manchester, which is profound in itself, but he would also share the logic that it makes sense to consider the case for more. We need a proper base to examine the impact of regional casinos, as well as that of the large and small ones. We need that base because regional casinos are different in scale to such an extent that it is difficult to argue that experimentation with large casinos would allow us to know the potential future impact of regional casinos. We need to know specifically how to effect proper partnerships between local authorities&mdash;the holders of the public interest&mdash;and private partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.0/2">We need to consider the commercial viability of regional casinos. We need to consider what we mean by regeneration opportunities and how they can be seriously translated into practice. And, of course, we need to consider how we can minimise and avoid the potential hazards, such as the existence of criminality in casinos, the abuse of those who are underage and questions of problem gambling. Those issues are all central and can only be dealt with if we have a range of regional casinos so that we can establish what is best practice.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.78.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" speakername="John Robertson" colnum="78"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h01.htm#60301h01_spnew5">
	<p pid="b.78.1/1">My hon. Friend, like me, represents a city where deprivation and unemployment are high compared with the rest of the country. Does he agree that although we need a diverse pilot to consider all the different areas of the country, and although regeneration and the need for jobs and employment have to be taken into account, there has to be some kind of guidance and unionisation? Ensuring unionisation in such casinos will go a long way to solving some of the problems that people keep putting forward.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.78.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" speakername="Tony Lloyd" colnum="78"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h01.htm#60301h01_spnew6">
	<p pid="b.78.2/1">As my hon. Friend would expect, since we both have a strong background in trade unions, I expect any casinos in Britain to operate by the best standards of employment practice, which include, of course, a role for trade unions. That is good for those who work there and, in the long run, for the casino operators and their relationship with the wider community.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.78.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="78"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h01.htm#60301h01_spnew7">
	<p pid="b.78.3/1">The debate seems likely to develop into many interventions and speeches urging the Minister to expand the number of casinos in the pilot. Through my hon. Friend, may I urge the Minister not to do that? In some ways, the Minister is a political croupier in charge of the decision. The option that was decided a few months ago was correct, and the Methodist Church and the Salvation Army were correct. Therefore, as political croupier, I hope that the Minister will say in his winding-up speech, &quot;Rien ne va plus&quot;.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.79.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" speakername="Tony Lloyd" colnum="79"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h01.htm#60301h01_spnew8">
	<p pid="b.79.0/1">I am not sure of my hon. Friend's Norman French. I can only say to him that&mdash;alas&mdash;although he exhorts me to urge the Minister to restrict the number, I cannot agree with him. My right hon. Friend the Minister will have heard his comments, but I hope that he will listen more to the louder voices from elsewhere in this debate.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.79.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" speakername="Joan Humble" colnum="79"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h01.htm#60301h01_spnew9">
	<p pid="b.79.1/1">I am a Member of Parliament for Blackpool, one of the tourist resorts that wants one of these casinos. I listened to my hon. Friend listing the organisations that should determine where the casinos should be, but does he agree that local people should also be consulted? To pick up on an earlier intervention, the local community needs to be fully behind the process so that the regeneration potential can be maximised.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="b.79.2/1">I agree strongly with my hon. Friend and shall make the case as to why that applies to my city of Manchester and its preferred location for a regional casino. She makes a point that applies wherever casinos should be located: they should have fundamental local support.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.79.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1518" speakername="Jim Cunningham" colnum="79"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h01.htm#60301h01_spnew11">
	<p pid="b.79.3/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on getting this debate this morning. He will be aware that if any of the schemes went ahead and the numbers increased, there would be strong regulation, with built-in safeguards that would allay a lot of fears people have about casinos, particularly in relation to young people. Is he aware that we already have a casino in Coventry, which would meet the criteria should the Minister and the Government decide to expand the numbers? We have one at the arena in Coventry, which is a very modem arena&mdash;probably one of the latest in the country&mdash;and we already have 90,000 sq ft that could accommodate a casino right away. The area where it would be located&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.79.7/1">I will in time, but it will be in everybody's interests if I try to make a little progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.7/2">It is already quite obvious, with some opposition, that the significant view in this debate is from people who want to see the number of casinos increased towards eight or whatever. That call exists not only among people in the debate, but on a much wider basis. It is important to recognise that other political parties as well as my own have begun to examine that question.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.7/3">My right hon. Friend the Minister has not gone so far as to say that he will change Government policy&mdash;the official position. However, he said on the record recently:</p>
	<p pid="b.79.7/4" class="indent">&quot;I was interested to read that the Opposition are prepared to revisit the issue of the number of regional casinos, and it would be interesting if they were to let us know how far they would go with liberalisation.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 442, c. 3.]</p>
	<p pid="b.79.7/5">He went on to say that the Government themselves wanted to examine what the wider scale of interest in a change would be, so that he could assess whether there was that national demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.7/6">I shall come to the main Opposition party's position shortly. It is probably worth placing on record, however, that in a debate on casinos in the House of Lords in October last year, Lord Clement Jones of the Liberal Democrats made their position clear:</p>
	<p pid="b.79.7/7" class="indent">&quot;If the Casino Advisory Panel recommends up to eight regional casinos, and if that decision is informed by the principle of destination gambling, we would be prepared to support an order incorporating that provision.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, </i>House of Lords, <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-24">24 October 2005</phrase>; Vol. 674, c.GC257.]</p>
	<p pid="b.79.7/8">That was a very helpful statement on behalf of the Liberal Democrats.</p>

	<p pid="b.80.5/4">We know that he was pulled back by the then Leader of the Opposition. The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford went on to say:</p>

	<p pid="b.80.5/6">The hon. Gentleman is normally seen as a cerebral and intelligent Member of our House, and as someone who takes issues on their merits and so on. Within that context, I welcome his clear commitment that one is no longer a viable number.</p>

There was an off-the-record briefing reported by Matthew Garrahan in the <i>Financial Times </i>the following day. It was confirmed in spirit by other people who were at the seminar. The hon.

I shall make it slightly embarrassing for him, because the real Tory party, which still wins things in the country, and I refer to Ken Taylor, the leader of Coventry city council, makes the same case as my hon.

They are not taking account of the considerable weight of evidence that says that the economic benefits will not benefit those local communities and that the social cost will be extremely high. Those casinos will rely on slot machines. That is where they will make their money, and that means local people putting their money into slot machines. Regeneration will not happen, and there is much evidence to support that argument.</p>

	<p pid="b.83.7/1">The hon. Gentleman accuses me of party politicking, but when the Opposition make it so easy, it is difficult not to ridicule their position with its total lack of clarity and its continual change. The hon. Gentleman should talk to his Front Bench and ask his leadership to sort out its policy. Is their position that of Ken Taylor in Coventry?</p>
	<p pid="b.83.7/2">A number of hon. Members, but not many who are here today, have asked about the regeneration impact and doubted whether it would translate into practice. During my remaining few moments, I want to refer to a report from Europe Economics. So that there is no ambiguity, I should explain that Europe Economics is an independent consultancy and was commissioned by Manchester city council, which wanted an independent assessment of the impact of regional casinos.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.7/3">Europe Economics made a number of methodological points that are worth stating because they are interesting to a wide audience. It made the central point that any proposal from a local authority had to have a credible local authority behind it. At one level that is obvious, but not all local authorities have the capacity to deliver such complicated and important projects if they are to deliver the benefits that those of us who support regional casinos want. It made the point that any regional casino would need to demonstrate commercial viability. That is also obvious at one level because without commercial viability the regeneration process that should follow cannot be delivered.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.7/4">The regeneration process is fundamental. My hon. Friend the Minister and the Secretary of State made it clear to the panel that that regeneration will be a central part of the process and that the regeneration impact must be demonstrated. It concluded by saying that, not least in the hierarchical sense but after the other issues had been examined, there would have to be a proper examination of the social impact&mdash;some hon. Members have raised this with me&mdash;in terms of issues such as the absence of criminality from casinos which is important, the prevention of under-age entry to casinos and gaming areas, and forestalling increases in problem gambling.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.7/5">Those issues are important as part of the methodological approach, and I hope that the panel will adopt them because it is important that we have the reassurance of a sound methodology. However, it was slightly patronising of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1759" name="Stewart Jackson">the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson)</phrase> to talk about the lower socio-economic groups as being those who might be caught up in problem gambling.</p>

	<p pid="b.84.1/1">I am totally aware of what the hon. Gentleman means. I represent a constituency that is composed largely of people from those groups and my constituents would probably regard with disdain the idea that they are fickle and feckless and that only people like the hon. Gentleman are immune to the problem. He should be careful in his choice of language if he wants to pursue that case. However, there is a real issue concerning problem gambling and we must all address it.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/2">We are confident that Manchester's bid is based on sound economics as well as a sound social strategy. The casino would be in Sports City, which is in my constituency. That is why I sought this debate. Sports City is already a successful part of regeneration in Manchester. It houses the new east Manchester stadium, the home of Manchester City's football ground, and is where the Commonwealth games took place. We have demonstrated in that area that economic and social regeneration follows economic investment and if the two are matched sensibly and intelligently, they can have a profound impact on the delivery of sustainable economic growth and the restoration of sustainability in our communities. Of those hon. Members who look down on the lower socio-economic groups, few would know what east Manchester was like when the Labour Government took office and about the transformation that has taken place since.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/3">The proposal for a casino would result in investment of around &pound;250 million&mdash;that is large-scale investment&mdash;and the creation initially of around 2,300 jobs, 900 of which would be targeted on the very local community. That is important as part of the development not simply of the viability but of the popularity of a regional casino in the local community. On the back of that, there would be a centre of excellence for the training of people in the hospitality and customer care industries. Again, that is important in a city such as Manchester where the service economy is so dominant. That would grow from the development as a second-round impact, which is important to the regeneration debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/4">There would be community access to local sports and community groups because sporting facilities would be part of the casino complex. The city and would-be developers are committed to an independent analysis and practical methods to tackle the potential downside of a casino. I am confident that the package would be good for my constituency, my city and my part of my region.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/5">Some hon. Members are opposed to regional casinos. That is fine. They are entitled to pursue their arguments and to debate them thoroughly. Their position is legitimate. What is very different is though for most of the rest of us, I believe, is the numbers game. To return to my theme, is it possible to have proper experimentation with regional casinos if there is only one? My central case is that there is a good economic and regeneration argument for regional casinos, but it can be properly examined only if we increase the number from one at present to somewhere around the eight originally envisaged, so that we as a nation can properly assess the impact of casinos in our national life.</p>

	<p pid="b.85.1/1">I was on the Joint Committee that gave the Gambling Bill some pre-legislative scrutiny, so I know more about this topic than I wanted to. To some extent, I approached it with scepticism, as I could never understand why a socialist Government, whom one supposed would at some time want to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor, would wish to encourage gambling, which seems to do exactly the reverse. However, the Bill was defended rigorously in the House with the suggestion that the prospect of regeneration was attached to it, plus, of course, and not to be missed, the prospect of a certain amount of voluntary taxation being paid by the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/2">None the less, it has been accepted throughout that casinos are problematic. First, they are not necessary for regeneration, and, secondly, even as vehicles for regeneration, they have mixed effects. Yes, they create employment, but they also knock out many local businesses, which are replaced by big concerns.</p>

	<p pid="b.86.1/1">One does not agree with absolutely every word of every report with which one is associated. I am unconvinced, and, when we visited Blackpool, the hon. Lady's constituency, some of the smaller retailers and hoteliers were not completely convinced that they would benefit from the development as designed, as they would be forced out of business by better and more profitable concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/2">We all accept that the proposals must be examined carefully, both as a package and specifically in respect of Blackpool. That point was persistently made. The issue is not just about gambling but many other entertainment industries that would benefit the population and community of Blackpool and the region at large. There was widespread agreement that we needed to make a distinction between destination gambling and ambient gambling, and that was part of the argument against extending the number of casinos.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/3">The second limit put on the process during the course of the Gambling Bill was purely numerical. To some extent, it was determined by fears about social consequences and by a laudable desire to proceed cautiously, and it was embodied in the term &quot;regional casino&quot;. A regional casino may carry the tacit presumption that there should be one casino per region, but it may also carry the assumption that it is a regional draw&mdash;that whatever is created, whether in Blackpool or anywhere else, is a draw throughout the region and perhaps in other regions as well. Either way, the assumption was that the market should not control the process and that criteria should be set, although throughout the entire debate there was almost an underlying assumption that, whatever was decided, Blackpool would succeed because it was the most preferred. It lobbied extremely well on its own behalf, it had no plan B for regeneration, and everyone accepted that something had to be done.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/4">A panel has been set up to run a kind of beauty contest. Two things are unclear to me, and they lead to the two points that I want to make. First, as the panel proceeds, is the extent of public subsidy a relevant consideration? Regeneration money for the north-west or anywhere else is limited. If it goes to one place, it cannot go to another. I have said in many debates on this subject that, on the continent, public subsidy is not to the fore. In fact, it is more the reverse: money from gambling concerns goes into the public coffers and public infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/5">I have tried to find out the intentions of the Northwest regional development agency in this affair. It is supportive and sends me brochures and an enormous amount of data on a regular basis. However, it has not confided in me its strategic investment plan: that is, what money, and how much, it wishes to put in, or where and when. That being said, neither does it tell us a variety of other things that we in the north-west would like to find out about, such as funding for such important things as a second Mersey crossing or the Liverpool docks. Such important financial data are largely obscure to democratic representatives in the north-west. What the agency favours and refers to on many occasions are transformational projects. That jargon of the moment seems to mean any project to which is attached high publicity and big expense.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/6">In judging where casinos should go, how much of a genuine concern is public subsidy? How much does it count against any particular proposal, and is it considered when proposals are evaluated?</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/7">The second thing that is unclear to me is the regional casino concept itself. Is a casino for a region, or does it draw people to a region? If it is the former, east Manchester and Blackpool certainly compete head to head. There could be a debate about whether we have one or the other, or whether there is room for both. However, if the case for Blackpool is that it will draw people UK-wide and perhaps internationally, right across the piece&mdash;to some extent, that is part of the argument for significant public investment to assist the venture&mdash;and will not draw in housewives from Barrow, Blackburn and other places, with all the possible social damage that that may cause, the argument for Blackpool and against Manchester does not work. It seems to illustrate a bias against regeneration in Manchester and in favour of regeneration in Blackpool, and it is difficult to make that case coherently, or to demonstrate that it is right.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/8">I am not asking the Government to change their policy, but I defy them to explain it clearly.</p>

	<p pid="b.87.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> on securing this debate on an important, albeit controversial, subject. The provisions in the Gambling Act 2005 were based on the presumption that casinos could act as a catalyst for regeneration in certain circumstances, bringing significant economic and social benefits. Equally, concerns were voiced about the potential negative impact. In the light of those concerns, the decision was taken to reduce the number of regional casinos from the original proposition of eight to just one.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.87.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" speakername="Nick Raynsford" colnum="87"  time="010:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h01.htm#60301h01_spnew52">
	<p pid="b.87.2/1">I have no reason to quibble with the hon. Gentleman's comment, but I was discussing the period when the Bill was under consideration.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/2">I have no doubt about the potential benefits of a regional casino as an element in the regeneration of the area that I represent in south-east London. It has suffered disproportionately from the decline of the traditional river-based heavy industry, which, when it left, left in a dramatic and damaging way. Huge numbers of people were left unemployed, and the area is gradually recovering from the resulting serious social problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/3">The regeneration that is under way in several parts of my constituency includes an ambitious project for the transformation of the Greenwich peninsula around the millennium dome, which, of course, was created for the year 2000. Subsequently, finding a long-term viable solution for it has been a challenge, but work is now under way. The dome itself, now called the O <sub>2</sub> , will feature a 23,000 capacity arena when it reopens in a year or so. It will host music and other events, including some of the Olympic events in 2012. On most occasions, it will have an evening audience. As the National Audit Office recognised earlier this year in its report considering the project, the income earned from within the arena alone would not generate a fully commercial return, so it is    crucial to develop an integrated leisure and entertainment destination by adding other components that will ensure that people come to the area throughout the day and which will attract international as well as national visits. The scheme therefore includes a range of other provision, including a music club, cinemas, a theatre, an exhibition space&mdash;there is already a proposal to bring the Tutankhamen exhibition there, which would be a huge attraction and benefit&mdash;and a luxury hotel. With regard to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the comments from the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase>, that will highlight the extent to which there is scope to generate revenue not from people in this country but from international visitors, who would not necessarily be considered as the poor. There may be a redistributive element in that, which he might like to think about. The provision also includes bars, restaurants, caf&eacute;s and a new pier.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/4">The project is ambitious and one element that would make it far more successful would be a regional casino, which would help to cross-subsidise other components, attract additional visitors, including international visitors, and support the regeneration not only of Greenwich but of many of the deprived areas of south-east London. It is estimated that, with a regional casino, there could be some 500 additional construction jobs during the construction phase and 1,100 jobs during the longer-term operational phase. That would have a significant impact not only on the local economy but more widely in south-east London. We have no doubt, therefore, about the benefits of a regional casino, were we to secure one, in Greenwich. It would be part of a successful regeneration.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/5">We have seen evidence submitted by various organisations. The Hall Aitken report, which has been referred to, cast doubt on whether the estimates for the regenerative benefits in the north-west, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and Blackpool would be delivered. I have no basis for commenting on whether that view is valid, but it is certainly not valid for Greenwich. We are confident that a regional casino would bring benefits. However, it would not be right to base an assessment of the potential contribution towards regeneration on one venture only in the unique circumstances of my constituency. Given the clear evidence and interest from many authorities in a range of areas&mdash;seaside areas, urban areas, more rural areas, the north, the midlands, London and the south&mdash;there must be a wider range of regional casinos from which we can learn lessons as to where they work and promote regeneration and where there are problems. There may be problems, and we need to learn from the initial phase in order to inform future policy developments. My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central made a very powerful case that one casino is simply not enough if we are to use it as a test bed to establish whether creating regional casinos supports regeneration.</p>

	<p pid="b.89.0/1">The arguments that we have heard about not having more pilots are based on the belief among some hon. Members that some academic research, to which my right hon. Friend has referred, shows that there probably are not benefits or there are disbenefits from regional casinos. Is not the point of the pilot to prove on the ground which academic research is correct and whether the benefits or disbenefits actually exist?</p>

	<p pid="b.89.1/1">I agree wholeheartedly and reinforce the point that a judgment cannot be made on the basis of one casino in one discrete location, because the circumstances that might apply in Sheffield, Blackpool or Birmingham will be different from the circumstances in Greenwich. I believe that we have a very strong and attractive proposition for a regional casino in Greenwich, but I accept that different circumstances apply elsewhere and I urge the Minister to reconsider the limitation to one and to accept that we need to conduct a pilot on a wider scale if we are to learn the lessons.</p>

	<p pid="b.89.2/1">I shall begin to call the hon. Members making the winding-up speeches at 10.35 am, which means that we have about 20 minutes left for this part of the debate. I hope that hon. Members will be brief.</p>

	<p pid="b.89.3/1">My constituency already has three casinos, all of which are very successful and which are, in many ways, some of the safest places to be around and within in Southend, compared with some of the pubs and clubs there. I would support there being only one test bed, but on the basis that it was in Southend. I suspect that other hon. Members who want a regional casino in their area would also encourage only one if it was on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">their patch. The hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> made powerful points about a larger number. I was somewhat confused, given that the Gambling Act 2005 allows the Government, through a statutory instrument subject to the affirmative procedure, to increase the number. I would be interested to hear, when the Minister winds up the debate, at what point, the initial casino having been tested, the number would be extended&mdash;whether that would be at six, 12 or 24 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.3/2">There are major social impact issues, but as I mentioned, the casinos in Southend are some of the safest places in the area. Southend has high unemployment&mdash;4.9 per cent.&mdash;and therefore meets the criteria for a regional casino. The local council is keen to bring a regional casino to the town. I admit that I have been concerned at words coming from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister forcing our region to rally behind one proposal. It would not be right to force all politicians and authorities to rally behind just one proposal in a region; we should leave things wide open. In my region, I can see why the Government would think that there is a powerful case for one regional casino at the dome, but I do not necessarily think that that would be right.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.3/3">My final concern relates to section 106 agreements. One reason why there is such a powerful case for a regional casino in Southend is that it would regenerate the area and, through a section 106 agreement, solve some of the social, economic and physical problems of the constituency, where there has been a cliff slip. However, if, over coming months and years, the Treasury decides that it wants to reform the system of section 106 agreements and to take the planning gain back into the central Treasury pot and redistribute it to other areas, I would be deeply concerned about Southend having a regional casino and about a number of other proposals. I ask the Minister to confirm, if possible, that that is not likely to happen.</p>

	<p pid="b.90.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> on securing the debate. I will be as brief as I can. I, too, served on the pre-legislative Committee, which sat for 18 months. We considered the proposals over that time and took the view that the open-ended criteria for regional casinos should be changed. The figure of 40 was determined by the Government at the time, but it went down to eight. The situation was accepted not only across the political parties but across the two Houses during the debate. There was no opposition in relation to the final report, so it was a bit disingenuous of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> to put forward the view that he did.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/2">The same applies to the Conservatives. They did make their point. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-24">24 January 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1474" name="Malcolm Moss">the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss)</phrase> said:</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/3" class="indent">&quot;If the Government want to test these proposals, they should do it across the board and limit the number of regional casinos from eight to four. That would, at a stroke, reduce the number of category A machines available from 10,000 to 5,000.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-24">24 January 2005</phrase>; Vol. 430, c. 67.]</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/4">That is on the record in <i>Hansard</i>, so we are now seeing another flip-flop on policy, admittedly not by the leader of the party but by other Opposition Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/5">The pre-legislative Committee came to its conclusion on the basis that the scheme would be fair, just and a proper test of some of the social problems that other parties considered the casinos would create. The scheme would come across the country, and we considered that the regional development agencies would be prepared to consider those issues. There are more than 150 applications for the casinos, so there is interest not only from the industry but from local politicians, local business people and local communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/6">I speak on behalf of my constituents in Great Yarmouth, and certainly the local authority, which is Conservative-controlled, wants one of the regional casinos to help to regenerate the resort. The regeneration is not just about having a casino. We have attracted a senior leader in the hotel industry to set up and build a brand new hotel in my constituency, which will lead to extra jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/7">Some advance the argument that such a development will be socially reprehensible, and people will turn to gambling. However, in Great Yarmouth we already have two casinos, a horse-racing track and a greyhound track, the amusement arcades and the bingo halls. I asked the people who look at social responsibilities in respect of those who get caught in the net of gambling whether there was a predominance of people with a gambling addiction in places such as Great Yarmouth, as opposed to other inland areas without such amounts of gambling, and they said no. The test needs to go across the country to find out if there will be a problem: I do not consider that one test will make a justifiable case.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/8">There is a bit of hypocritical nonsense coming from some hon. Members who decide to take a particular viewpoint on gambling, saying that perhaps we should not have even one casino and, perhaps, we should do away with gambling altogether. However, I hazard a guess that many hon. Members would welcome some investment from the lottery into their constituencies. As far as I am concerned, we need to take on board the comments of the pre-legislative Committee, which the Government have accepted, and have a test across the country on perhaps four or eight sites, because one is too few. The hunger is out there in various constituencies&mdash;not just in businesses, but in the communities as well&mdash;to help regenerate resorts like Great Yarmouth and other areas throughout the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/9">The Government should revisit this point. I urge the Minister not to be the political croupier stopping this, but to share the chips around across the country rather than give them to one player on the board.</p>

	<p pid="b.91.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> on securing this debate and making an eloquent and wittily barbed speech in terms of some of the Opposition's flip-flops.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/2">As a Blackpool MP, toge<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">ther with my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase>, I have a strong interest in the outcome of the discussions in this debate. Also, as honorary president of the British Resorts Association, I have seen, as colleagues have already mentioned, some of the broad issues of decline making seaside towns and resorts central to this debate. As a former Parliamentary Private Secretary in the Department that introduced this legislation, I am fully aware of all the twists and turns that have accompanied it. Coming from Blackpool, I can say a roller coaster ride on the Pepsi Max Big One is nothing compared to being in the Department in the two or three months before the legislation finally went on to the statute book. However, we are where we are.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/3">I want to take as my text what the Secretary of State said in writing to hon. Members about 10 days before the final agreement, before the general election:</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/4" class="indent">&quot;We think it is important to take a controlled and cautious approach to the introduction of these new types of casino&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/5">I believe that the Government have done that by setting up the panel and charging it with certain responsibilities. We should also remember that the process includes large and small casino expansion, which will give tests across the board and throughout the country from which conclusions can be drawn.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/6">As the debate about the House of Lords and its composition has often just dealt with the issue of categories and numbers and escaped the issue of what people want a reformed House of Lords for, I want briefly this morning to pick up some of the points that the panel needs to consider and ask, &quot;What do you want regional casinos for? What are the issues that affect whether we have one, four, eight, or whatever number?&quot; On sustainability, surely we are not talking just about where a regional casino is sited, but the level of preparedness, the background and the context. That is one reason why we in Blackpool feel that we have a basis for development.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/7">The leader of Blackpool council wrote in the latest document promoting the proposals:</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Destination casino development has the potential to ignite the reinvigoration process, remove the seasonal trading pattern, and bring about the wider investment that will reverse the current trends . . . Blackpool looks upon gaming deregulation as a potent catalyst for regeneration but only where it is part of an overall regeneration plan that will bring transformational change, and there is a strong local commitment to integrated policing and monitoring of casino management and social responsibility programmes.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.92.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend and Blackpool colleague for giving way. Does he agree that developing the local skills base is also important? Will he welcome the new courses available at Blackpool and The Fylde college to develop the necessary skills in the town and region to ensure that local people can take part in casino development?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.92.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" speakername="Gordon Marsden" colnum="92"  time="010:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h01.htm#60301h01_spnew60">
	<p pid="b.92.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a point on preparedness in considering regional casinos that I was going to deal with.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/2">We in Blackpool have tried, over a six-year period, to deal with this matter. It is six years since Leisure Parcs first produced its Pharaoh's Palace plan, during which time we have had the Psion report, which talked about potential regenerative benefits in Blackpool, development of the local strategic partnership and the urban regeneration company&mdash;the only one in the country&mdash;which has at its centre regeneration around the casino. The scrutiny Committee testified to the preparations in Blackpool, as the hon. Member for Southport said earlier. The chairman of the urban regeneration company is Sir Peter Hall, one of the most distinguished planners in the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/3">As my hon. Friend says, there has been a series of developments designed to broaden that base and deal with preparation. Sustainability is important, which is why we in Blackpool have not just looked at beaming in a resort, or regional, casino as if it were an alien spaceship, but considered it in the context of much broader regeneration for the town. Hon. Members who have visited Blackpool recently, for party conferences or other reasons, will have seen that we already have an intelligent, comprehensive master plan that is developing the town in contexts other than just the importation of a regional casino. That development includes the southern gateway, which has totally redeveloped the southern side of the town and the promenade area, the Solaris Centre, which is part of the partnership between Blackpool and Lancaster university, and work currently being done on a central gateway to connect the resort zone with the proposed conference and casino quarter.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/4">The point I am trying to make is that regional casinos cannot be thought about in a vacuum, or even in terms of one particular project, however attractively packaged and financed by the private sector it may be. We have to consider overall involvement and, indeed, as colleagues have said, the issue of local acceptance. In Blackpool, we have had, over six years, probably the most sustained argument and discussion of these issues. Of course, as the hon. Member for Southport said, there are people in Blackpool who are concerned about the potential effects of regional casinos there or anywhere else, but overall there is an understanding that without a regional casino and a kick-start element many other regeneration points on which I have touched run the risk of being still-born. That is the context in which we need to consider regional casinos, wherever they are located: will they work on their own terms and will they work in the context of the larger regeneration of the area?</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/5">If there were any doubt, our case has been put eloquently in recent years by the council, by businesses in the town and, I hope, by elected representatives and others. The five inner wards of Blackpool, where it is proposed that the casino development is located, have experienced intense multiple deprivation, which is not always recognised in seaside towns, although it is recognised in inner cities and on housing estates. We have the tenth most intense multiple deprivation in the country and male life expectancy that is shorter than that in only one other place in the country. We have poorish educational standards and transience, with primary school turnover of between 25 per cent. and 50 per cent. a year, and poor housing, with 35 per cent. of households with no central heating and 5 per cent. sharing amenities. That is the social context in which we need to look for local acceptance. We have that local acceptance across the board, even among some of the small hoteliers, who appreciate that it will involve disruption.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/6">We have not done that at the cost of ignoring social responsibility, which is an important issue for the panel to consider. Rightly, the Government came under pressure from the Churches, the Salvation Army and the Methodists; it is right that they, and all Members, should be prodded to consider that issue. We must avoid the experience of Australia and some of the experience of the US. Blackpool is acutely conscious of that, which is why we have developed the gaming academy and training facilities and why we are in deep consultation with the trade unions. Only last week, the local authority published a draft policy document on gambling that will be considered by the licensing committee, although obviously it cannot be finalised until the Gambling Commission publishes its guidance in May.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/7">The issue of what we mean by a regional casino has already been raised. From the support and endorsement given in Blackpool by the regional spatial strategy, the north-west development association and the North West regional assembly, it is clear that a regional casino is seen as something that will draw people in from elsewhere and that it has to have a national and international impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/8">We in Blackpool welcomed the award of the Commonwealth games to Manchester&mdash;as a native Mancunian, I particularly welcomed it&mdash;and Liverpool's designation as city of culture because those were transformational moments not only for those cities, but for the whole region, so we see anything that happens in Blackpool as having a regional and international impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/9">Finally, let me say something about regeneration. Regeneration has to be genuine and integrated. As my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood said when she spoke on the Gambling Bill in November 2004, development is not the same as regeneration. Hon. Members would do well to reflect on whether we are talking about destination gambling or doorstep gambling. I am sure that the panel will reflect on that in coming to its conclusions.</p>

	<p pid="b.94.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase> set out his case for the dome's suitability as an area for the regional casino in London. May I highlight Rainham in my constituency? It is on the edge of the Thames gateway, adjacent to Rainham marshes, and we have the opportunity to regenerate the east London corridor and kick-start much-needed investment for regenerating Rainham and the London Thames gateway area.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/2">When we talk about the regenerative effects of regional casinos, it is important that we should focus heavily on where the relevant sites, or site, would be, given that the negative social impact, about which a number of Members have talked this morning, can be acute. Research suggests that 0.8 per cent. of the population could be prone to problem gambling, and we should take that carefully into account when considering the appropriate site for a regional casino.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/3">Rainham has the advantage of being quite distant from population areas, separated by the channel tunnel rail link and other industrial areas. In my view, it could be a good site, because its distance from population areas would reduce the risk of problem gambling there; it is almost a destination location, and that marks it out as slightly different.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/4">We also need to consider displacement; by that, I mean how a regional casino&mdash;a large leisure complex&mdash;will impact on other leisure areas in the vicinity. That factor cannot be downplayed. When considering the location of an appropriate site, the negative impact on the region's micro-economic climate should be taken closely into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/5">My final word is that the issue should be considered carefully; the ramifications of choosing the wrong site for a casino would be long lasting and have negative impacts on the population areas that the casino served.</p>

	<p pid="b.95.0/1">As ot<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">hers have, I congratulate the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> on securing the debate. I remind Members that the regional casinos that we are debating were only one part of the Gambling Bill, which has become the Gambling Act 2005. Although regional casinos have been a highly controversial element of that Act, many other parts have been welcomed across parties&mdash;for example, the regulations on internet gambling, tougher social responsibility and the tougher regulator in the shape of the Gambling Commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/2">The greatest controversy has been about regional casinos. Indeed, Members across the House were deeply surprised when the Government first came forward with their proposals for a massive explosion in the number of casinos, whether small, large or regional. People were particularly surprised by the initial proposal, which I referred to in my previous intervention, to have an unlimited number of new regional super-casinos, which would have had up to 1,250 new-style category A machines, untried and untested, with unlimited stakes and prizes, and most closely linked in many people's minds to a potential increase in problem gambling.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/3">That proposal for an unlimited number of such casinos was deeply surprising, and people could not reconcile it with the Secretary of State's statement to the Joint Committee; she said that if the legislation gave rise to an increase in problem gambling, it would have failed and would be bad legislation. Stung by the criticism, the Government made a U-turn, not all of which is bad, and introduced their proposal for a cap of eight on the number of regional casinos.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/4">The Liberal Democrats supported that proposal. As we know, during the washing-up period, the Government were forced to reduce the number from eight to one. The Liberal Democrats were not involved in that deal, but it was what the Secretary of State was forced to accept. It is worth recalling that in doing so, she said,</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/5" class="indent">&quot;we reserve the right to ask Parliament again what number of regional casinos is necessary to test their impact.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-07">7 April 2005</phrase>; Vol. 432, c. 1624.]</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/6">That is what we are debating today. Before we make any decision to agree to an increase from one to whatever number, there are important issues to be resolved.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/7">It is crucial that we take into account the effect of any change in that number on the existing and future casino estate in this country. We know that there will be more casinos than at present because of the applications still being made under the old Gaming Act 1968. I find it surprising that we are debating how many new casinos there will be when we still have not had a clear agreement from the Government on the cut-off date for applications to set up new casinos under the 1968 Act. Indeed, if the figures given in a parliamentary answer are any indication, something like 50 or more new casinos could be established under the old legislation. All that is taking place while the independent advisory panel is considering how many new casinos there should be and where they should be located.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/8">The Government have not got their Act together on use class orders. Even before Second Reading, many of us were concerned about how a swimming pool, a dance hall or many other entertainment centres could change into a casino without needing planning permission. We argued that there was a need for a single use class order for casinos. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State promised us that we would have it, yet to date the issue has not been resolved.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/9">The Government have consulted, and the consultation report has been finalised and published on the website of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, but there still have not been any statutory instruments. That issue is still unresolved, but it is crucial, because if another form of entertainment centre can be converted into a casino without planning permission, no form of section 106 agreement has to be offered up and there will be no benefit from regeneration.</p>

	<p pid="b.96.0/1">I am listening to all of the hon. Gentleman's caveats. However, does he accept that if pilots are to be a meaningful test of the benefits or disbenefits of regional casinos, the right number is not one?</p>

	<p pid="b.96.1/1">We will test a number of issues in the pilot, one of which relates to social responsibility and another to regeneration. I believe that it is possible to have a trial involving just one pilot, although there might be arguments for having more. Until we know the background&mdash;the environment in which the number of pilots will take place&mdash;it is difficult to judge whether there should be one, four or more. That is why this is crucial.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/2">We are also considering issues about other impacts on gaming in this country. It is crazy that the Government still have not made a decision on what to do about the triennial review in terms of stakes and prizes for family entertainment centre machines. The Minister has said that he wants more evidence. He has been given that. He has said that it would be helpful to have cross-party support, which he has been offered. Yet, we still have not had the decision. That is creating a loss of jobs in seaside resorts and in many other places, and it is not an economic benefit. We need an answer.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/3">As others have said, we need to be clear about the regeneration benefit. It is fascinating to note that when the Secretary of State reluctantly accepted that there had to be a reduction in the number of regional casinos from eight to one, she said that it would probably mean a</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/4" class="indent">&quot;loss of probably in excess of 40,000 jobs.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 7 April 2005; Vol. 432, c. 1629.]</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/5">That represents 5,000 jobs per casino, which is in strange, marked contrast to what the hon. Member for Manchester, Central told us in his speech about the bid for east Manchester's casino. He said that it would create only 2,300 jobs. The Secretary of State has been somewhat cavalier about the economic benefits. We know from the Henley Centre's study and the Hall Aitken study, to which reference has been made, that</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/6" class="indent">&quot;the estimates of economic benefit from a regional casino development are both optimistic and potentially misleading&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/7">I am willing to consider good arguments for increasing the number from one, but several other issues need to be sorted out first. Many assurances need to be given and we need clear evidence of the real benefits if we are to accept an increase in the number.</p>

	<p pid="b.97.2/1">I have only seven minutes, so I shall continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.2/2">The Government presumably have the votes, so they should get on with it. They should not pray us in aid. They should not say to Conservative Members that they need to carry this through with our support; they do not need it. The House of Lords cannot change the statutory instrument, and the Government know that, so if Labour Members feel that this is a crucial issue, all they need to do is bring forward the statutory instrument and get on with the job.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.2/3">I was misquoted on two occasions during the debate. At the Social Market Foundation, when questioned by the journalist who has been mentioned, I simply said that we had argued for less than eight regional casinos in the pilot; in fact, to answer <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" name="Anthony D Wright">the question raised by the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase>, I tabled a probing amendment for four&mdash;<i>[Laughter.]</i> If we were all to be bound by the probing amendments that we tabled in Committee, there would be no point in debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.2/4">The issue was that the Minister came to the Committee plucking out of the air the magic figures of eight, eight, eight. He made no justification for why the number was eight rather than six or 24. We tabled an amendment to tease out the reasons for the choice of eight. Even now, we might hear some reasons why the magic figure of eight is so terribly important.</p>

	<p pid="b.97.4/1">No, I have not got enough time.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.4/2">The amendment was a probing one; that answers that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.4/3">In answer to a question that has been posed, I can say that we always argued that we had to approach the matter cautiously. On the number of category A machines that would be released through regional casinos, the evidence from Australia and the United States indicated that a cautious approach was necessary. We said that we were advocating one regional casino in the pilot because of serious concerns about problem gambling. If the Government could demonstrate through evidence that there would be no increase in problem gambling as a result of an increase in the number of regional casinos in the pilot, I said that we would consider the proposal. In other words, we would consider the evidence on problem gambling and would not turn our backs on a proposal backed up by evidence. That is not to say that we will back the Government if they simply come up with a figure of eight either today or tomorrow. That deals with that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.4/4">In answer to a written question last year, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="b.97.4/5" class="indent">&quot;The Government have made it clear that they wish to take a cautious approach to the development of new casinos, in order to assess whether their introduction leads to an increase in problem gambling. The decision to reduce the number of regional casinos permitted by the Gambling Act 2005 from eight to one was consistent with this cautious approach.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 15 November 2005; Vol. 439, c. 1135W.]</p>

	<p pid="b.98.0/1">The hon. Gentleman may not value consistency in his approach to this matter, but I put forward a strong case for a regional casino in Manchester, irrespective of what my right hon. Friend the Minister said. Indeed, I have had discussions and even arguments with my right hon. Friend about the issue in the past. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will accept that.</p>

	<p pid="b.98.1/1">All right, I will accept that, in the sense that the hon. Gentleman wants to promote, through regeneration, an area of Manchester that I know well. I would argue that it is the worst possible place in Manchester in which to put a super-casino. It is the most deprived area. There will no longer be any membership requirement to enter a casino. Therefore, the ambient gambling that will be done by the deprived people in that vicinity makes it just about the worst possible location for a regional casino that I can imagine. However, we will not argue about that now; perhaps we shall at another time.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.1/2">I want to raise several more issues. First, until the past few days, we had not seen any research or evidence that showed a completely different picture about the regenerative claims that are made by those who want to invest in regional casinos. The Hall Aitken report, which has been mentioned, represents the first evidence that we have of research that says, &quot;Hold on a minute. The claims being made for a regenerative benefit of &pound;50 million do not stack up if they are considered more closely.&quot; This is the first evidence that we have received, and the Conservative party was right to be cautious.</p>

	<p pid="b.98.3/1">The Minister will have plenty of time to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/2">On jobs, the report concludes:</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/3" class="indent">&quot;There will be a significant number of jobs created . . . but: many of these are likely to be displaced from elsewhere in the leisure sector; these jobs will not necessarily match the needs of the local population; and there is strong evidence to suggest that many of the jobs will go to migrant workers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/4">On social impacts, the report states:</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/5" class="indent">&quot;Our research suggests there will be significant social impacts from opening a regional casino. Many of these negatively impact on the Government's own social indicators and are therefore likely to undermine regeneration in the communities currently suggested. The proposed regional casino will generate . . . a significant increase in gambling expenditure.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/6">The report also states that evidence from the Henley Centre's work</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/7" class="indent">&quot;suggests the number of problem gamblers will nearly double by 2010. The number of problem gamblers in the UK will increase by some 38 per cent. as a direct result of the new Act. And data from the Psion report suggests that 260,000 new people (equivalent to a city the size of Nottingham) would take up gambling as a result of a regional casino&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/8">The Psion report was in relation to the north-west.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/9">All those issues are being raised, and they support our cautious approach. If the Government can come up with counter evidence to say that there is no evidence of potential problem gambling in having more than one regional casino, we shall consider it.</p>

	<p pid="b.99.0/1">It is a privilege to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Chope. I have never seen so many hon. Members turn up at 9.30 on a Wednesday morning for an Adjournment debate. I do not know whether that is due to your chairmanship or to the subject matter under consideration. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> on introducing the debate. He has been a champion of such matters for a considerable time. I assure <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1474" name="Malcolm Moss">the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss)</phrase> that my hon. Friend needs no prompting to make sure that the matter is brought out in the proper way.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.0/2">We have been debating not only regional casinos but how we have approached gambling as a whole from the Budd report onwards. That is important, because the Government did not have the powers to control remote gambling and e-gambling that are now serious issues for society. They are increasing at a rate that could not have been envisaged five or 10 years ago. It is therefore right that the Government set up a inquiry board and the playing for success initiative. I thank the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee for its good work. It brought to the House a measure that will go on the statute book to protect and deliver the real core values of the legislation, which is to keep the area crime free, protect the vulnerable and ensure that there is integrity within the industry. It is what we will deliver.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.0/3">While discussing the modernisation programme, we believed that it was important to investigate casinos. We went back to legislation from the mid-1960s that was probably the most draconian legislation in respect of gaining a licence. In fact, the most difficult licence to obtain is not that for casinos. We thought that such matters needed to revisited under the strict control of the new Gambling Commission, which many throughout the world regard as a model of how to have responsible gambling and make sure that the three core values are kept right at the heart of any gambling establishment in this country. As a commission, it has the teeth, the power and the resource to make sure that that happens.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.0/4">Our cautious approach was absolutely right. The work of Hall Aitken has been held up this morning as a well-researched report. Its estimated social cost is based on work commissioned by the British Amusement Catering Trade Association. That is fine. I have no problems with it but, for goodness sake, if people are to undertake a responsible piece of work, the work done by my Department must be taken into account. It is at odds with the base of the report. If we want an informed debate, let us have one. As a professional organisation, it does Hall Aitken no good at all to put out such rubbish. It is biased to an extent that is unacceptable. It has been presented as evidence by the Opposition spokesperson, who said that we based responsible decisions on it. It does not do itself any justice. There needs to be an informed debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.0/5">Let us be clear about <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the argument of the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase>. Yes, we are changing the Gaming Act 1968 in respect of casinos. Yes, we are consulting on such matters, the closure date for which is <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-28">28 April</phrase>. However, casinos are not the big issue. That was raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" name="Anne Milton">the hon. Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase> when she referred to the number of slots in the establishments. What clearly affected me when I saw what was happening in Australia was not casinos, pubs or clubs, but the number of slots that were allowed to operate. I assure the House that we have tied each establishment to a specific number of slots, so that the Gambling Commission can control what happens with that development in the light of social responsibility requirements. We are determined to take a cautious approach to make sure that that happens.</p>

	<p pid="b.100.0/1">Talking of slots, does my right hon. Friend recognise that one regional casino will be allowed 1,250 slots with unlimited stakes and unlimited prizes? That will double the total number of slot machines in British casinos at present. Does not that reinforce the case for a more cautious approach and for having one regional casino and determining its enormous effect over three years?</p>

She is temperance&mdash;I do not know what she thinks her son is doing. I can understand where the Methodists come from, but we are legislating in a cautious way. We need evidence. The best way in which to test reports such as those from Hall Aitken would be to have a number of regional casinos, a number of large casinos and a number of small casinos, so that there were eight, eight and eight.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/2">Let us consider political manoeuvring. The <i>Daily Mail </i>ran a big campaign to which the Tories acceded. They thought that it would bring them a few votes in the election if they knocked down the number from eight to one. It did not work. We were returned. Nevertheless, we must reach consensus. The Opposition treated the matter with a flip-flop, but a considerable number of Conservative Members made representations to me when going through the Lobbies asking whether they could have the casino in their area, if there was to be only one. We heard the same this morning. However, let us at least approach the matter sensibly.</p>

We examined it seriously and evaluated it. It was found wanting. If Hall Aitken want to produce a report, let them at least put the other side of the argument, too. It was already on the public record. The way in which the organisation carried out the report did not do it any good. I am willing to debate such matters. They were the subject of the Budd report, the playing for success initiative and the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee. The House then decided to subject the proposals to a Joint Committee that made recommendations of which the Government accepted pretty well every one.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.1/2">We then put the measure to the House and, because the Opposition thought that they could steal a march for a few votes in the election by pandering to the <i>Daily Mail,</i> they changed their mind from eight to one. That is the political reality of the position, and they are now trying to say that we can put that aside. I made it clear to the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, as I have to many hon. Members, that we shall reconsider the matter if those on the Opposition Benches say that they will reconsider moving from one to a number between one and eight. It is right to move forward in that way, and we are still prepared to go in that direction.</p>

	<p pid="b.101.2/1">Why does the Minister need our support? The Government do not ask for our support in respect of all their other legislation&mdash;except for education, of course, but that is a recent development. Why does the right hon.

	<p pid="b.101.3/1">I have been speaking for the past seven or eight minutes, but what I have said has obviously not penetrated through to the hon. Gentleman, as usual. I said that the legislation was not only about casinos, but about dealing with e-gambling and remote gambling. As it was, a side issue of the whole matter was casinos. To take forward regional casinos will need consensus across the House. That is the best way forward. If the Conservatives do not want to agree, it is at their doorstep that there will not now be a continuation of the regional casino.</p>

	<p pid="b.102.1/1">I am grateful for this opportunity to debate the future of Burnley general hospital, and it is an honour to make my Westminster Hall debut under your chairmanship, Mr. Chope, albeit in Committee Room 10. I am also grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" name="Gordon Prentice">my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)</phrase> for taking the trouble to be present, and I will be happy to listen to his contribution if he wishes to intervene.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/2">The issue we are debating does not affect only Burnley. Burnley general hospital serves not only my constituency of about 90,000 members of the public, but also the wider north-east of Lancashire. My petition in support of the hospital, run in conjunction with the <i>Burnley Express</i>, attracted 10,000 signatures from my constituents, but if we add together all the names on all the petitions that have been organised in support of Burnley general hospital&mdash;those by myself, by the trade unions and by individual community activists throughout east Lancashire&mdash;the number rises to around 60,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/3">My petition stated that we</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/4" class="indent">&quot;reject any proposals to close Burnley General Hospital or Burnley's Accident and Emergency Department&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/5">and we</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/6" class="indent">&quot;strongly oppose any options that would be detrimental to the health of Burnley and Padiham people.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/7">Let me explain why we felt that was needed. A few years ago, the acute trusts at Burnley and Blackburn hospitals agreed to merge. I am told by those who were involved in the making of that decision&mdash;not least my predecessor as Member for Burnley, Peter Pike&mdash;that assurances were given at the time that this was a purely administrative merger, and that there would be no transfer of services between Burnley and Blackburn. However, towards the end of last year the new East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust published four proposals emerging from its initial work on a clinical services review, all of which appeared to lead to a significant downgrading of Burnley general hospital in favour of Blackburn. The impetus for that change appears to be that the trust had mismanaged its finances. In its last annual report&mdash;that of 2004&ndash;05&mdash;the chairperson of the trust, Christine Kirk said that</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/8" class="indent">&quot;in plain housekeeping terms we have been living beyond our means and we must strive to bring this situation under control&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/9">My point is that is not the fault of my constituents that the trust has got itself into this mess, and so it is not my constituents who should suffer as it tries to get itself out of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/10">One of the published options proposed shutting down Burnley general hospital, which understandably led to ridicule in my constituency&mdash;and beyond&mdash;not least because the hospital is currently in phase 5 of a private finance initiative redevelopment project. I have since been told by the management that that was never a real option, and I am strongly of the view that if that is the case it should never have been put on the table. Therefore, my first question for the Minister is, whether it was necessary under Cabinet Office guidance to publish options that nobody has any intention of taking seriously? That was insulting to the intelligence of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/11">However, more worrying was the realisation that the two options that were being seriously considered would both lead to the removal of intensive care beds at Burnley general hospital, with people having to go to Blackburn instead. It would be an understatement to say that that has caused uproar; it has led to the launch of a &quot;save our hospital&quot; campaign, with the full support of the local newspaper, which ran it as its main story for a number of weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/12">My constituents fear that they are more likely to die if they have to travel further to receive intensive care services. If one of my constituents is in a serious condition&mdash;as a result of a heart attack or a road traffic accident, for example&mdash;it is surely simple common sense that a longer journey time to intensive care means that they are more likely to die. I would like to hear the Minister's view on that. Specifically, I would like to know his estimate of the additional length of time it will take for my constituents and those of my hon. Friends&mdash;in particular of my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle&mdash;to get to intensive care in Blackburn, instead of in Burnley. How much longer will they be on the road, and what will be the increased risk of mortality from that additional travel time?</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/13">Let me offer further examples. If one of my constituents has a complication during routine surgery at Burnley general hospital, or during childbirth at the maternity unit, they will be more likely to die if they have to be moved to Blackburn, instead of receiving intensive care support where they are undergoing the operation or giving birth. If one of my constituents arrives at the accident and emergency department at Burnley in an acute state, surely they are more likely to die if they then have to be transported to Blackburn, instead of receiving the intensive care that they need on site? What are the Minister's views on those examples?</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/14">There are also concerns that if the intensive care unit is lost, the whole of the accident and emergency facility will surely follow, that no complex surgery&mdash;routine or otherwise&mdash;could take place on the site for fear of complications, and that for the same reason the maternity unit would be unsustainable and the hospital itself would gradually become unviable. Losing the ICU in Burnley would also presumably lead to a reduction in intensive care beds throughout the sub-region, at a time when intensive care beds are already in high demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/15">Since the publication of these preliminary options, I have been deluged with letters from desperately worried constituents. I cannot walk through the town without being stopped by somebody who fears for what will happen as a result of the proposals, and I share their concerns. People honestly believe&mdash;and I think they are right&mdash;that they would be more likely to die if these proposals were carried out than under the existing situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/16">Therefore, we protested. We met the trust managers and handed over the petition here in Westminster. We turned up in droves at their board meetings. We organised a fantastic march through the centre of town on a Saturday shortly before Christmas, which culminated in mulled wine&mdash;non-alcoholic, of course, for health reasons&mdash;in the central square. A similar march took place in Pendle.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/17">That worked. As a result of our pressure, the management said that there would now be a new proposal for emergency care, dubbed the &quot;fifth option&quot;, which would focus on</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/18" class="indent">&quot;the retention of both planned and unscheduled care in some specialities at the two main hospitals in the towns&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/19">those at Blackburn and Burnley. The trust's press release went on to say that the new proposal</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/20" class="indent">&quot;comes in response to fears expressed by some local people about possible changes to critical care services at Burnley General Hospital&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/21">I wish to put on record a big thank you to all those who joined our campaign. Making that effort was worth while.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/22">We have come far, and we now need to put in place the final piece of the jigsaw. On Friday this week, a steering group consisting of all the relevant primary care trusts will decide which options will go out to formal statutory consultation. It is imperative that the option that is put forward as the preferred option is new option 5.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/23">We are a proud town with a strong history and a great hospital, and we need to keep intensive care beds at Burnley general hospital for those cases where to travel further would mean an unacceptable risk to life. Access to intensive care&mdash;and, indeed, accident and emergency in general&mdash;is a bit like the emergency exit in an aeroplane; we hope to goodness that we will not need to use it, but we blooming well want to make sure that it is nearby just in case we do. That is our main criterion against which the formal proposals will be judged when they emerge in a few days' time.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/24">However, it is not the only criterion. I have a 10-point checklist against which the proposals will be judged when they are finally published. I will draw my remarks to a conclusion by stating them, so if any of my hon. Friends wish to intervene, now is the time to do so; I am very glad that they are present to add their voices to mine. My first, and most important, question is, will there be intensive care beds in Burnley? Also, how many intensive care beds will there be in east Lancashire as a whole? Secondly, will accident and emergency services remain in Burnley? Thirdly, what will we specialise in? Will Blackburn people come to Burnley to be treated, and if so, in which areas? Fourthly, what will happen to Burnley's fantastic Edith Watson maternity unit where so many of my constituents and their children were born&mdash;including my own daughter, last year? Fifthly, how many more lives would be saved, or lost, as a result of the proposals? Sixthly, what would the trust do to help my constituents travel between Blackburn and Burnley&mdash;for example, to visit relatives? Seventhly, would additional ambulances be provided to compensate? Eighthly, what are the medical experts saying, particularly those who specialise in intensive care? Ninthly, what is being done to encourage more young doctors and nurses to apply to work in Burnley, so that we can bring the expertise of the future into our town? Finally, and very importantly, what will happen to the medical equipment that has been donated to Burnley general hospital by the fundraising efforts of successive mayors and mayoresses and the contributions of so many of my hard-working constituents?</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/25">The answers to those 10 questions will determine whether my constituents believe they are better or worse off as a result of the proposed changes. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us on each of those points, and I thank my colleagues for their patience and courtesy in listening to my contribution this morning.</p>

	<p pid="b.105.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1464" name="Kitty Ussher">my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Kitty Ussher)</phrase> on securing the debate. Since she arrived in the House, she has taken a close interest in health services in her local community. She has helped to lead local campaigns for strong health services and has persistently lobbied Ministers, both in the House and behind the scenes, not just because she is an excellent local MP but because she is a user of local hospital services. I was privileged to meet baby Lizzie recently, and Burnley should be proud of her.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.0/2">I, too, put on record my thanks to the <i>Burnley Express</i> for the way in which it has helped to keep the issue in the local headlines and at the centre of local conversation. Over the past few months it has proved, once again, that it is a real voice for the local community.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.0/3">The starting point for this debate is the transformation of the NHS in and around Burnley. As a result of our funding policy, the NHS nationally is in receipt of record resources, and so is the NHS in my hon. Friend's constituency. Funding overall in the NHS has increased almost twofold; it is up to &pound;70 billion, and by 2007&ndash;08 that will have increased to about &pound;92 billion. That is an enormous increase in spending. Indeed, if the NHS were a national economy, it would be something like the world's 33rd largest. That is a record of investment in which the Government can take great pride.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.0/4">The money has been extremely well spent. It has bought extra staff and shorter waiting times, and the result is that there have been great advances against the big killer diseases that we suffer from. This morning, I looked at the statistics for Cumbria and Lancashire: since 1997, about 150 more consultants, 3,000 more nurses and more than 1,800 health care consultants have arrived on the scene. The result of that investment, the new staff and the new ways in which they work is that waiting times have come down, and not a little, but massively. In 1998, nearly 300,000 people waited more than 13 weeks for an out-patient appointment. By December last year, that figure was down to just 171. In March 1997, about 165,000 people were waiting between six and eight months for an in-patient appointment; that has come down to just 35.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.0/5">Hon. Friends who have been in the House much longer than I will remember the days when they received many, many letters from constituents complaining about long waits. I hope that that flow of letters has dried up. The result of the reduced waiting times is that more people now live longer.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.0/6">This morning, I also looked at the death rate for an indicative disease, coronary heart disease, which, of course, is one of Britain's biggest killers. The mortality rate for that disease in Burnley came down by 32.8 per cent.&mdash;nearly a third&mdash;between 1997 and the last year for which we have statistics, which is 2003; that is a massive decline in the death rate from one of Britain's biggest killer diseases. That did not happen by accident; it happened through the sheer hard work of NHS staff, backed by the new tools with which they have been equipped.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.0/7">It is especially comforting that my hon. Friend's primary care trust has shown an enormous commitment to tackling many of the issues that the Government have seen fit to prioritise, such as cancer, coronary heart disease, choosing health, better services for the elderly, mental health, and diabetes. More than &pound;5 million is being spent on those services. To take a couple of local examples of great results in delivering better health care to my hon. Friend's constituents, the pulmonary rehabilitation service introduced in June last year has already delivered a 4.5 per cent. reduction in emergency medical admissions to hospital. The PCT is planning to recruit some 21 community matrons; there are already 11, and they are playing a vital role in making sure that more health care is managed in the community, so that people do not need to come into hospital for the help that they need.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.0/8">That investment is set to go on. My hon. Friend's PCT received about &pound;241 million in 2003&ndash;04. By 2006&ndash;07, that will have increased to &pound;340 million and in 2007&ndash;08 it will go up to &pound;371 million. That is an enormous increase in the cash available to the NHS in my hon. Friend's constituency. It is worth mentioning that much of the investment to date has benefited Burnley general hospital; &pound;30 million is re-providing new medical accommodation, and providing a new renal dialysis unit and a new entrance for the hospital. The hospital is, of course, the centrepiece of this morning's debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.0/9">The starting point for my hon. Friend's comments was whether there were Cabinet Office guidelines for how debates such as ours are conducted. I much regret the false alarm caused by the way in which the trust went about beginning the consultation. We recently recognised that problem explicitly in the White Paper on social care and health; in it, we set out that we would do far more to support local organisations by consulting in a manner that we think effective. As my hon. Friend knows, in that White Paper, we pioneered a new way of writing White Papers. We benefited from unprecedented levels of public engagement, and the process was extremely successful. We found that the public want debates about the local NHS and have intelligent views about it, and can structure what are often difficult decisions. We want to make sure that the learning that we acquired through writing that White Paper is made available to local communities.</p>

	<p pid="b.106.0/1">The Minister referred to the White Paper on social care and health. There is a reference in it to &quot;fully fledged&quot; accident and emergency departments. I invite him to tell hon. Members what the Government mean by that phrase, and to say whether that is what Burnley general hospital will have.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.106.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" speakername="Liam Byrne" colnum="106"  time="011:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h02.htm#60301h02_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.106.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention, and I will address that remark in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/2">The challenge for health chiefs in Burnley and Pendle, against a backdrop of a 20 per cent. increase in cash over the next two years and of record investment, is how to update their hospital for the 21st century. To answer that question, the steering group was set up to oversee the identification of options, and it identified a number of important criteria against which options would be developed.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/3">The first criterion was the need to expand and invest in community-based care that would increase the amount of planned emergency and long-term condition management that could take place in the community. In our consultation on the White Paper, the public said overwhelmingly that if care could be provided not just round the clock, but round the corner, that is where they would like it.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/4">The second criterion is that the patient experience for those going into hospital has to go forwards; it cannot go backwards. Ultimately, the debate must have a single test: is patient care being improved? Thirdly, hospitals need to develop into centres of excellence, supporting safe and high-quality treatment. Fourthly, redesigned hospitals and community facilities have to reduce waiting times; we made a big commitment to the British people in May to bring down waiting times from the scandal of one in 10 people waiting two years for treatment in 1997, to a maximum wait of just 18 weeks. Producing dramatic falls in waiting times has to be part of the criteria against which any new proposals are judged.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/5">The independent steering group meets on Friday to agree options for public consultation and I shall take a watching brief on the development of those proposals going forward. I shall be able to answer some of the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley has raised now, although not all of them, because we await Friday's decision on which options will go forward for consultation. However, I commit to write to her once those options are in the field and let her have my analysis of the answers to those questions, based on the two proposals that are put forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/6">First, and most importantly, no option will propose the closure of Burnley hospital. Secondly, A and E will not be put in jeopardy. Thirdly, we expect at least one of the options to see high dependency beds staying at Burnley. I understand that under that option those high dependency beds will have the flexibility to step up to intensive care beds, although this will have to be confirmed on Friday. I also believe that one of the options&mdash;again, this is subject to the confirmation on Friday&mdash;will involve new investment in women's and children's services. If that option is proposed, the logic is that those services will be centred on the Edith Watson ward.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/7">Those options are important because the number of cases that require intensive care in Burnley shows that there is a clear need. I asked officials this morning to dig out the number of high dependency cases and intensive care cases in Burnley last year. The answer is not inconsiderable: last year some 546 patients were admitted to high dependency units, with 191 admitted to intensive care, which is a little less than four a week.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.107.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1464" speakername="Kitty Ussher" colnum="107"  time="011:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h02.htm#60301h02_spnew3">
	<p pid="b.107.0/1">The Minister makes a powerful point. Given that there are 546 HDU cases and 191 ICU cases a year and that only one of the options proposes that there should be HDUs with the potential to flex up to ICUs, does he agree that that should be the preferred option? To phrase the question slightly differently, if the steering group and the hospital trust view that as the preferable option, should they not state that?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.108.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" speakername="Liam Byrne" colnum="108"  time="011:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h02.htm#60301h02_spnew4">
	<p pid="b.108.0/1">When the trust puts up different options for consultation it is vital that it also makes clear to the public the number of cases that we are talking about, to inform the engagement that it undertakes with clinicians. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" name="Gordon Prentice">My hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)</phrase> has made a good point in the past about the travel times between Burnley and&mdash;potentially&mdash;the new hospital in Blackburn. If the trust proposes that any option be preferred or not, it needs to explain the volumes for each kind of case and the implications of that if, for example, there are extra travel times.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/2">The trust is doing that against a moving background. For example, our reforms of the ambulance service envisage a future in which more and more emergency care can be administered by ambulance professionals working on the site. That is what ambulance staff want to do and it has been shown to deliver a decline in mortality in many parts of the country. There is a moving background, but it is imperative that the trust sets out not only the volumes of different kinds of cases but the implications for, say, mortality under the different options.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/3">I am sure that my answers will have provided my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley with some reassurance, although not complete reassurance, so I stress that decisions have not been made at this stage on the precise options for change. That decision will be made by the independent panel on Friday. The chief executive of the trust has kept hon. Members in touch with the development of some proposals and I expect that to continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/4">I assure all hon. Members that there can be no faits accomplis, no cabals and no decisions made behind closed doors. The NHS is under statutory obligations in the way it conducts consultations with the public. The trust is clear that it must put out firm options to public consultation following the analysis of pre-consultation options. I am advised that the trust anticipates that the proposed start date for the 12-week period of public consultation will be in March.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/5">In conclusion, I encourage hon. Members to stay closely engaged in the debate, if not to lead it. I am sure that there will be a rich discussion over the next 12 weeks in Burnley. I will remain closely involved in monitoring the situation and will be more than happy to meet delegations of my hon. Friend's constituents if she wishes to have me hear their views directly. I look forward to the consultation coming to a successful conclusion and, against the backdrop of a record increase in NHS resources, the development of option that immeasurably strengthens NHS services in my hon. Friend's constituency.</p>

	<p pid="b.109.1/1">In my view, the wealth of our nation is not measured by the gold stored in the vaults of the Bank of England, but by the nature of the society in which we live and the quality of our environment. Our national heritage includes not only our great public buildings, including ancient cathedrals like the one in Lichfield, but the geography of our market and historic towns and cathedral cities. However, that environment is under threat as a direct consequence of the Government's planning policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/2">Although we all appreciate the need for affordable housing and good quality start-up homes, the ever-increasing densities of new residential development are beginning to destroy the very nature of our heritage.</p>

	<p pid="b.109.2/1">On that point, the village of Cranfield in my constituency has two proposed new developments when the infrastructure in that village is already creaking, the schools are full and the village hall is not fit for purpose. Massive development is coming into my area, but developers are beginning to back off because of the lack of infrastructure for those developments.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.109.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" speakername="Michael Fabricant" colnum="109"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h03.htm#60301h03_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.109.3/1">My hon. Friend is relatively lucky because I know of developments that have gone ahead and many residents have moved in, but there is no infrastructure. At least in the instance she raises, the developers decided not to go ahead because the infrastructure is not ready.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.3/2">To continue my argument, it is interesting to note that although Tesco started with a &quot;stack 'em high, sell 'em cheap&quot; policy, it is now departing from that, whereas the Government have adopted a &quot;cram 'em in, and pile 'em high&quot; philosophy for housing. That began a few years back with planning policy guidance note 3, and they now propose even greater densities with their new planning policy statement on housing known as planning policy statement 3. Often, new housing developments arise when no additional infrastructure&mdash;schools, for example&mdash;is available and ready for the new residents when they move in.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.3/3">The current policy set by PPG3 dictates high-density residential development of 30 to 50 dwellings per hectare, with new development to be located mainly within existing settlements, making greater use of previously developed brownfield land. The aim is to make more sustainable use of land, and I do not dispute that it has helped to regenerate many run-down inner-city areas, where there are often large wastelands of derelict former industrial land. Such sites are quite clearly brownfield land and new residential development can do much to revitalise and uplift the area. Moreover, in major urban centres, densities of 30 to 50 homes per hectare are fairly typical, and produce increased land values that help to offset the higher costs of redeveloping run-down and sometimes contaminated sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.3/4">However, what may be appropriate in large urban centres such as Birmingham or Manchester is not appropriate in our market towns and historic cathedral cities. The Government seem to have a &quot;one size fits all&quot; mentality in planning policy, which fails to take into account the great diversity of architectural styles and building densities of English towns and settlements. Over the centuries, our smaller market towns have developed their own unique characters, which are very different from the major urban centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.3/5">Although PPS3 is an improvement on PPG3 in that it at least proposes a range of densities which vary by location, it does so only by substantially increasing the range of densities overall. Only in rural areas, where the density is set at 30 to 40 dwellings per hectare, is the proposed density range lower than PPG3 levels. For so-called suburban areas it proposes 35 to 55 dwellings, for urban areas 40 to 75 dwellings, and for city centres it proposes a staggering density of over 70 dwellings per hectare. The definition of what constitutes a &quot;city centre&quot; is far from clear, but I hope that it refers to large urban areas and not small cities such as Lichfield.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.3/6">PPG3 density policies are already having disastrous effects on historic towns, and that will only worsen if the greater densities proposed in PPS3 come into effect. I shall illustrate that by focusing on four particular issues: the poor standard of living environment that is created in high-density developments; the loss of well-established residential gardens to new housing development; the loss of existing employment land to residential development; and the threat to section 106 money, which is often used to improve the local environment. The examples I will give are for the city of Lichfield, at the heart of my constituency, but they are reflected throughout the smaller historic towns of our nation.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.3/7">I should begin by pointing out that the city of Lichfield is in fact a planned &quot;new town&quot;. Bishop Roger de Clinton saw to that early in the 12th century when he laid out a ladder-shaped pattern of wide streets to form a compact town centre around a bustling market square, from which Lichfield still benefits today. Like most developers, however, he also had a financial interest: the income from the rents was payable to the bishop. Lichfield prospered and grew steadily, so that by the 17th century it had 3,000 inhabitants. It took the next 300 years for the city to reach a population of 10,000, but then only 50 years for it to treble in size again to its current population of 28,000. That was brought about, first, through local authority development to take Birmingham overspill in the 1950s and 1960s, and then through a large estate of mainly privately owned housing in the 1980s. That expansion has been very rapid, but for the most part the new houses&mdash;both public and private&mdash;have been of a reasonable size, have their own gardens, are built on tree-lined streets and have recreation areas nearby. In short, they are the sort of houses in which people like to live.</p>

	<p pid="b.110.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for giving way to someone who represents the New Forest&mdash;&quot;new&quot; in that it dates from the 11th century, post William the Conqueror's invasion, as I am sure my hon. Friend is aware. Can he throw any light on why the Government appear to want to house extra people in the south-east or other parts of the country by cramming people into existing towns or cities, instead of building new towns or cities? Is that sensible planning or does it relate to electoral manipulation?</p>

	<p pid="b.111.0/1">My hon. Friend, as ever, raises a very interesting question. I shall take the fine example of our Prime Minister and say that this is probably not a question for me, but for the Minister for Housing and Planning. I hope that she will address that point when she responds.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/2">I mentioned that the population of Lichfield had expanded to 28,000 and that we had a pleasant new development, which was mainly built in the 1980s. However, the further major growth spurt taking place now is of a wholly different style and character to those of the past. The largest single site is a greenfield site on the edge of the city, where in the late 1990s permission was originally granted for 650 dwellings. However, in 2004, on the back of PPG3 policies, revised planning permission was granted to increase that to 1,100 dwellings. For the mathematically minded, that is 70 per cent. more houses on exactly the same area. If the proposed PPS3 policies had been in place, the increase could well have been far greater.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/3">Such high-density housing creates an inner-city style of development, totally out of keeping with the character of the rural fringe of an historic market town. The houses are predominantly three-storey units with relatively small rooms, handkerchief-sized gardens, or perhaps no gardens at all. I accept that some home owners enjoy that configuration, as it provides for easy maintenance, but the houses are packed so closely together and front so tightly on to the narrow estate roads that they are in almost permanent shade, even at the height of summer. There are some open landscaped areas, but almost nowhere that has suitable space for children to kick a football around. Slightly adapting Miranda's lines in &quot;The Tempest&quot; let me say, &quot;O, wonder! How many goodly creatures are there here! O brave new world. That has such houses in't.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.111.2/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his applause.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.2/2">Both PPG3 and the new PPS3 make great play of securing high-quality design, but it simply cannot be achieved when the fundamental ingredient of living space is not permitted. People need space inside their homes, and most want gardens outside to separate their house from their neighbour's, to provide a place to relax and in which their children and grandchildren can play in safety. We even have the ludicrous situation of four-storey blocks of two and three-bedroom so-called family apartments that have no private garden space, and the land that the developer &quot;saves&quot; becomes a communal area that counts towards the public open space provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.2/3">I shall move on from those new estates to consider the effects of planning policy on the more established areas of the city. Lichfield&mdash;I speak about Lichfield, but what I have to say applies throughout England and Wales&mdash;is fortunate to have many older properties built at a time when land was not so much at a premium. Those properties have gardens&mdash;sometimes large gardens&mdash;with trees and shrubs providing green havens for wildlife. Few people would equate those gardens with the derelict and abandoned industrial sites of inner cities, but in terms of Government targets for development on &quot;previously developed&quot; land, as they put it, those sites are one and the same thing, and they are all classed as brownfield sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.2/4">In the past, the problem did not really exist, because the cost of developing such relatively small garden plots meant that they were not usually viable. However, with ever-increasing residential land values derived from the ever-increasing densities that are permissible, developers are seizing those opportunities&mdash;who can blame them?&mdash;and more and more residential gardens are becoming high-density housing developments.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.2/5">In the past few years, we have seen several cases in which a perfectly good house on a large plot has been bought and then demolished to make way for several closely packed houses, or new homes have been built in the back gardens of existing houses. There have been strong protests from local residents with justifiable concerns about the loss of green space and the inappropriate style of development, but the development meets PPG3 criteria&mdash;it scores its brownfield points from the Government office&mdash;and the local planning authorities see little alternative but to grant approval. They are in an impossible situation.</p>

	<p pid="b.112.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that, as I mentioned to the Minister during the passage of recent planning legislation, one problem is that the PPGs and, for that matter, the PPSs have been published and imposed subsequent to the adoption of local plans by local authorities? Where it is possible for a local plan to be based on the PPG and to take into account the latest manifestation of the Deputy Prime Minister's thought processes, it is possible to alleviate the problem, but it is not possible to do so retrospectively.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.112.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" speakername="Michael Fabricant" colnum="112"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h03.htm#60301h03_spnew8">
	<p pid="b.112.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. That situation reflects a lack of co-ordination between national and local government, which is extraordinary given that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is responsible for that sort of planning matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.1/2">Returning to gardens, residential gardens provide far greater biodiversity than most agricultural land, so they have greater environmental value, particularly because they provide wildlife habitats in the heart of built-up areas where such habitats would otherwise be absent. Ironically, the loss of garden land usually has a far greater impact on the character of the surrounding area than the loss of an equivalent sized plot of greenfield land. Development of residential gardens should be strongly resisted, but planning guidance positively encourages it.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.1/3">At least the new PPS3 acknowledges that problem when it says that, although residential gardens are defined as brownfield land, that</p>
	<p pid="b.112.1/4" class="indent">&quot;does not necessarily mean they are suitable for development&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.1/5">It then negates that, however, by referring to the</p>
	<p pid="b.112.1/6" class="indent">&quot;positive contribution that intensification can make&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.112.1/7">by minimising the pressure on greenfield sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.1/8">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-02">2 February</phrase> the ODPM&mdash;obviously feeling some pressure on this point&mdash;issued a brief statement that typically passed the buck to local councils, saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.112.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Local planning authorities can already turn down applications for buildings in gardens if they are inappropriate or out of character with the local community.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.112.1/10">However, set against the clear encouragement in PPS3 about the &quot;positive contribution&quot; of such development, local planning authorities will be reluctant to risk the high costs of a planning appeal by refusing such applications. It costs the council tax payer money to lose such a fight.</p>

	<p pid="b.113.0/1">I know that it is not the correct planning term, but when I was on a planning committee, there used to be something that we called &quot;tandem development&quot;. There was an intention in the original planning development, which was met, but subsequently guidance comes in that is completely contrary to that. I accept the cost argument, but I wish that local authorities would be more robust in arguing the case. Does the hon. Gentleman agree?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.113.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" speakername="Michael Fabricant" colnum="113"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h03.htm#60301h03_spnew10">
	<p pid="b.113.1/1">I do agree with the hon. Gentleman. I have raised that point with my own authority, but it told me that in one case to fight and lose an appeal cost the authority &pound;250,000. At a time when local government is under financial pressure, those costs all have to be borne by the council tax payer. Perhaps we can understand the reluctance of councils to undertake such battles. I put it to him and, more importantly, to the Minister that by making her policy more clear, if only in her answers to me today and perhaps in the guidance that her Department issues, we could avoid such a problem arising. I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.1/2">My third point is on the loss of existing employment sites. Lichfield&mdash;I keep mentioning Lichfield, but my point applies to other areas&mdash;is predominantly a residential city. Many people travel out of the city each day to work in Birmingham and the surrounding conurbation. Clearly, all the daily traffic that that generates is not good for the environment or sustainability. Lichfield needs a much better balance between housing and employment sites, so that its residents can find employment in the immediate locality, but employment sites stand little chance when competing with the far greater property values that can be obtained from a high-density residential development.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.1/3">Instead of providing new employment sites, many of the employment sites in the city are being closed down and developed for housing. In most cases, it is not a result of business failure&mdash;they are going concerns&mdash;but the one-off bonanza of selling their land is apparently worth more than the long-term value of selling their product. A packaging factory now has 80 houses on it, and a concrete firm called Bison has permission for 175 houses. Even our greatly cherished old public houses such as the Carpenter's Arms and the Sozzled Sausage are being bought up and bulldozed to be replaced by yet more private housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.1/4">As with the development of gardens, the conversion of employment sites to residential development also attracts brownfield points, because it re-uses previously developed land and so&mdash;supposedly&mdash;benefits sustainability. However, what really happens is that it worsens the imbalance between housing and employment in the city, because more and more people have to travel out of the city to work, often to the relocated sites on the outskirts, which are inaccessible by public transport. They will probably have to drive out of town anyway to fill up with petrol, because most filling stations in the city have also been closed and sold as housing land. Even where land is earmarked for employment development, it is often not developed, because the landowners hold back in the hope of eventually securing a far greater financial gain from a residential development on the land.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.1/5">Finally, where planning policy currently provides a useful gain locally is through use of section 106 money, which is provided by developers. The money can be used by the democratically elected local planning authority to improve the local environment and provide necessary infrastructure. However now, the proposed introduction of a planning gain supplement&mdash;PGS&mdash;by the Treasury would require Lichfield district council and other councils to abandon their policies. That could hinder the ability to identify and respond through the planning process to the legitimate needs of wider social and community facilities than those available through PGS.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.1/6">The Government claim that the PGS will be a tax on developers, but it will also have a major financial impact on charities, which will receive less for their land from developers if they sell it. It will have an even more serious impact on charities developing their own land to fulfil their charitable purposes because they will not have received any income in terms of a price paid for the land against which they can offset the PGS. Yet again, the Chancellor is failing to trust locally elected bodies. He is imposing his will from the centre and introducing a stealth tax that will damage some of our most respected and deserving charities.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.1/7">I have four questions for the Minister. First, the Government make many fine statements about involving the local community in the planning process, so if a local community makes it clear it wants lower-density development&mdash;for example, houses with gardens&mdash;will the Government provide clear guidance that such local wishes can outweigh centralised density targets? If she did that, she would answer <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the very point raised by the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.1/8">Secondly, will the hon. Lady accept that development on residential gardens is hardly ever justifiable and amend the guidance in PPS3 to give a fairer and clearer definition of brownfield land that specifically excludes residential gardens and positively discourages building on them? Thirdly, to maintain a sustainable balance between employment and housing, will the Minister introduce measures to restrict new housing being developed on sites that are currently in viable economic employment use? Finally, will the Minister and her Department make robust representations to the Treasury not to abandon the principles of local democracy and the application of section 106?</p>
	<p pid="b.113.1/9">The environment of our historic towns is fragile, yet they are a reflection of our nation's heritage. The Government are the steward of our built heritage; they owe it to future generations to ensure that that environment is not lost for ever.</p>

	<p pid="b.115.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">My hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase> has done the House a great service in giving us the opportunity this afternoon to discuss planning issues. I very much hope that his speech is widely reported in the newspapers on his patch&mdash;indeed, I hope that the headline will be &quot;MP supports Sozzled Sausage&quot;, if nothing more.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.0/2">Banbury is an historic town. Until the start of the 1900s it had no other existence than as a market town. It existed simply as a market town and people who lived a day's cart ride away would go to Banbury market to sell their produce and stock, see their lawyers, and buy their provisions and take them home. In the 1980s and 1990s, we saw development and construction on the edge of town with Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons stores, all of which are excellent supermarkets, and more recently the Castle Keys development between Banbury town hall and the canal, with Marks and Spencer as an anchor site. Within a comparatively short time, there were three quite large supermarket developments on the edge of town and Marks and Spencer in the town. On the edge of town there was also increasing warehouse retail development, such as office supplies and carpet stores&mdash;hon. Members know the sort of thing I am talking about, which involves quite a large amount of footfall with considerable retail footage growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.0/3">Although Banbury as a town has grown and prosperity has grown, the amount of retail space has grown faster than the population, with the result that the historic core&mdash;the old shopping area of Banbury&mdash;does not receive the same amount of footfall as it once did. The consequence is a number of empty shops. Those shop premises that are occupied are increasingly occupied by charity shops, but some premises are boarded up and covered with graffiti. It is on that aspect of the subject that I shall focus this afternoon&mdash;I am conscious that other hon. Members wish to speak in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.0/4">Given the laws of supply and demand, there is no way that there will be infinite demand for retail space and we must accept that retail activity, like any other human activity, evolves and changes. Although some shops will remain within the historic core of the town&mdash;jewellers, wine merchants, specialist auction houses and so on&mdash;there will be many gaps. I have three suggestions for the Minister on what we can do with that space.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.0/5">First, I hope that some of the property could return to housing. We have a great shortage of social housing in north Oxfordshire. Although it is an issue for another day, I am genuinely concerned that the two large-scale voluntary transfer housing associations&mdash;Banbury Homes and Charter Housing&mdash;have no ability with the Housing Corporation to build new social housing. I do not know how we can get new social housing in a constituency such as mine.</p>

	<p pid="b.115.2/1">No. The right-to-buy policy was an extremely good policy, which created much more viable and vibrant communities. The problem now is how to create new social housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.2/2">There is an opportunity in historic town centres, but there is a difficulty. Many of the empty shops belong to property companies and retail consortiums and appear on their balance sheets as an asset value. It is often easier for them to hold those properties as an asset value than to develop them. I hope that the Minister will consider my first suggestion, which is that if property companies that own empty retail space in historic town centres are prepared to sell it for social housing, they should have relief from capital gains tax. That would be a real incentive for them to vacate the sites and to make them available to social landlords for housing for young people and elderly people, who would find it useful to live in town centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.2/3">Secondly, practically every top-floor flat over a shop in Banbury High street and Parson street is empty. Historically, when the shops were built the shopkeeper would live above the shop, but that does not happen now; the space is, at best, storage space, but more often it is empty. I know that at different times there have been attempts to encourage developers and social landlords to take on flats above shops, but that does not seem to have worked, so perhaps we could provide an incentive whereby if owners of shops were prepared to make the flats above them available, they could have some relief from corporation tax. There is a precedent for that: if any of us have lodgers in our house we can take rent of up to &pound;3,000 tax-free. The same incentive would encourage businesses to make flats above shops available, particularly to young people. These days, young people can usually only get into housing through the private rented sector with the benefit of housing benefit. Making sites in town centres available would be good news.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.2/4">Towns like Banbury have a number of historic buildings, but there is no protection for those historic buildings in the planning system. The listed building system protects buildings of architectural interest, but it does not protect buildings of historic interest such as the Banbury cake house, the shop that sold Banbury cakes. The old Banbury police station, which was demolished recently, was not of great architectural interest, but was of great historic interest in the market town. The Spencer corset factory was a wonderful 1920s art deco building that could easily have been converted into flats, but it was a lot cheaper for the developers to knock it down and start again. The same was true of the gardener's house of the People's park. I pay tribute to Banbury Civic Society, which tried hard to persuade the district council not to grant planning permission to demolish those properties, but the council clearly feels, as my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield said, that planning law and guidance ties its hands. I suggest to the Minister that we and, perhaps, civic societies throughout the country need to give thought to whether we need a designation&mdash;even if it were rarely used&mdash;of buildings of historic interest. Perhaps there could be a limit on the number of buildings that a local authority could declare to be of historic interest, but any historic market town will have several icon buildings of historic importance to the community, which, if they were to go, would leave a kind of ersatz streetscape. One town would look exactly like another, which would be a source of considerable sadness.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.2/5">I do not have a solution to the last issue that I want to raise with the Minister. Often, district councils make intelligent proposals on developing and improving a town centre. For example, in 1995, Cherwell district council commissioned an urban design study by Roger Evans Associates on how the hole that had developed in the historic core of Banbury could be replaced and repaired by rebuilding the historic street frontage. It considered a mixed-use allocation, and the district council went through all the necessary planning steps, including a detailed policy in the non-statutory Cherwell local plan and so on. The difficulty is that some landowners who own bits of derelict land&mdash;perhaps part of a car park, whatever&mdash;in various parts of the historic town have no incentive to develop them. They can sit on their land indefinitely, in the hope that some day a better planning opportunity may arise. Clearly, one cannot compulsorily purchase all the land, so there must be a carrot to encourage landowners who are sitting on key sites in historic town centres to develop those sites. I acknowledge that the mechanism may be difficult, but there must be some way to do that. Otherwise, the most tardy, unimaginative landowner can hold back imaginative town centre historic redevelopment, which would restore the townscape.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.2/6">My message to the Minister is that we cannot hold back new retail development. Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons are popular because people want to shop there.</p>

	<p pid="b.117.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes several interesting practical suggestions, but is he prepared to write off the historic town centre as a place of retail activity? That would be a bitter blow to many historic towns, and it is something that has been made much worse by the proliferation of supermarkets around the edge of towns and all the public transport and other problems that they generate.</p>

	<p pid="b.117.1/1">I believe that my constituents genuinely feel that Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Tesco and Marks and Spencer have been of real benefit. Retail prices have come down overall, and the range of food and goods in the shops has increased as a consequence of their presence. I shall not take up the time of the House, but there was an article in <i>The Economist</i> only last week that demonstrated that to be the case. The number of people using supermarkets each Saturday and Sunday is a testament to their popularity, and I do not think that we should blame them for the ills of town centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/2">Shops will continue to prosper in historic town centres, but the amount of retail activity over the past 20 years has not expanded at the rate of expansion in the size and scale of supermarkets. Therefore, with the best will in the world, some shops in historic town centres will no longer be viable. One can see the result of market forces in the voids on Banbury High street and Parsons street, and in the number of shops for which the only use is as charity shops. Charity shops perform a useful function in recycling goods and raising money for charities, but that is not a long-term future. We must work out how to make such areas viable again, and turning some of the buildings back into residential accommodation for the frail, the elderly, young people and people who find it useful and beneficial to live in a town centre would be a good way to do that. One sees that in towns and cities in France and elsewhere in Europe, and I see no reason why it could not be done in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/3">We must work out how the planning system can help to reinvigorate town centres, and blaming the supermarkets will not help us do that. We must acknowledge that we need to go with the grain of market forces in reinvigorating and reviving historic centres of market towns, to meet society's needs, in particular needs for housing and other activities. We must also take measures to protect historic buildings and working organisations such as civic societies.</p>

	<p pid="b.118.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase> on securing this debate. I agree with much of what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> said, particularly about the floors above shops in our town centres, which ought to be put to better use.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/2">I have a question for the Minister: will she confirm that section 106 agreements are not site-specific and that it is the local authority, not the developer, that determines what should be provided under section 106? I know that that is the case, but there is at least one local authority that thinks that it is the developer who decides what should be provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/3">I was interested to hear that Lichfield was a new town in the 12th century. I have news: Britain's oldest recorded town was, in fact, its first new town. Colchester was set out by the Romans almost 2,000 years ago, and the street grid pattern from that time still exists. That is both good news and bad news&mdash;good news, obviously, from a tourist's perspective, but not quite so good for traffic movement, particularly in the greater core of the town centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/4">Colchester should be a city. It was a city when it was the first capital of Roman Britain, but, alas, it dropped out in the mists of time. It should have been reinstated for the millennium, but I was advised in a response to a parliamentary question that only the Head of State can withdraw the title of city once it has been granted. I have been able to establish that no Head of State in the subsequent 2,000 years removed the title of city from Colchester, so Colchester is still a city. Alas and alack, the Home Office, which was then dealing with millennium city applications, refused to accept my watertight legal argument.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/5">I wish to speak in this debate because, like the hon. Member for Lichfield, I represent an historic town. There are many attractions in such towns, but there is also a downside in that other towns can do many things that we, quite rightly, cannot. That means that we need a bit of assistance from the county council or central Government. They should acknowledge that we are custodians of our historic past and that that comes at a price. It ought to be considered when it comes to transport grants, park-and-ride schemes and so on.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/6">I should point out that I am the secretary of the all-party group on small shops, which only a couple of weeks ago produced a report on the threat to small shops. It includes many recommendations, which I trust will be taken on board by various Departments. The report is timely, as Tesco is about to come back into Colchester town centre. Having gone out of town and done its bit, it is now coming back into town to do its bit again. In Colchester, it proposes to go into Crouch street. That attractive street, with its parade of local shops, is straight out of Walmington-on-Sea, &quot;Dad's Army&quot; and the 1940s.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/7">We may talk about a listed building here or a listed building there, but that is only part of it. It is the whole character, the whole street scene, that is important. A building might not be worthy of retention on its own, but if we take it out of the street scene, that scene is like a beautiful lady's smile with one tooth gone. What was attractive now has a gap. We should not talk about an individual building being listed; it is the street scene, the group setting, that is important.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/8">I am sure that the Minister was already aware&mdash;if not, her officials will have briefed her&mdash;of contributions that I have made in the past two years' Christmas recess debates and on my ten-minute Bill, which I introduced only last month. I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1579" name="Bernard Jenkin">the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin)</phrase> for drawing so much attention to my Local Government Referendums Bill. By his opposition he eloquently demonstrated why local democracy needs referendums when the local authority is out of step with what the community wants to happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/9">What can be done to help small shops and small businesses? Central Government need to realign the setting of business rates. At the moment, the small corner shop pays more per square foot in business rates than the out-of-town supermarket. That cannot be right, because the existing unlevel playing field becomes even more unlevel. In fact, it is not unlevel; there is now a slope and the only question is how steep the slope is. Perhaps central Government could consider that. I also urge them to consider English Heritage's thoughts on value added tax for new build as opposed to conversions, restorations and so on. That would be a positive step towards addressing the concerns of the hon. Member for Lichfield about brownfield development. We should be encouraging the retention of what is best, though conversions and so on, rather than almost encouraging developers on to greenfield sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/10">We are left with the interesting question of what is a greenfield site and what is a brownfield site. Let us imagine that a large mental institution occupies 50 acres of landscaped grounds. I think that I am right in saying that, under the Government's definition, those 50 acres of landscaped grounds, sports fields and so on would be classed as a brownfield site. The institution ought to be classed as a brownfield site, but I question whether classing the landscaped grounds as such makes sense and whether someone in the local infant school would recognise a sports field and a landscaped park as a brownfield site. I think that everyone would recognise that as a greenfield site.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/11">I referred to my membership of the all-party small shops group. I urge the Minister and her Government colleagues to see what else can be done to try to resist the growing clone-town image. There are many towns where, if someone was blindfolded on the way in, they would not know what part of the country they were in, let alone which town. That phenomenon is very worrying, because local identity is important. I hope that we can consider that.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/12">I shall conclude with the Romans. The setting of Colchester's Roman wall is a major tourist attraction. Unfortunately, there is a grandiose plan for an art gallery with a public subsidy of &pound;600,000 a year and the closure of the town's bus station, which the local community strongly opposes. In addition, with the Vineyard Gate St. Botolph's redevelopment, it is proposed to demolish some 40 buildings, ripping the guts out of part of the central area of Britain's oldest recorded town. That is being funded and encouraged by the East of England Development Agency, which was saying only two days ago in the <i>Eastern Daily Press </i>how proud it was of the amount of money that it was putting into Norwich to protect that city's heritage. By my reckoning, those are double standards. Obviously, the agency hoped that the MP for Colchester would not read what it was putting out in the Norwich paper, but I saw that. There is a need for joined-up government in the East of England Development Agency, let alone in the Government, because there are many buildings in the area that, although perhaps not worthy of listed building status, are important in the collective setting. Those buildings managed to survive two Luftwaffe raids on Colchester in the second world war, but it does not look as though they will survive Colchester council in the third millennium.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/13">There are many buildings that the Victorian Society, English Heritage and the Colchester civic society&mdash;this echoes the comments about the importance of civic society&mdash;want to remain. Unfortunately, the power of the developers&mdash;whoever they may be and who are, I suggest, working covertly with the local authority&mdash;is carrying the day. Many of us are looking to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to stop the latest attack on the heart of the town where I have lived for most of my life and which I have the honour to represent.</p>

	<p pid="b.120.0/1">It is a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase>. I add <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">my congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase> on securing the debate, but I shall start by saying how much I agree with a couple&mdash;not all&mdash;of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase>, first on what he describes as icon buildings, which I describe as landmark buildings and which my local planner tells me ought to be called locally listed buildings. Whatever they are, they are buildings that are of a special character in the town.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.0/2">On the night before the general election, I saw a building that was about to be demolished in Shanklin and I was so horrified that I took time out from my canvassing to telephone the local conservation officer to ask her exactly when planning permission had been given in relation to the building. It is a former pub that was called &quot;The Clarendon&quot; because it was built of timbers that were rescued following the shipwreck of the Clarendon off St. Catherine's point in the 17th century, yet that building was being demolished to make way for some pretty ghastly flats. I am pleased to say that the decision was taken when Isle of Wight council was controlled by a different political party from the one that controls it now. I would very much like more action to be taken to secure individual landmark buildings and to secure the protection of the character of areas through the conservation area approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.0/3">I have another story for the Minister. A house on the front in Cowes called &quot;Mornington&quot; was listed with the agreement of English Heritage. It was then, while the   area was subject to consultation on the question whether it should have conservation area status, delisted without anyone in my constituency being notified. It was then demolished while the area was still under consideration. When I challenged the local authority on why it had not imposed the conservation area first and then consulted, instead of consulting first and then imposing the conservation area, it told me that it was regarded nationally as bad practice not to consult, presumably, a developer who would want to demolish a building before measures were put in place that would prevent him from demolishing it. I do not think that what I have suggested is bad practice. The Minister looks puzzled. I hope that she will look into how more sensible guidance can be given. I echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.0/4">I also echo the remarks of the hon. Member for Colchester on clone-town Britain. We are certainly seeing the development that he described in too many of our town and city centres. I note what he says about VAT, although I would rather see VAT imposed on new building than taken off repairs to old buildings. It is always easier to argue for improvements to old buildings.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.0/5">On section 106 agreements, which the hon. Gentleman also mentioned, I am concerned to hear that it is now possible for a developer, having secured a development with a section 106 agreement and signed up to it, to challenge after five years have passed the agreement that he freely entered into. That seems to be a case of developers having their cake and eating it, but of course it is not uncommon for developers to try to do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.0/6">Finally, I should like to reinforce the point that I made to my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield about the unitary development plan falling out of date. My local plan was only approved in 1997, yet it is already significantly out of date and has been made more so by changes in Government guidance. I am pleased to say that my local authority is proceeding rapidly with the creation of its local development framework, but however rapidly it proceeds, there is a gap through which the developers can sneak and develop in ways that my councillors and I do not like.</p>

	<p pid="b.121.0/1">I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider another scenario, where the local authority, having signed its adopted local plan, proposes in its own application to go against what it had agreed and adopted only a year before.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.121.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" speakername="Andrew Turner" colnum="121"  time="015:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h03.htm#60301h03_spnew19">
	<p pid="b.121.1/1">My position on that is clear. Local authorities should not be judge and jury in their own application, because that is contrary to the rules of natural justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.1/2">Town centre regeneration is the most important issue that we have touched on this afternoon. We can do a number of things to improve the quality of life in town centres and prevent them from being damaged. First, they should have conservation area status, which would protect the teeth in the face of the beautiful woman, to whom the hon. Gentleman referred. Secondly, we have to consider street design and look at the relationship between planning, conservation and highways. In many cases, highway engineers do not bulldoze&mdash;although they do that all too frequently&mdash;but drive a metaphorical coach and horses through a conservation area by installing appalling street furniture. At the foot of Quay street in my constituency, in the middle of a conservation area and less than five minutes from where I live, there is a forest of horrid street signs.</p>

	<p pid="b.122.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that in considering street design, there should be a concept of density appropriate to the area? The new PPS3 is increasing density rates dramatically from up to 24 dwellings per unit under the previous system bar one, which is leading to three-storey development in essentially residential areas where two-storey development prevails.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.122.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" speakername="Andrew Turner" colnum="122"  time="015:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h03.htm#60301h03_spnew21">
	<p pid="b.122.1/1">There should be an allowance for appropriate densities as far as possible and such decisions should, as far as possible, be taken locally by people acquainted with the local circumstances, not, as is the case in my constituency, by inspectors in Bristol appointed by the Deputy Prime Minister in London.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.1/2">I should also like to mention the materials from which streets are built. My local authority has just built a nice new pavement in Wroxall, but as in far too many places it is made from tarmac, with the kind of kerbstones that are seen in modern developments. It is inappropriate in a village. Such things need to be taken care of rather more carefully.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.1/3">In relation to local shops, the hon. Member for Colchester mentioned clone towns. I have not read the document to which he referred, although I have read press statements about it. There is a case for protecting and encouraging the development of more local shops in town centres. One way to do that is to adopt the policy, as some local authorities do, of allowing rate relief to non-chain stores, which has a cost attached but is within the capacity of local authorities. I was told of a case in Hinkley, where the local authority developed land that it owned specifically for local traders' occupation. That approach might be taken by means of a section 106 agreement, even on land that is not owned by a local authority. If we can get 40 per cent. social housing from house builders, perhaps we could get, say, 10 per cent. social shopping from developers of shops. Indeed, I recognise that in many cases some supermarkets that want to acquire a site in towns do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.1/4">I disagree most with my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury on the position of the supermarkets and the house builders, which are terrifying lobbies that wield enormous power. In the 1980s, Tesco, which funded the local government reception year in, year out at the Conservative party conference&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.122.3/1">The hon. Gentleman clearly knows about the others.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.3/2">Tesco was busy trying to buy the votes of councillors on local planning committees. At the time, we did not realise the damage that that would do to town centres. Similarly, there are builders, including in my constituency Persimmon, a national chain&mdash;I would not dare to mention a local chain, of course&mdash;which, having secured planning permission for x houses, managed to cram them by bad building, not bad design, to the end of the site so there was room for two or three more left over. Of course, that is just an amendment to a planning application in some cases and does not require advertising, so unless local people go out with a tape measure in the middle of the night they do not know what is happening.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.3/3">The big lobby groups need to be resisted. I am pleased to note the pressure on the authorities of the House to recognise which lobby groups are funding some of the all-party groups, because if those groups are funded behind the scenes by big lobbyists, we should know, just as we and the public should know if our hon. and right hon. Friends are funded behind the scenes.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.3/4">My concern about the supermarkets is not only that they damage trade in the town centres&mdash;I recognise that they are popular; of course, they are&mdash;but that they have a number of unfair competitive advantages. First, their trading practices and purchasing policies are deeply unfair to farmers in this country, so I cannot think what they are doing to farmers in the developing world.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.3/5">Secondly, they have free car parking on site, which they have acquired over a long period. I recognise that in many cases it is the local council's fault that it is not easier for people to park their cars in the town centre, but if supermarkets have free parking on site and there is no scope for new supermarkets to open, they are a local monopoly. Tesco at Westridge in my constituency, the only supermarket in north-east Wight, has a current application to double its sales space. That will undoubtedly damage three of my nine towns, Sandown, Shanklin and Ryde; that is recognised. Some of the planning gain that we would supposedly get from approving this application by Tesco is a tiny amount of money going into Ryde. Supermarkets are local monopolies and should be recognised as such.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.3/6">Thirdly, it should be recognised that supermarkets are vertical monopolies. The hon. Member for Colchester talked of Tesco opening a branch in his shopping street. Having driven many of the businesses out of town centres, it is now taking over some of the few remaining smaller shops and chains and damaging trade in that way.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.3/7">Fourthly, supermarkets are hugely damaging to the environment. The level of packaging should be a planning issue, as should food that is grown in my constituency being taken 100 miles and then brought back to be sold. That is exactly what is happening. Planning considerations should include whether additional haulage is required and whether jobs are protected in the local area through opportunities for people to sell local produce. We can do a great deal to improve the planning system. I am sorry to say that in some cases in the past local authorities have been a bit feeble and, far too frequently, planning officers have said, &quot;We'll lose on appeal, we'd lose a lot of money&quot;, and the council members feel compelled to vote in favour of an application that they would rather vote against.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.3/8">I suspect that since May last year members of my local authority have rejected more planning applications than were rejected in the preceding four years when the authority was under different control. That is because they are beginning to realise that such decisions are vital to the future prosperity, economy and quality of life of my constituents. I hope that the Minister will give us some hope that those issues can be taken account of in future planning guidance.</p>

	<p pid="b.124.0/1">First, I apologise to you, Mr. Chope, and to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase> for not being in my place at the start of this debate. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this debate, because protecting the unique character of our constituencies is a huge priority for all Members of this House.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.0/2">The constituency that I have the privilege of representing has a number of historic landmarks, the most famous of which is perhaps Bramall hall, a magnificent manor house dating back to the 15th century. During my time as leader of Stockport metropolitan borough council, we took positive steps to protect the character of the area surrounding the hall and to preserve its unique qualities.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.0/3">The area is blessed with sites of historic and architectural importance throughout the borough of Stockport, including a market that dates back to mediaeval times. However, it also faces high demand for housing and other developments, so I empathise with the hon. Gentleman's cause this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.0/4">All of us have the responsibility to seek to balance the competing needs of housing demand with the protection of the character of our towns, villages and neighbourhoods. That is one of the reasons why my party strongly supports cutting VAT on home improvements. Literally hundreds of thousands of properties throughout the country could be brought back into use if only there were the financial incentives.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.0/5">In addition, I agree with the assertion that loopholes in planning policy and guidance allow building work up to the curtilage of the plot, meaning that gardens and other spaces can be compromised. Attempts to close that loophole through legislation are ongoing, and my colleagues support that course of action. However, it should be acknowledged that the Government's record on developing brownfield, as opposed to greenfield, sites is reasonably good. Nevertheless, pressures persist on communities such as those we are debating this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.0/6">There is a wealth of guidance from a variety of sources that seeks to preserve the character of historic locations when it comes to planning. Indeed, English Heritage has published detailed proposals for principles that should be applied to developments in areas of historic importance. They include the careful use of materials, incorporating historic street patterns, detailed site analysis and plenty of other guidance, which, if consistently implemented, would have a very positive effect.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.0/7">Of course, there is guidance from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, particularly in PPS6, although that has a high degree of internal conflict in respect of market towns, historic towns and cathedral cities. One of the statement's basic premises is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.124.0/8" class="indent">&quot;It is not the role of the planning system to restrict competition, preserve existing commercial interests or to prevent innovation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.124.0/9">However, much of the document seems to suggest a high level of encouragement, and even protection, of traditional businesses such as markets:</p>
	<p pid="b.124.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Local authorities should ensure that their markets remain attractive and competitive by investing in their improvement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.124.0/11">The statement goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="b.124.0/12" class="indent">&quot;Local authorities should, where appropriate, seek to protect existing facilities . . . for people's day-to-day needs and seek to remedy deficiencies in local shopping and other facilities to help address social exclusion.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.124.0/13">Detailed research on PPS6 and other planning guidance shows that that top-down approach does not always produce the desired outcomes on the ground, and that the results in terms of development are at best patchy.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.0/14">My party's aim is to decentralise the system, speed up the planning process, increase sustainability and give communities a much greater say over land use in their areas and improve their ability to shape their local environment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.125.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" speakername="Alan Beith" colnum="125"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h03.htm#60301h03_spnew25">
	<p pid="b.125.0/1">I point my hon. Friend to an example in my part of the world, where as a result of top-down decisions on the regional spatial strategy by a distant and unelected regional assembly, historic towns such as Alnwick and Berwick are being told that only 60 houses a year will be allowed to be built in the entire district. Sustainability of house building is also important to the conservation of historic towns.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.125.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" speakername="Mark Hunter" colnum="125"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h03.htm#60301h03_spnew26">
	<p pid="b.125.1/1">I thank my right hon. Friend for his contribution. He makes an interesting point, and I shall refer further to such issues a little later.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.1/2">We believe that the best way to protect important sites of the sort that we are discussing is to end interference from Whitehall and the Secretary of State in the process of drawing up local development plans. Frankly, we want to get central Government off the backs of local people. My party has also proposed the concept of the community plan, under which a community would set out what it sought to achieve from the council's local development plan, and in some circumstances could propose that some land should be zoned for particular purposes. The community plan would then form a subsection of the local development plan. Under our system, the planning system would become much more community-focused, and be bottom-up rather than top-down. That need not mean building fewer homes than are currently proposed. Communities can respond to their needs if they are given the freedom to do so; the end result will often be better and more acceptable than a plan handed down from Whitehall via regional offices demanding, say, that 100,000 homes should be built in a particular region.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.1/3">In addition to the community plan, we have also proposed much wider use of pre-application consultation so that developers, and the community in which they wish to build, can reach agreement on applications. We believe that that is a route through which communities can influence section 106 agreements. If land is suitable for development, community involvement in drawing up the remit for the site will be a key approach for ensuring that the needs of the community are met. Such a community-led approach is impossible under the present centralised planning system.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.1/4">Ultimately, the greatest action we could take would be to reform the planning system, so that local and regional authorities can make more decisions for themselves about what developments are allowed. By involving the community&mdash;the people who know and appreciate their areas more than any civil servant in Whitehall ever could&mdash;we can promote development to meet our needs and protect our constituencies at the same time.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.1/5">Before I finish, I should like to ask whether, given his obvious commitment to preserving the character of his area, the hon. Member for Lichfield was as surprised as I to hear his party proposing that there should be building on the green belt. Surely that policy, announced only recently by the shadow Chancellor, will do precisely the opposite of what the hon. Gentleman is calling for this afternoon. Concreting over our precious green space is hardly the best way to preserve the unique heritage of our market towns, historic towns and cathedral cities.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.126.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" speakername="Alistair Burt" colnum="126"  time="015:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h03.htm#60301h03_spnew27">
	<p pid="b.126.0/1">This debate has been wide-ranging, interesting and enjoyable, as these debates always are. First, I should say that normally <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1858" name="Michael Gove">my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)</phrase> would answer a debate on the impact of planning policy, but unfortunately he is indisposed. Anything I say that goes contrary to our Front-Bench team's planning policy will be immediately disowned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1711" name="Caroline Spelman">my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman)</phrase>, so I let the Chamber know in advance that pretty much I have free rein.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/2">Debates such as this are enjoyable because there is always some element of competition, along the lines of the Monty Python sketch with the three Yorkshiremen. The competition has been partly about pubs and local produce&mdash;we had the Sozzled Sausage and the Banbury cakes; my contribution is the Bedfordshire clanger, a wonderful pasty with meat at one end and fruit at the other, wonderfully made by Mr. David Gunn and his team at Sandy.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/3">Hon. Members have also competed on the age of their new towns; we went from the 12th century to the 11th century, which was then trumped by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">the Romans of the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase>. All I can say to that is that my children were born in a part of Bury known as Jericho, and Jericho is the oldest city in the entire world&mdash;so I win that one.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/4">I shall go into a little more substance, as I think is appropriate. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase> on raising the issue of planning policy clearly and sensibly. He picked out a variety of issues, a number of which I shall address, paying particular attention to two. He mentioned the problems that are likely to be caused by the new stealth tax&mdash;the planning gain supplement&mdash;that the Government are planning. It will drive up the cost of properties, be passed on to those who buy houses and do nothing to improve the affordability of housing for those who seek it. He was right to draw attention to yet another stealth tax from a Government who have become renowned for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/5">Secondly, I strongly support my hon. Friend in his concerns about the so-called back garden development, which is a new phenomenon. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" name="Mark Hunter">The hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter)</phrase> is nodding, and I know that that development is a concern to many of us. My hon. Friend the Member for Meriden tabled early-day motion 486 as long ago as July last year, almost as soon as the new Parliament convened. It noted</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/6" class="indent">&quot;the growing public concern over the damaging effect of inappropriate infill development on the character of local neighbourhoods&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/7">At that time the problem was related to PPG3.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/8">Back garden infill is insidious, setting neighbour against neighbour. At its worst, it can take out a row of houses, because the asking price for a house becomes impossible for a householder to resist. The houses can then be removed and a new estate constructed. That is not the proper way to go about things. We are right to resist it and to urge the Government to be much more direct, as my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield said, in their opposition to it, as opposed to their current lukewarm attitude.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/9">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for drawing attention to the key point, which is the need to preserve the distinctive character of our great historic cities and market towns&mdash;those places in this country that have history. We are proud of our heritage, but it is threatened by the inevitable march of progress. That has its place and, as hon. Members from all parts of the Chamber have mentioned, careful conservation can do wonders. Inappropriate development could be a tragedy. We have lived through the renovations of this country in the 1960s and we know what we lost. We all hoped that we had learned some lessons, but we are not so sure now that we did.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/10">The Campaign to Protect Rural England produced a report in March 2004 entitled &quot;Market Towns: Losing their Character?&quot;. It will be familiar to all of us, including the Minister. It set out a series of concerns that have been echoed today. Its survey</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/11" class="indent">&quot;found that the individual distinctiveness of some market towns are at risk through ill considered, uniform development which can generate intolerable levels of congestion and stretch local services to their limits.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/12">Various comments were made in the survey, which ranged throughout the country. The report stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/13" class="indent">&quot;local retail outlets are struggling; availability of local foods is decreasing; the use of local materials in new building developments is rare.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/14"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" name="Andrew Turner">My hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> mentioned that last point. The report continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/15" class="indent">&quot;The quality, character and distinctiveness of market towns and their surrounding countryside is a huge economic asset which provides opportunity and competitive advantage. It is important that this is recognised&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/16">My concern is that the Government are failing to learn some blindingly obvious lessons. Three or four particular points raised in this debate make that case for me. I do not think that the Government do learn lessons. <i>The Observer</i> this weekend had an article entitled &quot;Mr Prescott, please save us from another supermarket mega-shed&quot;. It was about a planning application in Sunderland, where a local proposal to have a much more appropriate town centre development runs the risk of being lost because of proposals by a supermarket called Tesco.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/17">I sometimes wish that we played Tesco bingo in the House of Commons and awarded ourselves points for each time that company's name was mentioned, because we would all be doing very well. I am afraid that Tesco is going to take another beating from me, because I am less generous towards it than <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase>. I feel strongly that it has its place; there is no doubt that supermarkets have made an extraordinary contribution to the retail life of this country and to the everyday lives of many people. They have their place, but we have learned over the years that sometimes their impact can be more damaging than it is worth.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/18">In the 1970s and 1980s, we learned of the damage that out-of-town centres do to town centres. I wish that the Government would now learn the dangers of the express stores&mdash;the small stores&mdash;coming into what used to be the independent retailers' area. I do not object to Tesco the supermarket; we have learned to live with it and it has many advantages, although I know that farmers are very concerned about the pressure on them as suppliers. However, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the worrying involvement of the big stores in small-scale retail developments in towns is very damaging.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/19">The Association of Convenience Stores claims that some 2,000 independent stores went out of business last year. The Forum of Private Business has written to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. Nick Goulding, chief executive of the FPB said:</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/20" class="indent">&quot;We have written to the secretary of state, calling on him to use his powers to instruct the Office of Fair Trading to stop dithering&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/21">That comment was made about the monopoly position of large stores. He continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/22" class="indent">&quot;High streets are in crisis, with shops being forced to close at a rate of 50 a week due to the dominance of the retail chains.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/23">The Government have failed to learn lessons and to appreciate the dangers that are affecting our market towns, which were set out in the 2004 report to which I referred and which are echoed two years later, in 2006. There has been a slow response. Our town centres and historic market towns demand something better.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/24">The Government are also slow in relation to design. The design of new buildings in historic settings&mdash;indeed, in any setting&mdash;is important. The Minister will be aware of the criticisms made by the urban task force in November 2005. The UTF was set up by the Government but finds its voice listened to increasingly less. It issued an independent report that was critical of new design and new developments. On page 5, it stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/25" class="indent">&quot;The majority of new developments remain poorly designed, with public realm and buildings of a very low quality. Where some good practice has emerged, it tends to be in smaller 'infill' schemes where designers can relate to an existing context. However, too many housing projects are just that&mdash;thoughtlessly laid out groups of cheaply built fragmented residential units relatively isolated from surrounding communities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/26">That is not what we need; we need a Government who listen carefully.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/27">A further Government failing is that when a good initiative is introduced, such as the market towns initiative that emerged through the Countryside Agency, they cannot help but meddle. They took that initiative away from the Countryside Agency and put part of it with regional development agencies. That was a transfer to an unelected body&mdash;a collection of interests which gets increasing powers and responsibilities. The Government meddled with the basis of an initiative that had attracted some interest and built up core skills, which were then diffused. The Government cannot resist being top-down, meddling and slow to respond to things that are necessary. That is the core of the issues that colleagues have raised today about our historic market towns and cities.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/28">We need appropriate planning guidance that recognises the distinctive differences and characters of urban areas in the United Kingdom. We also need a Government who demonstrate that they have learned lessons and that they have seen the dangers to our historic cities and market towns, which colleagues from all parts of the Chamber have discussed in their contributions. Above all, we need a Government who recognise the importance of local decision making rather than having decisions increasingly being made by unelected regional assemblies.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.0/29">The hon. Member for Cheadle had a sly dig at comments made by the shadow Chancellor, but he will have to consider how he reconciles local decision making with his own party's demands for regional government and for moving things further away from local regional councils. I assure him that our policy on the green belt is fixed: the green belt is important and remains a vital part of Conservative party planning policy; ensuring that we make better use of brownfield sites and of ill-designated green sites might help everyone. The House, and our historic cities and market towns are seeking those things, but I suspect we will not get them until the Minister and I swap places in some years to come.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.129.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" speakername="Yvette Cooper" speakeroffice="The Minister for Housing and Planning"  colnum="129"  time="015:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h03.htm#60301h03_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.129.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase> on securing the debate and for leading the tributes to market towns throughout the country. I shall resist the temptation to tell the House about the market town in which I grew up, and I shall almost resist the temptation to pay tribute to the two market towns in my constituency. It has an interesting market town with sadly hidden Roman heritage, but more visible mediaeval heritage, including&mdash;to match <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the Banbury cakes of the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase>&mdash;Pontefract cakes, which are still enjoyed throughout the country. I also draw attention to the liquorice sweet factories that still exist in Pontefract.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/2">I have no doubt about the importance of our market towns not only to the quality of life for those who live in them, but to local economies throughout the country. Many different issues have been raised today. I shall begin by talking about some town centre matters, after which I shall refer to many of the questions about housing asked by the hon. Member for Lichfield. Planning guidance has changed the balance in favour of our town centres, especially retail development. That is the right way forward. It is interesting that even IKEA has started to change its format to cover town centre developments, too. While it is true that many supermarket chain stores say that they prefer out-of-town developments, we know of many cases in which supermarkets are involved in the redevelopment of town and city centres, and they are often at the heart of urban renaissance and regeneration.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/3">The hon. Member for Banbury made some thoughtful proposals on town centre regeneration, some of which we should obviously treat as Budget submissions to the Chancellor. I agree that town centre living and mixed housing, retail and other developments in town centres are important for the life of a town centre, not only because they make it more sustainable, support the local economy and keep buildings in use, but because they can improve the safety and the quality of life in a town centre. Such areas no longer become the deserted no-go zones in which people feel frightened late in the evening.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/4">I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's ideas about the way in which we could support social housing and I shall look into that issue. Local authorities can use a wide range of powers to support town centres and to promote their development and redevelopment, whether they be planning powers, compulsory purchase orders or working relationships with local businesses to support business improvement districts. We have provided guidance and support on how to manage town centres, such as neighbourhood wardens and policing. We certainly need to provide guidance to support competition and the economic life of our town centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/5">There have been debates about clone towns. Some people are hostile to chain shops, but if Next moved into one of the town centres in the market towns in my constituency, it would be really good. If some big chains moved into the market towns, that would be a sign of economic growth and prosperity. We must inject a little economic reality into our debates on the nature of our towns. We certainly need to support a wide variety of different businesses in town centres. As part of their planning approaches to town centres, we urge local authorities to consider the need to provide different premises. Perhaps they need to provide smaller units, for example, to enable smaller businesses to get going. There must be diversity of provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/6">At the beginning of his speech, the hon. Member for Lichfield said that the quality of life depends very much on the quality of our communities and our market towns, and that that is a measure of the wealth of the community. He is right, but I am sure that he would agree that if we do not have enough homes for people or if people cannot afford to buy houses, it says bad things about the wealth of our communities and the nation. When talking about the need for housing development and its nature, whether in market towns or cities, we must be clear about the wider backdrop of housing need to which we must respond.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/7">Over the past 30 years, there has been a 30 per cent. increase in the number of households, but a 50 per cent. drop in the level of new homes being built. As for household growth, about 190,000 new households are formed a year as a result of our ageing, growing population with more people living alone, but only about 150,000 new homes are being built. That gap is unsustainable. It is hardly surprising that, faced with that gap, our long-term house prices have risen considerably faster than those in other European countries to the point at which, even though we have 1 million more home owners since 1997 as a result of low mortgage rates, economic stability and prosperity, we have rising house prices that cause particular pressures for first-time buyers. Those pressures are unsustainable.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/8">We must respond to such pressures over the long term, too. If we carry on building at the current rate over the next 20 years, research shows that the proportion of two-earner, 30-year-old couples able to afford their own home will fall from more than 50 per cent. as it is today to nearer one third. That is unsustainable. We cannot have a society in which two thirds of 30-year-old, two-earner couples cannot afford to buy their own home on the basis of their earnings. I accept that some of them will still be able to afford their own home because they will receive gifts or inheritances from parents or grandparents, but it is not fair that people's chance of affording their own home is dependent on whether their parents or their grandparents were home owners. It is so important to build more new homes for the sake of first-time buyers in the future and for the sake of being able to deal with pressures such as overcrowding, homelessness and the problems of those on low incomes. We must accept as our starting point the need to build more new homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/9">Where and how do we develop new homes and provide the housing that the nation undeniably needs? The Conservatives face a challenge. I recognise <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">the point made by the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase> when he said that perhaps we should be developing new towns instead of high-density developments in cities or existing towns. That was an honest recognition of the fact that there are trade-offs. It is unacceptable for people simply to say, &quot;Yes, we need more new homes, but let us tell you all the places where you cannot build them and all the places where new housing is acceptable&quot;, and not to say, &quot;Okay, so where should the new homes go?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/10">The hon. Member for Lichfield said that worries had been expressed about high-density development. There is a lot of high-density, high-quality developments. Let us consider the Georgian terraces in Bath: they are beautiful, extremely high-density developments&mdash;much higher than the density levels that are set out in planning guidance. Should we not have flexibility in the density to which we build? Should we not respect the different character of market towns and city locations? That is why PPS3 introduces much more clarity and flexibility in the guidance on housing density.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.132.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" speakername="Alistair Burt" colnum="132"  time="015:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h03.htm#60301h03_spnew28">
	<p pid="b.132.0/1">The Minister offered us a challenge, so I must toss one back. If terraces are so good, why have so many been knocked down in the north of England as a result of the pathfinder project rather, than being maintained and refurbished?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.132.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" speakername="Yvette Cooper" colnum="132"  time="015:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h03.htm#60301h03_spnew29">
	<p pid="b.132.1/1">As the hon. Gentleman will know, a huge number of Victorian terraces in our pathfinder areas throughout the north of England are being refurbished as a result of the pathfinder scheme. In fact, far more are being refurbished than are being demolished. In some areas, the quality of the housing and local demands or problems have meant that a variety of housing is needed. We must recognise that there is a wide variety of housing needs. We must respond to the local character of the places, and provide sensitive and sustainable housing. It is right that we have increased the proportion of houses being built on brownfield land.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.1/2">Finally, I come to the planning gain supplement. I hope that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase> will find himself contradicted by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1711" name="Caroline Spelman">the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman)</phrase> because the supplement will provide a good opportunity for us to raise the money that we desperately need for infrastructure. We cannot build new homes without the necessary infrastructure for local communities. We must accept that that is an important factor for the future. The issue is not simply where new homes should be built.</p>

	<p pid="b.133.1/1">I am pleased to be under your chairmanship, Mr. Chope, for this debate on an issue that is extremely important in my constituency. I am also grateful to Mr. Speaker for allowing the debate, and I hope that he recovers quickly and is back in the House as soon as possible. I thank the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" name="Caroline Flint">the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>, for attending, and I hope that she will be able to address the issues that I raise.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/2">I note that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> is here; he has concerns about health care in north Northamptonshire, too. He and I have been raising local health care issues since we entered Parliament last May. In Wellingborough, health care has become the No. 1 issue to local people, as identified by my &quot;listening to Wellingborough and Rushden&quot; campaign. I note today that my excellent local newspaper, the <i>Evening Telegraph</i>, has a story about the health service with the headline &quot;Crisis Point&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/3">Back in the autumn of 2005, my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering and I wrote to the Secretary of State for Health requesting a meeting so that local health care problems could be discussed. I do not request meetings with Ministers lightly; in fact, it is only the second such request that I have made. I was eventually given an appointment with the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" name="Rosie Winterton">the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton)</phrase>, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December 2005</phrase>. However, a few days before, the meeting was cancelled with no explanation. After hearing nothing from her regarding an alternative date, I contacted the Department of Health to say that my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering and I still desperately needed a meeting with the Minister. I was given an appointment for today, <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-01">1 March</phrase>, which was in three months' time, but&mdash;lo and behold&mdash;a few a days ago that meeting was cancelled, too. I heard on Monday that it has been rescheduled for <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-19">19 April</phrase>. Trying to get an appointment with the Minister is like trying to get an operation in a NHS hospital: one is never quite sure when it will be, and there is always a strong chance that it will be cancelled at the last minute.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/4">My constituents, the people of Wellingborough, have been misled. The Government promised them something that they did not deliver. Last year, they promised that no one would wait more than six months for a NHS in-patient operation. Well, the Government misled the House. One of my constituents, whose operation was cancelled recently, has been forced to wait well over six months. I have a statement from Northamptonshire Heartlands primary care trust, saying that it cannot meet the Government guarantee. I also have a written answer to a parliamentary question, which I received two weeks ago. It confirms that scores of patients are waiting more than six months for an NHS in-patient operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/5">We are only two months into 2006, and the Government have not kept their promise. Let me make it clear that the Government could never have kept it: the six-month guarantee was never feasible without massive extra resources for certain primary care trusts and hospital trusts. It is not that the guarantee went wrong; it was never possible to meet it. The guarantee has more to do with spin doctors than real doctors. The reason why the Government have not kept their promise to my constituents is lack of funding, pure and simple. For far too long, the Government have underfunded my local hospital&mdash;Kettering general hospital&mdash;as well as the Northamptonshire Heartlands primary care trust. Health care in general in my constituency is underfunded compared to other parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/6">I pay enormous tribute to the doctors, nurses and staff of Kettering general hospital; they do a superb job treating patients in difficult circumstances. I praise them for their excellent work. They often carry out additional work, for which they are not paid, to ensure that patients do not suffer. If it was not for them, local health care in my constituency would collapse.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/7">The Government cannot claim that Kettering general hospital is inefficient and wastes money. The Government have a national formula for funding hospitals, allegedly so that there is no inequality for funding across the country, yet the funding is only 85 per cent. of what Kettering general hospital should get. It has a hospital budget of &pound;119 million, which means a shortfall of &pound;21 million. Because of that, it has one of the    lowest nurse-to-patient ratios, yet under the Department of Health's standards, it comes in the top quartile for efficiency. It is a well run hospital, and I pay tribute to its professional managers and administrators for achieving what they do, but they are being asked to do it with &pound;21 million being held back&mdash;&pound;21 million that, by the Government's own standards, the hospital should have.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/8">At the end of January 2006, Northamptonshire Heartlands primary care trust, which covers my constituency and Kettering general hospital's catchment area, announced that it was cutting &pound;720,000&mdash;nearly three quarters of &pound;1 million&mdash;from the planned budget of Kettering general hospital. As a result, Kettering said that it would have to cancel or postpone more than 2,800 out-patient appointments, 200 ear, nose and throat operations and 370 gynaecology operations. In addition, the hospital has had to close one gynaecology ward and theatre, reduce the number of beds on another ward, and redeploy doctors and nurses to work in others areas of the hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/9">Transferring gynaecology nurses to other wards, in areas in which they are not trained, can only be to the detriments of patients' health. What a totally unacceptable situation. We have the doctors, nurses and staff, the wards and operating theatres, and patients in desperate need of an operation, yet operations cannot be carried because the accountants will not allow it. All that does is to push the problem into the next financial year and the whole sorry cycle of events starts again&mdash;Ministers, civil servants and accountants deciding when people in my constituency who are in pain and in need of an operation can have an operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/10">Let us examine what the Government's promise to the people of this country was. Last November, the Prime Minister stated in Prime Minister's questions that, from the end of that month, for patients awaiting an NHS in-patient operation</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/11" class="indent">&quot;there will be a six-month maximum wait&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 30 November 2005; Vol. 440, c. 264.]</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/12">That was a guarantee to sick people that they would not have to wait more than six months. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December 2005</phrase>, I pointed out in the House that 437 people in my constituency were waiting more than six months, as recorded in column 401 of the <i>Official Report</i>. In fact, only five hospitals out of 205 in the whole country had more people waiting longer than six months for an NHS operation than Kettering general hospital did.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/13">I wrote to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State on that point and was advised that the maximum six-month wait for operations was to come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-31">31 December 2005</phrase>, not on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-30">30 November 2005</phrase>&mdash;a change in policy in fewer than 24 hours. The Secretary of State also wrote to me in a letter of <phrase class="date" code="">7 December</phrase> that</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/14" class="indent">&quot;by the end of 2005, the maximum waiting time for a first outpatient appointment with a consultant will fall to 13 weeks and the maximum waiting time for in-patient treatment will fall to six months.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/15">In a parliamentary answer to me given on 14 February 2006, the Minister for Health said:</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/16" class="indent">&quot;At the end of December 2005, there were no patients waiting for six months for in-patient treatment at the Kettering general hospital NHS trust.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-14">14 February 2006</phrase>; Vol. 442, c. 2022W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/17">However, on the very same day I received another parliamentary answer, from the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase>, who stated that scores of patients were waiting longer than six months for in-patient admission at the end of December 2005. The answer also referred me to the Department's website, for detailed figures by hospital trust. They showed that some patients were waiting more than 12 months for their operation. So much for the Prime Minister's six-month guarantee.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/18">I was amazed that, out of the numbers of patients mentioned in the parliamentary answer, Kettering general hospital NHS trust was shown as having none waiting more than six months. I know that at least one patient has been waiting more than six months, so how many more have been waiting more than six months but not been disclosed? Getting an accurate figure from the Department is almost like pulling teeth.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/19">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-14">14 July 2005</phrase>, my constituent, Mrs. Michelle Baddock, received a letter from the hospital informing her of her in-patient operation, which was to take place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February 2006</phrase>, which by my calculations is more than six months. So how on earth can I receive a parliamentary answer stating that there were no patients at Kettering general hospital waiting more than six months for an operation when I have that example?</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/20">Of course, that is not the worst of it. Mrs. Baddock was admitted to hospital on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February 2006</phrase>; but, after her pre-op, after being marked up for surgery and after being told to gown up to be ready to go down to theatre at 1 pm, she was told at 5 pm that the doctors would not be operating. Instead of pushing the operation back to the next day, which one might think would be the sensible thing, considering she that was completely ready for the operation, she was sent home. Having taken up Mrs. Baddock's case, I discover that her operation was scheduled for this week, some eight months after she was originally told that she needed the operation. I have here an unreserved apology from Kettering general hospital NHS trust to Mrs. Baddock.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/21">In the same parliamentary answer that I received from the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree, she stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/22" class="indent">&quot;No trusts have indicated they will not be able to meet the maximum wait standard.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/23">That is good news, but in the very next paragraph she says that</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/24" class="indent">&quot;48 patients were waiting longer than six months.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-14">14 February 2006</phrase>; Vol. 442, c. 2030W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/25">We cannot have the Prime Minster and the Secretary of State giving us an assurance of a guaranteed maximum waiting time and then telling us that they are meeting that guarantee, only to find that the facts are massively inconsistent with their claims. We then have two parliamentary answers totally contradicting one another on the same day and we have a Department's website giving the wrong facts.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/26">I wrote to the Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-15">15 February</phrase> urging her to come to the House to make a statement correcting the misleading impression that had been given. Would you believe it, Mr. Chope, the Department rang my office yesterday and stated that, owing to an administrative error, it had lost my letter? The Government obviously have something to hide. I am unable to get a meeting with the Minister, the Department loses my letter&mdash;why do the Government not just come clean?</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/27">One of the many problems with the Government's guarantee of a maximum six-month wait is that many people are having to wait longer. Patients who may have had to wait a few weeks are having their operations pushed back to five and a half months to try to squeeze everyone in. That sounds all right, but let me highlight what it means in practical terms.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/28">In the autumn of 2005 my constituent, Miss Michelle Major, was told that she needed a hysterectomy. Several doctors recommended that she should have a hysterectomy, owing to the constant pain and other symptoms she had been suffering. On three occasions, the pain and bleeding had become so bad that she had been rushed to the hospital's A and E unit. Each time that happened she was sent away without seeing a consultant and just given a prescription for painkillers. Why is Miss Major unable to have the operation that she so desperately needs? Once again, the reason is funding. Kettering general hospital has the doctors and staff to perform the operation, but it has had to close one of its gynaecology wards. Miss Major was originally given an operation date of <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-08">8 March</phrase>, but that was cancelled. As of yesterday, she had not been notified of when she will have an operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/29">That is the crux of the problem with the Government's six-month waiting guarantee. More people are having to wait longer than they would have done for serious operations such as Miss Major's. I want a fairer share of Government funding to go to the Northamptonshire Heartlands primary care trust. I also want an emergency funding package for Kettering general hospital, so that it can carry out the operations needed and not have to close wards or transfer staff to areas in which they are not trained.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/30">The Government may quote their rhetoric time and time again, but the rhetoric has got the people in my constituency nowhere. I am fed up with Government spin. I want guarantees and action. Can the Minister guarantee patient and staff safety by transferring gynaecology nurses to work in other wards? Does she not agree that it is ludicrous for wards at Kettering general hospital to be closed when waiting lists are growing? Does she not agree that it is absurd to deny patients operations for financial reasons rather than clinical ones?</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/31">If a patient's operation is postponed or cancelled, their condition is likely to get worse, therefore requiring more treatment. Have the Government not learned that by pushing problems into the next financial year, those problems do not go away? They grow and grow. I want the Government to admit that they have failed to deliver on their promise of a six-month waiting guarantee, and I want them to apologise for misleading those of my constituents, and the other people throughout the country, who have had to wait more than six months for an operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/32">From the facts that I have given today, it is clear that we are in desperate need of a community hospital in Wellingborough. Kettering general hospital is already full to capacity, and yet Northamptonshire's population is growing ever larger as it has been decreed one of the Deputy Prime Minister's areas for major growth. Over the next few years, 167,000 extra homes will be built in Northamptonshire, yet our local hospital cannot cope with the current levels of demand. We desperately need local facilities in Wellingborough; that would reduce the burden on Kettering general hospital and provide a service to local people. I hope that the Minister can give my constituents some hope in respect of this matter.</p>

	<p pid="b.137.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase> on securing this debate on such an important topic, and I thank the Minister for allowing me to say a few words in support of my parliamentary colleague.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.0/2">I, too, wish to thank all the hard-working medical, administrative and ancillary staff at Kettering general hospital, and those who are involved in all the other NHS functions in our local area. Of course, our local GPs and dentists are also feeling the strain of the lack of NHS funding from central Government. In my constituency, all the local GP lists are closed. Local people are not able to go to the GP of their choice; they have to be allocated to them by the local health authority. So far as dentistry in the Kettering constituency is concerned, 7,000 local people have been thrown off NHS dental lists over the past three years and now have to go private, and I suspect that many thousands more will go down the same route as a result of the new dental contracts that are now being introduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.0/3">Finally, I wish to emphasise the point about the growth in population in Kettering and Wellingborough. Under the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister house building expansion plans, the population of the local area is likely to increase by at least a third in the next 15 years. Therefore, we will need a third more dentists, a third more GPs, a third more nurses, a third more doctors, a third more spaces to park the car at Kettering general hospital, and so the list goes on. But the point is that we do not have enough of those resources now; we do not currently have enough personnel of that kind. Unless the Government realise the seriousness of this issue, local people will find that the local NHS in Kettering and Wellingborough simply will not deliver the world-class service that we have all come to expect, and that we all pay for.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.138.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="138"  time="016:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h04.htm#60301h04_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.138.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase> on securing this Adjournment debate, and I welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the presence of the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/2">Let me begin by saying something about the recent debate about health inequalities. I took a great number of interventions in my opening speech, and in closing I was left with less time than my Opposition counterpart. Although I was aware that the hon. Member for Wellingborough was present for the debate, my perception was that he was not present for all of it. When I did not take his intervention during the small amount of time I had for my closing speech, I made that point, and I think he was rather offended. I apologise for any offence caused, but I was present for the entire three hours, and it was my perception that the hon. Gentleman was not there for all that time. I hope that that has cleared that matter up to everybody's satisfaction.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/3">Both of the hon. Gentlemen make important points, but what they leave out of their analysis of this situation is a frank discussion of the state of play in relation to waiting times and resourcing for the NHS prior&mdash;I am sorry to say&mdash;to my Government being elected in 1997. I am sure that the hon. Gentlemen will shrug their shoulders and say, &quot;Well, what's that got to do with where we are today?&quot; I think that the facts speak for themselves and I shall go into detail about that. For instance, we can compare the number of people who were waiting in those days, with those waiting today, or the number of doctors and nurses we have today, compared with the situation before 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/4">Of course, the NHS stands still for no one. People's expectations have changed as new drugs and technologies are used and become more commonplace, even during my lifetime. I can remember when hip operations were seen as a novel idea. It is fair to say that, although it is not commonplace for people to have such operations, it is now a pretty commonplace procedure. That is an important context in which to place these issues. It is undoubtedly the case that the Government are responsible for record levels of investment. The amount of money spent on the NHS has risen to about &pound;60 billion from &pound;34 billion in 1997, and it will go up to more than &pound;90 billion in 2008. That represents a decade of significant investment in the NHS and a period of record investment in health services for the people of England, which applies to both hospital services and the development of services outside of hospital, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/5">It is not just a question of putting money in; the process has to be accompanied by reform to ensure that we deliver a more efficient health service. During my time in this job during the past eight months, I have been surprised and worried in different respects by visits to certain hospitals and primary care trusts during which I have seen how money is spent very well in some places, delivering better services for better value, but in some places&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;they could do better.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/6">One of the aspects of the NHS the Government have to consider is best practice in order to see why certain places have better outcomes in their hospitals or in the community when compared with others. There are clear issues to discuss concerning the financing of the NHS and to be fair to my Government, we have shone a light on what has been a historical legacy of a smoke-and-mirrors approach to NHS funding in the past, where creative accountancy created debts going from one financial year to another. By shining that light, we have taken a risk because we have exposed historical funding anomalies that have to be put right.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/7">We have also exposed underfunding in certain areas. This is certainly the case for the PCT area of the hon. Member for Wellingborough and, I think, for the hon. Member for Kettering. It is similar to the case of my own area in Doncaster where historically there has been underfunding compared with other areas where, when we have looked at what is necessary for the needs of the area, we have found overfunding. That is why a number of Health Secretaries have looked at how we can enable areas that have been historically underfunded to reach their target point of funding, work which has been continued by the work of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. I hope the hon. Member for Wellingborough agrees that in reaching that point we have to bring areas that have been overfunded to a level point, in order to bring the others up.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/8">We are dealing with services and people, and a big bang approach could have caused a huge number of problems. I shall go into a little more detail about that, but I am pleased to say that we are gradually moving up. The hon. Gentleman's areas have benefited during the past three years from a steady movement towards their target, and there have been increases that were larger than the national average in the spend available for PCTs to plan their services locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/9">Alongside that investment, we have seen important reform and that dynamic has to continue. We have also delivered extra staff and shorter waiting times. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that in the area that he represents, the big killer diseases caused by cardiovascular disease and cancer have been considerably dealt with and challenged. That is one of the reasons we are seeing people's overall life expectancy improving, although there are issues of health equality upon which we have to bear down even further. There has been a 47 per cent. increase in the number of consultants since 1997 and although I take on board the point made by the hon. Member for Kettering, there are now more GPs in the NHS than ever before, as is also the case for qualified nurses.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/10">For the people of Northamptonshire, it comes down to the fact that there are 100 more GPs, more than 280 consultants, more than 1,500 more nurses and midwives and more than 1,400 more health care assistants in the Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Rutland strategic health authority area than in 1997. If there are issues in more localised areas, the PCTs must address them, as they do in my area of Doncaster, attracting and recruiting professionals to work in our local health economies.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/11">In terms of health and inequalities, one problem that was highlighted in our recent White Paper, was that our poorest areas are least well served by GPs. We must look into that. I say to GPs who may be listening to this debate, &quot;Come and use your training for some of those most challenging communities that desperately need your expertise, professionalism and support. In those areas, there is the biggest challenge and the most satisfaction, because you can make a real impact.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/12">The NHS plan sets out the direction of NHS reform, and we are half way through it. Local health economies will have to make some difficult decisions if we are to provide an NHS that can meet the needs of patients in the 21st century. I am sure that that the PCTs in the hon. Gentlemen's areas take that to heart, and that that is why they are considering the issues of operations and services.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/13">Again, there is a judgment to make. We have always said that in all finance decisions, clinical issues and priorities must be taken into account. That should be set against the services that people were getting in those areas 10 and 20 years ago. They have been substantially improved. It is a sign of our success that people do not remember the long, one or two-year waits for treatment that they used to have, because, let us face it, why worry about what happened five years ago? They are concerned about what is happening today.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/14">The waiting list issue was raised by the hon. Member for Wellingborough, and I shall ensure that my right hon. Friend sees his contribution about the cancellation of appointments. I assure him that there was no conspiracy. There was certainly a&mdash;I do not want to use an un-parliamentary expression&mdash;but there was no conspiracy. The hon. Gentleman acknowledged that his constituent Mrs. Baddock has received an apology. I understand also that on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-27">27 February</phrase>, she received her operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/15">I have looked into the case, because it is a constituent concern, and to be honest, in an open way and in good faith, it was an administrative error that was caused locally. I do not want to get into a blame game about that, but several issues did not serve Mrs. Baddock well. There was no manipulation of waiting times, and there was no local or national conspiracy to try to hide situations in which people had said that six-month waiting times were being met when they were not. The trust has confirmed that it was an isolated case and that it continues to meet the national waiting time targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/16">We are addressing issues about those targets. The six-month target came into effect at the end of December. Before that, it was a nine-month target, so on <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase> or <phrase class="date" code="">14 December</phrase>, there were people who had been waiting six months, but that was based on the old nine-month target. Therefore, the two answers to the parliamentary questions to which the hon. Gentleman referred were both right in their own sense. One referred to how many people were waiting more than six months before we reached <phrase class="date" code="">31 December</phrase>, and the other answered the question about the situation on <phrase class="date" code="">31 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/17">There are some issues about the way in which the figures are collected, but counting the number of waiters at the end of a period is the method that the Department of Health has used to measure waiting times for more than 20 years. The reason why we continue with that is to be consistent.</p>

	FIRE SAFETY
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.142.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" speakername="Celia Barlow" colnum="142"  time="016:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h05.htm#60301h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.142.1/1">Two years ago, a terrible fire shattered the local community of Crowborough in East Sussex, just outside my constituency. Mr. and Mrs. Kent had their two sons, Alex and Philip, staying for the night. Alex was an off-duty fire officer. At about 2.30 in the morning, the East Sussex fire and rescue service received a call from the property. Alex Kent had woken up and discovered a fire in the lounge. This had triggered the smoke detector, and he had shouted to the others to escape. His parents hurried out, but there was no sign of Philip. Alex went upstairs to find him. They were never seen again. Both sons died in the fire. Mr. and Mrs. Kent lost their only two children and almost everything that reminded them of their lives. The couple eventually moved back into the house a year after the fire. Now a sprinkler system will ensure that such a tragedy never happens in that house again.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/2">Adrian Brown of the East Sussex fire service, who managed the rescue attempt on that fatal night, is here as a visitor today. He told me about this sorry event. This drastic example shows how a house fire can devastate a family. It also shows that, despite all the security precautions, despite a smoke alarm, and even despite an experienced emergency worker staying in the house, terrible loss of life and injuries and massive property damage cannot be prevented.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/3">This is not an isolated example. In the UK, two people are killed and 50 are injured in fires every day. Three out of four fires occur in private homes. Most of the people dying are young children, old people, disabled people and people under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/4">The family in Crowborough relied on the old saying that there is nothing as safe as houses. Today, I want to call for people to be safe in their houses as well&mdash;safe from a terrible fire death, from injury through smoke and burns and from severe property damage and loss of every precious little thing that matters to them. That is why in the first part of my speech I shall focus on fire sprinkler systems in domestic dwellings: private properties, care homes, houses in multiple occupation, and high-rise buildings. I am aware that fire sprinklers in schools is a contentious issue. Therefore, I shall add some thoughts on that at the end of my speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/5">I call on the Government to use the current rethink of building regulations to consider the wider use of fire sprinklers in all new residential buildings in England and Wales. At the very least, it is high time to fit fire sprinkler systems in all newly built care homes for the elderly, for children and for the disabled. This must also apply to all care homes that are being refurbished. We must ensure that sprinklers are installed in all new high-rise buildings.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/6">HMOs pose a particular problem. They tend to house a higher proportion of vulnerable people. Nationally, only about 5 per cent. of people live in HMOs, although Brighton and Hove, with 14,000, has a much higher percentage. Multi-occupancy properties account for more than one third of all fire deaths. Many of those living in HMOs are on a low income and are people who cannot be reached by the Government's fire safety messages.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/7">In an Adjournment debate on HMOs in 2000, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1856" name="Chris Mullin">the then Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin)</phrase>, acknowledged the considerably higher risk of dying in a fire in HMOs. He stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/8" class="indent">&quot;I am aware of the growing body of support for the provision of residential sprinklers in houses in multiple occupation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/9">He went on to say that</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/10" class="indent">&quot;where the risk is justified . . . sprinklers may well be appropriate.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-08">8 November 2000</phrase>; Vol. 356, c. 173WH.]</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/11">I am not saying that sprinklers will guarantee that tragedies such as Crowborough never happen again. However, there is now a growing body of research and practical examples that shows that they would make a decisive contribution to the safety of our people.</p>

	<p pid="b.143.0/1">I agree with my hon. Friend about the need to install sprinkler systems in HMOs. Does she agree that, if implemented, the effect would be as radical and as effective as the measures introduced after the 1979 Woolworths fire in Manchester? Fire safety regulations were overhauled for public places and workplaces.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.143.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" speakername="Celia Barlow" colnum="143"  time="016:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h05.htm#60301h05_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.143.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. The Woolworths fire was a tragedy, and it is a great pity that there were not fire sprinklers at that time. I agree that the Government have made advances in fire safety&mdash;there is no doubt about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/2">I called for this debate because Brighton and Hove city council recently passed a motion to encourage developers to install sprinkler systems in all new buildings. It also asked the three Members of Parliament for Brighton and Hove to lobby the Government to include the installation of residential sprinkler systems as part of the revision to building regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/3">The motion had the unanimous support of the entire city council. That support reflects the unanimity that can be found among experts when it comes to fire sprinklers. The chief executives of the fire services, the fire fighters' unions and the Association of British Insurers are all in agreement that fire sprinklers are beneficial and should be used on a much greater scale.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/4">The motion followed a long-standing campaign by East Sussex fire and rescue service calling for all newly built domestic dwellings and major refurbishment schemes in similar houses, including HMOs and schools, to be fitted with an appropriate sprinkler system. I recently spent a day at the headquarters of the East Sussex fire and rescue service and saw its professionalism and the excellent work done by the fire fighters day by day to keep everyone secure. They impressed on me the need for wider provision of fire sprinklers to avoid the terrible loss of lives, injuries and property damage that happens every day throughout the country. The advantages of sprinklers have been proven over many years. In short, they prevent casualties and avoid great property damage caused by fire and by water. They help to save water because they fight the fire in its early stages. Examples of sprinklers being tested and widely used have shown that they reduce the number of fire deaths considerably. According to the Fire Sprinkler Association, they reduce injuries by at least 80 per cent. and property damage by 90 per cent. They also use less water so are more environmentally friendly.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/5">In 2004, there were eight fire deaths in my region of south-east England, four of them in residential dwellings. The Government have set a target to reduce the number of accidental fire-related deaths in the home by one fifth and they are moving towards that target. The progress made has been encouraging. In the UK in 2004, the number of fire-related deaths was just 500, which is the lowest for 45 years. However, I am sure that my hon. Friend and hon. Members will agree that that is still too many. The general public often do not take fire seriously; it is something that happens to other people. However, fires happen as often as burglaries. We spend millions on crime prevention, yet only &pound;5 million on information about fire safety.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/6">According to the Association of British Insurers, fire claims were at a record level in 2005, costing &pound;1.15 billion throughout the year. Domestic fire losses were &pound;358 million. Again, that was a record level. The insurance companies predict that that level is set to rise with an ageing population that is more vulnerable to smoking materials. We need to change our attitude to fire and the Government have made a great start with their consultation on building regulations last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/7">A study by the Building Research Establishment commissioned by The buildings division of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister commissioned a study by the Building Research Establishment. Its report, &quot;The effectiveness of sprinklers in residential premises&quot;, concluded:</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/8" class="indent">&quot;For the majority of scenarios experimentally studied, the addition of residential sprinkler protection proved effective in potentially reducing casualties in the room of fire origin and connected spaces.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/9">However, the project concluded that sprinklers were cost-effective only in buildings of 11 storeys or more and probably cost-effective in residential care homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/10">I welcome those propositions and urge my hon. Friend to enforce them as soon as possible. However, in my constituency the redevelopment of the King Alfred sports centre is currently going through its planning process and under the current regime, only the car park will be protected by sprinklers; the people who will live in the flats above will not be protected by sprinklers.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/11">Smoke alarms have a good track record of warning people of upcoming danger. However, for people who are infirm or disabled, the alert may not help. For example, in a care home at night with only two duty members of staff present, evacuation could take a long time and that time could run out too quickly. In reality, smoke alarms are often tampered with in HMOs as residents simply cut them off after a false alarm, thereby leaving everyone unprotected when a real fire breaks out.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/12">What is more, smoke detectors may be ineffective when they are in the wrong place. Often they go off only when smoke from the room where the fire started has reached the hallway and that is particularly so in HMOs. That happened in the case of the fire in Crowborough which I mentioned earlier. That can mean that escape routes are blocked or that people sleeping upstairs have already inhaled a toxic amount of smoke.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/13">Returning to the question of high-rise buildings, I argue that 11 storeys is too high a threshold for the installation of sprinklers. There was a terrible blaze in my constituency in 1992. Five people died in Palmeira avenue in Hove when a fire broke out during a party in a third-floor flat. The escape routes were blocked and the only way to survive was to jump from the roof and the windows. At least 12 occupants jumped or fell from the building to escape the flames. Three of them were later confirmed dead and a further two bodies were discovered inside. In addition, two people were seriously injured.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/14">That dreadful event illustrates my point that it can be lethal to jump from the third floor. I therefore ask my hon. Friend the Minister to reconsider the 11-storey threshold.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/15">In any case, smoke alarms should be complemented by sprinklers. Two good examples from north America show us how well they can protect lives and properties. The first is from Scottsdale, Arizona. In 1985, the town passed an ordinance requiring the installation of fire sprinklers in all new homes. The 15-year report states that more than half the homes in Scottsdale now have a sprinkler system installed. As people moved into older properties, they asked for sprinklers to be installed. There have been no deaths in a sprinklered home, but there have been 13 deaths in un-sprinklered homes during that period.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/16">In the Canadian city of Vancouver, a similar success has been observed. During the 1970s, the fire death rate forced city officials to act. It reached its peak in 1973, when there were approximately 40 fire deaths. The city of Vancouver passed a byelaw requiring all new residential construction in the city to be built with fire sprinklers installed. In 1998, that city of more than half a million people recorded its first year with no fire deaths.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/17">Sprinklers can be portrayed as too expensive, too ugly and prone to malfunction. I admit that their cost is an issue. However, I argue that if we change the building regulations and make it mandatory for all new homes to have sprinklers, that will become a normal part of the building process, together with the installation of pipes, electricity and the heating system, and that will drive the costs down considerably.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/18">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister could also explore opportunities to produce standard sprinklers for new homes. The British standard for sprinklers is higher than, for example, the American regulations. It is sometimes too over-engineered to be cost-effective. Research and development is also making progress. We should not forget that the normal lifetime of such a system is 50 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/19">As I said, one objection is that sprinklers can look ugly or be intrusive. However, modern sprinkler heads can be integrated into the ceiling. If the heat is too high, the head will fall off, and only when the heat grows significantly greater will a bulb break and release the water&mdash;far less water than, for example, a fire hose uses. Sprinklers operate very early in the development of a fire and consequently require only a relatively small quantity of water to extinguish it.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/20">As for malfunction, the chances of a sprinkler going off without mechanical assistance are one in 16 million. They are activated by heat rather than smoke. Sprinklers can make a significant difference. They are also effective at minimising property damage, which leads me to my second point, on the installation of sprinklers in schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/21">Happily, no child or staff member has been killed or seriously injured in a school fire in recent years, but a fire can damage a school and disrupt learning for years and can traumatise the children. According to figures released by the Zurich Municipal insurance firm, the number of large fires causing significant damage to schools increased by more than 55 per cent. in 2004; 90 per cent. of the fires were a result of arson attacks. That firm believes that those large fires would not have escalated to such damaging proportions had the schools been fitted with sprinkler systems, and it is not alone in calling for sprinklers to be made compulsory in all new or refurbished schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/22">A year ago, a school in Newhaven&mdash;near my constituency&mdash;in East Sussex was severely damaged by fire. Students lost all their coursework and the school was shut because of asbestos contamination. The children had to watch in horror when decontaminators in protective suits moved in and tried to clean their books. Their coursework had to be held up at windows to be photographed to assess their standard of reading and writing. That example shows that a school fire can be very damaging to a local community. Children lose their sense of safety and the central venue for their learning. Many schools are also used as a meeting point for the local community. Therefore, we cannot ignore the growing number of school fires and pretend that, because people are not dying, the issue is not important.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/23">I realise that this topic comes under the remit not of this Minister but of the Department for Education and Skills, but I ask my hon. Friend to press for better fire safety in our schools. He knows much more about fire protection than many others do. Could he use his knowledge to have a word with my right hon. Friend the Minister for Schools to ensure that our substantial investment in education is not diminished by school fires? In addition to the statistics that I have mentioned, there are many small school fires.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/24">I would like to draw hon. Members' attention to the early-day motion on sprinkler systems for schools that I tabled today. I am asking hon. Members for their support, as there should be nothing more precious to us than the safety of our children and the opportunity for them to learn without disruption.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/25">It is high time to consider the use of sprinklers in private properties and schools. Over time, I am convinced that they need to become compulsory in every new residential building in England and Wales. At the very least, I urge my hon. Friends to commit to the installation of sprinklers in all newly built or refurbished care homes and high-rise dwellings. I should like the Minister to have a word with the Department for Education and Skills about sprinklers in schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/26">People can lose everything that they value in a fire&mdash;every precious little photo, letter or book that they treasure&mdash;they can lose their health and, sometimes, even their life. It is time we took the danger of fire more seriously. We need sprinklers to be safe in our homes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-01b.147.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister"  colnum="147"  time="017:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/halltext/60301h05.htm#60301h05_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.147.0/1">It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Chope. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" name="Celia Barlow">my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Ms Barlow)</phrase> on securing this important debate. She is fast gaining a reputation for being a champion of fire and safety issues, for which I commend her. Clearly, her interest is a result of her own experiences as well as that of her constituents, who have told her stories like the one from Crowborough. I send my commiserations to her constituents on their tragic loss.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/2">Whether we are talking about the fire and rescue service, central Government or local government, the voluntary sector, or MPs and Ministers working on or interested in fire-related issues, we all share the same goal, which is to cut deaths and injuries from fire. That is reflected in the public service agreement target to reduce the number of accidental fire-related deaths in the home by 20 per cent. by April 2010, and achieve a 10 per cent. reduction in deliberate fires by the same date. These are ambitious targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/3">We have been criticised for not aiming for zero deaths, but that is obviously unrealistic. The latest figures published only yesterday are encouraging. In the year ending June 2005, accidental fire deaths in the home in England were down 21 per cent. to 219 and injuries were down by 4 per cent. The only way we can continue achieving this kind of reduction and continue this downward trend in the long term is through prevention. We have a world-class emergency fire and rescue service&mdash;probably the best in the world&mdash;and we must maintain it. But however good it is, it can do no more than respond. More than half of all fire fatalities occur before the fire and rescue services are even called out.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/4">Prevention must be, and is, the new culture, and that means helping the most vulnerable people in our society as a priority. We have made a great deal of progress, but statistics continue to show that a third of all fire deaths are people aged 65 and over, with the highest rate of all among those aged 80 and over. The demographics are working against us. We have an ageing population. By next year there will be more over 65-year olds than under-16s. We must do all that we can to protect the most vulnerable groups, including older people and the very young. The good news is that we are making significant progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/5">The &pound;25 million initiative from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to provide smoke alarms and fire safety advice to 1.25 million vulnerable households was launched nearly two years ago. So far, more than 416,000 home fire risk checks have been carried out and more than 451,000 smoke alarms have been installed. Older people have been one of the main target groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/6">On behalf of the ODPM, I recently announced &pound;11.4 million grant funding for fire and rescue authorities in England to cover the period April 2006 to March 2008 and it is to support fire prevention work, including community fire safety, arson reduction and work with children and young people. The single grant to all fire and rescue authorities replaces the grants paid to some authorities under the community fire safety innovation fund, as well as the arson control forum implementation fund up to 2006. The single grant provides revenue funding to complement the capital grants paid to all fire and rescue authorities under the home fire risk check initiative up to 2008. This substantial investment will support fire and rescue authorities, working with local partners, to continue reducing the number of accidental fire deaths in the home and the number of deliberate fires in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/7">Statistics clearly show that vulnerable groups, deprived households and certain communities are at far greater risk of fire and suffer a greater impact from its effects. We will use the funding to narrow that inequality gap. In that way, the additional funding will also support the Government's wider neighbourhood renewal plans and dovetail with the Government's respect action plan agenda and antisocial behaviour plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/8">The main theme of this debate is sprinklers. Sprinklers have an important role to play, particularly where their provision is targeted at buildings where the occupants are most at risk from fire. However, they are not a panacea, and it is important that they form part of a package of measures, both active&mdash;such as smoke detectors&mdash;and passive, such as fire doors, fire-resistant construction and compartmentation, the efficacy of which has been proved over many years, along with effective building management.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/9">My hon. Friend referred to the success story with sprinklers of Scottsdale, Arizona, and asked why we do not copy its example. We follow its experience very closely; indeed, I should own up to having gone on holiday there in 2001, which shows how sad I am, but I wanted to see things for myself, and, as it turns out, Scottsdale is a beautiful part of the United States. If anybody wants a decent holiday in the desert, I can warmly recommend it, and they can benefit from some professional advice as well. Data from the United States show that about 0.3 per cent. of its residential premises currently have sprinklers. I will be happy to continue discussing Scottsdale after the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/10">I fully agree with my hon. Friend that the experiences of other countries can provide us with a valuable insight into the implementation and effect of residential sprinkler policies. But it is not a simple task to translate experience from other countries with different built environments from ours. That is why in April 2001 we commissioned an extensive research project with the Building Research Establishment to consider fully the effectiveness of residential sprinklers.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/11">The research suggests that targeting the provision of sprinklers to particular types of building, typically those where the occupants are considered to be the most vulnerable to fire, would be the most effective and economically robust way forward. In the light of research findings, we have consulted on whether sprinklers should be provided in tall blocks of flats&mdash;those over 30m high&mdash;and in residential care homes. That is part of the current review of part B of schedule 1 of the Building Regulations 2000 and the guidance in approved document B. I hear what my hon. Friend says about her own views on this, and I can say that we are looking at the responses and hope to publish a revised version of part B and the supporting guidance in approved document B towards the end of the year. The aim is for that to come into force in April 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/12">We have also looked at the potential role of so-called &quot;lower-cost&quot; sprinklers for domestic dwellings. The findings of our research on their potential role in domestic dwellings&mdash;which we funded at Little Rissington in the Cotswolds&mdash;are very encouraging, but more work needs to be done. For example, there is a need to conduct more research to determine the robustness of the present design of the lower-cost sprinkler system in a real housing environment. The research also recommends that further supporting work be carried out to resolve a number of issues. Those include the possibility of a pilot scheme to see how the sprinklers would work in practice and to determine actual installation costs and so forth, so that we can take this forward on a fully informed and strong evidential basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/13">We hope to make funds available from existing funding streams in 2006&ndash;07 to support a small pathfinder programme for installing lower-cost sprinkler systems in new social housing projects. That is under active consideration in several local authorities with several registered social landlords. That would enable us to gather cost data and also to monitor the efficacy of such systems in a real environment. Such a programme would also give potential installers the opportunity to resolve any practical problems and issues, which, in turn, would help us to develop a design and installation standard for lower-cost sprinklers. However, realistically, it will take several years before we have any meaningful results from any pilot scheme and the other further work that is required. It would therefore be premature to commit to any specific course of action, particularly in respect of whether it might become a regulatory requirement.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/14">The capital funding set aside for the home fire risk checks is what the Government like to call non-ring-fenced. In effect, that means that it is open to fire and rescue authorities to use some of the money, if they think fit, to install sprinklers in domestic dwellings. We have evidence from fire authorities across the country who are doing just that, particularly in the sorts of care establishments described by hon. Friend. However, that is a decision for the local fire and rescue service, and it must be based on an assessment of local risks and on local strategies for improving prevention. It is certainly an important option to consider, and we are promoting it within fire and rescue services.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/15">My hon. Friend suggested that one option for progress would be to fit sprinklers as a requirement of building regulations, but that is not necessarily the best way forward in the short to medium term. If lower-cost sprinklers were fitted in all dwellings subject to building regulations, it would affect only new and materially altered properties. In other words, the impact would be restricted to less than 1 per cent. of the building stock each year. Evidence shows that the majority of fire deaths occur in existing buildings. As I said earlier, they are often influenced by socio-economic factors, so although lower-cost sprinkler systems would prevent some fire deaths, the number might be fairly limited.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/16">There have also been calls for the retrospective fitting of sprinkler systems in existing social housing by the beginning of 2007. That could be extremely costly and we believe that registered social landlords would argue for additional funding. RSLs are already carrying out improvements to meet the decent homes standard. The housing health and safety rating system will be introduced in April, and all RSLs and local authorities will have to consider whether their stock is free of serious hazards, including fire hazards.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/17">My hon. Friend correctly said that sprinklers have a wider potential role than purely one of protecting domestic dwellings. Their possible role in schools and educational establishments is being considered by the Department for Education and Skills as part of its consultation on the draft fire safety guidance for schools, known as building bulletin 100, or BB100. It is one of a series of building bulletins that provide design guidance on various aspects of school buildings and facilities. BB100 is about designing fire safety at schools. The document highlights the value of a risk assessment approach to determining whether sprinklers should be installed in school buildings. It also deals with fire engineering solutions. I gather that the DFES hopes to publish a final version of BB100 later this year. We have liaised closely with the Department on its development, and will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/18">We believe that sprinklers have a major contribution to make in preventing fire deaths and injuries, but there is clearly more work to do before we can be certain about the best way forward for their use in different places and circumstances. We are determined to go on doing whatever is needed to improve prevention and help the most vulnerable people in our society to live safer lives, free from the fear and tragedy that fire can cause.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/19">In conclusion, I thank my hon. Friend for raising this important issue for debate. She can safely report back to Brighton and Hove council that she has lobbied us on this particular subject. It is only through social, business and political pressure that we can make real progress in campaigning for the level of safety that we want for all our citizens. All our officials in the fire and rescue service directorate and, I am sure, all those in the fire and rescue services, thank her for her support and attention.</p>
