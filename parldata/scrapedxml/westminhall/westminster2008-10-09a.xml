	<p pid="a.147.2/1">It is a great pleasure to be able to appear<i>&mdash;</i><i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I see that the Minister has arrived in the nick of time, as ever&mdash;seven strong men dug him out of his fox hole. He said, &quot;No, no, I don't want to see Barry Sheerman.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/2">It is a pleasure to be back in Westminster Hall to discuss a major report from our Select Committee on Children, Schools and Families. As many people with an interest in the education system know, when we formed the new Committee, we were determined to get the right balance between the work on schools and the new challenge of having responsibility for children and families. We decided that on the schools side, we would consider the three major planks of educational reform, which most people believe date back to 1988 and the time when Lord Baker was Secretary of State. Of course, those reforms were about testing and assessment&mdash;knowing how students were performing&mdash;and the national curriculum and inspection. There is no doubt that in 1997, the incoming Labour Government carried on with those three major ways of trying to improve standards in schools. Our responsibility seemed clear: 20 years after those reforms were embarked on, we needed to assess whether they had been effective and were still fit for purpose or whether they needed modification. That is what the Committee is about in relation to schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/3">In terms of children and families, we embarked on a major inquiry into looked-after children&mdash;children in care. We are well on the way with that inquiry and the balance has been struck in a pretty fair way. In fact, I have just come from a wonderful lunch time meeting with a dozen young people who had been in care. We do not believe that an inquiry into children in care can be carried out without actually talking to some of those children and we have just come from an excellent meeting with them. That is by way of explaining why, at the moment, I am the only member of the Committee here. I suspect my colleagues will be joining me shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/4">I would like to discuss testing and assessment in terms of the following framework. Only yesterday, I was talking to the Institute of Education about a new publication called &quot;Educational Management Administration and Leadership: the legacy of the Educational Reform Act 1988&quot;, which is an excellent collection of essays that evaluates the progress we have made in the past 20 years. Yesterday, I was at the Institute of Education with the authors of that publication and a large audience. I argued that I thought on the whole the publication was a bit too pessimistic about how much change there had been and how much difference the reforms had made. The thesis in the book is basically that the reforms that were introduced depended largely on a kind of market economy view of providing education.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/5">I want to remind the House and this Chamber that when one considers the biographies of our great Secretaries of State for Education&mdash;and there have been quite a few of them&mdash;it is sad that, on average, they only stay as Secretary of State for about 20 months. One wonders how they ever achieved anything&mdash;let alone greatness. Indeed, yet again, in the Department for Children, Schools and Families a couple of people have moved on just as they were becoming interesting and fantastically knowledgeable about education. They went off to the Department for Transport or somewhere else. There is something wrong with our ministerial system when good men and women just learn the ropes and are then moved on. That is not good for education and if that happened with a school&mdash;if we walked into a school in which the top management kept changing and the middle management churned&mdash;it would be in special measures. However, that is what has happened in the former Department for Education and Skills and in the Department for Children Schools and Families. Something is going sincerely wrong under all parties when such ministerial churn takes place.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/6">That happens with the civil servants, too&mdash;they just begin to understand &quot;building schools for the future&quot; or testing and assessment, and they have gone. I am making a serious point: there is something seriously wrong with a democratic system that ends up being more about what the Whips want and what individuals want for their career advancement than what the citizens of this country need from a Department dealing with education, or any other Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/7">When I spoke about testing and assessment at the lecture yesterday, I tried to put the matter in context. In 1988, when a Secretary of State&mdash;or senior politician&mdash;was offered responsibility for education, they often said, &quot;No. It is a hopeless little department with no power and a small budget.&quot; These days, that is the sort of thing that people say about the Department for Culture, Media and Sport&mdash;I should not really say that, but I have heard it said. Pre-1988, people thought that the Department dealing with education was small and had a small budget and asked, &quot;If you are ambitious, why would you go to education?&quot; However, Ken Baker and the educational reforms of the past 20 years have made a real difference to that perception. Before 1988, education was largely run by local authorities and since then, during the period of reform, an England-wide, centralised education system has been delivered by franchise directly to schools. Local education authorities have been by-passed whenever doing so would be useful. That model is quite useful for understanding the change that has taken place during the past 20 years. There are some strengths in that model, but there are some serious weaknesses. That is the backdrop I want to give the House to our report on testing and assessment. That is the setting: a heavy reliance on three kinds of tools.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/8">This is the first report. We are half-way through our evaluation of the national curriculum and we will then consider inspection, Ofsted and so on. That has put the matter in context. The report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-07">7 May</phrase>. Ofsted submitted a response on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-25">25 June</phrase> and, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-15">15 July</phrase>, we received the Government's response. The Committee published both responses as our fifth special report, session 2007-08, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-22">22 July</phrase>. The Minister is an old friend of mine, but it is one of the most disappointing responses I have ever had to an inquiry of our Committee. Someone in the audience I was addressing yesterday mischievously said to me, &quot;Do your reports ever make any difference?&quot; In the House&mdash;when I have a better voice than this&mdash;I am known for speaking up for my Committee and boasting a little. I hope that I am not too boastful, but I do remind people that the good commonsense reports that we produced, both as the Education and Skills Select Committee and as the Children, Schools and Families Committee, have made a great difference. They have made a great difference to the succession of Ministers who have taken on board our recommendations, and there has been better policy implementation because of our reports. You and I, Mr. Williams, have been around for some time&mdash;as has the Minister&mdash;but we know that things do not happen instantaneously. Let me remind you, Mr. Williams, about the rather frenzied period spent considering variable fees, top-up fees and university funding. The report we wrote made a big difference in a short time to whether that piece of legislation was a success or failure in the House. Many people think that our report on the later White Paper on schools made a big difference and bridged the gap between the original White Paper and the legislation that flowed from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/9">There have been fast and slow results. I was amused this week when I heard the Secretary of State&mdash;if it was not him, it was the Minister&mdash;saying that where there is an instance of bullying in schools it should be noted and reported. I remember that when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1429" name="Nick Gibb">the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb)</phrase>, who is the Conservative spokesperson on schools, was a member of the Select Committee, we wrote a report on bullying. We made that recommendation on bullying at least three years ago, if not four. Now, the Secretary of State thinks that it is a good idea. That is a four-year lag and sometimes there are two-year lags, but I challenge anyone to examine the history of the Select Committee over the past seven years and not to say that it has made a substantial difference to policy. I think that Ministers have benefited from our reports and our wisdom. We have sometimes given them a good opportunity to hang a change in policy on a report from us.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/10">I shall go through some of the main points in the present report on testing and assessment. We stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/11" class="indent">&quot;National testing in England is used for a wide range of purposes&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/12">far too wide a range of purposes&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/13" class="indent">&quot;including assessment of pupil attainment, teacher and school accountability and national monitoring.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/14">That is a heavy-duty use of a system of testing. Let us compare it with the situation 20 years ago. When Ken Baker got to the Department, he did not know how children were performing in schools at all. It was very difficult for him to find out how children were progressing, so he instituted some tests in schools and found that they were not progressing nearly as well as people thought they were and not as well as local authorities and his officials were telling him. He was very disturbed by that.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/15">At about that time&mdash;I am sure that this is right&mdash;Ken Baker read one of those management books, and there was a saying in one of those books that people of my age will certainly remember, which was, &quot;If you can't measure it, you can't manage it.&quot; That was said by one of the management gurus of the time. I thought that it was in the book on one-minute management, but I checked the quote the other day and it is by another management guru. I think that Ken Baker took that idea very seriously and that Ministers have consequently always taken it very seriously, but it can be taken too far, and running through the Select Committee report is our view that it has gone far too far.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/16">The Committee received a large quantity of evidence; there is much feeling in the country about this issue. As we said in our conclusion, the evidence was that</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/17" class="indent">&quot;a single set of tests cannot validly achieve all of these purposes&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/18">and that one of the purposes&mdash;accountability&mdash;had the effect of raising the stakes of the testing system for teachers, schools and local authorities, and raising them in a dangerous way. People who gave evidence to the Committee said that people no longer wanted to be heads but wanted to stay as deputy heads because they could not bear the thought of the responsibility of being head of a school that perhaps was in an inner city or a town with high mobility of students. They could not bear the idea that they might take over a school and that following an influx of students and a decline in the achievement of the students, they would, within a year or two, given the testing system that we have, be unable to practise as a teacher or a head for the rest of their lives. Such was the fear. Whether that fear was grounded in reality is a question that the Minister will perhaps respond to, but we found a great deal of evidence that people were seriously deterred from going for senior management positions in schools because of the testing regime. That is not good.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/19">We stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/20" class="indent">&quot;national testing can be used in inappropriate ways and...this may lead to damaging consequences for the education system and, most particularly, for children.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/21">That is the heart of the issue. Anything that I say flows from that, because those consequences include teaching to the test, narrowing the curriculum, inappropriate diversion of resources in favour of pupils on the borderline and just too much national testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/22">We had witnesses after witnesses and made visit after visit. The Select Committee takes oral evidence and receives written evidence, and we go out on visits. There is nothing like the visits to bring home to us the reality on the ground. Our members, both individually and as a Committee, get out to many schools. I challenge anyone in the House to say that they have been to more schools than I have. I go to schools and other educational settings all the time. I think that I beat most Ministers in that respect. They may have a little spurt of going out on visits when they are the Minister responsible for schools, but then they move on to new things and I overtake them. I unashamedly say that I think I am the champion visitor of schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/23">When I go out on visits, I talk to heads, staff and students, and time after time the staff say that the pressure is on them to such an extent that they cannot help but teach to the test. They say that in an embarrassed way. They say, &quot;We don't want to teach to the test. If we do, it narrows the curriculum.&quot; Schools should be broadening the curriculum. They should be allowing children to wander across the curriculum, find out what they enjoy, spend more time on one part of it and so on. Of course, we want the essentials to be learned, because if people cannot read and write or add up, they do not have access to other materials. We all know that, so I hope that the Minister will not throw that one at us. The curriculum, if people take it seriously in terms of its breadth, is a very good one in many ways, but if schools teach to the test, that destroys access to the broader curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/24">I went to schools where heads said to me, &quot;We got some special money to expand access to the broader curriculum.&quot; They would then smile ruefully and say, &quot;Do you know what we spent that money on? Teaching to the test&mdash;more rehearsals.&quot; That is dreadful. I like the Minister a lot. The only time that I thought he really had his head in the sand when he was giving evidence to the Committee was when he would not accept that, up and down the country, his regime, the Government's regime, was leading to teaching to the test, a narrowing of the curriculum and a diversion of resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/25">Time and again, we found that classes were aimed at children who were just at the margins of being able to reach a certain standard. It was a question of lifting the low-hanging fruit and getting those pupils into the five A to C area. Staff were concentrating on those pupils and perhaps neglecting both the brightest students, whom they took for granted, and the less able students, whom they did not think would make that standard. Some pretty naughty things are going on in schools. That is not the case in all of them. I hate it when people say that these practices are going on in all of them, but a significant number of schools are involved. When we go into a school with very good leadership and a fantastic team of staff, there is a different environment. They know that there are tests, but they are not teaching to the test; they are providing access to the full curriculum. Many schools do that. I do not want to slag off the whole state sector. That would not be right. Most of the state school sector that I see is wonderful, but a significant percentage of schools are teaching to the test and narrowing the curriculum, which is bad for us all.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.0/1">The hon. Gentleman speaks about the fitness for purpose of cohort testing under the present testing regime. Our report was produced in May, so we were not able to consider the specific key stage tests that were offered to children this year. One of those tests has given schools in my constituency a great deal of concern. I speak of this year's written English test, which was set for key stage pupils. It required pupils to have a knowledge of historical fairgrounds; they had to write a biography of a fairground operator. Many of the pupils in my constituents are recently arrived migrants, and they did not have sufficient pre-existing historical knowledge to meet that challenge; yet, quite properly, they could have met an extended writing challenge that did not require that level of knowledge.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/2">One of the things that we failed to cover in our report was to consider some of the details of whether that approach was fit for cohort testing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-09a.153.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1645" speakername="Barry Sheerman" colnum="153"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081009/halltext/81009h0002.htm#08100953000283">
	<p pid="a.153.1/1">To be fair, that is a subject for another debate. I am interested in getting to know the shadow Minister well. I know that he does not like our report, because he is quite fond of testing and assessments. Not only do we have a cross-party consensus between the Labour and Conservative parties on the economic measures that are going on outside this Chamber; we have one also on testing and assessment. I disagree with the hon. Gentleman and the Minister, but they will have the chance to put their views later.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/2">National curriculum tests address only a limited part of the curriculum, and a limited range of children's skills and knowledge. That is the heart of the problem. Achieving excellent test results by teaching the whole curriculum in a balanced and creative manner, without teaching the tests or narrowing the curriculum. requires considerable confidence on the part of teachers and schools&mdash;confidence that many do not have. However, I wish to go a little further.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/3">The other aspect of our inquiry clearly showed&mdash;the key stage test problems in the summer underlined it&mdash;that the reform movement over the past 20 years has led to the undervaluing of our teachers. There are many aspects of teacher training, and the Government have done good things to attract able people into teaching&mdash;the golden hello for subjects short of staff and the teach first scheme in London and other parts of the country have attracted really good talent. The Government are doing some good stuff.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/4">One problem with the working of the national curriculum and the centralisation of education is that it has led&mdash;inadvertently in some ways; I do not think that it was a deliberate ploy&mdash;to an undervaluing of teachers and a lowering of their feeling of professional competence. We have been running this sort of system for 20 years. We might say to teachers, &quot;Do it yourself. Explore the curriculum. Do this. Do that. Open things up.&quot;; but they say, &quot;Oh, I'm terrified. What if my class underperforms and the head comes down on my like a ton of bricks because I have not delivered the A to C grades expected in my subject?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/5">There is a real problem in the undervaluing of a highly trained work force. Once that has happened, once their professionalism has been undermined, it will lead to serious problems. In part, our report is asking why the Government do not trust teachers more. I throw in the example of the key stage tests in the summer. What kind of country and what kind of Department is it that allows millions of scripts to go running and chasing around the country, being delivered by the Royal Mail or special delivery. It was a carbon footprint disaster. The tests could have been administered and assessed locally, by local teachers. They could be set nationally and marked locally. I do not understand the logic of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/6">When thinking of our report during the summer&mdash;I am sure, Mr. Williams, that the Clerk is telling you that I am out of order, but I do not think that I am&mdash;I said to myself, &quot;What a crazy world it is that we cannot trust our teachers to do more. They are competent and highly trained. Why not give them the confidence to do many more tasks?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/7">The Government did not accept that the current system of targets had put the system out of balance; nor did they accept that improvements in national test results were the result of teaching to the test. They ignored the Committee's view that although teaching to the test and narrowing the curriculum were not the inevitable consequences of high stakes testing, many schools and teachers were struggling and had resorted to those techniques in an effort to maintain or improve their league table position.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/8">The Government said that single-level tests and increased emphasis on teacher assessment were the answers to the Committee's questions on the burden of testing. However, they did not address the concern that single-level tests might actually increase the burden of testing. That is another major point arising from the report. We are worried about single-level testing. Many people think that it is a magic answer and that people taking tests as many times as they like is better than taking them at the end of a year, but we believe that such an approach has not been piloted, tried and tested sufficiently well, so there could be unintended consequences if we rush into it as if it is the answer. In the drive towards more demonstrable reliability in results, the Committee found that teacher assessment and the wider skills of the teaching profession have been undervalued, and that the single-level tests should be treated with great care.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/9">The Committee expressed the view that the professional competence of teachers can and should be explicitly recognised and supported by extensive training and ongoing professional support to enhance the use of teacher assessment in schools. The Committee took issue with single-level tests. Testing when ready may have some merit, but if the system is used for holding schools to account and if schools succumb to the imperatives of accountability through targets and performance tables, the focus on effective pupil learning could be lost.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/10">Another major point is that the Government interpreted the Committee's recommendations as supporting their strategy to improve assessment for learning practice, promoting personalised learning and combining the two in single-level tests in the Making Good Progress pilot. In fact, the report offered no such endorsement. I thought that that was a bit naughty. We have taken effective action against the posters that one used to see outside west end theatres that said &quot;Sensational!&quot;, when reviews actually said &quot;Sensationally awful!&quot;. Such things are now against the law, but the Minister did it with our report. He put a big sign, as it were, outside the Eden Project, by which I mean Sanctuary house, that misinterpreted the report. The Committee certainly approved of assessment for learning, increased use of teacher assessment and better personalised learning, but it was not convinced that such outcomes would result from single-level tests and the Making Good Progress pilot.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/11">The Committee was concerned that progression targets would perpetuate the problem of inappropriate use of resources for borderline pupils, and that they would simply shift the emphasis from pupils on the borderline of level 4, for example, to those on the borderline of moving up two levels during a key stage. The Government did not directly address the issue of borderline students but stated that the focus on progression targets as part of the pilot study would enable them to consider their effectiveness in encouraging schools to secure good progress for all pupils, which is different.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/12">I would hope that everyone in education who hears about this debate will know that the Secretary of State has hinted that the coming academic year&mdash;2008-09&mdash;could be the last for national curriculum testing, which implies that single-level tests may be introduced in 2009-10. I cannot tell what the Minister thinks about that from his expression, but, given that the Making Good Progress pilot, which includes a pilot of single-level tests is not due to be concluded until the end of this academic year, there must be a question whether there will be time to assimilate fully the results of the pilot if the Government are to introduce single-level tests in September 2009. I am not naive&mdash;the Government want to get results as quickly as possible, and I do not blame the Minister for being in a hurry. However, the Committee is concerned about single-level testing, even if it is the flavour of the month and fashionable. We have seen the latest fashions and fads employed in other sectors of education and they do not always turn out as well as people expect.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/13">The Committee criticised the Government for not engaging with the complexity of the technical arguments on grade inflation and standards over time. In response to my colleague who said that we did not have time to look in sufficient detail at marking differentiation and key stage tests, I should say that any inquiry can go only so far, and a report must be produced. When I first became Chairman of the Committee, Gwyneth Dunwoody, who was Chairman of the Transport Committee, said, &quot;You have to give Select Committee members a varied diet. The poor darlings don't have a long attention span.&quot; That was a lovely Gwyneth moment, but there is no doubt that people get bored if an inquiry goes on too long, so there must be time limit. I am the first to admit that things such as a sophisticated examination of, and taking evidence on, grade inflation could have been done better. The Government cited the decision to create Ofqual as an independent regulator in response to the criticism that they did not engage in the complexity that I mentioned. However, without some form of standardised, longitudinal assessment, the Committee suggested sampling, which the Government rejected, so Ofqual will not have the tools to monitor assessment standards, as opposed to performance standards over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/14">Going back to where we started, anyone who reads the report will see that the Committee was systematic: we took evidence, listened to what we were told and visited places. In my experience, which includes a range of inquiries in the past seven years, the report was one of the most thoughtful and thorough the Committee has ever offered to the House. The Minister is used to dealing with the Committee and he is charming, and it was great fun when he gave evidence to the Committee, but I hope that he sometimes feels that we are a bit of a pain&mdash;a positive rather than negative pain.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/15">Some things can be put right. When we produced our report, the Government were in the first year of a five-year key stage testing contract with an American company, to which they were in hock. At that time, they could not come back to us and say, &quot;We are going to look at testing and assessment again, clearly, openly, thoroughly, and holistically&quot;, because they were in a five-year contract. I do not blame the Minister or the Department for the debacle in the summer&mdash;we are inquiring into what went wrong&mdash;but it gives them a great opportunity to thoroughly and holistically re-examine testing and assessment. I hope that I am right that the Minister&mdash;I always think the best of people, particularly him&mdash;has cleverly decided that he will not rush into another four-year contract, but sign a temporary contract for one year. I hope that he believes that that year will give him and his Department the chance to seriously assess the direction of testing and assessment, evaluate the report more thoughtfully, and introduce reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/16">There is a thoughtful collection of essays entitled, &quot;Education Management Administration and Leadership&quot;. From it emerges the idea that the incoming Blair Government, who liked most of the Conservative-style reforms of the previous 10 years in terms of markets, diversity and choice could, at the same time, by adding expenditure and focussing on more deprived areas, social deprivation and so on, secure social justice goals for the less fortunate children in our society.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/17">If it tells us anything it is that all the money we have expended, and the massive investment we have made in pre-school and early years education, and throughout education&mdash;tapering off a bit into higher education&mdash;has been a wonderful investment. It would have been even more wonderful with, along the way, some modification of what we do about testing and assessment and the way we value and use our teaching staff, and some more sensitive evaluation of whether the inspection system is quite what we want it to be. I look forward to presenting future reports by the Committee, with you in the Chair, Mr. Williams, and with, I hope, the same Schools Minister as we have today; we shall be arguing the case for the best education system for all the children in the country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-09a.173.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1429" speakername="Nick Gibb" colnum="173"  time="016:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081009/halltext/81009h0005.htm#08100953000304">
	<p pid="a.173.0/1">I will come on to those points, but I do not accept the argument that such tests cannot be used for multiple purposes. There are two main purposes&mdash;to assess the child and to provide an accountability framework for schools&mdash;and I do not think that they are incompatible. I will talk in a moment about the concept of teaching to the test and the extent of that problem and how we tackle it, but I want to focus first on the issue of too many tests. There is a problem with tests from 16 onwards. The introduction of modularisation and the AS/A2 split means that sixth formers are taking exams throughout their two years of study with repeated retakes adding to that burden. From the age of 15 or 16, children in this country have a huge burden of testing, which is unnecessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/2">The reforms have done so much damage. As I said in an intervention, they have stunted the progression of 16 and 17-year-olds from absorbers of knowledge and concepts at GCSE level to thinkers at A-level. Too many sixth formers leave school with their intellectual development scarcely above the GCSE level because of the modular approach, which was reflected in the concerns the vice-chancellors expressed in their evidence to the Select Committee. We have asked Sir Richard Sykes, the former rector of Imperial college, to look at that aspect of the exam system to determine what reforms are required to restore the integrity and rigour of our examinations and public confidence in them.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/3">Teaching to the test was raised in the report, and it has been raised extensively in this debate. I would argue that it is a feature of weaker schools. I visit schools every week, and I always ask heads whether they engage in the practice, whether for year 6 in primary schools or year 9 in secondary schools, and whether they focus on test practice, narrowing the curriculum or stressing their pupils. The heads of strong primary schools in particular tell me that the children in their school take the tests in their stride. They simply come in on a Monday morning and do them. Those schools are confident that their broad curriculum, which includes ample time for subjects such as history and geography as well as the basics and science, equips the children with a broad knowledge and vocabulary so that they can excel in key stage 2 standard assessment tests. Ofsted itself said on page 13 of the response to the Select Committee's report that</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/4" class="indent">&quot;the best schools can focus on tests and exams without narrowing the curriculum.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/5">I believe that that is the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/6">The schools that use synthetic phonics to teach reading in reception class and year 1 get to a position in which almost every child is a fluent reader by the end of year 1, or at the end of year 2 at the very latest. In those schools, having learned to read, children then spend the next five years of their primary education reading to learn rather than still struggling to read. Children should not be put in the position 10 weeks before their key stage 2 tests in English of being rehearsed to reach level 4. In strong schools, the aim is not level 4 but level 5&mdash;they are way beyond level 4. Schools should aim to teach beyond the test. If they were to do so, they would find that the test itself was not something to worry about.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/7">I acknowledge that teaching to the test takes place in either a minority or significant minority of schools. Ofsted needs to monitor the extent to which it takes place and to report on it at an individual school level. It should criticise schools for doing it. I am always astonished by how many teachers admit to teaching to the test. The hon. Member for Huddersfield cited people who gave evidence to the Select Committee saying that they teach to the test. Professionals should not want to boast about it. It is, as he said, &quot;naughty&quot;, and Ofsted should therefore include it as one of the things on which it reports.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/8">I agree with paragraph 131 of the Select Committee's report, which recommends</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/9" class="indent">&quot;that the Government reconsiders the evidence on teaching to the test and that it commissions systematic and wide-ranging research to discover the nature and full extent of the problem.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/10">Of course, schools are under pressure to ensure that all children who leave primary school are fluent readers and at ease with arithmetic. When tests were introduced in the mid-1990s, it became clear that one half of 11-year-olds were starting secondary school ill-equipped in the basics. Even now, one in five 11-year-olds leaving primary school still struggles with reading, and 40 per cent. leave primary school not having mastered the basics in reading, writing and maths combined.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/11">I am always astonished when I visit comprehensive schools&mdash;even good comprehensive schools with good feeder primary schools&mdash;where the head teacher tells me that 25 per cent. of the children coming into their school have a reading age below the age of 11, or that some other significant percentage have a reading age more than two years below their chronological age. As much as half the intake of some weaker comprehensives with weak feeder primary schools has a reading age below the children's chronological age. That is totally unacceptable and unnecessary: reading is a low-level skill that all children, except those with particular neurological conditions, should master in the first two or three years of primary school.</p>
