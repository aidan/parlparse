	<p pid="b.104.1/1">Would the Minister refrain from stalling by reading out a singularly boring pre-prepared statement and address the question of whether or not Brian Monteith should be put down and of what should happen if Margot McDonald stands down?</p>
	<p pid="b.104.1/2">There is no provision for a by-election for a single person on the list. Seriously, that is another issue that ought to be addressed, as should the fact that all Labour votes in Glasgow in the second ballot are wasted, because we have already won all the first-past-the-post seats.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-09b.119.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1726" speakername="Patrick Mercer" colnum="119"  time="15:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051109/halltext/51109h03.htm#51109h03_spnew34">
	<p pid="b.119.1/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" name="Mark Williams">the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)</phrase>, who spoke clearly and with great interest in the subject. May I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" name="Stephen Crabb">my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb)</phrase> on securing this debate? Any time the Minister wishes to look at the limited but large farms and the burgeoning, affluent supermarkets that I have, he is welcome to return to his old stamping grounds. I shall show him around with the greatest of pleasure; I am sure that my constituents will be very pleased to see him.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.1/2">North-east Nottinghamshire is not noted for its dairy or beef farmers. During the past 50 years, we have moved quickly from a mixed agricultural society to a limited one of almost completely arable farmers. Unlike the rich pastures of Preseli, where I spend many of my holidays, the whole area in between the power stations that proliferate up in Nottinghamshire is taking on much more the mien of the county of Cambridgeshire.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.1/3">Our farming is getting much less interesting, demanding and diverse, and the farming communities, and their mixture, are suffering. Several Members present have already made the point that the vibrancy of the agricultural community depends not only on profit margins, but on variety and on there being a fair deal for those to whom they sell their produce.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.1/4">Time is limited, so I shall not bang on more than I normally do, but I should like briefly to consider one case study in my constituency. A little under a year ago when this problem started to generate heat in the east midlands and in north-east Nottinghamshire, I was asked to visit several of the diminishing number of dairy farms in my area. Most of them were absolutely model farms. They understood the necessity to make milk production as efficient as possible, and the diversity was impressive. Every single one of them had thought about the environment; many had tried to diversify so that they could sustain all sorts of farm products other than merely dairy products, and I was impressed by the way they were making a go of difficult circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.1/5">In one particular case, the farmer of a larger than normal herd of 110 beasts told me that he was producing in profit less than &pound;1,000 a month. He and his wife worked more than a 60-hour week, and they had had to pay off the man who worked part-time essentially, as far as they were concerned, to fill in the forms about which we heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase>. Their workload was increasing and their profit margin decreasing by the day. I do not need to tell the Minister that on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-01">1 October</phrase> the price of milk fell by another 0.3p, making life even more difficult for the characters whom I have just described. That is a relatively large milk producer on my patch; there are others in more difficult circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.1/6">Although electricity, diesel, contracting, oil-based fertiliser and all other costs that the farmer must absorb continue to rise, there is nowhere for the farmer to go. I know that the Minister understands. With my limited grasp of mathematics, I should have thought that the rules of supply and demand suggest that as supply diminishes, so prices should rise. That is not the case. Although prices may be rising, they certainly are not doing so at the farm gate. The losers in this deal are the farmers who are trying to put in those 60-hour weeks not only to produce the goods that we want, but to maintain the farms, the diversity and the rural aspect.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.1/7">Those points have been made already. However, the dairy farmers pointed out to me that it is not easy to change from dairy farming, unlike other forms of farming. It takes about four years to go from conception to producing a milkable animal, if that is the right technical term, and such a business cannot just be turned round or changed overnight. Already, we have heard that if we are not careful, given where competition is going, we will end up with large farms, and the sort of small herds that I have been discussing will completely disappear. I do not want that, and it is clear that nobody in this Chamber&mdash;no matter what their political stripe&mdash;wants that either.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.1/8">I iterate the points already made. Will the Minister please allow us, and therefore our farmers, to know what the Office of Fair Trading is going to do about this? How will a supermarket code of practice be made to work, both in theory and&mdash;to use the same word again&mdash;in practice? What can the buyers charter be made to do for the farmer, rather than the processor? Lastly, how can farmer-controlled co-operatives be encouraged by the Government, not just in theory, but in fact?</p>
	<p pid="b.119.1/9">The time for talking about this subject is long past. The Minister understands that, unless the supermarkets and other market factors are gripped and controlled, we shall lose our dairy production capacity completely, and I, for one, will be extremely sorry and many of my constituents will be extremely poor.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-09b.138.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" speakername="Douglas Alexander" speakeroffice="The Minister for Europe"  colnum="138"  time="16:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051109/halltext/51109h04.htm#51109h04_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.138.0/1">I am most grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" name="Norman Baker">the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase> for securing this debate. His contribution is eloquent testimony to the importance of Inter-Parliamentary Union groups visiting and seeing for themselves the kind of initiatives that he was able to describe in such detail following his recent trip to Nicaragua and Costa Rica. I also place on record my personal gratitude for his generous words about Ambassador Georgina Butler, whom he described as &quot;unstuffy&quot;. I shall ensure that his kind and generous remarks are relayed directly.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/2">The hon. Gentleman made comments about Daniel Ortega's style of conducting meetings; propriety and diplomatic convention oblige me to resist commenting on that. Suffice it to say that my own limited experience of diplomacy&mdash;first as Minister for Trade and then as Minister for Europe&mdash;convinces me that Mr. Ortega is not alone in approaching meetings in that style. I have faced similar challenges on how to ensure that the British Government's point of view is communicated in various meetings during the past couple of years.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/3">The hon. Gentleman asked a number of questions about Foreign and Commonwealth Office policy towards Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and I shall direct myself to some of those concerns. The background was set out in the December 2003 White Paper &quot;UK International Priorities: a Strategy for the FCO&quot;. That set out the Government's international priorities for the next 10 years and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's strategy for delivering them.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/4">It was clear that we needed to evaluate our network of overseas representation to respond to inevitably changing priorities. We have, in the past seven years or so, opened 28 new posts, including major new missions in Baghdad, Basra, Kabul and Pyongyang. Twenty-six posts have been closed over the same period, and Managua in Nicaragua is one of those. None of those decisions has been taken lightly, but it is essential that we align our resources to our overall priorities and have the ability to respond to change.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/5">I assure the House and the hon. Gentleman that we are not&mdash;categorically not&mdash;abandoning countries. As the hon. Gentleman knows, and recognised before our deliberations today, our ambassador to Costa Rica is now also accredited to Nicaragua and is responsible for taking forward the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's strategic priorities for both those countries. The Department for International Development's central America office is in Managua, as was acknowledged in the hon. Gentleman's contribution. The head of the Department for International Development office, whom I know the hon. Gentleman met on his visit, is also accredited to the British embassy in Costa Rica. We also have an excellent honorary consul in Managua.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/6">A key priority for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in both Costa Rica and Nicaragua is to promote the rule of law and sustainable development, underpinned by democracy, good governance and human rights. We continue to seek opportunities to develop our cultural relations with the region, including through the Chevening programme. The hon. Gentleman said that he had heard rumours that the Chevening programme would be withdrawn from Nicaragua and Costa Rica; I assure him that that is not the case. Two of the presidential and one of the vice-presidential candidates in the forthcoming election in Costa Rica are former Chevening scholars. By any measure, that shows the importance of the Chevening scholars programme and its effectiveness in identifying those who will be figures of influence in Costa Rica and the region in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/7">The Department for International Development's work in Latin America is based on a regional approach to help the multilateral agencies. The hon. Gentleman raised that point in talking about the effectiveness and efficacy of using our money as part of a multilateral effort, rather than the Department for International Development determining priorities in isolation. That is notably the case in relation to the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. The general policy context in which such individual decisions are made has received detailed Government consideration and is based on a judgment that, in many circumstances, pooling money across multilateral agencies is a more effective means of securing value for money and effectiveness of output than when each international development agency from a range of different countries chooses to set up its own mechanisms and deploy its resources unilaterally. In addition, the Department for International Development provides bilateral assistance to Latin America through United Kingdom non-governmental organisations. DFID maintains a bilateral programme of support for Nicaragua, the only remaining low-income country in the region other than Haiti, and has increased its annual budget for Nicaragua from &pound;3.7 million to &pound;4 million for 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/8">This is the first year that DFID will provide budget support to Nicaragua. Given our concerns about the party polarisation of central state powers and the fact that donor support to the Government's fight against corruption is hampered by political control of state powers, including the judiciary, the audit authority and the electoral circumstances, DFID Ministers decided, this year, to provide budget support direct to local municipal governments. DFID is also providing &pound;1.5 million of additional technical assistance over three years to help strengthen the transparent auditing of municipal institutions. I hope that that commitment to transparency in audit goes some way to addressing the concerns about the public accounts.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/9">DFID, the FCO and the MOD have worked closely on emergency preparedness action in the region. As a result, HMS Cumberland stood ready to provide humanitarian relief in the wake of hurricane Beta, which hit the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-30">30 October</phrase>. President Bolanos of Nicaragua and the United Nations were grateful to the Government for this offer. I understand that HMS Cumberland went on to seize two tonnes of cocaine in international waters about 100 miles off Nicaragua, for which we should all feel rightly proud.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/10">The hon. Gentleman also raised specific concerns about the Atlantic coast region of Nicaragua. Since taking over responsibility for Nicaragua, the ambassador in San Jose has paid four visits to the Atlantic coast region and has made a point of raising a number of the concerns with the Nicaraguan authorities in Managua, reinforcing the message of the Under-Secretary of State for International Development, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" name="Gareth Thomas">my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Thomas)</phrase>, who visited that region in March 2004. DFID's work to improve the auditing mechanisms of Nicaragua's central and local government expenditure should enable it to identify better in future the extent to which the national budget has benefited the Atlantic coast. DFID is also funding a countrywide programme to help local government and NGOs to provide basic care for people living with HIV/AIDS, again including those on the Atlantic coast. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's generous acknowledgment of the work that DFID is doing in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/11">DFID has also been supporting the United Nations Development Programme's 2005 national census in the coastal region. The census now covers a wider area and takes better account of local ethnic sensitivities. It has also helped the Government to identify more clearly the areas of poverty on that coast, it has increased their awareness of communities not previously registered and it has highlighted weaknesses in the electoral register in the coastal region.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/12">Two weeks ago, with the assistance of <i>La Prensa</i>, the biggest Nicaraguan daily newspaper, the embassy launched a book of short stories about life on the Atlantic coast, written by children from Bluefields and Pearl Lagoon. It is hoped that this initiative will help raise awareness of the region and boost pride and self-esteem in the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/13">The hon. Gentleman also touched on and expressed concern about the level of our commercial resources in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. UK Trade and Investment offers support both to companies in the UK trading internationally and to overseas companies seeking to locate in the UK. As some hon. Members will be aware, UKTI's 2004 spending review settlement included a &pound;20 million cost reduction in its global overseas network. Following that decision, a fundamental review of the network was carried out to identify and prioritise business needs. Although it can no longer offer the full range of market services in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, UKTI is focusing its commercial resources on responding to the needs of UK businesses. The level of commercial staffing at the British embassy in Costa Rica reflects this demand, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that we will continue to monitor it carefully.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.0/14">The hon. Gentleman also referred to the internal political situation in Costa Rica and Nicaragua.</p>
