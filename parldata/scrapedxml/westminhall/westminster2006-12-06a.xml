<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-12-06a.82.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" speakername="Mark Simmonds" colnum="82"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061206/halltext/61206h0001.htm#06120650000491">
	<p pid="a.82.0/1">I am grateful for my hon. Friend's intervention. As always, he is an assiduous Member of the House, with the interests of his constituency at the forefront of his mind. I am sure that the Minister and his officials will take on board what he has said.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/2">I should like an assurance from the Minister today that the revenue support grant for both Boston borough council and East Lindsey district council will be increased in the next financial year to ensure that they receive sufficient resources for coastal flood defences and the internal drainage boards, and are not forced to make the terrible choice of raising council taxes, cutting public services or increasing the likelihood of flooding.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/3">In addition, there is a moratorium on the approval of capital schemes for both internal drainage boards and local authorities, because the funding demand is greater than the funding available. It would be helpful if the Minister could provide further information on when the moratorium is likely to be lifted and about the backlog of applications for funding capital schemes. Internal drainage boards play a vital role in protecting Lincolnshire from flooding, but they will require significant capital investment in the near future, as many still operate with technology from the 1930s and 1940s that is reaching the end of its usable life. In the long run, that capital investment will result in efficiencies, but discussions need to be had now about how those funds are found.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/4">I am also keen to ensure that the internal drainage boards retain their local control. In the past, it has been suggested that the Environment Agency should take control of the management of the boards. I am strongly opposed to that idea, as are the internal drainage boards, as they need to retain their detailed local knowledge and expertise. I should welcome a reassurance from the Minister that that suggestion is completely off the agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/5">Many of my constituents have contacted me concerning their nervousness about obtaining insurance for domestic properties and businesses in areas at risk of flooding. An excellent recent report by the Association of British Insurers raises concerns, of which I am sure the Minister is aware, about its statement of principles with DEFRA. The statement is an agreement between the Government and insurers to ensure that, in the long term, as the former continues to invest in flood protection, the latter will continue to provide cover to homeowners and small businesses. However, many members of the ABI will not insure any new building unless it has only a 0.5 per cent. chance of flooding or less, and the statement of principles covers only the majority of properties. The Government must work further with the ABI and its members to ensure that flood insurance is provided at a reasonable cost to as many homes and businesses as possible, particularly in areas of socio-economic deprivation, such as coastal Lincolnshire, where, for many businesses and individuals, the net financial cost of getting insurance constitutes a significant part of their outlays. Unavailable and expensive insurance could have a negative impact on the economy of the east Lincolnshire coast. The local authorities are keen to diversify the economy away from its traditional agricultural base, but without guaranteed insurance and the long-term protection of land, developers will struggle to attract new investment and new businesses into the area. The Government and the Environment Agency must do more to ensure that such security can be offered, so that new businesses feel confident in developing and investing in east Lincolnshire and other coastal strips across the country, providing sustainable, non-seasonal employment and stimulating economic regeneration and wealth creation.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/6">The Government must ensure that flood defences&mdash;both hard, such as sea walls, and soft, such as salt marshes&mdash;are fully funded and maintained. That will require sufficient funding for the Environment Agency in the comprehensive spending review, and the revenue support grant to each council must be sufficient and appropriate for the financing of flood defences without cuts in public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/7">The Environment Agency must give a clear commitment to maintaining the defences and, if necessary, when sea-level rise occurs, improving and increasing the defences to protect communities and valuable farm land in Lincolnshire and elsewhere. Currently, the ambiguity on the part of the Environment Agency is a major barrier to inward investment and is leading to a confused policy area, as other Government Departments push to improve economic growth, make social and educational improvements and make the quality of life better for residents in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/8">The Stern report provides evidence that global warming presents a serious threat and the Government must match not only taxation but expenditure to the threat of climate change. Nowhere is that more important and appropriate than in south and east Lincolnshire. I conclude by quoting Professor Sir David King, chief scientific adviser to Her Majesty's Government and head of the Office of Science and Technology:</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/9" class="indent">&quot;Continuing with existing policies is not an option. We must either invest more in sustainable approaches to flood and coastal management or live with increased flooding.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/10">I assure the Minister that this is not the time for cuts.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that information, which I am sure the Minister will note with interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/2">In the Select Committee inquiry the agency noted that it already lacked the appropriate resources to carry out basic planning applications, so this year's budget cuts do not bode well, especially if the consultee status is indeed delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/3">The ABI has made it clear that insurers do not want to insure new developments on flood plain lands in high risk areas. That will put off the private sector, which will not want to go into the development of projects and properties that it will not be able to sell. Perhaps we will be saved, after all, in the Thames Gateway, as the plan falls flat on its face because the Government have not done their homework on flooding, and consequently have scared off investors. That issue has not escaped the academic world. Writing in <i>Regeneration and Renewal</i>, Professor Sir Peter Hall of University college London noted that according to the interim plan published last week, most of the Thames Gateway jobs will be at the London end:</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/4" class="indent">&quot;But beyond that there was little indication, because of one key problem dogging the project: flood risk.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/5">He goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/6" class="indent">&quot;The report casually mentions that the Environment Agency will complete a draft assessment by 2008&mdash;a year after the plan is to be finalised. This is crucial because many sites proposed for large-scale development, especially in Essex, are at risk.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/7">The whole Thames Gateway development faces a very watery grave&mdash;I hope that the Minister will forgive the pun. We in south Essex are deeply concerned about the Government's plans and would like the Government to reconsider the position before hard-working families move into properties that will ultimately be flooded.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/8">As to infrastructure, the bulk of flooding that the ABI has predicted in applying its catastrophic model will take place at the eastern end of Southend and Shoeburyness. For hon. Members who are not entirely au fait with the constituency map, Shoeburyness is literally at the end of the line, following the Thames on the northern banks. If a major storm occurs there will be a disruption in rail links between Southend and Shoeburyness, and flooding on the main roads linking those two areas. That would have a severe impact on local residents at the very time when infrastructure links would be vital. The floods in New Orleans following hurricane Katrina showed dramatically what happens when the right infrastructure is not there. In particular it showed the human impact of flooding and the disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups, which my hon. Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness has already highlighted. In Shoeburyness not only would residents be cut off, but a large proportion of those residents would be elderly and frail, and there would be a lower proportion of young and able-bodied people to assist them.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/9">In summary, I shudder when I think of the ABI catastrophic impact scenario playing out in my area. People in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia face such floods today. This debate is not the place for a plea for assistance for them; but what is happening in those places is evidence that climate change is happening now. When it reaches us it will not be pretty. I am very grateful for the opportunity to take part in this debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-12-06a.89.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1785" speakername="James Duddridge" colnum="89"  time="010:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061206/halltext/61206h0002.htm#06120650000502">
	<p pid="a.89.0/1">I am grateful that we are having this debate, because coastal flooding is a major issue for people in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/2">In some way, the ABI's report &quot;Coastal Risk Flood&mdash;Thinking for tomorrow, acting today&quot; precipitated this debate, and it is a useful contribution to the overall debate on coastal flooding. It was particularly useful for me, because Southend was pinpointed as one of the areas that would be under increased risk of flooding in the coming years.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/3">Let us get things straight: this is not a hypothetical issue, but a real concern, which is faced by all our constituents. The great storm in 1953, which was mentioned in the report and by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" name="Mark Simmonds">the Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds)</phrase>, killed nine individuals from around Southend, Great Wakering and Foulness. The total death toll around the UK was 309. There is a vivid living memory of that event in my constituency, and no one wants to see it repeated.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/4">The ABI predicts that, with the existing defences in my constituency, 1,400 residential and commercial properties would face significant flooding if the 1953 storms were repeated, causing losses of anything up to &pound;86 million. Let us look at what would happen if, as the ABI predicts, sea levels rose by 40 cm. With the current levels of protection, the same storm would significantly increase the number of properties flooded to more than 24,000&mdash;a huge increase. The financial cost would go up to more than &pound;330 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/5">On top of all that, the Government are planning to develop the Thames Gateway, with 160,000 houses planned by 2016&mdash;the 120,000 originally planned are not sufficient. Some 35 per cent. of the developments are planned for the flood plain in south Essex, which makes absolutely no sense to me. A very worrying picture is building up.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/6">We also need to look at communication. Charles Beardall, the eastern region manager at the Environment Agency, has been making a lot of effort to keep me and the local community informed and updated about the projects that the agency is running. Indeed, the agency ran a public consultation, as part of which it held a successful event in the village hall at Great Wakering. Local people could come along and talk to the experts about what was happening, and I look forward to the outcome of that consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/7">However, there is no real money to deliver the projects; indeed, there was none even before the cuts at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Flood risk management at DEFRA has seen funding cuts to the tune of &pound;14.9 million, and there is no doubt that the Environment Agency will suffer and that individuals will suffer as a result. As the Minister will know, I am a member of the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. As recently as Monday we took oral evidence in public from Helen Ghosh, the permanent secretary at DEFRA, as part of our inquiry into its annual report. We talked about the impact of the cuts, and it would be fair to say that it might be as follows: there will be reductions in the rate of repairs on flood defences; in channel clearing and maintenance; in asset management plans and structural asset services, which are so important; in risk-based assessments; in flood warnings; in flood mapping; and in studies and the collection of data, which is essential. There will also be a reduction in the number of pre-feasibility studies, or else existing feasibility studies will be slowed down. In many cases, catchment flood management plans will be delayed. Action on water level management plans, where they affect sites of special scientific interest, will be reduced and delayed.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/8">I do not think there is any doubt that the Environment Agency's services will be harmed, and it is vital that the agency should be given necessary funding. It is also important that it should be made a statutory consultee on proposed developments. Planning policy statement 25 on development and flood risk still has not been published. There was a consultation on it a year ago, which indeed proposed that the Environment Agency should be a statutory consultee, but the promised statement has yet to be delivered.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.0/1">My remarks will be brief, as time is getting on. First, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" name="Mark Simmonds">the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds)</phrase> on securing this timely debate. So far it has necessarily, and perhaps rightly, focused on the east coast of the country, but I want to say a few words about the other side, the west coast.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/2">Our country has one of the longest coastlines in Europe. Wales, with about 6 per cent. of the UK population, has about 10 per cent. of its coastline. My constituency of Ceredigion has 50 miles of that coastline, with towns such as Aberystwyth, Aberaeron, New Quay and Borth, to name a few, lying within the sea's reach. In my brief speech I hope to develop the theme of how funding decisions taken in recent months by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will impinge on the capacity of the Environment Agency Wales to provide the coastal protection that we seek. The Environment Agency Wales is funded by the National Assembly, but is still part of the larger Environment Agency of England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/3">The natural strength and unpredictability of the seas and seasonal changes have always meant that living by the sea is a risk. The sandbags have been out in my communities for the past few months. Year in, year out, that risk is always present. However, the realities of climate change and the resulting rises in sea level have made the threat even more potent. The Government-funded UK climate impacts programme predicts that sea levels on the Welsh coast could rise by as much as 74 cm by 2080, and the Stern report, which was hailed by the Prime Minister as the great wake-up call, alerts us all to the need to adapt and to prepare for the impact of climate change. That message has not been lost on my constituents or other people in Wales: there has been a 28 per cent. increase in registrations&mdash;that is 15,000 new customers&mdash;for the Environment Agency's flood warning service in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/4">Constituents of mine have for years faced the rough edge of nature's sword. In November 2005 the river harbour wall in the town of Aberaeron collapsed under the weight of flood waters. Other areas of my community are under threat, and three priority projects still await funding. Other hon. Members have alluded to the funding shortfall; it is estimated that the total spend required on capital projects is &pound;69.7 million, yet I am told that the Environment Agency Wales has &pound;6 million in its coastal defence budget. I appreciate that the funding of flood and coastal defences is a devolved matter, but by my calculations the proposed &pound;15 million cuts to the Environment Agency's flood defence maintenance budget may mean&mdash;I seek clarification from the Minister&mdash;a corresponding cut in the Assembly's block grant of anything up to &pound;900,000. That would be lamentable. The Minister shakes his head; I seek reassurance that that may not happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/5">Clearly, any cuts in the Assembly's budget would have to result in savings elsewhere. We are told that the cuts are for one year only, and that may be so; nevertheless, they go completely against the grain of the Government's commitments on the effects of climate change. I congratulate the Government on their 35 per cent. increase in spending since 1997&mdash;it would be churlish to do otherwise&mdash;but this year is not the time to reverse that trend. That was borne out by the report of the Association of British Insurers last month, which made it crystal clear, as other hon. Members including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" name="Anthony D Wright">the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase> have said, that we should be hoping to increase spending by 10 per cent. a year, to &pound;750 million by 2011, to combat flood risk. The Environment Agency Wales has similarly called for increases in resources to take account of the risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/6">It is particularly galling to my constituents and others that the cuts seem to have been forced on DEFRA by the cost of the mismanagement of the single farm payment. As a result, the Welsh block grant and other DEFRA services provided to England and Wales at UK-wide level, such as the state veterinary service, will lose funding. As a point of principle it is wrong that we in Wales and people elsewhere should face serious shortfalls in budgets because of those decisions. So far the effect of DEFRA's summer budget review in respect of Wales and the Welsh block grant has yet to be fully identified, but I ask the Minister to prove me wrong&mdash;I sincerely hope that he can&mdash;and to make a clear statement on how cuts to the flood maintenance budget, and the savings more generally, will affect us on the west coast, in Wales, and, of course, people on the east coast as well.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-12-06a.93.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" speakername="Bob Russell" colnum="93"  time="010:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061206/halltext/61206h0003.htm#06120650000506">
	<p pid="a.93.0/1">I am grateful to you, Mr. Conway, for calling me to speak near the end of the debate. I represent an urban constituency that is eight miles from the sea, but it is on a tidal river and anything that happens at the coast could have an impact on urban areas upriver. Indeed, a barrier had to be constructed across the River Colne a few years ago to prevent surge tides from coming up and flooding the lower areas of Colchester. A mini-Thames barrier is the best way that I can describe it.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/2">On the one hand, I congratulate the Government, but on the other, I strongly criticise them. I congratulate them on their work on managed retreats in coastal areas, where that can be achieved. At Abbotts Hall, the Essex Wildlife Trust has developed just such a policy by allowing the tide to breach the sea wall and come in and create new salt-meadow marshes. That is something to be praised. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1805" name="Elliot Morley">The hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley)</phrase>, when he was a Minister, came to Abbotts Hall for the formal opening. It was quite an occasion to watch the tide come through the breached sea wall to engulf what only the week before had been a ploughed field; the corn crop had been harvested for the last time. Such developments are how coastal flooding can be dealt with in some places, certainly for a generation or two.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/3">However, I echo the sentiments of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1785" name="James Duddridge">the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge)</phrase>, because there are potential flooding problems in the north of the county that have been caused by what I can describe only as stark staring bonkers decisions of the Government to allow housing to be built on areas prone to flooding. Only three weeks ago, on appeal, a Government inspector allowed a housing development right next to the River Colne in an area that is known to be prone to flooding. Just as in the Thames Gateway area, it is not fair to build houses in such areas&mdash;it is not fair to the people who will be obliged to live there. I suspect that in many cases social housing will be put on such land, because the private sector may well take the view that such areas are not the place to build.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/4">Therefore, although we can praise the Government for their work on managed retreat, as illustrated by the Essex Wildlife Trust at Abbotts Hall, I urge the Minister and his colleagues to take very seriously the point made by the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East, by me and, I am sure, by hon. Members up and down the country who represent not only coastal areas, but areas where tidal and other rivers have a habit of flooding on to surrounding land. Building houses on such land is not acceptable, and I hope that the Minister will work with his colleagues to stop such nonsense.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/5">I hope also that the Minister will be able to stop the development on the flood plain in my town. The borough council, knowing the area, unanimously refused the application, but then an inspector was persuaded to allow it by experts who, it seems, will prostitute themselves and give evidence either for or against something, depending on who is paying. It is the community that ends up paying the ultimate price. The experts, planning inspectors and highly paid legal executives leave, having given their evidence. I ask the Minister, please, to work for common sense and to stop the building of houses on flood plains.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-12-06a.94.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" speakername="Martin Horwood" colnum="94"  time="010:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061206/halltext/61206h0003.htm#06120650000507">
	<p pid="a.94.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" name="Mark Simmonds">the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds)</phrase> on securing the debate on an important but extremely sensitive issue. It demands honesty and political courage and, even more challenging, it sometimes demands support for the Government if they do the right thing and act realistically. However, realism also is demanded of the Government, and sometimes they must admit that some of the policies that they have espoused in the past may not be viable in the light of what we now know about flood plains. The remarks made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">the Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase> reinforce that.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/2">The context is clear. We all know the statistics on climate change, so I shall not go over them again. However, as well as considering shorter-term rises in sea level, it may be worth our while to look at the longer-term scenarios. The most apocalyptic version that I know of involves the complete melting of the Antarctic ice cap, which would lead to a truly biblical rise in sea levels of some 60 m, but thankfully that is unlikely. However, a long-term scenario in which the Greenland ice cap melts over a century or so and leads to a rise of some 7 m is not beyond the realms of possibility if we do not take sufficient action on climate change worldwide. I am happy to say that Cheltenham, being on the edge of the Cotswolds, would be safe even in those circumstances, but I suspect that the constituencies of many current Members would be under water.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/3">I do have one question for the Minister about the situation in Gloucestershire. In the scenario that I have outlined, the area containing Berkeley nuclear power station would be surrounded by water, which has two implications. The proposed time scale for decommissioning nuclear power station sites is some 100 years&mdash;the so-called deferred site clearance strategy. Have the Government taken climate change into account in planning the decommissioning of nuclear power stations?</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/4">The other obvious implication is for the next generation of nuclear power stations that the Government are planning. I cannot know the future, but I suspect that planning permission for many of those stations will be requested for sites that already have clearance for nuclear power stations. That is clearly where public opposition will be most limited because, in one sense, the planning arguments have already have been won. However, those sites are often in coastal positions or on flood plains. In the long term, which is what we have to think of with nuclear power stations, stations such as Berkeley would be threatened by the type of sea level rises that I have described. I would therefore be grateful for the Minister's reassurance that he is discussing those implications with the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/5">The shorter-term scenarios offer various predictions for rises in sea level&mdash;for example, a 40 cm rise by 2040 from the Association of British Insurers, and a range of 20 to 80 cm in the Stern report. In evidence to the Communities and Local Government Committee, of which I am a member, the Environment Agency warned of a 30 cm rise by the 2080s, but said that that equated to an increase in the storm surge from the North sea of more than 1 m. Even though the absolute level of rise may not be very great, sometimes the storm surge amount may be much greater and have greater implications than is at first apparent. The Environment Agency admits that even that is a conservative estimate. In its evidence to the Select Committee, it stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/6" class="indent">&quot;At present the Environment Agency does not plan for the worst case scenario when allowing for future climate change, as this would make most costs prohibitive.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/7">In a sense, the agency is ruling out the worst answers before it has even asked the questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/8">In a brief that it gave to hon. Members, the Environment Agency stated that the foresight future flooding report, which was published in April 2004, estimated that the risk of flooding from rivers and the sea will at least double by the 2080s and could increase by up to 20 times. There is a huge range of uncertainty. At the same time, the number of people at a high risk from flooding could increase from 1.5 million to between 2.3 million and 3.5 million. An enormous number of people could be affected. In its evidence to the Select Committee, the Environment Agency said that even those figures may be underestimates. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/9" class="indent">&quot;Recent research by a number of establishments indicates that the sea level predictions used within the Foresight report...and the last United Kingdom Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) reports (2002) were underestimated.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/10" class="indent">In addition the impacts of such factors as polar and glacial melt on storminess and risk of tidal surge were not well understood and probably underestimated.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/11">Yet again, our discussions about scenarios may well prove to be over-optimistic.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/12">The warning bells that have been rung have been well expanded on by various hon. Members and I will not go over them all again. They include the fact that the potential costs to which the ABI has alerted us are very high. In terms of the people who are likely to be impacted on by flooding, one of the most worrying things that the ABI said was that insurers cannot guarantee that they will maintain cover in areas where there is a greater than 1.3 per cent. annual probability of flooding, which equates to one major flood event in 75 years, yet the foresight report said that by 2080 the UK could be facing major flood events which once happened once in 100 years once every three years. That is clearly an enormously increased potential cost. The foresight report said, too, that the cost of the annual damage from flooding could rise from &pound;1 billion a year to a range between &pound;1.5 billion and &pound;21 billion a year. The false economy of cutting back on flood defence budgets when all the experts are screaming for more resources and warning of the much greater potential costs of doing nothing should be obvious to everybody.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/13">We are now talking about an adaptation scenario. David King of the Environment Agency made it clear in his evidence to the Select Committee that that was what we should be thinking about. We are moving from a strategy based purely on flood defence to a more holistic policy based, I hope, on three points: realistic and sustainable solutions, adequate funding, and fairness to affected communities. On realistic and sustainable solutions, we may complain about the way in which the making space for water plan was launched, complete with maps that instantly reduced people's house prices&mdash;I think that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> complained vociferously at the time&mdash;but there is no doubt that an integrated approach that includes some acceptance of coastal realignment and the creation of new wetlands, carefully managed, must be right. The recent &quot;Blueprint for Water&quot;, published by an impressive range of non-governmental organisations, including the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and other environmental groups, welcomes that holistic approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/14">If the Government demand such realism from coastal communities, we need to demand realism from them. The evidence that hon. Members have referred to about the Thames Gateway is very clear. Again, I refer to the evidence given to the Communities and Local Government Committee by the Environment Agency, which stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/15" class="indent">&quot;1.25 million people, &pound;80bn of property and major infrastructure are already sited with the Thames Estuary floodplain. However the location, layout and design of the existing developments do not incorporate flood management measures, other than the reliance on estuary-side walls and barrier.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/16">The agency also pointed out:</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/17" class="indent">&quot;Over half of the area of the Thames Gateway lies within the floodplain of the Thames Estuary, the majority of the proposed development sites are on brownfield sites on the riverside. The area is currently protected to a high standard, often in excess of a 1:1000 year annual probability however, as a result of sea level rise and deteriorating assets the risk of flooding is likely to increase. By 2080 we expect the sea level in the Thames to rise by an average of 26cm to 86cm, with extreme surge conditions adding another 2 metres.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/18">The agency is trying to be tactful to the Government, but it could have said that the Thames Gateway development is a disaster in the making&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.97.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" name="Martin Horwood">the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase> after that extensive speech. He raised many sensible points with which I agree.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" name="Mark Simmonds">the Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds)</phrase> on securing the debate. He spoke powerfully about the threat of flooding and the issues that are converging to make the subject all the more urgent and topical at the end of 2006. I was struck during the debate by the intelligent way in which the representatives of coastal towns and communities are tackling the subject. We heard no Canute-like insistence that the tide must be turned, but a much more thoughtful analysis of the problems. The representatives and the communities on the coast are willing to engage with the Government in an intelligent way that acknowledges the force of rising sea levels, if, in turn, the Government are responsible in their actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/3">We are starting to see that coastal communities accept some degree of incursion from the sea and are willing to adapt to it. However, they will not stick at any price ministerial incompetence and mismanagement that results in cuts to budgets at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs that are totally avoidable and unnecessary. That is the point of today's debate. On the one hand, we have an intelligent thoughtful response from coastal communities, and on the other, we have unthoughtful, poor management at DEFRA that results in budget cuts to much needed services.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/4">It is not only the budget cuts at DEFRA that make the debate pertinent, but climate change as a whole. The Stern review published a couple of weeks ago brings together both the economics and the science of climate change in an unprecedented fashion and serves as a stark warning to us as a nation of communities and as an economy that we have to take action and simply cannot ignore the effects of man-made climate change. Climate change is happening, sea level rises are inevitable, and no one needs to take that on board more than coastal communities. As public policy makers, we have a duty to act decisively to prevent the most extreme impacts of man-made climate change. That requires the whole nation&mdash;the whole global community&mdash;to act together, but we must also work to adapt in our coastal areas, which will be in the front line of the effects of climate change as sea levels start, not to begin to rise, but to rise more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness graphically outlined the dangers to coastal communities along the east coast of Lincolnshire. He proved himself a champion not only of Boston and Skegness but of the whole of the east coast of England, highlighting the fact that by 2040 400,000 properties in eastern England could be at risk from coastal flooding. What is more, 15 per cent. of ambulance stations and 12 per cent. of schools and hospitals are increasingly at risk, and that could rise to one in four. He made the important point that inland flooding and sea defences must be linked&mdash;they must be treated as part of the whole. He also made an extremely good point about the severe impact that flooding could have on the huge population of mobile home residents in his part of the world, for whom flooding would be catastrophic. The water would not simply come in and then recede; it would wipe out their homes. Sound defences are an absolute prerequisite to giving peace of mind to those living in such communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/6">As well as engineered defences, there is growing acceptance of the need to work with nature, turning over parts of the land to natural incursion, creating natural wave breaks and using shoreline management plans. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1924" name="John Penrose">the Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose)</phrase> emphasised the need to preserve the amenity value of our coastlands as well as using engineered solutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" name="Anthony D Wright">The hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase> made a thoughtful speech. I was grateful for his clarification on managed retreat. He said that it would require a more flexible and imaginative use of agricultural subsidy. I have not heard of the subject being raised before&mdash;certainly not on the Floor of the House&mdash;but it will certainly bear a lot more discussion. Coastal wetlands can enhance the amenity value and ecological benefits of coastal areas, but such a policy would need to be carefully managed as part of a deliberate process rather than it being a knee-jerk reaction to the sudden flooding of productive farmland or freshwater inland waterways.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/8">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1785" name="James Duddridge">the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge)</phrase>, who is a member of the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, made a powerful speech. He spoke not only for his own constituency but for the many communities in Essex and the Thames Gateway. He drew attention to the Association of British Insurers report &quot;Coastal Flood Risk&mdash;Thinking for tomorrow, acting today&quot;, a welcome report has greatly informed our debate. I was struck by its comprehensive analysis of the flood risks that we face. It is worth noting that that report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/9" class="indent">&quot;Sea levels are already rising at a faster rate than was predicted&mdash;latest research shows a 3 cm rise in the last ten years. Latest estimates from the UK Climate Impacts Programme suggest that the East Coast could see further rises in relative sea levels of 40 cm by 2050 and 80 cm by 2080. At the same time, climate change is making it likely that storm surges will occur more frequently, and that they will be more destructive when they do.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/10">A number of Members referred to the flooding of 1953&mdash;the worst natural disaster in northern Europe for two centuries, when flood water broke through the coastal defences on the east coast in 1,200 places. That was this country's glimpse of what happened in New Orleans, but the situation could get substantially worse. What the ABI report has to say on North sea storm surges is particularly worth noting. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/11" class="indent">&quot;Although sea level rise is an important influence on coastal flood risk, storm surges (i.e. abnormally high sea levels) pose the greatest threat. Storm surges are caused by low air pressure which raises the height of the sea, combined with onshore winds which push the sea. Shallow waters, as on the continental shelf, magnify these effects; the shape of the North Sea produces a funnelling effect, concentrating the surge in a decreasing area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/12">We are all aware of what the Thames barrier does to protect London, but whole swathes of our eastern coast are unprotected by such great engineering works. It is crucial that the Government should not seem to be protecting only London; they should protect all who are vulnerable to sea flooding.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/13">I hope that the Minister will reassure the House that the gross mismanagement by DEFRA of rural payments&mdash;the single farm payment fiasco&mdash;was a one-off and that the Department is now managing its budget.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.1/1">I understand the ABI's point of view, but because of where we are in our policy process I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a clear answer. The commitment may be more than 10 per cent. or it may be less, but we certainly understand the rationale for it. Well before the next general election, we will produce robust plans that will be fully funded. There will no repeat under the next Conservative Government of the sort of fiasco that we saw at DEFRA, with knee-jerk cuts being made to vital services.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.2/1">Not in view of the time, as I need to answer the detailed comments made by the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/2">A number of hon. Members pointed out that, both on the coast and in tidal rivers, we have the key problem of the rising sea level. We recently revised our estimates of sea level rise, and we encourage operating authorities to factor it into their decisions on future defences. Those estimates recognise that relative sea level rise&mdash;including the effect of land tilt&mdash;is likely to accelerate from between 2.5 mm and 4 mm a year, depending on location, to between 13 mm and 15 mm a year by the end of the century. Clearly there are significant uncertainties, but current guidance is based on the best available science.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/3">We need to manage and adapt to that increase in risk. The coastline has always changed over time, and it will not be sustainable to try to hold the line against flooding and erosion everywhere&mdash;something that hon. Members seem to accept. We are supporting a large capital improvement programme, with many projects to reduce flood risk on the coast.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/4">I shall deal with hon. Members' comments on budget matters in a moment, but I emphasise that current projections are that we will exceed our target of reducing the risk to 100,000 households both on the coast and inland between 2005-06 and 2007-08. However, we need to look at a range of options for managing flood risk in order to make the best use of public resources and to avoid burdening future generations with the cost of maintaining unsustainable defences.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/5">The current review of shoreline management plans is intended to develop the sustainable strategic direction for each coastal length. The review also aims to look ahead over the next 100 years and to take into account climate change and the impact on sea level rise. Public consultation will be a key part of the review, which was a point raised by the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness. I can confirm that all shoreline management plans will be in the public domain and all plans should be completed by 2010&mdash;obviously some are at a more advanced stage than others.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/6">In addition to the large investment increases of recent years, we are engaged in a thorough review of policy further to develop a broad range of responses to the cross-government &quot;making space for water&quot; programme. Operating authorities will have to take some difficult decisions in cases where defence against the sea may not be sustainable in the long term. I recognise that there can be social justice issues associated with the decision-making process and we are looking at ways in which such communities can be helped to adapt to a changing climate.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/7">The Environment Agency is considering realignment possibilities and how we might promote the environmental benefits that would accrue from that&mdash;for example through our high level stewardship scheme. On the issue raised by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" name="Anthony D Wright">the Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase>, I can inform him that agri-environment funding is available at the moment to landowners who make their land available. Realignment can produce some good habitat benefits in terms in salt marshes and improvements to biodiversity. I went to Aldbrough recently, just north of the Humber, which is a great example of a management alignment scheme. By allowing occasional flooding of a thousand acres of farmland, a high level of protection is provided for people in the Humber and the Humber estuary area. At the same time, a wonderful marine environment has been created.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/8">We have just consulted on proposals for the Environment Agency to have a strategic overview of sea flooding and coastal erosion risk management. Whatever role we decide the agency should perform following that consultation, I expect it to work in close partnership with local authorities in relation to long-term planning strategies and in determining and delivering works programmes. I plan to announce conclusions on that in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/9">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness and a number of other hon. Members raised the issues in the recent ABI report. Clearly, we are well aware of the report and I would not want hon. Members to think that detailed work is not taking place on that. The Environment Agency is already looking at the key locations identified in the report. For example, as part of its Thames estuary 2100 project, the agency considered the management of flood risk in London and the Thames estuary over the next 100 years. On the Humber estuary, we are considering the agency's strategy proposals for &pound;1 billion of investment, again, over the next 100 years. I am aware of the ABI's call for more funds to be made available and recently met ABI representatives to discuss Government commitments associated with its statement of principles. I can confirm that we are on target to exceed commitments that we made to the ABI as part of the statement of principles.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-12-06a.108.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" speakername="Margaret Hodge" speakeroffice="The Minister for Industry and the Regions"  colnum="108"  time="011:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061206/halltext/61206h0005.htm#06120650000523">
	<p pid="a.108.0/1">I join other hon. Members in congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> on securing this debate. I cannot let it pass without paying enormous tribute to my hon. Friends the Members for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith) and for Alyn and Deeside (Mark Tami) on their work in supporting the aerospace industry, particularly the Airbus capacity in their constituencies. I have endless conversations with both about the present and future Airbus presence in their constituencies, and I know that they spend a lot of time visiting the Filton and Broughton Airbus bases in their patches. I congratulate them.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/2">I want to start by speaking about the aerospace industry to put the matter into context. It is a very successful industry and sales are up. The latest figures are in the annual survey covering 2005. Sales were up by 26 per cent. last year, at just under &pound;30 billion. Export sales, importantly, were around &pound;15 billion. New orders were up by 33 per cent. throughout the industry as a whole at more than &pound;30 billion. Employment was up by 9 per cent. at just under 125,000. We are now the second largest employer of people working in the aerospace industry and second only to the USA. We also have the second largest turnover in the aerospace industry after the USA. Research and development is up by 31 per cent. year on year and is now &pound;2.7 billion. The figures for productivity are good and up 15 per cent. The number of graduates now stands at 34 per cent. and wages in the UK aerospace industry are 44 per cent. above the national average at more than &pound;33,600 per annum, the manufacturing average for the UK being about &pound;25,600. It is a very healthy part of an important part of the manufacturing sector in the UK economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/3">I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Northavon that Airbus is a success story. I did not recognise his figures and if I am wrong, I will write to him. The figures that I have for launch investment are in the region of &pound;1.2 billion and the return has been around &pound;1.3 billion, of which &pound;530 million went into the A380 and &pound;700 million into the A320, the A330 and the A340. The Government and taxpayers are getting a good return on that investment, which demonstrates the success of those Airbus projects. Airbus is now the ninth biggest company in the UK, so it is a substantial presence here. Not only have we invested money in launch investment, but we have recently put around &pound;250 million into Rolls-Royce to develop its Trent 900 engine, which will be used in the A380. According to figures given to us by Airbus, about 40 per cent. of the total value of the A380 will be produced directly in the UK and around 400 UK companies will benefit directly or indirectly from the development of the new aeroplane. While we, like the hon. Gentleman, regret that that is being delayed, I agree that the long-term prospects for the plane look good. As he has done, I welcome the recent news that Qantas has added to its order for a number of A380s.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/4">Like the hon. Gentleman, I also welcome last week's announcement that Airbus intends to go ahead with the A350 Xtra Wide Body plane. Composite technology is being developed, particularly in relation to the wings, which are of special interest to the UK. That is crucial, not just for the aerospace industry or for ensuring that more environmentally friendly aeroplanes are built&mdash;composite technology, on the whole, ought to lead to lighter and therefore more environmentally friendly aircraft&mdash;but because composite technology, of itself, has huge repercussions across all sectors of manufacturing. We take it seriously, which is why we are investing, out of our technology strategy, the hefty sum of &pound;30 million in a national composites network. We see that as a key element for future investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/5">We welcome the announcement that I mentioned. Clearly, we are in discussions to ensure that the UK gets its fair share, particularly in respect of the development of the wing technology and the production of the wings. It makes sense for those two things to be developed together in the UK, as the technology cannot be divorced from the production. The long-term development of that technology has repercussions not just for civil aircraft, but for defence aerospace capacity in the UK. We are giving that extensive thought.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/6">The hon. Gentleman asked me a number of questions, including what the Secretary of State had agreed with EADS on the position of Airbus following the sale by BAE Systems of its shares. An agreement was reached in principle in Farnborough on a number of issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/7">The first such issue was whether a transfer of undertakings was given to BAE Systems by EADS when Airbus was first created. Those undertakings have now transferred to the UK Government. There is no time limit on them, and they will clearly be subject to commercial good sense over time, but a clear commitment was made by EADS to transfer those undertakings.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/8">The other commitments in principle, which we are now discussing in detail with EADS, include a transparency mechanism in the decision making of EADS, so that we can ensure that everything that is done is fairly open. We also agreed in principle to establish a research and development centre in the UK for EADS, and we are pursuing the details of that. Another such agreement was for a UK national&mdash;not a Government appointee&mdash;to sit on the EADS board, which we thought was important, given the sale of the shares by BAE Systems. We also secured from EADS a commitment to consider giving secondary listing on the London stock exchange.</p>

I shall try to get in as many Members as possible, and I hope that they bear my request in mind when making interventions.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-12-06a.118.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1675" speakername="Peter Soulsby" colnum="118"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061206/halltext/61206h0007.htm#06120650000547">
	<p pid="a.118.1/1">It is inevitable that those canals that are less used, as well as those that are in line for further investment and regeneration, will suffer first, as British Waterways prioritises where it will be able to make cuts with the least effect on its current users.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.1/2">As promised, I shall say something about the Minister could do about the situation. British Waterways will want to minimise the effect of cuts and to preserve as much as it can. We all remember the dereliction and disrepair of the mid and late 20th century. However, unless the Minister and his colleagues take some action, potential developers will inevitably be nervous, if they fear that the canal next to, say, a block of flats that they plan to build is likely to be drained and become a muddy ditch in the next five years. I expect that the Minister will remind us of the investment that has already been made and the support that the Government have given. He will undoubtedly want to make the case that there is little that his Department can do about the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.1/3">However, I hope that the Minister will say that he will talk to his ministerial colleagues, because the responsibility falls across Government, not just on one Department. I particularly hope that he will enlist the support of my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, to whom I referred earlier as a champion of the waterways. I hope that the Minister will also enlist the support of the Treasury, which, with his Department, can find solutions to the funding problems of British Waterways. British Waterways is a national treasure. It has a unique importance in our history and plays an invaluable part in our life today. What is needed is a solution across Government, to preserve the place of that national treasure in our life. I hope that the Minister will agree to talk with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasury and work with them to deliver a review of the funding mechanisms for British Waterways that will secure a way out of the immediate crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.1/4">One approach would be to give British Waterways a status that permits it to make full use of its assets, without having to rely on the partnerships that are such an essential part of its current fundraising mechanisms and which it has used so creatively. I do not suggest for a moment that British Waterways should leave the public sector: it belongs in the public sector and it should remain there. However, it could certainly be permitted to use its expertise to invest in property beside waterways other than its own, or to borrow commercially using its own property. Above all else, British Waterways could benefit from a clear long-term contract across Departments, rather than being expected to meet the objectives of many Departments while its funding is dependent on a single Department that has short-term and of whose core business it is not really a part.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.1/5">Whether we are waterside developers, walkers, canoeists, anglers, historians, ecologists or merely people who love our canals and rivers, we need to be reassured that the Government's enormous achievements will not be lost. Whatever the cause of DEFRA's immediate financial crisis, British Waterways&mdash;that priceless national asset&mdash;and the inland waterways that it has so ably and creatively cared for, nurtured and developed are far too important to be allowed to return to decline. Confidence in the future must not be lost. Our waterways must not be permitted to fall back into decay. The Government as a whole must find a solution.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1675" name="Peter Soulsby">the Member for Leicester, South (Sir Peter Soulsby)</phrase> on securing this important and timely debate. I particularly want to draw attention to my local canal&mdash;the Caldon canal&mdash;which is a small, local canal that feeds into the Trent and Mersey canal. It does not have the same status as canals that create a route through to the national canal network, so it is far more vulnerable. It has already suffered because it has not had the same level of maintenance as other canals. The cuts this year, and, just as importantly, the long-term potential cuts to the funding of British Waterways, create a tremendous threat to the survival of such canals.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/2">In the early 1960s, the canal was in a derelict state. Volunteers from the local Caldon Canal Society put in hours of work and lots of fundraising to put it back into operation, and it was reopened in 1974. Within living memory, therefore, we have seen the canal return from dereliction. That has brought huge economic, recreational, sporting and social benefits to my constituency, which has seen the decline of the textile industry, small engineering firms and farming, and where tourism is therefore a vital area of expansion. If more maintenance is denied to the Caldon, key structures, such as dams and embankments, could collapse. As a result, the canal could become derelict, which would have a devastating impact on the local economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/3">During the outbreak of foot and mouth, many areas of my constituency were denied to walkers, and that had a real impact on the local economy. Understandably, a lot of people talk about the 29,000 boat owners, but I do not want to make a point about boaters, because, to some extent, they are the tip of the iceberg. Let us talk about the walkers, bird watchers, canoeists, cyclists and people who just enjoy living by the canal. Let us talk about the impact on local businesses, such as the public houses, restaurants and boating establishments that would be affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/4">My local area in Leek does not make enough of the canal. There were no signs from the industrial estate where the canal comes to an end to demonstrate to boaters and others who use the canal that the lovely town of Leek is just down the road, offering supermarkets, pubs and restaurants. The local Uttoxeter canal group, however, has an ambitious plan to open up the whole Leek arm of the canal, which would bring huge benefits. Sometimes, the towpath can be impassable, because certain areas get very muddy. However, it is still regularly used, and if we want to cut some of the congestion locally around the Britannia building society&mdash;a big national mutual building society that is known to many people&mdash;the towpath should be used for cycling; that part of it should be opened up, not closed down.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/5">The Leek canal, however, is now likely to turn into a stagnant, dirty ditch. It will not be something that people want to live beside, but something that they want to avoid. It is important that such canals are regularly dredged; otherwise, a canal as valuable as the Caldon could end up being deprived of traffic. The local Beatrice boat organisation puts on trips for special needs children in a specially adapted boat. Its members fear that if the dredging does not take place, they will no longer be able to operate the boat. That would be not only sad, but criminal, because the children look forward to those trips.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/6">The Government's agenda is all about regeneration, improving the environment and encouraging healthy lifestyles and exercise, and the waterways press all those buttons. As I said, the local canal society is investigating developing the local canal in Leek to ensure that it will be the sort of recreational hot spot that it should be. The canal runs alongside the local heritage railway through a beautiful valley.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/7">I therefore want the Minister to tell us today that he will rethink the cuts for this year. Probably just as importantly, however, we should draw back from the brink of even more damaging cuts in the long term. To some extent, the canals could sustain cuts for one year, but a lower level of funding in future years would be absolutely disastrous; it would turn back the clock many decades and, in some cases, more than 50 years. I therefore hope that DEFRA and Ministers in other Departments will come to the aid of our canals.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1675" name="Peter Soulsby">the Member for Leicester, South (Sir Peter Soulsby)</phrase> and congratulate him on securing this debate. Reference has already been made to the impact that the regeneration of the canals has had on our urban areas. If Birmingham and Manchester are held up as being among the greatest regeneration achievements of the 21st century, surely the clearest logic tells us that we should protect, maintain and improve our canal system for future generations. That is the crux of my argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/2">After 40 years of inaction and abandonment, the canal system was in a dire condition. Yet after only a few years of an organised, well targeted and&mdash;crucially&mdash;funded approach, the change has been remarkable. Is it common sense to cut funding in spite of such progress? No, it is not. Cuts have already not only threatened but had an impact on the British Waterways winter programme of refurbishment and maintenance on Ashby canal, the Birmingham canal navigations, Birmingham and Fazeley canal, Grand Union canal, Kennet and Avon canal, Leeds and Liverpool canal, Peak Forest canal, Ribble link, Rochdale canal, the River Severn, which is close to my constituency and that of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, the River Trent and the Weaver navigation. About &pound;5.5 million has already been cut from the winter programme, and that will continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/3">Is it common sense to cut the budget in the middle of the financial year? I liken that to a football manager being forced by his chairman to play the second half of the season with only seven or eight men. That is not common sense. Reference has been made to the status of British Waterways&mdash;whether it should be public or private, and whether it should review its status, which might enable it to borrow against its capital assets. I shall deal with that by referring to the report on British Waterways by what at the time was the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It stated that British Waterways</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/4" class="indent">&quot;has to maintain a 200-year-old canal system in a safe condition. This outstanding heritage from the first industrial revolution has many fine listed structures which are expensive to keep in good repair. Indeed the whole canal network is part of the nation's heritage and many canals are themselves listed. British Waterways also has extensive environmental responsibilities, including over 60 sites of special scientific interest (SSSI) and hundreds of conservation areas and areas of special landscape character. Given the history of the system, it is unlikely that the Board can ever run its affairs on a wholly commercial basis. It is therefore inevitable that British Waterways will continue to rely on public funds for a significant proportion of its annual turnover.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/5">I guess that that view and judgment are supported by many hon. Members in this Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/6">I can only add my views to those already expressed by hon. Members. I ask DEFRA to look again at the issue&mdash;please. Perhaps the cuts, having been imposed this year, are not going to be wound back. Some of us might not be happy about that, but we can understand it. But for God's sake, do not let us get ourselves into a downward spiral in which the new reduced base budget of grant aid to British Waterways becomes the base for further cuts next year and in consecutive years. We would then end up with huge cuts in the totality of the British Waterways budget and that would be extremely detrimental. DEFRA, please think again on this one.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-12-06a.132.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1679" speakername="Bill Wiggin" colnum="132"  time="015:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061206/halltext/61206h0009.htm#06120650000571">
	<p pid="a.132.0/1">I think that my hon. Friend would be very surprised if I did not agree with him. He is absolutely right and makes an important point.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/2">If the Government still doubt the strong feeling against the cuts, I hope that they will pay particular attention to the flotilla that is planned to pass by Parliament in January. It is easy to think that the Government are completely out of touch with the public and canal users on this matter. While the Government seem to want to claim that the cuts will be harmless and will not have any dramatic or noticeable impacts, the truth seems somewhat different. When questioned about the cuts, Lord Rooker claimed:</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/3" class="indent">&quot;I don't think it will lead to the cutting of British Waterway's programme of work.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/4">However, a briefing note on the cuts provided by British Waterways states:</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The possible sources of funding to balance the budget are: cuts in revenue expenditure such as core waterway maintenance and administration expenses, cuts in major works expenditure, and increases in income.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/6">So, who told Lord Rooker that the programme of work would be unaffected?</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/7">Furthermore, Tony Hales, the chairman of British Waterways, has stated</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Defra's cuts, not just the amount but their suddenness for reasons that have nothing to do with the waterways, clearly cause us problems. They could threaten the long-term stability of the system and our vision to expand it, unless strong action is taken.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/9">What strong action is being taken? We have the Under-Secretary of State bravely stepping up to the plate and stating:</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/10" class="indent">&quot;The Government are working with British Waterways...to minimise the impact of the current restructuring.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-11-07.1067"><i>Official Report</i>, 7 November 2006; Vol. 451, c. 1067W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/11">Perhaps when the Minister responds to the debate, he will be able to elaborate on what has been discussed and planned in the new budget that, as Lord Rooker claimed, will not lead to a cutting of British Waterway's programme of work. The Under-Secretary has also claimed that one of the reasons for the cuts at British Waterways was that it was &quot;good financial management.&quot; He stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/12" class="indent">&quot;As a matter of good financial management, DEFRA keeps its budgets and spending under regular review and challenge, and adjusts them as new pressures and demands arise.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-11-07.1068"><i>Official Report</i>, 7 November 2006; Vol. 451, c. 1068W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/13">I am sure that hon. Members will disagree with him; good financial management does not involve cutting millions from budgets at short notice and creating difficult financial challenges for others to respond to. That is challenging, yes, perhaps testing, but hardly good financial management.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/14">Moreover, a substantial proportion of DEFRA's financial problems are the result of its incompetent handling of the Rural Payments Agency. That is frustrating for those affected, not least because it could have been avoided. I must draw to the attention of the Chamber that I received &pound;49 in a single farm payment. If the then Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, now the Foreign Secretary, had bothered to listen to and act on the criticism levelled at the RPA and DEFRA by people such as myself, we could have been debating British Waterways' successes instead of budget cuts.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-12-06a.133.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1679" speakername="Bill Wiggin" colnum="133"  time="015:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061206/halltext/61206h0009.htm#06120650000573">
	<p pid="a.133.1/1">I am grateful for that intervention, but I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman is quite right. We will wait and see what the Minister has to say in his response. According to British Waterways' spokesman:</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/2" class="indent">&quot;The network is in the best shape it has been for 150 years, but that is now at risk.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/3">He went on to state that British Waterways was being penalised for DEFRA's incompetence, which is rather contrary to what the hon. Member for Leicester, South suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/4">I hope that when the Minister responds, he will be able to explain why British Waterways, the work that it does and the 180 workers who will be made redundant have to suffer because of DEFRA's failings elsewhere. I would also be grateful if the Minister is any closer to explaining the reasons for the cuts. We understand that DEFRA needs to save &pound;200 million from this year's budget, but during oral questions the other week the Minister was able to account for only &pound;33 million&mdash;DEFRA must save &pound;10 million for bird flu, which we in the Conservative party understand is important, and &pound;23 million on the RPA for the single farm payment fiasco. That leaves &pound;167 million unaccounted for, and it would be helpful if the Minister could explain the reasons for the cut. The only explanation given at the time&mdash;he said it himself&mdash;was:</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/5" class="indent">&quot;The rest is needed for other reasons&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-11-02.455"><i>Official Report</i>, 2 November 2006; Vol. 451, c. 455</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/6">On top of the cuts to British Waterways, the maintenance of our waterways and canals is also threatened by the &pound;27.7 million cut to the Environment Agency's budget. The network of waterways that was once built to support our industrial growth is now used to support our tourism and leisure industries and was fast becoming a valuable asset for communities, jobs and homes. However, while all those benefits are under threat, we discover that there has been a lack of joined-up government in trying to manage the situation, as has been mentioned. Last month, in a written answer, the Under-Secretary stated that he had had no discussions with his ministerial colleagues specifically about the funding reductions for British Waterways or their impact on the environment, the economy and regeneration. When we consider how much regeneration and investment is involved, it is improper that the impact of those cuts has not been discussed with ministerial colleagues in other Departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/7">With so many potential benefits at stake, I am somewhat saddened. I wonder why the Government are jeopardising them by cutting British Waterways' budget for this year and planning further cuts that will amount to between &pound;50 million and &pound;60 million over the next five years. Is it not odd that the Under-Secretary should have confirmed that he and his colleagues have not discussed the British Waterways cuts with the Chancellor? I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to explain why. Should the cuts continue, waterways will have to be closed, vital maintenance postponed or cancelled, and regeneration projects halted. I am sad to close by reporting that the Rochdale, Peak Forest and Ashton canals now face cuts in their works programme and that, as a result, closure may be on the cards.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1675" name="Peter Soulsby">the Member for Leicester, South (Sir Peter Soulsby)</phrase> on securing this debate. The high attendance&mdash;in my experience, it is exceptional&mdash;shows that it is a matter of great interest not only to those who use our inland waterways but to all who are involved in their restoration and heritage. I pay special tribute to my hon. Friend for the excellent progress that British Waterways made while he was a member of its board.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/2">The Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is sorry not to be here to answer the debate. He is attending an event with the Prince of Wales and the Prime Minister in connection with his biodiversity responsibilities. If hon. Members will allow me, I shall ask him to respond in writing to the specific and individual constituency concerns raised during the debate. As Minister with responsibility for waterways, my hon. Friend has seen how much British Waterways has achieved in the last 10 years and the tremendous contribution it has made to stimulating regeneration and delivering benefits to the public in general. He and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State have held a number of meetings with British Waterways' chairman and chief executive in the past weeks and months to discuss the funding situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/3">A number of hon. Members have fallen for the misapprehension that the funding challenges faced by DEFRA are all due to the single farm payment and the Rural Payments Agency. As my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South rightly said, it is only a small proportion of the &pound;200 million&mdash;approximately 11 per cent.&mdash;that we have to save this year. It is not quite true to say that it is all the result of the single farm payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/4">The in-year reduction for British Waterways was 7 per cent., not the figure suggested by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1679" name="Bill Wiggin">the hon. Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin)</phrase>, and considerably less than the reduction that we asked of the core Department and the other parts of the DEFRA family. Those reductions have averaged between 10 per cent. and 15 per cent, but we made efforts to protect British Waterways. It is also right, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South said, that the reductions should be seen in the overall context of British Waterways' turnover of &pound;190 million and the massively increased investment in British Waterways over the past 10 years. Its income has risen by 200 per cent. in that period; I doubt whether many organisations have seen such an increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/5">Like hon. Members, however, the Government do not wish to see that wonderful track record and those improvements and achievements undermined. Indeed, that record was acknowledged by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase>, who is no longer in his place, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1537" name="Michael Ancram">the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram)</phrase>. Although I cannot give hon. Members the assurances that they seek on budgets for 2007-08 and beyond into the 2007 comprehensive spending review period, I assure the House that we are actively working with the management of British Waterways to ensure that its funding is sustainable. Some of the figures that my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South suggested for possible cuts are, as far as I know, pretty speculative and do not bear much relation to the figures that I have heard being discussed within the Department and with British Waterways.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.1/1">No; that is a matter for British Waterways. It is not for the Government or Ministers to dictate its priorities within its resource allocations. It is up to British Waterways to decide how best to apportion its budget in relation to its activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/2">I welcome the fact that British Waterways is taking a positive approach to its funding and to putting its budget and finances on a firm footing. The Department is waiting for its proposals for a long-term agreement on funding. We hope that it will be based on a realistic assumption of the likely funding levels. Many hon. Members were in the Chamber earlier for the pre-Budget report. They will have heard that a number of Departments are going to face stringent spending restrictions and that some will face flat cash cuts in the next comprehensive spending review settlement. The massive growth in public spending of the past few years will therefore be maintained, but not to the same level as in the past few years. We hope that our agreement with British Waterways will give it greater financial security, provide it with funding certainty, allow it to plan with confidence, and make it less dependent on Government subsidy.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/3">I shall respond to some of the constructive and positive points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" name="Roger Williams">the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase>. Although we acknowledge that British Waterways has made tremendous progress in recent years by becoming more self-sufficient, it needs to continue along that path. I am mindful of what my hon. Friend said about the need to consider the statutory constraints. Last year, British Waterways earned slightly less than &pound;100 million through trading. That was the highest ever figure, and it accounted for more than half of its total income. British Waterways' income has tripled over the past seven years. The rest of its income derived from Government grants and third-party contributions. We think that it still has considerable potential to increase its income&mdash;for example, it still sits on considerable assets, and we believe that it can better exploit their potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/4">With the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South in mind, I shall ask for the statutory constraints on British Waterways to be reconsidered. I can tell him that British Waterways is actively exploring with the Cabinet Office whether its development powers might be widened under the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.1/1">I have not had such discussions, but Ministers in all Departments speak to their Treasury colleagues regularly on all funding matters. I cannot speak for my colleagues or for the Secretary of State on whether British Waterways has been mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South and other hon. Members also mentioned British Waterways' place within Government. My hon. Friend was right to say that British Waterways, as part of our heritage, could fit into a number of Departments, but I ask him to be slightly cautious about assuming that, were it to come under another Department, everything would suddenly be much rosier&mdash;not least because of the spending restraints on other Departments as a result of the next comprehensive spending review settlement. I also point to DEFRA's having delivered a record increase in funding for British Waterways while my hon. Friend was its vice-chairman. DEFRA's record is honourable and people should not assume that if British Waterways were to come under the remit of another Department&mdash;assuming that another Department wanted it&mdash;it would fare any better.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" name="Michael Wills">the Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills)</phrase> on securing the debate. In the customary way, he has raised an important issue. I certainly thank him for the opportunity to consider the HSE's dealings with his constituent, Mr. Burr, in improving safety for the public and, in particular, children at Roves Farm visitor centre. I shall draw some general conclusions from that case and deal with each in turn. None the less, I regret that the issues have had to be raised in this Adjournment debate, as I believe that in the past months other routes could have been taken to reach a solution in this case.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/2">My hon. Friend spent time highlighting the background to the Burr case. Perhaps I can add some information. As he said, Mr. Burr and his wife operate a visitor centre at the farm site. Many children attend the visitor centre every year, so it is important that health and safety is properly managed at the farm. The HSE aims to ensure that children can have maximum fun and learning at the farm in sensibly managed conditions. The HSE regulates many farms and visitor centres and uses a range of tools&mdash;such as verbal advice, a written report done on site or a letter sent after the visit&mdash;to ensure that an appropriate standard of health and safety is adhered to. When necessary, inspectors use their powers to require specific improvements or to stop activities until they are made safe through an improvement or prohibition notice. Appeals against such notices are rare.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/3">Since Roves farm set up a visitor centre, the HSE, as my hon. Friend's remarks suggested, has had to serve an unusually high number of notices to get work carried out to secure the health and safety of visitors and employees. I can assure my hon. Friend that that is not a typical regulatory response by the HSE when regulating a farm. I regret to add that the HSE's experience since 2003 has been that inspectors have not always met with a positive response from Mr. Burr. They have given advice, usually written as well as verbal, but sadly their experience is that Mr. Burr does not deal well with issues when given informal advice and they have previously needed to serve three notices to make progress and get deficiencies remedied.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/4">I think that my hon. Friend suggested that in some way the HSE rushed to a conclusion and rushed to a prohibition notice on the maze. I shall take hon. Members through the time scale. In December 2004, two inspectors became seriously concerned about the risk to visitors, especially children, to Roves Farm visitor centre using the straw bale maze. They spoke to Mr. Burr, suggesting that he should, as the law requires him to do, carry out a formal risk assessment, so that they could have a discussion about whether there was proper management of risks well before the summer season of 2005. They asked Mr. Burr to contact them to confirm when the work had been done.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/5">By early summer 2005, Mr. Burr had not responded, and as far as the HSE was concerned he had not taken any action. Inspectors then sought the advice of experts from within the HSE and from the fire brigade. Those experts visited the farm in July 2005 and confirmed that, in their opinion, there were serious deficiencies in fire prevention, fire escape, fire alarm and fire fighting measures in connection with the maze&mdash;in essence, they said that there was a significant risk of a fire starting in the straw bale maze. The design of the maze, as my hon. Friend has said, was an interesting one. However, the design made it foreseeable that, in the event of a fire, a child could be trapped in a smoke-filled tunnel, unable to find an exit.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/6">I want to put on record the issues that the prohibition notice was meant to address. The bale maze was constructed of compressed large straw-bales, which had been assembled to provide a three-dimensional complex of narrow tunnels. The tunnels were unlit, and extended over an area of more than 19 m by 10 m. They were 3.75 meters deep, and the floors were covered in a fine layer of crushed straw that varied in depth but was at least 2 cm deep. Some of the tunnels were 19 m long. At any one time there could be more than 25 children, from pre-school age upwards, using the maze. The notice indicated that there was poor control over sources of ignition within the maze area. Dry straw on the floors of the tunnels was likely to transmit fire and smoke rapidly. There were poor arrangements for detecting a fire and there was no means of raising an alarm inside the maze. Escape from the maze was only possible from one side via the pre-existing tunnels, and no provision was made for fire escape or recovery of casualties. The means of raising the alarm was by blowing a whistle, but at the time of the HSE's inspection the whistle was missing. The alarm was tested under silent conditions and was heard faintly from within the stack only after 18 soundings, which in the HSE's opinion was unsatisfactory. The evacuation system was inadequate. A test evacuation had been made and it took approximately 10 minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/7">As I said, it was foreseeable that in the event of a fire, a child could be trapped in a smoke-filled tunnel unable to find an exit and would not be likely to be rescued before he or she succumbed to fumes or flames. In fact, the experts&mdash;not only the HSE inspectors but the fire brigade as well&mdash;advised that there was a serious risk of multiple fatalities should a fire occur. I also want to put on record that the prohibition notice was affirmed by the tribunal without modification.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.1/1">I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Hancock, for this short but important debate. I am grateful to be allowed to raise this important subject in the Chamber today and I am indebted to the Professional Contractors Group for bringing the matter to my attention and for its helpful briefings.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/2">I want to start with an apology to the Minister for the confusion over the title of this debate. This is the first time that I have been successful in securing a Westminster Hall debate and I am still struggling to understand how my original title, &quot;Contractual security and protection for people who work via a contract for services (freelancers, contractors, consultants)&quot;, became transformed into &quot;Security of short term employment contracts&quot;. However it happened and whoever's good intention it was to shorten and simplify the title, the error illustrates one of the key points that I want to make today.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/3">The people for whom I am speaking today are literally the &quot;little guys&quot; of business. I emphasise that they are not employees; they are self-employed contractors. They are the people whom companies call in when they need expertise for a specific, short-term reason, and they become confused with employees by courts and legislators who misguidedly try to protect or hamper their activities. Today, I hope to achieve four objectives: first, recognition by the Minister that common law developments have created commercial uncertainty, and that that is economically damaging; secondly, an acknowledgment by the Minister that Government action is desirable to clarify common law uncertainty; thirdly, a comment from the Minister on the recent Green Paper and an indication of the Government's position; and finally, a commitment from the Government to maintain the UK's traditional freedoms and certainties, and not to allow employment rights to intrude into commercial relationships.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/4">I shall begin by explaining why it is so important that the division between professional contractors and employees is properly clarified and enshrined in law. There are basically two types of contractual relationship: employment contracts and commercial contracts. The distinction is often expressed in terms of contracts &quot;of service&quot;, which cover employment, and contracts &quot;for services&quot;, which are commercial. In other words, &quot;contractors&quot; in this context operate via commercial contracts or contracts for services. If people enter into such a commercial relationship as a professional and career choice, it is enormously beneficial to the UK economy. Contracting works to the advantage of the company and the contractor. The company receives specialist expertise for as long as it needs it. If the contractor does not deliver the goods, they can be dispensed with without the worry of employment protection legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/5">The contractor, by taking on the economic risk&mdash;that is, by absolving the employer from employer risk and providing only what is needed when it is needed&mdash;can charge a premium for their services. They generally have more flexibility about when and where they work; they are contracted to complete a job and are generally left to get on with it. The relationship is also good for the organisation's employees. It is much easier to extend employee rights when not all the work force will be utilising them. As soon as a professional contractor starts being treated as an employee, the benefits to all cease.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/6">My first request is for a recognition from the Minister that common law developments have created commercial uncertainty, and that that may be commercially damaging. I want to bring two cases to his attention: Dacas <i>v.</i> Brook Street and Cable and Wireless <i>v.</i> Muscat.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/7">In Dacas <i>v.</i> Brook Street, a Mrs. Dacas attempted to claim unfair dismissal by the agency that she worked for at the time. She failed, but the Court of Appeal judges said that she had almost certainly been employed not by Brook Street, the agency, but by the end client, Wandsworth borough council. In Cable and Wireless <i>v.</i> Muscat, a Mr. Muscat was found to be an employee of Cable and Wireless, despite the fact that he was providing services via a limited company. The judges decided that it was &quot;necessary&quot; to find an employment relationship to make sense of what was happening!</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/8">The logic behind those decisions was presumably that they were cases of &quot;disguised employment&quot;&mdash;that the person involved was working in the manner of an employee, although formally working via a commercial contract. Employment rights were therefore pinned on the end client. That logic is fair enough as far as it goes, but it is totally unclear how it applies to other working relationships. Mrs. Dacas was not an employee when she started working for Wandsworth borough council, so when and how did she become one, and when would that apply to other agency workers?</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/9">Mr. Muscat had previously been an employee of Cable and Wireless, but what exactly made it &quot;necessary&quot; to find an employment relationship? In what circumstances would other workers be found to be employees in a similar way? Your guess, Mr. Hancock, is as good as mine.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/10">What is clear is that those cases have created great commercial uncertainty. Companies are hesitating to take on contractors, and many terminate their contracts after 48 weeks, despite the fact that the work is not completed. The damaging aspect for all parties does not need spelling out, and there are damaging knock-on effects for the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/11">My second request is for an acknowledgment that Government action is necessary to clarify common law uncertainty. The Government's strategy paper on success at work, which was published earlier this year, contained many sensible observations about the UK's labour market, and many in business were pleased that there were no recommendations to change the fundamentals of employment status and relations. However, the Government have perhaps been unlucky in their timing. The consultation exercise started in 2002, and the Muscat and Dacas cases have arisen since then.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/12">We need to restore clarity in the law. How the Government do that is clearly up to them, but one option is to enshrine the key common law tests for employment in statute. I am hardly a fan of legislation and regulation, but that would be beneficial because it would require companies to use genuine commercial terms in their contracts or to hire an employee, whichever is the most appropriate in the circumstances. The tendency for a company to try to get the best of both worlds and to create a disguised employment relationship would be over.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/13">I recognise that, if there is to be clarification, there is a balance to be struck between allowing individuals the continued freedom to choose to work through service contracts and ensuring that any changes that define their work as a service contract and not an employment contract are not detrimental to vulnerable, low-paid workers. Low-paid workers operating on service contracts rather than employment contracts may find themselves trapped in a revolving door of moving from one short-term, low-paid piece of work to another without any employment protection. That balance would remove the confusion and the opportunity for obfuscation, and would make redundant the iniquitous and unpopular IR35 and other measures, such as the proposals regarding managed service companies announced by the Chancellor earlier today. It would dispense with a deeply unpopular regulatory burden, which is something that we all want.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/14">My third aim is to ask for a comment on the recent Green Paper, &quot;Modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century&quot;, which was published by the European Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-22">22 November</phrase>. Not to mince words, Mr. Hancock, it is a pig's breakfast. It fails to recognise the fundamental difference between the two types of contractual relationship&mdash;employment contracts and commercial contracts. As a result, it discusses some commercial freelance and self-employment relationships as if they were commercial relationships.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/15">The Green Paper has a theme of &quot;flexicurity&quot;, but what it means by that is ill-defined. Of course there has to be a balance between flexibility and security, but surely that should be achieved by using commercial and employment contracts appropriately, not by trying to lump the two sets of law together. There is a worry among self-employed people that any law based on this muddled thinking could prevent them from going about their legitimate business. The Green Paper has other items of concern, as well as good aspects in the attempt to protect vulnerable workers, but for the independent contractor that is the main one.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/16">Finally, I am seeking a commitment from the Minister that the UK's traditional contractual freedoms and certainties will be maintained, and that employment rights will not be allowed to intrude into commercial relationships. In June, the International Labour Organisation passed a recommendation that labour law should not be allowed to interfere in commercial relationships. That represents a recognition that many of the newer ways of working rest on legitimate commercial relationships and should not be subject to law intended to regulate employment relationships. So, do the Government agree that that is a sensible approach to the issue? Do they regret that the Green Paper does not proceed on that basis?</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/17">None of this is suggesting that well-targeted measures of protection for vulnerable workers are a bad thing&mdash;of course it is right that such people should be protected&mdash;but all freelancers and self-employed professionals are asking is to be allowed to continue going about their business unimpeded, and to continue to provide the invaluable contribution that they make to the companies and the economy of this country.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.0/1">It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair this afternoon, Mr. Hancock. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1823" name="Lorely Burt">the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt)</phrase> on giving us the opportunity to debate this issue. The confusion over the title of her debate has put me at a slight disadvantage in that I am not able to answer all the points that she raised. I shall cover one or two of them, and I undertake to write to her in response to the others as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/2">The hon. Lady referred to the Green Paper on labour law recently published by the European Commission. We hope that it will stimulate an open debate on how labour law impacts on labour market flexibility, and that it will promote employment and facilitate new ways of working. We need to encourage the widest possible participation in the labour market with a framework of fairness and openness. Unemployment remains one of Europe's key social challenges, and there is a need to address labour market performance if Europe is to meet the Lisbon employment target of 70 per cent. by 2010. We believe that flexibility is needed to achieve that. Business needs flexibility to create jobs, and people need it to come into the work force on terms that allow them to balance work and family life.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/3">I hear that the hon. Lady is not very happy with the document, but it is a Green Paper and we have four months to ensure that we put forward the UK's position as effectively and forcefully as possible. We would be pleased to receive observations and contributions from her and her colleagues, because we want to ensure that we put forward as consensual and as strong a UK position as possible. We believe that we have a good message to tell in Europe and we want to ensure that the Commission hears it as clearly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/4">We agree that genuinely self-employed people do not have a contract of employment with whoever they are working for; they usually charge a fee, pay their own tax and have their own business in their own right. In effect, such people are their own boss, but they are not without protections. They are covered by discrimination legislation and they are entitled by law to work in an appropriate health and safety environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/5">The hon. Lady referred to &quot;Success at Work: Protecting Vulnerable Workers, Supporting Good Employers&quot;, in which we announced that we did not intend to change the current legal framework. We are developing a tool to help people understand their employment status at present, including in respect of common law. I will write to her more fully on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/6">The foundation of the UK's success has been a strong and stable economy, providing a platform for business to innovate, invest and grow. That has benefited individuals as well; some 2.5 million more people are in work now than in 1997. In common with all developed nations, the UK is facing a global economic challenge. Rising to that challenge does not mean a race to the bottom. The UK cannot compete on low-cost, low-skilled, unprotected labour.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/7">Labour market flexibility is an essential part of our response to globalisation, and to be competitive we must pursue policies designed to promote jobs and growth. Our approach is based on the idea that social justice and a strong economy go hand in hand. To that end, we have improved the quality of work by establishing decent minimum standards and tackling unfairness. We made a clear policy statement about our future intentions in this area in &quot;Success at Work&quot;, which was published earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/8">Our focus is on protecting the most vulnerable workers&mdash;those who are most likely to suffer mistreatment and not get the rights to which they are entitled. However, this is also about striking the right balance between giving rights to individuals and allowing business to continue to operate productively and profitability. We will therefore continue our targeted approach to enforcement. A second campaign is under way targeting non-compliance with the national minimum wage, this time in the child care sector. I am sure that the hon. Lady heard the Chancellor announce increased resources for the enforcement regime in his pre-Budget report statement in the Chamber today.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/9">Short-term contracts, which may be via a personal contract for services or a contract of employment, are by their nature for a fixed term. People on short-term contracts will range from the highly-skilled and highly-paid to those with lower levels of skills and pay. Working on short-term contracts may be a positive choice for some, although for others it might be their only option.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/10">Temporary workers in the UK comprise an important but relatively small part of the work force. In total, around 5.5 per cent. of workers are in temporary work, accounting for a smaller share of total employment in the UK than such workers do in many other European countries. Temporary jobs remain a popular choice for some. The proportion of people in temporary jobs who said they could not find a permanent job has fallen from more than two fifths in the mid 1990s to one quarter now. Some 52 per cent. of temporary workers choose temping for positive reasons, such as increased flexibility, better pay or gaining valuable work experience.</p>
