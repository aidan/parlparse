	<p pid="b.197.2/1">Being officially &quot;incapable&quot; corrodes the confidence and aspirations of the toughest. In Nottingham, 30,000 individuals feel like that every day. We can now do something about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/2">Some 18 weeks ago, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions wrote to me, as he did to many, to let me know that I was one of 100 MPs who have among the highest number of incapacity benefit claimants in their constituencies and what the Government proposed in their Green Paper. I am sure that he wrote also to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1746" name="John Heppell">my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, East(Mr. Heppell)</phrase>. My hon. Friend is here today, but his Whip's duties prevent him from speaking. However, I know that he feels strongly about getting people off incapacity benefit, as does <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1748" name="Alan Simpson">my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/3">As the chair of One Nottingham, our revived local strategic partnership, I know that it is keen to seize the opportunities to be offered by the Green Paper. Individual partners in my city have already done some tremendous work. The city council, Jobcentre Plus, the greater Nottingham partnership, the learning and skills council, the voluntary sector and many others have introduced innovative and important projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/4">Those partners and others need to build on that work, taking their efforts to the level necessary to meet the magnitude of the challenge to be set by the Government, doing so not from a bureaucratic perspective but from the perspective of the incapacity benefit claimant. We are doing so in close co-operation with the skills board, one of the five theme partnerships that work closely with One Nottingham. With the lowest rate in the United Kingdom of level 2 achievement, and the UK's worst reading levels atage 11, they know the problems that Nottingham faces. They also know that long-term preventive measures in education and skills are needed to complement the remedial measures necessary to deal with incapacity benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/5">It is One Nottingham's intention to respond promptly when the Government ask for expressions of interest in creating a city strategy on incapacity benefit. Local partnerships deliver. They have done so in Manchester, where &pound;1.75 million of neighbourhood renewal funds have been used on the highly successful stepping stones project, and in Edinburgh, where the equivalent of the local strategic partnership has led innovation on incapacity benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/6">One Nottingham will allow unique access to all the partners in our city, including organisations dealing with crime, health, education and liveability as well as skills. We also intend working closely with our conurbation and county partners. To take matters forward, a consortium will be created that will include key local and national players. It will pool money, create new flexibilities, and push back the boundaries of devolution. Beyond that, it will work out the most effective structures for execution and delivery, which can be monitored and held to account. A lot of planning has already taken place. During the past three months, our local area agreement, our floor target action plan and our community strategy have converged to present an aligned and coherent set of targets, which can be the foundation of our city strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/7">The local area agreement sets a target for the reduction in the number of incapacity benefit clients over three years. The target will move from the current 65 per cent. of people in our city in employment to80 per cent. The target reductions for invalidity benefit claimants in our city have been set at 1,129 this year, 2,258 next year and 3,387 the year after that. That may sound ambitious, but for Nottingham to reach its share of the Government's target of a 1 million reduction will require 6,425 people to leave our incapacity benefit register. That is another indication of the efforts that will be needed to take us to a different dimension&mdash;more even than what has already been done.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/8">Our local area agreement stretch targets already link to specific evidence-based programmes on training, child care and health. That valuable pre-planning will obviously sharpen as our expression of interest is prepared, and if it is successful in June, we shall want our consortium to be up and delivering before the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/9">We are delighted that, within days of the launch of the Green Paper, the Secretary of State accepted my invitation to come to Nottingham and give the keynote address at our One Nottingham conference on building a city strategy for incapacity benefit. Ironically&mdash;or appropriately&mdash;that conference was held in the Aspley ward in my constituency, where one in eight people is on incapacity benefit and 56 per cent. of people have no qualifications whatever. It is the ward with the lowest entry rates into higher education among the 18-20 age group in the whole of the UK. It was appropriate and welcome that the Secretary of State took the message to a heartland area that is so obviously in need of the strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/10">That was followed up on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March</phrase> by a broad-based series of workshops involving officials from the Department for Work and Pensions and many local partners, which began thinking through what shape our strategy should take. That work continued and last Tuesday&mdash;<phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May</phrase>&mdash;a delegation of partners from One Nottingham was able to play a full part in the DWP's stakeholder event on incapacity benefit in London. We were pleased to welcome the new Minister; it was probably his first official engagement after the reshuffle. He made a telling contribution at that event, and I am sure that he will do so today, too. The Secretary of State said:</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/11" class="indent">&quot;I very much welcome One Nottingham's support for this initiative and look forward in due course to seeing your proposals as to how you would use a City consortium to build on your existing work and that of your constituent partners.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/12">One Nottingham, with its partners, is ready to submit that expression of interest. It is a big task, but we have proved that such big tasks can be done; an example is unemployment. In Nottingham, unemployment has fallen by 2,700 to 11,300&mdash;that is according to the International Labour Organisation measure&mdash;since 1997. That is not just a statistic; it means that 2,700 individuals and their families now have self-respect and a better quality of life, and are now contributing to society, rather than feeling that they are being a drain or burden on it.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/13">However, we must do more, especially to address that forgotten group of those trapped on incapacity benefit. There are 17,600 IB claimants in Nottingham, more than half&mdash;53 per cent.&mdash;of whom have been on IB for more than five years. The excellent district manager of Jobcentre Plus told me that a person who has been on incapacity benefit for two years or more is more likely to die or retire than find work. That is a damning conclusion from a local expert professional. We will do something about that. Some 7,700 of that number have mental problems, and I will address those difficulties later. In addition, there are 6,820 lone parents and 10,200 older workers on related benefits. Reaching and helping those groups will be the mission of our city strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/14">On top of the human price that we pay there is also financial waste. Around &pound;5.6 million is paid in incapacity benefit in Nottingham alone each month. Add to that housing and council tax benefit and forgone income tax revenue from people who are not working, and the bill mounts up massively. We are interested to explore the incentives for recyclingany savings made into more incapacity benefit programmes. I am pleased that the Government floated that as a possibility; we need to explore that carefully.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/15">The savings in incapacity benefit spending need to be retained locally&mdash;not nationally or even regionally&mdash;so that local partners can see something for their effort and investment of energy. The money needs to be reinvested locally to expand the city strategy even further, so that we can get the next tranche of people nearer to work. It needs to be retained locally because it needs to flex and we need to be sensitive to the local context and initiatives, rather than imposing a top-down model.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/16">The average IB beneficiary receives the king's ransom of &pound;83.86 a week. For those who say that the higher levels of benefit paid to long-term IB recipients have encouraged people to stay on IB, let me point out that in Nottingham 42 per cent. of all IB claimants are not getting the higher rates. They did not have sufficient national insurance and so have to depend on income support. That group has been increasing while the number of IB recipients has been decreasing. More people in Nottingham&mdash;7,300&mdash;have to claim income support because they did not have sufficient national insurance than are receiving the long-termIB rate. There are 7,200 such people.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/17">In households in which no one goes to work, both money and self-esteem can be in short supply. A lack of positive role models can result in generation after generation getting stuck in the benefits trap. Getting people on to IB and its predecessors&mdash;invalidity benefit and sickness benefit&mdash;was sometimes seen as a way to mask soaring unemployment levels. People in Nottingham&mdash;in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, East, in my own and in Nottingham, South&mdash;have paid a heavy price for that policy failure over many years. We are delighted that that is now being seriously addressed by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/18">One Nottingham, which was created to help in deprived areas, sees the clear link between benefit dependence and hardship. It was shown in the figures that I received from the Department for Work and Pensions all those months ago that half of the most severe pockets of deprivation in Britain are in the 100 constituencies with the largest number of IB claimants. If we tackle incapacity benefit, we tackle poverty. People in my city do not accept a system that perpetuates hardship and denies people the opportunity to better their lives by accessing the world of work, and we want to do something about it. The vast majority of people who start receiving IB want to go back into work. That has been proven in survey after survey as well as by anecdotal experience, which I am sure hon. Members on both sides of the House share. Our city strategy will provide those people with tailor-made, local help to go back into work.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/19">The Government have made great progress since 1997, reducing the number of new claimants by one third and turning round the massive rise that took place when numbers trebled between 1979 and 1997. The Government have also put the pathways to work programme into every core city in the country, and those programmes have piloted a new approach that offers increased support to IB claimants in return for an increased responsibility to do what they can to return to work. By 2008, IB claimants in Nottingham will, for the first time, be able to benefit from the pathways to work programme, which is being rolled out nationally. It was pioneered successfully in our nearest city, Derby.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/20">One Nottingham obviously has an interest in the impact that IB claimants can have on regeneration&mdash;for example, in mentoring youngsters, teaching literacy or helping to reduce antisocial behaviour. If just one in 10 IB claimants gets back to some form of activity in our city, there will be 3,000 extra brains and pairs of hands helping to regenerate our city. We want to build on the work of the voluntary and community sector, Enable and the local learning and skills council to create volunteering experience as a route to work. Volunteering is a safe place in which to build up confidence, self-esteem, experience, skills, the work habit and discipline. It is, in effect, work experience, which looks good on a CV, and the volunteers realise that if they can work for free, they can work for money. Most areas in the country have a volunteer centre accredited by the national body, Volunteering England, which operates like an old-style job centre and which the consortium would look to develop in our city.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/21">Although the new deal for disabled people has shown increased success, with job starts for incapacity benefit claimants in Nottingham increasing from 120 in 2002 to 390 in 2005, and 52 per cent. of all those registering for the new deal for disabled people in Nottingham starting work in 2005&mdash;a very good record indeed&mdash;the scale of the activity is not large enough to do more than scratch the surface. Our consortium will need to examine how we can use outside providers, such as the Shaw Trust, Working Links, Work Directions and many others, to work alongside local providers to liberate the talent and potential in the disabled people of Nottingham. One Nottingham and our partners will never advocate forcing people with physical and mental difficulties back into work. That is not appropriate. However, we will not shrink from using our city strategy to challenge the fatalistic culture of storing people on incapacity benefit without offering them ways forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/22">When we receive documentation relating to an expression of interest we will need to think seriously about governance and how to take the consortium forward. How the consortium works and how it is structured will be key. None of the local partners will have dealt with central government on a task of such size and scope. Passive representation will not do. Each consortium member must bring revenues to the pool and take responsibility for specific targeted and measurable activity. A small full-time core team is likely to be needed, under its own chief executive, to measure achievement and provide a forum for day-to-day learning and interaction of the many providers that we will need if we are to make an impact on the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/23">One of the key early decisions of the consortium will be how to franchise and commission our 6,000 share of the 1 million national target. That represents more than 700 incapacity benefit claimants whom we wish to get off the register in each of Nottingham's nine area committees, should our consortium choose to break the task down at that level, so that it lies alongside the new developments taking place on neighbourhood management. Even that work will need to be further sub-divided into target groups, such as single parents, older workers and those with mental health issues. All the low-hanging fruit has been picked, so long-term relationships in each locality have to be built between providers and commissioners around workable and realistic delivery plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/24">I hope that I will not disappoint the Minister in saying that I do not want a big blast of figures next year that make him feel good about how well the programme has been implemented early. I want a steady growth in those figures, rather than a quick fix that peters out, and I am sure that he feels the same.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/25">We have been incredibly excited by the idea of taking control of the incapacity benefit challenge locally. We must now enter the uncomfortable phase of reality checking, being honest about local capacity and allocating responsibilities and accountabilities that will stay the course. Our consortium will tackle a number of key issues, the first of which is the incapacity benefit routine.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/26">It is difficult to leave the security of incapacity benefit payments for regular work payments. A bad back, depression or stress can often recur. Members of a Jobcentre Plus focus group recently mentioned their suspicion that Jobcentre Plus wants only to talk to them to take away their benefit. They fear the transition to work and the impact on, for example, tax credits, housing benefit and final incapacity benefit payments. If the employment does not work out, they have the reverse situation. One suggestion that came out of the consultation in Nottingham is that we should look to retain stability by, for example, keeping housing benefit and free prescriptions for a transitional period. We need to reward people financially for working by making the incentive great enough to overcome their fear of moving from incapacity benefit and reassuring them that we will take every possible step to ensure that the transition is easy and smooth and not something to fear.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/27">The second issue is flexibility. When we first went to see the Prime Minister and the then Secretary of State at No. 10, it was encouraging to hear over and over again that the Department and the Government wanted to be as flexible and open as possible on ideas about extending and changing some of the rules that inhibit those on incapacity benefit in getting back into work. Some excellent flexibilities already exist, and incapacity benefit claimants can earn up to &pound;81 per week for one year, although many do not know that or do not know how to take advantage of the arrangements. A locally based city strategy will, I hope, be much better placed to get that information to claimants and be sensitive to their needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/28">Giving us real authority to act locally will mean that our consortium is able to judge how resources can best be applied by sector and by area. The problems in the white working-class estates of outer-city Nottingham that I represent will, of course, differ from those in the inner-city, multi-ethnic areas of mixed housing tenure that are more typical of the constituency represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, East. We will need to be sensitive to such problems, and by creating city-based strategies with a lot of flexibility, the Government will allow us to tackle them all at the same time.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/29">I must flag up for the Minister the fact that the move by Jobcentre Plus towards regional contracting has taken away local district managers' ability to invest in and purchase what they know is needed. The Department for Work and Pensions could demonstrate flexibility by looking again at whether it can let the local Jobcentre Plus manager have more control over his or her budget. I do not expect the Minister to answer that question today, but if he has any thoughts about it and cares to write to me, that will be most welcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/30">We need to work out how those with short-term or treatable incapacity spend the period of their rehabilitation on incapacity benefit and then come off it once they are fit again. We need to offer a menu to help reintegrate these people back into work and we need to plan flexibility and discretion in relation to incapacity benefit exit. The individual's variability of performance over time is also a critical issue, particularly where their mental health is involved and they suffer, for example, from bipolar illness. We need to use reasonable adjustments. We need to make use of volunteering and permitted work, but there should also be also scope for social firms and charities to pioneer alternatives. The Government have offered flexibilities, and the Minister knows that we will test that offer.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/31">The third issue is re-skilling. In the case of longer-term injury, it is easy for claimants to find their skills out of date. A year out of the information technology industry, for example, can be a long time. Even outside fast-moving technology industries, the pace of change is increasing year on year. Skills upgrades need to be created by all our partners. We need to break down the artificial barriers and silos from top to bottom, including in central and local institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/32">If we have our own city strategy, there will be nobody to blame. If we cannot get deals done locally, we will not be able to point the finger at a convenient Minister and say, &quot;If only they did this&quot; or, &quot;If only they did that&quot;. If the responsibility is ours, we will need to face up to things locally and strike deals. Where deals cannot be made, we will come to the Minister and ask for the barriers to be removed, but the onus will be very much on us.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/33">The rules must be made crystal clear and ensure, for example, that when an IB claimant follows an agreed training and further education programme they do not lose their benefit. Further education institutions that reach out to claimants who are long out of education should be rewarded and not penalised, for example, by Ofsted, since success rates might be low. I have mentioned that to the Minister in private. Where FE institutions fulfil their educational mission to reach out to those without qualifications, that should be understood in Ofsted's marking and weighting system. Ofsted should not say that such people should attain at the same level as those who are cherry-picked by the establishments, often against those establishments' judgment and drive. However, when people are marked down, colleges have to take those unenviable decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/34">Fourthly, there is a need to build bridges to work. I have alluded a little to that. It is difficult for those who have never been on benefits to appreciate how it feels. I have had a brief spell of unemployment, and even though I knew I had a job coming up at some point in the future it was completely debilitating. It knocks a person's confidence sideways in a way that nothing else can. It destroys self-esteem, it is demoralising and it can often evolve into depression and even clinical depression. It is easy for someone to believe that because they are claiming incapacity benefit, they are generally incapable of any work or any contribution, or of being any use to society or their immediate family. That can happen not just if someone has an ailment or injury but if they have wider mental problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/35">Morale and motivation needs to be revived. Effective person-to-person contact has to be ensured and, above all, our Nottingham approach will recognise thatIB claimants should have an important say in their road map to a better future. We will also ensure that our programmes meet their needs rather than just fuelling local or national bureaucracies.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/36">It will be our ambition to ensure that everyIB claimant has a personalised road map that shows the training or work experience that they need. Over time, we will develop ways of putting real choice in their hands about where they can access the help that their map signposts for them. One way might be to trial a pilot in learning or guidance accounts. Those should not just be the preserve of undergraduates or people at advanced level. As the revival of the learning account concept takes place, I hope that incapacity benefit claimants will find their rightful place in that pantheon. We have to live the rhetoric that many people on incapacity benefit want to get back to work. We must trust them to take the right decisions, with the right help, for themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/37">Our Nottingham programme will have anIB claimants customer group, which will let us know whether we are meeting the needs of claimants. We are also considering using Jobcentre Pluses and geographical information systems&mdash;GIS&mdash;to door-knock. There is nothing like good, old-fashioned canvassing: eyeballing people and asking what they need and when they need it, with trained advisers taking the work of the estate-based local learning champions, a concept that we have pioneered in Nottingham, to a higher level.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/38">Why not reward those on incapacity benefit who mentor a youngster at school, help the elderly or take on work as a park keeper as a bridge towards more appropriate and fulfilling work? That would reward those who want to keep working but cannot necessarily work conventionally. It would augment their income and raise their aspirations, confidence and experience. Nottingham is lucky enough to have strong community and voluntary sectors, and it is our aim that they will play a key role in our city strategy on IB issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/39">Finally, we have already identified the work on mental health that we need to do with our health partners. Many people just need personal encouragement. Employment and the full reacquisition of social skills are as important as treating medical symptoms. There are massive service delivery implications for GPs and cognitive behaviour therapists, who will be needed to work not with the odd customer but with thousands of people. That needs to be carefully worked through, with colleagues in the health service and primary care trusts&mdash;particularly in the new era of practice-based commissioning.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/40">There is also a need for employers to be given awareness training and education; they need to be able to achieve compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and provide appropriate mental health support to employees as well as occupational health support for those returning from time on incapacity benefit. There is a leading role for private and public sector organisations in piloting the arrangements and setting an example.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/41">Most of the surveys and studies do not bear out the view that employers do not want to take people who have been on incapacity benefit, or that there is discrimination against people with a mental incapacity or mental ill health. None the less, an example should be set, not least by the big public and private sector employers. We need the whole team at the table, in the local context, in Nottingham, just as is happening at ministerial level in the national context.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/42">As the Secretary of State said last week, we are beginning</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/43" class="indent">&quot;a process of policy renewal that will help us to better address the endemic problem of worklessness facing many of our major towns and cities. Looking to the future. Being prepared to adapt and change. Always being prepared to develop new and better tools through which we can support local re-generation and economic development.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/44">In the brief conversations that I have had with colleagues from other parties&mdash;the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties&mdash;I have gained the impression that they, too, are anxious to exploit to the full the possible advantages of the new way of ensuring that people on incapacity benefit can lead more fulfilling lives. We certainly want to replicate that at local level. The issue is not a partisan one; it affects people&mdash;indeed, it affects claimants&mdash;of all political views or none, and does not discriminate on those grounds. We should not either.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/45">Our consortium would be keen to add some of the seedcorn funding, which I understand will amount nationally to some &pound;90 million from the deprived areas fund, but we see that only as an addition to the pooled resources that we have locally. A key point will be to enable all the individual organisations and agencies to come together. Of course we will welcome the additional resources, but the project lies in our own hands. The real prize in the next few months&mdash;this is something else that is evident from our consultations&mdash;will be to build a relationship, with trust, with central Government, so that the proposed freedoms and flexibilities can be negotiated with our national partner at the Department for Work and Pensions, to bring about real benefits for the people of Nottingham.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/46">In Nottingham we know that the number of incapacity benefit claimants needs to be reduced. We are working towards a clear strategy on how to do that. Working closely with all our partners we intend to submit an expression of interest to the Department for Work and Pensions, as soon as the Minister requests it. I wish him well in his new appointment and hope that he will retain his position long enough to see the initiative through. It will be a long-running effort and will take a lot of setting up. I am not trying to keep the Minister from his ultimate rightful post in Cabinet, but I hope that he will be allowed a sufficient period to get involved in the issue and see it through&mdash;not just for Nottingham's sake but for the sake of all the other pathfinders who get city strategies in the first wave. I could not wish for anyone more capable to do the Minister's job, and we do not want to lose him, now that he has started out on the path.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/47">I hope that by raising this debate, I have reinforced the Minister's view that the agencies and organisations in Nottingham collectively look forward to meeting the challenge of making a serious impact, not only on the problems of incapacity benefit but on more fully realising the potential of the individuals who claim it but would welcome a return to appropriate work. Nottingham is a great city; our revival is continuing and our ambition is not to let the talents and potential of a single person in our city go to waste.</p>

	<p pid="b.205.0/1">I start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> on securing this debate on a very important subject for Nottingham and the whole United Kingdom. I congratulate him also on the detailed and eloquent case that he set out on the proposals coming forward within Nottingham, and on the leading role that he clearly plays in his community in trying to develop some of the ideas and thoughts about benefit reform and in helping back to work people who have long been excluded from the labour market. He clearly plays a leading role in making such things happen in his community, and that is a model that many hon. Members could follow. I congratulate him for all those reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/2">The hon. Gentleman set out the scale of the problem faced by people in Nottingham; his constituency and those of the other Labour Members who represent the city are among the 100 constituencies with the most incapacity benefit recipients. As he said, 17,600 people are on incapacity-related benefits in Nottingham. It is also interesting to note the high overall level of economic inactivity in the city: 36 per cent. of its population are classified as economically inactive for reasons of incapacity or for the many other reasons that he set out.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/3">The hon. Gentleman drew particular attention to an important point that needs to come out more in the wider debate about benefit reform and helping people on incapacity benefit back into work: for many in the groups that we are discussing, low educational achievement is another barrier to returning to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/4">Drawing attention to Nottingham's problems helps shed light on the broader issues facing many cities&mdash;and indeed rural areas&mdash;in the UK. After all,2.7 million people are on incapacity-related benefits across the UK, and the December 2005 figures, although they may have been updated since, show that over the whole of the UK, 7.94 million people are classified as economically inactive. The Government are finally taking on the challenge to raise the level of economic activity and help people on incapacity benefit back into work, and I welcome that; it is important and timely, and it has come not a moment too soon.</p>

	<p pid="b.206.0/1">As we have a little time, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will indulge me. I should like to reinforce his point about educational attainment being one of the key factors that we need to bring to bear in our partnership work on this issue. The powers and extra assistance from the Government on IB claimants are extremely welcome, but locally we need&mdash;we are attempting it at One Nottingham&mdash;to seek a city strategy. That is one of our priorities; the second&mdash;there are three&mdash;is to teach social behaviour in all our primary schools so that youngsters can get the social toolkit to learn, so that they qualify better than youngsters have in the past, and go on to further education, training and employment, so there will be less of a pool from which those on incapacity benefit can be drawn. We need to tackle the issue on lots of different levels, and the hon. Gentleman was right to emphasise that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16b.206.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" speakername="Danny Alexander" colnum="206"  time="010:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0002.htm#06051659000451">
	<p pid="b.206.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. He makes a good point.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/2">Also, I should have welcomed the Minister to his place at the beginning of my remarks. I am delighted to see him here and to congratulate him on his appointment. I look forward to working with him as the welfare reform process continues. I am sure that he will want to give due emphasis to that process in the coming weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/3">The partnership approach taken by One Nottingham is one that the Government should encourage not only in Nottingham but throughout the country. It is important to bring together people and organisations from the public, private and voluntary sectors to deliver in a coherent, co-ordinated and locally driven way&mdash;that is an important consideration&mdash;policies and proposals to help back into the labour market people who have been out of or excluded from it for a long time, perhaps for reasons of incapacity. A lot of hard work is being done in Nottingham to bring people together, and that can be furthered. The hon. Gentleman set out clear targets, and made it clear that Nottingham will soon be ready to submit its application. That has been successfully advertised and highlighted today, and I congratulate him on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/4">The hon. Gentleman rightly drew attention to the social and human waste that incapacity benefit creates. A number of people have been on incapacity benefit for a substantial time. He drew attention to the often-quoted statistic that people who have been on incapacity benefit for more than two years are more likely to die or reach retirement age than they are to find work. That is a damning indictment of the current system. Many different barriers prevent people in that situation from getting back into work, such as having a lack of educational skills or confidence, or having an illness or disability. There are also more physical and practical barriers to prevent people from returning to the labour market.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/5">The hon. Gentleman has made important points about the local situation in Nottingham and contributed to the broader UK debate about the welfare reform that we hope is about to get going. The concept of the city strategies, in which available funds&mdash;often a multiplicity of funds; I know that in Glasgow there are many dozens of strands of funding devoted to helping people back to work&mdash;are brought together and other funds may be brought in, is a welcome approach. However, there are several issues that relate to that approach that I want to draw to the Minister's attention, and I will be grateful if he can respond to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/6">The hon. Member for Nottingham, North talked about scaling up in Nottingham. One consequence of the greater focus on welfare to work is that current projects and programmes need to be scaled up dramatically to enable them to meet delivery targets, but such scaling up raises issues of local accountability and responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/7">It is important that the Government's approach to welfare reform should not be to deliver it in a top-down way, but to allow local communities and organisations to develop their own strategies, programmes and ideas about how best to tackle the problems that they face in their own communities. The hon. Gentleman talked about the deprived areas fund that the Government are looking to set up. It is worth noting that that fund will be partly resourced through ending the action team for jobs model, which works in Nottingham, in Inverness in my constituency, and across the country. Can the Minister provide some reassurance that the areas that will be targeted by the deprived areas fund will, by and large, be those that currently benefit from the action team approach? In many parts of the country, including Nottingham, there could well be some concern that the important community engagement work of the action teams will be lost.</p>

	<p pid="b.208.0/1">This is a rather paradoxical point. I am keen to have as much local discretion as possible and, going beyond this debate, I believe in constitutional independent local government, in getting off our backs. However, having been in this position of almost supplication for decades, it is not always easy to release people locally to get on and do the job. People are still unsure of where to go and how to take on those responsibilities. It is important that the Department is still there to offer advice.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.0/2">We have had tremendous advice from officials in the Department for Work and Pensions and from people such as David Simmonds at the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion that has been invaluable in pointing us in the right direction so that we do not miss this fantastic opportunity because of inexperience in running our own affairs at that level. I hope that the Department will continue to do that with a light touch and to guide us in the right direction.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="b.208.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.1/2">I want to speak about the national role of the DWP in bringing to fruition some of the local ideas that we have heard about today. The Department's first role is to introduce legislation following the Green Paper, and any indication that the Minister can give us today about the likely timing of that will be gratefully received. Given the range and detail of the issues that have been rehearsed today relating to the strategy in the city of Nottingham and the rest of the country, it is important that sufficient time be allowed to scrutinise the matter in detail. I would be grateful for anything that the Minister can say about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.1/3">Two other issues relating to the approach so far about which there are real concerns are, first, funding, and secondly, the arrangements for contracting with voluntary sector organisations such as those that the hon. Gentleman told us were involved in the consortium in Nottingham.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.1/4">The overall package in the welfare reform Green Paper for funding the pathways to work scheme was &pound;360 million. The hon. Gentleman drew attention to the importance of rolling out the scheme properly in Nottingham. I have looked at the pilots elsewhere, and it is clear&mdash;this is the view of many of the organisations that have commented on the matter&mdash;that &pound;360 million is not enough to ensure that a roll-out on the scale that the hon. Gentleman wants in Nottingham and elsewhere can be taken forward. Even a calculation based on a written answer that I received suggests that the cost of the scheme is &pound;400 per claimant, in which case over two years the total funding needed would be &pound;440 million. However, that estimate does not include the cost of the back to work credit or the condition management programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.1/5">I was surprised, to say the least, having tabled a parliamentary question to ascertain what proportion of that &pound;360 million is for back to work credit and what proportion is for the condition management programme, to be told simply that the information was not available. That raises concern in my mind about how the Department calculates the figures and whether we will see pathways lite, which is not what people in the One Nottingham consortium or anywhere else really want or need. A further point is that the&pound;360 million will supposedly come from existing DWP budgets. I am keen to hear from the Minister where the axe will fall to release even that inadequate sum for rolling out the pathways to work project.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.1/6">I mentioned the condition management programme, as did the hon. Gentleman, in relation to necessary medical assistance. A successful condition management programme rolled out nationwide is dependent on a supply of properly qualified professionals such as cognitive behaviour therapists, but there is a shortage of such therapists and they take up to five years to train. It is important that the Minister in his response addresses how to ensure a supply of properly trained condition management professionals and properly qualified employment advisers. I also want to know how the importance of having people in those areas comes up against the current cuts in DWP staff in a number of areas&mdash;and, as I know from my own experience, how that has an impact on morale.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.1/7">The hon. Gentleman drew attention to the important issue of engaging the voluntary sector and the private sector in delivering many of the back to work schemes that are starting. The separation that that entails and the engagement of such organisations are very important. The Government have talked about that, which I welcome, because a separation between the benefit decision-making process and the back to work help can be an important tool in engaging people in back to work activity without their fearing that they will be challenged on or lose their benefits. That might lead to Jobcentre Plus and the DWP moving into much more of a commissioning role: rather than delivering back to work services themselves, they will commission voluntary and private sector organisations of the sort that the hon. Gentleman mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.1/8">However, it is important to know how these contracts are to be set up. I think that that will be specified in legislation at national level; perhaps the Minister will spell that out. The Green Paper addresses the engagement of the voluntary and private sectors on a target-driven basis. In terms of the setting out of the contracts, it is important that there be sufficient flexibility to allow the kind of local initiative that the hon. Gentleman described. It is also important that sufficient time be available within a contract for a local organisation to develop and work through the best methods for engaging people in its area. Too often we hear about voluntary organisations coming up with programmes that, as the hon. Gentleman described, spend too much time working on next year's funding application rather than delivering the services that they are setting out to deliver.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.1/9">It is also important, as the hon. Gentleman said, that welfare to work&mdash;welfare reform&mdash;provides real support for employers. I was privileged during the Easter recess to visit the Working Links project in the Parkhead ward in Glasgow; some such projects have been picked up on in the plans being developed in Nottingham. One of the most striking things about that Parkhead project is how it engages with employers to help individuals once they have been placed in work not to lose that job. It can often be found that for people who might never have been in work or who have not engaged with the workplace for a long period, the basics of being in employment&mdash;such as turning up on time and dealing with their employer on a day-to-day basis&mdash;are an entirely new experience, and having support to deal with that is very important. I hope that providing real support to employers, and beefing up the access to work scheme, which is very important for helping people with disabilities back into work, can all be part of what the Government introduce.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.1/10">The hon. Gentleman rightly drew attention to the importance of mental health, and he will know that depression and anxiety-related conditions are now the largest cause of new on-flows to incapacity benefit, and that people once on incapacity benefit for other reasons often become depressed as an associated condition, so tackling those mental health-related conditions is very important. He said that the One Nottingham consortium was planning to do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.1/11">That requires reform of the personal capacity assessment in particular. In the Green Paper, the Government talked about setting up a taskforce to look into reforming the Pca for people with mental health conditions. I understand that that taskforce has still not been set up. Will the Minister address that? Dealing with this issue is of great importance in terms of the wider point that the hon. Member for Nottingham, North made on the need to provide support that is as locally driven and flexible as possible, to help people in Nottingham who need it to get back into work.</p>

	<p pid="b.210.0/1">Welcome to you on this fine morning, Mr. Olner, and welcome also the Minister, for whom I have a great regard. I want to say on the record for all those who will read this debate that I see it as part of my job as shadow welfare reform Minister to work co-operatively with him.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.0/2">Welfare to work is a key part of social justice, which is an objective that I believe all politicians of good will sign up to. We may differ on the means but not the objective, and I am sure that everyone reading this debate will want my party to work co-operatively with the Government and the Liberal Democrats to take politics out of the issue as much as is humanly possible during debates on the Bill and beyond. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> on another typically insightful parliamentary contribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.0/3">The debate is timely, as the introduction of a Bill to implement parts of the Green Paper and the city strategy is a key part of the Secretary of State's agenda. We do not know much about the city strategy models. Co-operative inter-agency work has been done in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Manchester, but the strategies are very much in their infancy. The Opposition believe in more localism and, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, decentralisation, but we must ensure that councils and the public sector take the role of enabling authorities and do not seek to micro-manage.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.0/4">The right noises are being made on page 10 of the Green Paper about how co-operation should work. It states that employers should be involved and that budgets should be pooled to simplify funding streams so that they are more accessible and comprehensible to claimants. We welcome the idea of fewer and simplified targets. Let us hope that the learning accounts are not individual learning accounts, as that model sounded good in theory but did not work too well in practice. Much detail needs to be chewed over, and I urge the Minister&mdash;as if he does not already know this&mdash;to understand that the devil lies in the detail, as the hon. Member for Nottingham, North said.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.0/5">There is a discussion on page 18 of the Green Paper about vacancy rates in the cities with some of the highest proportions of incapacity benefit claimants. There is a reference to the 100 MPs to whom the Secretary of State wrote in January. The Green Paper states:</p>
	<p pid="b.210.0/6" class="indent">&quot;However, many residents of cities do not take up these jobs even though they live within easy travelling distance of thousands of vacancies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.210.0/7">It would be extremely useful to have more detail when we debate this matter in the coming weeks and months. Can the Minister publish evidence to support that proposition, that there are literally thousands of vacancies in those cities? Those inner cities are some of the most depressing, sad and demoralising blackspots for people who feel that they are trapped on incapacity benefit. We need to help them, but we can do that only if we have more analysis, and in particular supporting evidence for that proposition in the Green Paper.</p>

	<p pid="b.211.0/1">The hon. Gentleman has highlighted a phenomenon that I experience often in Nottingham, which is that people do not wish to move off their estate, whether for education or employment. One way to tackle that is to make provision on the estate for further education or other aspects of learning. Once those people are turned on to education and realise that they can get a job, they cannot be stopped from applying for further education or the vacancies that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. We must provide a trigger point in the locality for those people and then let them make the best of it themselves. I hope that that will become evident as we develop our city strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.211.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and hope that he is right. However, we need more evidence for the proposition that there are thousands of accessible vacancies in those cities. Perhaps the means that he outlined&mdash;I trust that he is right&mdash;is the way for people to access such vacancies, but discovering the distribution of vacancies among cities would be a starting point, and it is necessary before we can discover whether that is a true proposition.</p>

	<p pid="b.211.2/1">Speaking as a Glasgow Member, it is undoubtedly the case that thousands of vacancies are available in Glasgow, and thousands of people are on invalidity benefits. One of the reasons why there has been such a take-up of jobs by the influx of eastern Europeans is that most of those unemployed or on benefits are essentially unemployable and no reasonable employer would take them on in their existing situation. Given a choice between a highly skilled and motivated eastern European and someone trying to return to the labour market who may have addiction problems and has been unemployed for 10 years or so, the latter would be found to be simply not job-ready. They cannot compete in such circumstances, and background help and assistance is necessary. A simple juxtaposition of vacancies and individuals is insufficient.</p>

	<p pid="b.212.0/1">That is an important point, which is why I call for the Minister to publish some statistics. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the question is not quite as easy as it looks. If it were, many more people would be getting on buses and going from one side of Glasgow, Edinburgh or Manchester to the other, and we would not face this problem. I take his point.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/2">In some quarters, such as the third and private sectors, the Green Paper's proposals have been judged to be rather sketchy. We look forward to seeing detail in the Bill and I urge the Minister to tell us the likely date of its publication, not just for my benefit but for that of the stakeholders outside this place. I shall make it easy for him: can he narrow it down to summer or autumn? A specific month is not necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/3">I want to raise some points that bear on the likely success of the city strategy model, which are applicable to all other means of welfare to work delivery, outside cities. The first is the key role of the voluntary and private sectors. In the Green Paper, we are told of the city strategy model and that</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Each consortium would also be expected to make use of private and voluntary sector providers to deliver additional employment support.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/5">I shall not rehearse the arguments brilliantly set out in a document from the Oxford Economic Forecasting company prepared for the Employment Related Services Association. In essence, it argues for what the National Audit Office has urged: a complete top-to-bottom change in the letting of welfare to work contracts on the part of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/6">There is not a level playing field. Private and voluntary sector providers already understand that some of the contracts let to them are of very short duration, which means that they cannot plan and invest for the future by hiring people and buying premises. There are low-value contracts for which it is not worth tendering. Short tendering times and last-minute tendering by Jobcentre Plus make it very difficult for the third and private sectors to make proper bids. Quite amazingly, there is sometimes a change in the specifications that a private or voluntary sector provider has to meet after their bid has been accepted.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/7">Those issues must be flagged up because of the ambition that we regularly hear about from Ministers, which I share, to get more private and voluntary sector provision, provided it is as effective as or more effective than the public sector alternative. We are talking not about cost considerations but about what is effective in getting more people back to work more swiftly in more sustainable jobs. The private and voluntary sectors are not getting a fair crack of the whip. The city strategy will work only if we reconsider procurement.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/8">My second concern relates to the target of getting 1 million off benefit within 10 years, and there is obviously a disaggregation of that figure: there will be a target for each city. Of course, that will mean not getting 1 million people into work but getting them off benefit. There is a huge issue here for those of us who grind through the statistics with a great deal of joy in our heart&mdash;it is a genuinely fascinating subject. The destination of some of those who come off incapacity benefit will be to return to income support or jobseeker's allowance, or just to disappear altogether. We should place proper emphasis on getting as many of that 1 million as possible back into work, not just off benefit; they are two radically different things.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/9">I shall not delve into the view of Her Majesty's Opposition and my views about whether getting 1 million off incapacity benefit by 2016 is too ambitious. The Secretary of State calls it a stretching target, but I wonder about it. I say that for one simple reason. I pray in aid only what the Work and Pensions Committee said in the past couple of weeks, that the</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Department has not met its commitment to produce incapacity benefits caseload forecasts to 2016&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/11">and that it should do so immediately. It also stated that clarification of the baseline by which the aim will be measured is urgently required.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/12">That must be right, because unless we know what the predicted off-flow is, particularly in respect of those over 50 who will reach retirement age between 2006 and 2016, we cannot get a sensible idea of how well the Government are doing in terms of hitting their target.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/13">That brings me to my third concern, which the hon. Member for Nottingham, North will share: how far will the city strategy or any other strategy tackle the problem of existing claimants? That issue needs a good and thorough airing for the following reason. Having been an old Treasury hand pre-1997, I know how to qualify spending commitments and I noted that page 48 of the Green Paper states something about how the needs of the existing stock in pathways to work areas will be catered for:</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/14" class="indent">&quot;As resources allow, we will, over time, consider extending work-focused interviews to existing claimants&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/15">Three qualifiers in one sentence&mdash;&quot;as resources allow&quot;, &quot;over time&quot; and &quot;consider&quot;&mdash;is not bad. That bears on what so many of us have pointed out: the &pound;360 million from existing budgets to roll out pathways to work nationally seems a serious underestimate.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/16">Why do we say that? We know that incapacity benefit personal advisers will need upskilling, that there will need to be better training and that there is a shortage of therapists. Professor Layard is probably arguing on the high end of the spectrum when he says that 10,000 cognitive behaviour therapists might be needed to deliver pathways as a high-quality intervention in the condition management programme. Listening to this debate, I wondered whether the consortium in Nottingham will have the ability to tackle what seem to be serious supply-side constraints, be they in physiotherapy or cognitive behaviour therapy.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/17">Employers are important in the area of welfare to work. The Work and Pensions Committee said that employers seem to have been</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/18" class="indent">&quot;largely overlooked in the Green Paper&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/19">All of us who speak to the stakeholders&mdash;the voluntary, private and public sectors&mdash; agree with that. No matter how much help and support an incapacity benefit claimant or disabled person may receive, if employers do not change their culture there will be difficulties. They must also change it in respect of statutory sick pay and the 28 weeks for which someone who may still be under contract to a company can take time off work because of illness, be that a mental health condition or otherwise. Employers are not doing enough to intervene and give such people support, because they might have been off sick for six months before they do one day go on incapacity benefit. As we all agree, unless incapacity benefit claimants are helped and supported early in their claim, the chances of their returning to work reduce almost exponentially.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/20">The Minister can help the city strategy model by telling us a bit more about his plans for changing statutory sick pay. What will he do to improve employers' attitudes when they work in consortiums of the kind that the hon. Member for Nottingham, North outlined? What plans does the Minister have to reform medical certification, which is first encountered by a claimant when they are on statutory sick pay and are going to their local GP? We need to hear more about what the Government intend to do with the new personal capability assessment, which is meant to be about what IB claimants&mdash;and those on statutory sick pay who are potential claimants&mdash;can do, rather than just focusing on the illness. To do that, we have to understand what the role of employment advisers in doctors' surgeries will be, not just for individuals on incapacity benefit, but&mdash;I stress this&mdash;for those on statutory sick pay who are not yet in the benefit system.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/21">The Minister will want to consider all those points. I had a discussion with him before this debate; we decided&mdash;well, I did, anyway&mdash;that we are men of good will, and that what we were talking about, essentially, is an exercise in improving legislation in a crucial area of public policy and social justice as much as we can. If some questions raised cannot be answered today, I hope that they will be answered in Committee. I once again thank the hon. Member for Nottingham, North, who has, typically, raised an important issue, and has done so in his own special way.</p>

	<p pid="b.214.0/1">I am delighted to respond to t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">his debate initiated by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase>, who is not only a Nottingham Member of Parliament but chairman of One Nottingham. In the short time that I have been in this job, he is the Member I have seen the most of, but I am not complaining about that; there are others I might complain about. However, over the past week and a bit, I have on occasion felt as though I were being stalked by him.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this Adjournment debate. It is an important time in the development of the city strategy. Given what he says, I would be surprised if One Nottingham were not first in submitting its expression of interest to the Department. I am not saying that it has to be, but given the interest shown by him and his colleagues in the partnership, that would not surprise anyone in the Department.</p>

	<p pid="b.214.1/1">Of course, the case for Nottingham is strong, but the case for Glasgow is similarly strong. Given that the Scottish elections are coming up next year, I should point out to the Minister that it is important that any launch does not get confused with that process. That requires bringing forward the announcement about Glasgow. The Minister was born and grew up in my constituency, but then left it to go to the other side of the world. He ought to put something back as soon as possible by recognising that Glasgow should be one of the cities chosen.</p>

	<p pid="b.215.0/1">I do not know whether I have to declare an interest based on what my hon. Friend says, but before I respond to that point, I should say that I welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1746" name="John Heppell">my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Heppell)</phrase>, who, as my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North, said, was not able to participate in today's debate simply because of the rules of this place, which we all understand; nevertheless, I am sure that he wished to contribute in the same passionate way that my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North, did. I also welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1566" name="Ian Stewart">my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles (Ian Stewart)</phrase>. He, too, has taken a silent role, but I know that he is interested in the issues that we are discussing.</p>

	<p pid="b.215.1/1">Mr. Olner, I have to say that that is the first time that I have been intervened on by the Chairman.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.1/2">Last, but of course not least, I should mention <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1991" name="Ian Davidson">my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West(Mr. Davidson)</phrase>, who rightly pointed out that I&mdash;and almost all my family&mdash;grew up in his constituency, in whatever configurations it has found itself in the past few years.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.1/3">In the short time available to me, I shall not be able to answer all the questions raised during the debate. My officials have written an excellent speech, for which I thank them, but I shall not use much of it. I would rather respond to as many points as I can and save that text for another occasion.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.1/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West was right to say that I grew up in his constituency. It is the most significant reason for my having energy and determination for my job, especially in respect of the city strategies, the opportunity for people to find work&mdash;it was not always there for my immediate family&mdash;and the challenges of child poverty. All of us have had different upbringings, and different experiences of income, and of the difference between wealth and poverty. Some have managed to escape poverty, but those who do so must not forget those experiences. Despite the remarkable improvements of recent years, we should remember that too many children continue to grow up in shameful poverty. We need continually to challenge it.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.1/5">I need no encouragement or additional commitment to get the work done; it gives me the opportunity to restart social mobility. I have spoken about it inthe past, but I was limited in my ability to make the changes essential to driving it. Working at the Department for Work and Pensions gives me an enormous opportunity to help change that cycle of social mobility, but that change has stalled. We could debate why, but it is a generational problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.1/6">The changes in social mobility have come about over the generations, but there are three big drivers of social mobility. The first is the family and the mechanisms that the family employs to support the children; that is partly to do with the culture of work and partly to do with the culture of aspiration. The second is education. Education is a phenomenally important driver of social mobility, particularly early-years education&mdash;and even early-months education&mdash;pre-school education and support during the first few years of primary education. The third is poverty, especially child poverty. As we know, a child born in poverty is four times as likely to live in poverty in adulthood.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.1/7">We need to break that cycle of generational poverty, that inherited lack of aspiration. The Department and others are helping to overcome that problem. Although I say that it is a generational problem, we none of us have the luxury to say that the solution is generational. The problem has built up over the generations, but it cannot and must not be solved over the generations. Instead, we have the target dates of 2010 and 2020 for alleviating child poverty and gaining the aspects of full employment of which we have spoken before.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.1/8">The reason why we have a city strategy&mdash;I will respond soon to the specific points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North&mdash;is that we have a target of 80 per cent. employment for the United Kingdom. We are currently hovering at just under75 per cent. The employment rate in our great cities of Glasgow, London, Manchester and Liverpool is at or just below 70 per cent. Despite that, the greatest progress in the past nine years has been in the cities with the highest levels of unemployment and the highest levels of economic inactivity.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.1/9">However, there are still real problems. There are problems not only in Nottingham, as we heard earlier, but in the five cities that we talk of most often&mdash;London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow. For those five cities even to reach the current national average&mdash;not the 80 per cent. target but the national average of 75 per cent.&mdash;a further 400,000 people will have to find work .</p>

	<p pid="b.216.0/1">Is the Minister aware that since 1997 unemployment in my constituency has fallen by more than 50 per cent., that youth unemployment has come down by more than 80 per cent. and that long-term unemployment has been reduced by more than 90 per cent.? He would have known that if he had delivered my election leaflets. However, there is much more to be done.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16b.216.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2010" speakername="Jim Murphy" colnum="216"  time="010:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0003.htm#06051659000464">
	<p pid="b.216.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. There has been remarkable progress. The areas where the problem has been greatest have seen the most remarkable improvements and turn-around. There has been genuine progress in the transformation of individual families' material well-being and employment has changed the culture within families. However, even within those families who have an adult in work, there are still too many&mdash;I think it is about 40 per cent.&mdash;in which the child experiences material poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/2">Listening to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase>, I think that the good people of Parkhead will be over-visited, as I, along with the local Member of Parliament,<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1986" name="David Marshall">my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, East(Mr. Marshall)</phrase>, will be visiting the area this Friday to talk about the specifics in the east end of the city.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/3">London is the richest city in Europe, yet almost half the children in inner-city London still experience real poverty. That cannot be right. We all agree that it cannot be right. The city strategy, pathways into work, the new deal, the national minimum wage and investment in primary education are all about driving those children out of poverty and into opportunity, so that they can help break what is an all too common cycle in generations of families.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/4">I shall respond to some points that hon. Members have made during our thoughtful debate. I hope that it sets the tone for our dialogue throughout the entire welfare reform agenda. I thank hon. Members for welcoming me to this new post.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North made some points about local flexibility for Jobcentre Plus managers, and I shall take him up on his invitation to reflect on whether we have the flexibility right at local level. Our approach to local flexibility must be consistent. If we say that in city strategies, local people who know the local specifics should design a mechanism that helps to drive up employment and alleviate child poverty, it is right that we should provide opportunities for people to tell us what barriers exist in national and regional policies, structures or mechanisms as they roll out those strategies and make their expressions of interest. We will do what we can to remove as many of the barriers and working operations that those who submit well-founded expressions of interest say get in the way of their ambition to deliver a locally designed, effective way of finding people employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/6">Several hon. Members made the point about qualifications. I have said this before, but the generation currently in education is the first for whom the global economy is the norm. People are no longer competing with the person in the same street, country or on even the same continent. It is a global competition. To equip those children and teenagers in the global economy, skills and qualifications are crucial. One sobering statistic is that 40 per cent. of lone parents who are out of work have no qualifications whatever. That is one genuinely worrying statistic.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/7">My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West alluded to how we provide an opportunity for those folk who have no formal qualifications, are not in employment but have the phenomenal responsibility of bringing up children. We must strike the right balance to ensure that they learn and acquire skills and qualifications, whether academic or others, to make them more employable in the global economy. He gave his own sense of that in terms of the challenge from eastern Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/8">A question was asked about the city strategy timetable. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North will receive over the next few days detailed guidance about the expression of interest. Some very good work is being done in Nottingham, but I know that he accepts that if we are going to deliver on our collective ambition, we have to take that good work delivered by good people to a different scale and reach. That is the case for all cities that submit an expression of interest. We expect a delivery plan over the following three to four months. Our current thinking is to have 10 to 15 pathfinders in the first tranche of the roll-out. There is flexibility in that, too, because if there are more than 15 high-quality expressions of interest, we may go further.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/9">I thank my hon. Friend for his compliments on the support that he received from officials at the Department for Work and Pensions. They will welcome his words, because they put enormous energy into the initiative, as did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" name="Margaret Hodge">my predecessor, the right hon. Member for Barking (Margaret Hodge)</phrase>, who has now gone to the Department of Trade and Industry. She had a personal interest in the initiative. The appropriate level of support and guidance&mdash;but not interference&mdash;will remain available for local consortiums that want additional support and to share best practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/10">The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey raised points about capacity in the health service and the attitude of employers. We are in constant dialogue with officials and Ministers in the Department of Health and elsewhere on the matter. We all share an ambition&mdash;it is shared across Government, so that there is no lack of will and determination to achieve it&mdash;and we are engaged in detailed conversations about capacity.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/11">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1468" name="David Ruffley">the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds(Mr. Ruffley)</phrase> pointed out, if we are to reduce the number of incapacity benefit recipients by 1 million, supporting people in getting work is not all that is needed. We must prevent people from going on to incapacity benefit in the first place. That is a matter of working with GPs, primary care trusts, and, crucially, employers.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/12">The initiative is not just a matter of employment opportunities and the changing of employers' attitudes towards people on incapacity benefit and people with mental health problems; it is about working with employers to prevent people from slipping out of economic activity into the depression and lack of confidence that we heard described by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North, which leads them to leave the workplace and claim incapacity benefit. This is not just about getting people off incapacity benefit; it is about a sensitive approach to preventing them from going on to it&mdash;something that I am sure we can profitably discuss in the next few months. I have already engaged in conversations about that with the national employment panel.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/13">The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds raised points that also arose in other hon. Members' speeches this morning. We expect that the national roll-out of pathways will largely be achieved in partnership with the voluntary and private sectors, with the proviso that he suggested that it should provide value for money and be effective. We think that working in partnership with local agencies will provide the dynamism, flexibility and spark that will help us with the national roll-out.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/14">I have two things to say about the voluntary sector. First, now that we have greater ambitions for the voluntary sector and are asking it to do more, we cannot ask it to do so on a cycle of annual budgets and annual contracts. It is not feasible, fair, effective or cost-effective, and it will not deliver on our collective ambitions. As we all know from our conversationswith representatives of the voluntary sector, when organisations are asked what they want to do first, they often say, &quot;My first priority in my one-year contract is to get a renewal for next year. My main role in week one is to scope next year's funding plan.&quot; It is not reasonable to request the voluntary sector to work in that way, particularly if we are asking it to do more. I hope that the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds is reassured by the fact that the pathways contracts, for example, will build a three-year cycle, which will give a greater sense of stability.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/15">My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West gave his own interpretation of the point about vacancies in cities, but it is my understanding that the Department for Work and Pensions has published a detailed analysis. I shall look at it, and if there is a gap in the analysis I shall of course do as my hon. Friend suggested. As to contracting, external consultants are currently reviewing how we contract, and whether we do so in the most cost-effective and productive way. Once we conclude that work, I shall of course share it with hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/16">We have come to the conclusion of a helpful discussion. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North again, and not only on securing the debate. He and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West have taken a keen interest in how we support those who are economically inactive, how we drive up employment opportunities and how we end the cycle of low aspiration in families. Cities are key parts of that. They are engines of economic regeneration and development and I thank my hon. Friend for securing the debate.</p>

	London Olympics
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16b.220.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="220"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0004.htm#06051659000465">
	<p pid="b.220.1/1">It is a pleasure to introduce this debate. I suspect that we will have quite a few debates on the financing of the Olympics in the next six years. It is appropriate to visit the subject now, because we are getting past the stage of general concept and into the practical, gritty reality. The Olympic Delivery Authority has been established and the chief executive of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games is now in place. There is also the public inquiry into the site, and people are beginning to talk seriously about funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/2">In the past few weeks, David Higgins, in almost the first words that he has uttered in his capacity of chief executive of the ODA, has suggested that the infrastructure costs would be not &pound;1 billion, as originally thought, but &pound;3 billion. It was not clear exactly what those costs referred to, but the implication was that the man running the show has a much more realistic&mdash;and pessimistic&mdash;picture of costings than has hitherto been portrayed.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/3">Also, the Mayor has indicated in the past few days that he might have to acquire land, at considerable cost&mdash;pessimists have argued that an equivalent of possibly double the London council tax contribution will be needed, which is not something that was considered previously. I do not know what the truth is on those items&mdash;we shall come to questions about that later&mdash;but costings are now crucial and the issue of a properly financially disciplined games needs to be firmly set out.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/4">I share the all-party consensus that hosting the games is potentially good for Britain and good for London. We should support the games and ensure that they are a success. Success is not just about sport but about funding and the wider economics. My other motives for approaching the issue are several, the first of which is that I represent a constituency in south-west London.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/5">I was surprised and a bit taken aback by the strength of feeling that I encountered on the doorstep in the past few weeks from people who had realised for the first time the extent of the council tax increases that they face&mdash;because of the nature of property valuations in London, many are nearer &pound;40 than &pound;20 a year. It is not so much the cost, which I guess most people can afford&mdash;at least at the upper end of the income scale&mdash;as the feeling that things are open-ended and there is much more to come.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/6">In trying to justify the games and explain things to my constituents, I appreciate that their response is not just a grumpy reaction to paying for the games. Twickenham is already a sporting Mecca and we are proud of that. There are the usual frictions associated with stadium communities, but we are proud of our association with rugby union. However, the key thing about the sport is that its big events&mdash;from the World cup down to internationals&mdash;are self-financing. It does not depend on largesse from London or the Government. Indeed, one of the gripes of rugby union is that corporation tax has to be paid on its profits, just as if it were a company, and the surpluses go to the Treasury, not back into grass-roots sport as they should&mdash;a point that I have made to the Minister and the Chancellor.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/7">We now have another big spectator sport in Twickenham. As a fellow Yorkshireman who grew up with rugby league, I know that the Minister will be pleased that Twickenham now boasts a rugby league side that sits above the mighty Wigan in the premier league. Like rugby union, however, rugby league is a self-financing sport and does not depend on subsidy.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/8">We have also had bad experiences locally of national funding of sport, which has jaundiced an awful lot of people's thinking. I suspect that the biggest participant sport locally is swimming. We have one public swimming pool, which is open and heated. For my first five years as an MP, I battled with Ministers and Sport England to get some support from the lottery for the pool. Initially that was ruled out on grounds of pure dogma&mdash;in no circumstances would the lottery support open pools&mdash;but, with the help of the then Sports Minister, we got the fatwa lifted. However, we were then told that although the pool was an admirable project, which would serve many thousands of people and was no longer barred on principle, Sport England did not have enough money, so we had to go for a cheaper patch-and-mend solution. Unfortunately, a few months after the announcement we were told that there were hundreds of billions of pounds available from the sports lottery for the Olympics. I think the Minister will understand that a lot of my constituents&mdash;the tens of thousands who use this community facility&mdash;are a little jaundiced when they hear about the way in which the Olympics are being funded.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/9">My final local point is that, like all communities, we have local athletes of whom we are very proud. Unfortunately, in the case of Twickenham, the most celebrated name recently has been that of the gymnast Ben Brown, who publicly announced that he was no longer able to continue training for the Olympics because there was no support for him. I know that the Chancellor has subsequently come forward with a handsome sum of money, but I think it was too late in his case.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/10">I paint this picture because I want to try to convey to the Minister the fact that in my area, as in many parts of London, let alone other parts of the country, there are mixed feelings about the way in which the Olympics are being funded. There is a general sense of pride and optimism, but also grumbling. I am anxious that the grumbling should not become anger, and to that end we must ensure that things are properly managed financially.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/11">A second personal reason for wanting to introduce the debate is the work that I did before I became an MP. I was involved in the oil and gas industry, with projects that were often as big as the Olympic games. In the private sector, no less than in the public, there can be massive errors and cost overruns. I have recently been reading about the travails of my former company in its projects off Sakhalin island in Russia, where costs are several hundred per cent. more than budgeted. In the private sector, there are disciplines to deal with that, which we used to call scenario planning. Managers are forced to set out what could happen rather than what they would like to happen and think will happen. In the funding of the Olympic games, I do not sense a hard scenario planning discipline. Are people looking at worst case scenarios, budgeting for them and preparing for the worst possible outcome, not in order to knock the games or undermine them but to be hard-headed and ruthlessly realistic about the prospects? That is my background and why I have come to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/12">We are all concerned with trying to make a success of the games. Success is about money as well as sport. As the Minister knows, recent Olympic games have a mixed history. Some have been unambiguously successful: Seoul, Los Angeles and probably Barcelona&mdash;although there has been an argument about the legacy of the buildings there&mdash;are normally included in that category. Some have been commercially successful, although perhaps not successful in sport: Atlanta is the obvious case. Some were disasters, some for purely political reasons: Moscow and Munich. We have had commercial disasters, of which Montreal is the obvious example. Sydney massively overran and, most recently, in Athens costs escalated from &pound;2 billion to &pound;8 billion in broad global terms, and there is continuing anxiety about how Greece will cover that. We clearly want London to be at the top end of the range, rather than the bottom.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/13">In order to try to analyse the problems, I have been trying to get a handle on the costs of the games. One of the difficulties is that quite apart from the big document that the costs are contained in, they are being presented in many different ways. Revenue and capital are also mixed up, there are differences between cash flow and balance sheet accounting and all kinds of conventions are being used, so it is difficult to get a handle on the costs that we are talking about and how they are being set off against revenue streams. In simple terms, so we can talk from a common base, my understanding is that the cost of the Olympics can be roughly put into three main categories.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/14">First are the operating costs of &pound;1.5 billion, which are predominantly commercial and are covered by TV rights, tickets and sponsorship, although there is an explicit Treasury guarantee on that component. Secondly, there is &pound;2.4 billion in funding from the lottery, London council tax payers and the London Development Agency for the village's essential infrastructure, the transport, the stadiums and the security costs. The third, slightly ambiguous bit includes elements that were to be funded anyway, such as the Lea valley development and the village, which was originally seen as a purely commercial project, but which might not be now, given the Mayor's comments. It also includes the &pound;7 billion envisaged for transport, which may or may not be necessary, but which would be desirable. We therefore have a rough range from about &pound;4.5 billion to &pound;12 billion, depending on what we do or do not include.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/15">The big challenge for the organisers&mdash;the Government are, of course, centrally involved&mdash;is how to ensure that the costs do not explode as they have in other public and private sector projects. I am sure that the Minister is fed up to his eyeballs with all the pessimistic stories about previous public sector projects, but what amuses me is that people always choose the Wembley stadium project as a bad example, when in fact it has been pretty successful compared with many other projects, because the cost overrun is only 20 per cent, the project is overdue by only a year and almost all the extra costs have been borne by the commercial partner, Multiplex. That is rather a good outcome compared with many other projects, such as the Jubilee line, let alone real horror stories such as the Scottish Assembly or the British Library, which is probably the ultimate disaster case, having cost 10 times the original estimate and been 10 years overdue. Clearly, we are not heading down that road, but a lot of discipline will have to be exercised if we are to get close even to the outcome of the Wembley project, although of course the Government and the organisers cannot allow such an outcome, because the Olympics must be delivered on time.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/16">The central problem is that the organisers must ensure that the project is delivered not only on cost, but on time. Some pretty sophisticated thinking is going into understanding how we can improve on previous public sector experience with big projects by drawing on best practice, as happened in the case of theT5 terminal, which is the model that is now being used. The central problem, however, is that although the Government, the Mayor and the people who will be operationally responsible are thinking about best practice, the people in the construction industry are also learning from experience. People do not get to be the chief executives of big construction companies by being Mother Teresa&mdash;they are hard-headed people and they have learned the lessons. Companies do not want to be the next Multiplex, so they will put in very high bids for contracts that involve rewards for coming in under cost and penalties for going over cost&mdash;nobody will take the risk of overshooting. When the bids come in, I suspect that we will be shocked by how big they are, and Mr. Higgins has perhaps been preparing us for that.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/17">I want to set out a long series of questions. I hope that the Minister can answer them and that they will trigger discussions among colleagues in the Room. I think that they will form the basis for a process of questioning and public accountability in the months and years ahead. First, can the Minister explain what Mr. Higgins meant? Which infrastructure costs was he talking about? Was he talking out of turn or was his estimate of the cost escalation sensible and prudent?</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/18">Secondly, and related to that, when will the KPMG study on the cost of the Olympics be published? What is the Government's estimate of construction cost inflation? We do not need to get such information from an expensive commercial consultant, because it is presumably available to the Bank of England and the Treasury. According to unofficial estimates, cost escalation is about 7 per cent. a year, rather than 3 per cent. a year, but is that correct?</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/19">Leading on from that, once the KPMG study has been finalised, who in the Government or the ODA will be responsible for monitoring and modelling the construction industry over the next five to six years? I ask that because an awful lot of work will be going on. I think that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> spoke about this in a recent debate. Although the transport projects, the London Gateway project and the bridge are complementary to the games, they are also competing with the games for construction raw materials and labour. Who will monitor supply and demand in the construction industry? Has anyone got a grip on that? Presumably it is not the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Is it the Department of Trade and Industry or the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister? Is anyone in Government or involved with the project considering the overall flow of supply and demand in the construction industry and how that will affect costs as the project rolls forward?</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/20">There is a question about new items of cost. There is the possibility, raised by the Mayor, of the compulsory acquisition of land&mdash;of London buying land that was hitherto assumed to be part of a voluntary, purely commercial exercise. Will that happen? I do not know what the risks are, the current state of play or the Government's assessment of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/21">There is a series of questions about how the ODA and the various partners to the Olympics will deal with the pressures that I have described. One question is about how they will deal with issues of design. There is clearly a big difference of strategic focus betweenthe Mayor and Lord Coe. I am not a great fan of the Mayor of London, but I believe that he said the appropriate thing for an elected politician when he said that London</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/22" class="indent">&quot;was not in the position of spending additional monies on iconic buildings&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/23">but he was promptly contradicted by Lord Coe, who rather tartly observed:</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/24" class="indent">&quot;We wouldn't want a tin-shed Games on the edge of a city.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/25">Reading those quotations, one sees that there are very different perspectives on how the games and the facilities should be designed and costed. It is appropriate to ask the Minister where the Government sit in that controversy. What end of the spectrum are they at? Do they broadly agree with the Mayor or with Lord Coe? Where will they throw their weight in the argument?</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/26">Another question about how the Government in particular could help with the management of potential costs relates to the subcontracting of much of the construction work. One of the more worrying documents that appeared in the past few weeks was the report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which I am sure the Minister has seen. It says that whereas London's GDP will benefit by some &pound;6 billion, non-London will lose &pound;2.8 billion. In other words, the rest of Britain will be worse off than if another country had staged the event. I present that not as a negative debating point but to make the point that the provinces of Britain could benefit from large-scale outsourcing and prefabrication in respect of a great deal of the work. They will have lower construction inflation, too. Clearly, the process needs to be managed, and I ask the Minister who is managing it.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/27">There is a series of questions about sponsorship. The &pound;1.5 billion needs to be met through aggressive and successful sponsorship. We all wish the sponsors well. It is a worthy cause and I hope that they are able to raise the money, but it is a big ask, because we are talking about more being raised in sponsorship than the whole marketing budget for British sport in any one year. What happens if the sponsorship falls short and the &pound;1.5 billion operating budget cannot be met? Who is first in line to take up any slack if the sponsorship does not come in as we hope it will?</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/28"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">My hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> has been pursuing a series of issues relating to the link between sponsorship and the integrity, the copyright, embedded in the Olympic symbols. Quite rightly, the Government have been tough in insisting that those symbols should be protected. There is real intellectual property there, and protection is essential to encourage sponsors to come forward. There is an issue of detail, because we are all beginning to hear from small businesses that are irritated or frustrated that they cannot muscle in on the Olympics. The question for the Government is about when they will produce the guidelines that explain exactly how the integrity and intellectual property elements of the Olympic symbols are to be protected. What guidelines will govern people who try to encroach on that terrain?</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/29">There are also questions about security; we know from the Athens experience that that can blowthe financing of the games wide open. Clearly, the Government have to give security priority. If the security budget goes way beyond what was in the bid document, where will the slack be? To what item of the budget will the Government look to offset any escalation in security costs, as could well arise for very good reasons?</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/30">There is also an issue about the legacy and its costing. Who will benefit from the legacy? In the past few months, a change in the concept of the Olympic village has emerged; the village could become a more valuable, high-density development than was originally envisaged. Presumably, that means that after the games it will be worth a good deal more. That is positive, but who will have first access to that money? Will it be London, the Government or the International Olympic Committee? Under what formula will any upside be apportioned between the various partners? Similarly, who will take the first hit if it all goes badly? I am not clear that there is a clear protocol that defines which of the various supporters and guarantors will be first in line to take both the benefits and the losses that might arise.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/31">How far have we gone in clarifying what will happen to some of the legacy buildings? I am aware that the IOC has praised the London Olympic bid for the thinking that has gone into legacy work. That is a very positive sign. As one who represents the rugby Mecca, I was somewhat struck by the proposal, current until recently, that the main likely future for the big stadium was to downsize its capacity from 80,000 to 25,000, and that it would probably then be used for a London rugby club. Harlequins, my local rugby club in Twickenham, is good and well supported, but even with the recent expansion of capacity, it operates at about 10,000. It is not at all clear how any London rugby union or rugby league club operating in the east end close to West Ham will be able to pull in anything remotely like 25,000 spectators. The concept I have talked about may have disappeared, but it would be useful to have clarity on whether the issue has been resolved, and if so, in what form.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/32">We acknowledge that it was necessary to enter various guarantees, involving notably the Treasury, but also London as a result of the memorandum of understanding with the DCMS. The lottery is also a potential support. However, from what I have read and discussed, what is missing from the picture is the exact relationship that would exist between those three potential guarantors and support bodies in the event of things going wrong. Who will take the first hit when, and under what conditions? We need more clarity on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/33">Among my constituents there is a mixture of pride and hope on the one hand, and worry, anxiety and even a degree of cynicism about the funding of the games on the other. The feeling is that the present generation of politicians of all parties is only too happy to scoop up the credit for having brought the Olympics to London, but in six, seven or eight years' time somebody else will have to pay the bill. If we are to prevent that anxiety from degenerating into outright cynicism, it is important that we should be absolutely up front and clear about the costs, risks and potential dangers, and that we should face them now.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16b.226.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" speakername="Christopher Fraser" colnum="226"  time="011:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0005.htm#06051659000466">
	<p pid="b.226.0/1">Initially, I came only to listen to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase>. However, having understood and appreciated what he has said, I should like to make a few comments.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.0/2">Financial commitment is an important aspect of the games, because we have, dare I say it, been here before. Contingency planning has come before the House for many years. I remember when we discussed and managed the preparation for and development of the millennium dome, when I sat on the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport. Over a period oftwo years or more, we had the then Minister,Mr. Mandelson, in front of the Committee&mdash;I hope that the Minister will spend some time looking back at some of the evidence given then&mdash;and our biggest issues and complaints were about contingency planning.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.0/3">Of course, things happen, as part of a development process, that one does not anticipate at the beginning. The hon. Gentleman's earlier questions on this issue are particularly timely, because we now have an opportunity to overcome some of the problems from which we have suffered on issues such as the millennium dome.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.0/4">The hon. Gentleman pointed out that sponsorships have to come in. One of the problems with the millennium dome was that sponsorships did not come in on time, and the Ministers and other people involved with the commissioning of the dome had to back-pedal on many occasions. We all know that the costs spiralled enormously. Having said that, the dome opened on time, but then there was a big question about its legacy. Unfortunately for the Government and all those who supported the dome, the press had a field day and the dome became a great white elephant. The issues of the dome and its legacy still have not been resolved, and I do not want to see what could be a fantastic event for this country, with a fantastic legacy, being handled in a way that does not close off all the financial issues that were not closed off for the millennium dome.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.0/5">The Culture, Media and Sport Committee also studied the preparation and build-up of the Olympic games in Sydney. Our Chairman decided that it would be appropriate to go out to Homebush, and we spent some time there. I was extremely impressed by the work done by the Australians in preparation for and in the build-up to those games. I may have this wrong, but I remember being told that they had sold off the competitors' village in advance to raise funds. We all thought that was fantastic, but at the end of the games&mdash;like many others, as was well described by the hon. Gentleman&mdash;even though their contingency planning was, in my opinion, well scrutinised in advance, they came across some extremely large financial costs which had to be supported by the Australian nation.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.0/6">We cannot take anything for granted. We want the games to be a success. I want that not only for my constituents but for the nation. Importantly, we must accept that although not everyone can participate and compete in the games, everyone can be a part of the process. I would like the Minister to accept this morning, in terms of the planning commitments and finances that go with them, that we should have a nationwide project through our schools, sports clubs, regions and local authorities to encourage people to participate in a successful launch and games. That could do many things: it could mean that everyone says, &quot;I didn't compete, but I participated,&quot; it could help to raise funds, and it could make people buy into the concept, so that when the games happen, everyone owns part of them. The nation's ownership of the games is a fundamental part of everybody understanding the financial commitment that goes with them.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.0/7">I have a specific point to put to the Minister about the games and their legacy, and about contingency planning in order to get the &quot;best of British&quot; flag flown from the beginning. Does he agree that an environmentally sustainable Olympic park that demonstrates the best in UK green landscaping and planting would be a valuable contribution to the games? I speak with a vested interest: I am vice-chairman of the all-party group on gardening and horticulture, and in my constituency there are many companies that can and will produce first-class plants, trees and all sorts of landscaping products for use at the games.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.0/8">My point&mdash;and it has been amply demonstrated that this was not well handled at the Athens Olympics&mdash;is that such activity is always considered last and not first. If we want to give a commitment to make the park an environmentally sustainable place where the whole nation can participate and it becomes a British park&mdash;not a world park, because we are flying our flag and nobody else's&mdash;I have to ask this question of the Minister: as part of the financial commitment, will he join me in calling on the Olympic Delivery Authority, by ring-fencing funding early in the development process, to allow this to happen, because I assure hon. Members that it would pay dividends in the end?</p>
	<p pid="b.226.0/9">May I draw to the Minister's attention my early-day motion asking for this commitment? It currently has all-party support, but not enough people recognise the need for us to fly the flag for Britain. We need to make a financial commitment now, and we must ensure that that financial commitment, and the contingencies that go with it, are fulfilled before, during and after the games.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16b.228.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" speakername="Don Foster" colnum="228"  time="011:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0005.htm#06051659000467">
	<p pid="b.228.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on securing the debate. It is traditional to say that, but I also congratulate him on the content of his contribution. He made it very clear that the Liberal Democrats are fully supportive of all the work being done to ensure that London in 2012 has the best ever Olympics and Paralympics. However, he also made it crystal clear that our support comes with a clear understanding that we will be critical friends of the project, and that we will not be prohibited in any way from seeking answers to some of the crucial questions&mdash;questions that were raised not only by my hon. Friend's constituents in Twickenham but by people across the country. I am delighted that he had an opportunity to put a series of questions to the Minister, and I am sure that we all look forward to the responses.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/2">There have been many debates in this Chamber and elsewhere about the Olympics and Paralympics. During them, it has been traditional for the relative merits of the cities of Loughborough, Bath and Sheffield to be aired, and for the virtues that they have to offer in respect of the Olympic movement to be extolled. I am prepared today to agree to a self-denying ordinance to make mention no more of my wonderful city and the contribution it can make, if we get a similar assurance from the Minister in relation to Sheffield.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/3">The crucial thing so far has been the cross-party support for the Olympics. In a recent letter from the IOC to the Secretary of State, the IOC praised that cross-party support and made it clear how important it had been in securing the Olympics and Paralympics for London in 2012. I must place on the record therefore my considerable disquiet at the winning of the Olympic games having been used in a Labour party election broadcast in the run-up to the recent local elections. I know that that concern is shared by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" name="Hugh Robertson">the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson)</phrase>. We have raised it with the Secretary of State, and we have been given a clear assurance that such events will not be repeated, which I welcome. We have also been assured that there will continue to be the opportunity for members of Opposition parties to work closely with the Government on the various issues that will no doubt come before us over the next few years, because this is a crucial project. It has not been said so far in this debate, but it has been said elsewhere, that seeking just to build the Olympic park and to make the associated transport arrangements is the equivalent of seeking to secure within just six years two terminal 5s. This is a huge project. My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham is absolutely right to say that it is critical that we examine and question issues relating to the cost of this mammoth undertaking at all stages and to what happens if things go wrong, as they are likely to in one way or another. He rightly asks questions about who will pick up the tab and who will get the huge benefits that may come.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/4">It is crucial that we do not see the winning of the games a year ago as the end of the matter. One of the diligent researchers in my office came across a quotation from Polybius, made over two and half millennia ago:</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Those who know how to win are much more numerous than those who know how to make proper use of their victories.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/6">In a sense, that is what our debate is about: ensuring that we make proper use of our success in Singapore a year ago. Scrutiny mechanisms must be in place to ensure that we do not have the sort of fiasco we had with the millennium dome or the many other public sector projects to which my hon. Friend referred.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/7">We must ensure, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" name="Christopher Fraser">the hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser)</phrase> rightly said, a sustainable legacy. That includes an environmentally sustainable park and many other aspects. We will be critical friends of the project, but from the outset enormous praise must be given because of the huge progress already made. That progress was recognised by members of the visiting IOC delegation recently. They rightly said that we were years ahead of some other cities that had previously won the great honour of hosting the Olympic games in their countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/8">The London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006 was passed in record time, and it will set up the various bodies that run the games. The Olympic Delivery Authority and London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games are both now well under way, and soon we shall see the official launch of the ODA, even though it already has some excellent people on board&mdash;people in whom I have a great deal of confidence. The organising committee has begun to search for the first tier of sponsors, which is an example of good, early progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/9">London 2012 now controls 90 per cent. of the land at Stratford and has done deals with the majority of landowners. As my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham says, we still have the compulsory purchase order inquiry to come, but good progress has been made. Work has already begun on the Olympic site with the burying of what were previously overhead power cables. Recently, Stratford International station has been completed, which will open next year once the final stage of the channel tunnel rail link is completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/10">During the past 48 hours, we have seen the success of the national lottery, not just in meeting the &pound;14 million target for this year's Olympic lottery games but in exceeding it by more than &pound;2 million. We know that work is under way to consider all aspects of cost. My hon. Friend rightly referred to the KPMG study, and we look forward to that report. I hope that it will touch on the issue that he raised of inflation costs. A figure of roughly 3 per cent. has been assumed, but many people are saying that inflation costs in the construction industry are running somewhere in the order of 7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/11">Understandably, there will be concerns. My hon. Friend said that we should be &quot;ruthlessly realistic&quot; about the cost of the games, and that notion should apply at all stages. The fullest information must be made available, so that as many people as possible can be engaged in the necessary scrutiny. We do not wish to be left in the same situation as Athens&mdash;some are saying that it will still have to find about &euro;9 billion or &euro;10 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/12">We know that there are huge challenges ahead, and my hon. Friend mentioned many of them. I do not wish to repeat things, but I shall discuss additional concerns. A huge challenge is being given to the national lottery in respect of the money that it is to secure both from its traditional funding sources, where money will be taken away, and from the money raised through the specific Olympic promotions. Despite the recent successes&mdash;overall lottery ticket sales have increased for three years on the trot, which is welcome because of the money that is going to good causes&mdash;there are some clouds on the horizon.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/13">One such cloud relates to lottery-style games, which are increasingly being run by gambling operators and have no mandate to raise money for good causes, yet offer lottery-style arrangements. They confuse consumers, are at odds with the duty of the Gambling Commission to ensure that gambling is conducted in a fair and open manner, and are increasingly diverting money away from the national lottery and the good causes that it supports, including the Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/14">I also have a concern about possible impacts on the national lottery of the newly-established online lottery, monday. Recently, on the Floor of the House, I asked the Minister whether it had been set up as a result of a loophole being found in the existing legislation. I was told that that was certainly not the case and that it was all perfectly above board. It seems odd that monday is claiming that it is offering a prize of &pound;1 million, yet the operators are set up as a so-called society lottery, for which the legislation requires that the maximum prize be &pound;200,000. The only way in which it can offer&pound;1 million is by linking five individual lotteries, but I understand that such linking is also not permitted.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/15">We have concerns about how that particular online lottery is operating. It is setting itself up very deliberately&mdash;its advertisements are clear&mdash;in competition with the national lottery. I recall the Minister assuring me during debate on the Gambling Bill that everything possible would be done to protect the national lottery. I am in favour of society lotteries. I moved amendments to propose that such lotteries that provide funding for hospices, for example, would be protected. The monday operators have found a loophole in the legislation, which I hope will be examined quickly.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/16">My hon. Friend and I share the growing concerns of some Londoners about the contribution that they will have to make. My party has argued, and the Conservative party has supported us, that there should be a cap on the total contribution that London council tax payers should make to the running of the games. Londoners will benefit more than those in other parts of the country, but there is a limit to what they should realistically be expected to pay. They should not be put into a situation where they have no certainty about how long they will have to make the contribution for. I must point out something that is rarely said in a debate about London council tax contributions. The total contribution is estimated at &pound;625 million, but the Mayor of London has always made it clear that that represents &pound;550 million going towards the Olympics and Paralympics, and the further &pound;75 million has been included for potential cost overruns.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/17">I am also concerned that Londoners may not get the full benefit that they seek. One concern is whether we are doing sufficient to ensure that people in London have the necessary skills to acquire the jobs that will be created. A recent Local Government Association report expressed concern that not enough was being done about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/18">Another area of concern relates to tourism, for which the Minister also has responsibility.</p>

	<p pid="b.231.1/1">I apologise to the Minister. He has been stripped of that responsibility, but he had it until recently, and I know that he is an expert in these matters, so he will have no difficulty in responding to my point. I say to him in the gentlest possible way that I for one am confused by the Government's policy on tourism. Before we had won the games, the Secretary of State proudly boasted that she would get behind tourism and that, consequently, by 2010 we would achieve income of &pound;100 billion from tourism. That was her tourism target. The Minister looks puzzled. It was published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-19">19 July 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/2">We won the Olympic games, there was a pause and then the Prime Minister decided to get in on the act. He produced the Prime Minister's Olympic tourism charter. When we asked for a copy of it, nobody could give us one. Eventually we got one&mdash;it was printed on one side of an A4 paper&mdash;but nobody has heard any further details. The interesting thing was that it set a target of &pound;100 billion for income from tourism by 2012. Having won the Olympics, the Government appear to have downgraded their aspirations for income from tourism.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/3">Finally, on the nations and regions, I have spoken to the Minister about the commitments that we all made to our electorates that all parts of the country would benefit from the Olympics and Paralympics coming to London. It is critical to ensure that that is the case and that at the earliest possible opportunity people in every part of the country who were so supportive of the bid for the games are given information on how they will benefit not just from one-off contracts, although those are important, but from lasting legacies in each nation and region.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/4">I note with some concern that the chief executive of the British Olympic Association is urging the Minister, as did my hon. Friend in his excellent contribution, to publish at an early stage a set of guidelines on how plans for&mdash;rightly&mdash;protecting the Olympic symbols and names will be put in place in a way that enables firms, businesses, organisations, charities and so on in each of the nations and regions to feel that they are able to contribute.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/5">My hon. Friend asked a series of excellent and important questions. We look forward to the Minister's answers, but I end where I began, by saying that, notwithstanding the fact that we are critical friends of the Olympics and Paralympics, we believe that significant progress has been made. The games are a huge opportunity for each part of this country as well as for London, but a great deal of work must be done to ensure that we grasp that opportunity in such a way that our preparations are not only on time but on budget.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16b.232.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" speakername="Hugh Robertson" colnum="232"  time="011:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0006.htm#06051659000470">
	<p pid="b.232.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on securing this debate on the financing of the Olympics. It is of course only six weeks since the London Olympic Games and Paralympic GamesAct 2006 passed through the House, but three key things have changed since then. The first is that the Olympic Delivery Authority has been formed as a result of the Act. It is focusing its attention on land acquisition, site assembly and, particularly, the businesses. Secondly, the Olympic precept has hit the doorsteps&mdash;people are now paying for the games.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/2">Thirdly, the local elections have taken place. We had the same feedback in west London that the hon. Gentleman described. There is a clear feeling that people in the west of the capital are not benefiting from the process at all, and that came back time and again during the local election campaign. We have already spoken to the Minister and voiced our dissatisfaction about the party political broadcast. I suspect that in some subconscious way people's feelings were stirred up. There are many people in the west of London who believe that the games are very east London-centric and that they are not benefiting them. The first of five questions that I want to ask the Minister is about the plans of the Government and the Mayor to ensure that west London benefits from the Olympics in the same way that east London evidently will. I want to concentrate firmly on the financing of the Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/3">As the hon. Member for Twickenham said, the issue is a jungle, but it is best explained by breaking the Olympics down into four departments. The first is the area for which central Government are responsible. They have responsibility for the overall strategic direction, the legislation and the funding through the Exchequer and lottery. As the hon. Gentleman said, tied up in that are generic infrastructure improvements&mdash;exact cost unknown. The second department&mdash;these divisions correspond exactly to the four seats on the Olympic board&mdash;is the responsibility of the Mayor and the ODA. They are responsible for infrastructure; the estimate for that is &pound;2.375 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/4">The third department is that managed by LOCOG, which is effectively the event manager. It raises its income through sponsorship and merchandising. When we considered the Bill, we were told that LOCOG had to raise &pound;1.5 billion, as the hon. Gentleman said. In a written answer to me this week, the Minister for Sport suggested that that sum was too big. Finally, there is the BOA, which is responsible for training the athletes.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/5">The best analogy for that structure that I have heard is that of a theatre: the Government decide that having a theatre would be a good thing; the ODA and the Mayor build the theatre; LOCOG is the events manager who lays on the show; and the BOA ensures that the actors turn up ready to go, having learned their lines. That is the rough division.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/6">Let us consider those four areas one by one, starting with the Government. We debated the Government's part extensively during proceedings on the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act, and there are two points worth emphasising. First, there is still a crucial lack of protection for Londoners from any cost overruns that may occur. We suggested to the Minister&mdash;we proposed an amendment, supported by the Liberal Democrats, to this effect&mdash;that there be a cap on Londoners' contributions. In the absence of that cap, the feelings that the hon. Member for Twickenham mentioned will continue. There is a real worry&mdash;particularly in west London, where the hon. Gentleman's constituency is&mdash;that costs will overrun and that Londoners will be left to pick up the tab. Until the Government address that, those concerns will continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/7">The second point to emphasise is that the Minister could have been spared the battle with the Treasury over funding that characterised the autumn and the spring and that caused so much unpleasantness if the Government had adopted either or both of the policies that we advocated at the time. They were: to return the tax on the Olympic lottery game as a one-off&mdash;that would have provided &pound;320 million, which would have comfortably paid for all the elite athlete provision&mdash;and to put back the four original pillars of the lottery. The other day, I was interested to note figures from the Library showing that since the lottery was reformed in 1998, &pound;3.2 billion has gone away from those four original pillars, although some of it has come back. That is quite a headline figure. If sport had received a quarter of that&mdash;&pound;800 million&mdash;it would be in a dramatically different place.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/8">The second of the four areas is the part played by the Mayor and the ODA. That is at the heart of this debate. London council tax payers are expected to contribute &pound;625 million. A KPMG review is in progress, and that will look into where costs have increased and where value can be added to the site, and so where the bill can be adjusted. However, there are five key things that give us worries about cost overruns. The first is the evidence. I am afraid that the evidence is simply that every single Olympic games up to now have substantially overrun their budget. Local taxpayers in Montreal are just now paying off the debts incurred in 1976. Sydney's budget was &pound;1 billion, but the games eventually came in at &pound;2.8 billion; <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" name="Christopher Fraser">the hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser)</phrase> alluded to that. The Athens budget of &pound;1 billion went up to &pound;5 billion. So the evidence is not at all encouraging; indeed, the one thing of which we can be sure&mdash;apart from death and taxation, of course&mdash;is that there will be an overrun on the Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/9">The second worry is that security costs are likely to soar. The budget was decided on before <phrase class="date" code="">7 July</phrase> last year. No Member of this House can believe that the international security situation will improve dramatically in the near future. I think that we would agree that, if anything, it is likely to get worse. It was the rising cost of security that caused Athens to run over budget so dramatically. I believe that the security budget is &pound;220 million. The question is whether the Minister still holds to that figure.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16b.233.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" speakername="Don Foster" colnum="233"  time="011:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0006.htm#06051659000471">
	<p pid="b.233.0/1">I urge caution on the hon. Gentleman. Was not a new Tetra security system established as a result of the increased cost of security in Athens, which has provided a lasting legacy? That could have been borne outside the Olympic costs. We have to be careful about where the different costs lie.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16b.234.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" speakername="Hugh Robertson" colnum="234"  time="011:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0006.htm#06051659000472">
	<p pid="b.234.0/1">I entirely take the point. However, the central point is that the original budget of&pound;220 million is unlikely to sustain the post <phrase class="date" code="">7 July</phrase> environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/2">Thirdly, I have always felt that there is a contradiction at the heart of the process. The Mayor has always been commendably honest about his reasons for supporting the Olympics: he wants to regenerate the east end of London; it is his lifetime's passion. However, that is not the Government's key priority; they want to deliver the 2012 Olympics on time and on budget, as the best games ever. The temptation for the Mayor to try to get a little more for his key lifetime's project of regenerating the east end will be irresistible. That will necessarily add to the pressures on the budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/3">Fourthly, the cost of acquiring land in the lower Lea valley&mdash;and therefore of site assembly&mdash;is bound to have risen dramatically since we secured the Olympics. That is an inevitable product of the market.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/4">Finally, to pick up on the point made so clearly by the hon. Member for Twickenham, I looked up the inflation rate of building costs, and the current estimate is that it stands at 7 per cent. However, the bid document shows it to be 3 per cent. My second question for the Minister is therefore this: is the funding package of &pound;2.375 billion still accurate, and in particular how have the estimates for security at&pound;220 million and for construction sector inflation at3 per cent. altered since we debated the Bill?</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/5">The third area of concern is to do with LOCOG. It has rightly received wide praise for the progress it has made since the bid was won&mdash;particularly, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> said, during the IOC visit. When the Bill was going through Parliament, we were told that LOCOG would have an operating budget of &pound;1.46 billion. That was made up of&pound;550 million from the IOC; &pound;310 million from ticket sales in its role as an event manager; &pound;100 million from revenue, licensing, merchandising and the like; and &pound;500 million from sponsorship. However, in answer a week ago to a written question that I tabled, the Minister told me that LOCOG's budget is now&pound;2 billion. My third question to the Minister is why has the budget risen from &pound;1.46 billion to &pound;2 billion, and when was that increase announced? In connection with that, does the Minister still stand by LOCOG's original expectation that it would produce a profit in excess of &pound;100 million? Clearly having to raise so much more must throw that profit forecast into doubt.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/6">My fourth area of concern is the BOA&mdash;the fourth pillar of the Olympic board. It is in the market looking for sponsorship. We have raised the issue with the Minister before. Private sponsorship is now an extraordinarily congested field&mdash;a point made by the hon. Member for Twickenham. As far as I could see in my brief survey, LOCOG is in for either &pound;1.5 billion or &pound;2 billion; UK Sport is looking for &pound;100 million, as announced by the Chancellor in the Budget; the Youth Sport Trust, albeit a charitable organisation that has already secured sponsorship for the UK school games, is also in the market looking for money; and the National Sports Foundation, which the Minister launched in April, is looking for private sponsors. That strikes me as an incredibly congested field. A number of sports bodies are likely to be competing with each other and possibly against each other, so my fourth question for the Minister is how does the DCMS, which is the only body that can regulate or act as umpire, plan to regulate the market, and what are its priorities?</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/7">London 2012 has two central sporting objectives. The first is to put more British athletes on the rostrum, and the second is to increase the number of people who take up sport. The first has been dealt with as a result of the Chancellor's announcement in the Budget, but the second very firmly has not. Many people are making encouraging noises about how we want to get more people, particularly young people, involved in and taking up sport for all its health and educational benefits. So far, however, no pot of money will pay for those improvements, and they will not happen by magic. The Greeks tell me that fewer of them participate in sports now, after the Olympics, than before. The Australians, whom I visited last month, told me that there was no discernable take-up in sport as a result of the 2000 Olympic games. The fifth question is how can the improvement in mass participation be financed? Connected to that, does the Minister believe that through Sport England, the structure is capable of delivering the improvement?</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/8">In conclusion, I congratulate the hon. Member for Twickenham on securing this timely and useful debate. I thank all those who have contributed, including my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk, and of course the hon. Member for Bath. I would like the Minister in his winding-up speech to address five key questions. First, what plans does DCMS have to ensure that the whole and not merely the east of London benefits from the games? Secondly, is the funding package of &pound;2.375 billion still accurate, and what are the estimates for security and construction sector inflation? Thirdly, why has LOCOG's budget risen from &pound;1.5 billion to &pound;2 billion, when was it announced, and does it still hold to its target of producing more than &pound;100 million in profit? Fourthly, how do the Government plan to ensure that the sponsorship market is properly regulated? Finally, how are the improvements in the mass participation agenda to be structured and delivered?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16b.235.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" speakername="Richard Caborn" speakeroffice="The Minister for Sport"  colnum="235"  time="012:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0006.htm#06051659000473">
	<p pid="b.235.0/1">I shall try to answer the many questions that have been asked, but first I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on securing the debate. It is always good to update the House, and this is an opportune time to do so. I shall try to answer the questions as I go through my response to the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/2">As has been reflected again this morning, <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-06">6 July 2005</phrase> was a momentous day. There was great rejoicing and a great feeling of pride when Jacques Rogge said London. Several of us present today were at the announcement, and we also saw the fantastic celebrations in London and the length and breadth of the United Kingdom. We must now manage those expectations into reality, and the hon. Gentleman brought us down to earth to start analysing how we are doing so. I hope that what I shall say will provide some assurances that we are well on the way with the management of the project. It will be managed probably as no other major project in which Government have been involved has been.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/3">We are determined that the London Olympic and Paralympic games will be a memorable and inspirational event that leaves a lasting sporting, social and economic legacy, and that not only London but the nations and regions throughout the United Kingdom benefit and gain from it. It has rightly been said that the challenge facing us is formidable. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> said, the biggest construction project in Europe is terminal 5, which is running at &pound;5 billion, but we are embarking on a project twice the size in half the time. By any standards, it is a challenge, but the prize is a legacy that will last for generations.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/4">The regeneration of the Lea valley&mdash;one of the most deprived parts of the UK&mdash; will make it into a stage fit for the greatest sporting and cultural show on earth. Although we rightly focus on the Olympic games, we must put the event in context. It is the gateway to the Gateway: the gateway to the Thames Gateway, which is a 20-year project and, again, probably one of the largest investments in transport, social and housing infrastructure anywhere in Europe. What we are discussing will bring about between &pound;13 billion to&pound;15 billion of investment, with a lasting legacy of not just a stadium or other sports facilities but housing, as we have heard, improved transport infrastructure, schools and health care. That is an integrated regeneration package, of which the Olympics are part.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/5">The games will also bequeath a powerful sporting legacy to the whole UK, as I have said. Those 60 days in 2012 will give many young people throughout the UK the unique opportunity to see elite sportsmen and women competing at close hand. I have talked to people who saw the 1948 Olympics, and the experience is vivid in the mind of many of them. I hope that tens of thousands of young people will for years to come be affected in that way.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/6">We have heard many times about the inspiration of competing in one's own country. We are determined to capitalise on that, creating a new generation of elite sportsmen and women in the UK. London will inherit major new sports facilities, including an aquatics centre, a velo park, a hockey arena, an indoor sports arena and the main stadium, but the UK will also benefit from top-class sports facilities. That is how what we are doing differs from Australia's approach and that of many other countries that have won the right to stage the Olympics in the past. Through the nations and regions group we shall invest&mdash;and are already investing&mdash;in sport and recreation facilities. An impetus is added in the Olympic context.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/7">The work will also bring considerable lasting benefit to business and the economy throughout the UK. The games are expected to create 7,000 jobs in the construction industry alone. In addition, a further 12,000 jobs could be created as a result of the legacy development of the Olympic park area. A cultural Olympiad is planned to coincide with the games and a wide range of cultural events will be staged throughout London and the UK. Jobs are likely to be created in the cultural sector as a result, and stage managers, lighting technicians, producers and artists will co-ordinate a massive programme of events.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/8">The games will also offer a considerable boost to the tourism industry in the UK, by putting this country in the biggest shop window in the world. The games are seen by billions of people, and visitors will naturally want to see what else the UK has to offer. It is essential to consider tourism&mdash;a matter that the hon. Member for Twickenham raised. It has always been difficult to get visitors to one of the most famous capitals in the world, if not the most famous, to go to other parts of the United Kingdom. The games give us an opportunity to do that. Only yesterday I was discussing with representatives of visitBritain how we could capitalise on the Olympics and other sports events and use London as the gateway to the rest of the UK. We are now receiving a level of co-operation from Visit London that we have not had before.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/9">I am fairly confident that we shall be able to do what was done in Sydney where there were an extra1.6 million visitors between 1997 and 2001, with a spending power of 6 billion Australian dollars between them. We should expect to do equally well or, I should hope, better, in 2012. Tourism industry leaders forecast that hosting the 2012 games should be worth at least &pound;2 billion to our visitor economy. Those benefits will fall particularly on London. However, we are committed to ensuring that the 2012 Olympics will maximise the potential for job creation, training and business growth throughout the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/10">Early progress has been made, as both Government and Opposition Members have I think acknowledged, as, recognising the need for fast progress, we either passed or at least framed much of the relevant legislation ahead of <phrase class="date" code="">6 July</phrase>, to get a flying start if London proved successful. By <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March</phrase> this year, more than &pound;40 million had been spent on essential preparatory works. To date the Chancellor has announced an additional investment of &pound;200 million in our most talented athletes between now and 2012. The London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006 has received Royal Assent, and I want to acknowledge the support that we received from all parties in the House, and indeed in the other place.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/11">The Olympic Delivery Authority has been established and its board appointed. Its board is one of the most significant to have been created while I have been the Minister, and I was very pleased at the number of people who came forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/12">Let me digress slightly, however, on the issue of the Olympic board. The IOC delegation came here to look at the progress that is being made, and everybody will acknowledge that its report was very good, but I get very concerned when I see articles that are as ill-informed as the one in yesterday's <i>Evening Standard</i>. It was headed &quot;Get a grip now on the Olympics,Ms Jowell&quot; and was written by Rowan Moore, who I understand&mdash;I have never met the guy&mdash;is the paper's architectural critic. The IOC delegation made it clear that it gets all the cuttings from the British press, and its members are incredibly well informed&mdash;they know what goes on in Select Committee and in the press.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/13">Let me quote just one bit of Rowan Moore's article to show how ill informed he is. He writes:</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/14" class="indent">&quot;For much of the time since the bid was won, it has been hard to know who is in charge. It took months to announce the chief executive of the Olympic Delivery Authority, when it could usefully have been done a day after the victory.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/15">A 10-year-old student of politics would know a lot more about how this place works than Rowan Moore does, and the headline ought to be &quot;Rowan Moore, get a grip on the facts&quot;, but the fact remains that the article will now appear in the IOC's files. Rowan Moore is doing a disservice to the Olympics and to this nation. As Opposition Members have said, no one could have been more open than the Department, and I invite Rowan Moore to check his facts.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/16">What concerns me more, however, is that when the Secretary of State asked the editor of the <i>Evening Standard</i> whether we could have the right to reply to the article just to put the record straight&mdash;after all, we are talking about a national programme&mdash;she was denied that right. I say this more in sorrow than in anger, but that article, with its ill-informed commentary, will now be in the IOC's file, and we do not even have the right to reply to put the record straight. Broadly speaking, in the run-up to London winning the bid, editors and the press were very supportive&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.238.6/1">May I draw the Minister back to the debate? As I sat on the Back Bench, I noted that he was asked more than 37 questions, but he has spent the past three and a half minutes on what I would suggest is a rant about an issue that he should take up outsidethe Room. He should perhaps spend the next 13 to15 minutes answering our questions, which are totally relevant and which would give him the opportunity to put on the record his support for our comments and to let us know that the financial probity of the games is secure, rather than spending time on a rant against a newspaper.</p>

	<p pid="b.239.0/1">I totally reject that. I would not have had to come here to say what I did had the <i>Evening Standard </i>been reasonable about a national project and given us the right of reply. This is the only place where I can say that that was fundamentally wrong and that it will do a lot of damage to the British case&mdash;it is power without responsibility. If people write such things and know that they are fundamentally wrong, but then deny us the right of reply, the issue needs raising. However, I will leave it at that.</p>

	<p pid="b.239.2/1">If the hon. Gentleman wants another Adjournment debate, he can have one. I am more than willing to spend hours in front of hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.2/2">The EDAW consortium has been appointed to design the Olympic park and infrastructure. The relocation of high-voltage overhead power lines into tunnels underground is under way to deliver an essential improvement to the environment of the Olympic park. A charitable trust to support cultural and sporting initiatives associated with the games has been announced. That initiative is worth &pound;35 million and will see the end of the Millennium Commission with the funding going to the trust. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-24">24 January</phrase>, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport hosted a business summit, which was attended by more than300 business representatives and was massively oversubscribed. The summit set out the key challenges and opportunities facing business, including up-to-date information about procurement. That was followed up with a further business summit in the west midlandson <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May</phrase>, which was organised by the regional development agency, Advantage West Midlands, which is very proactive. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-30">30 January</phrase>, the Olympic Delivery Authority announced updated plans for the Olympic park site. Camelot's income target for raising lottery income for 2005-06 was met, and indeed exceeded by some &pound;2 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.2/3">The first &quot;Go for Gold&quot; scratchcard was launched on <phrase class="date" code="">28 July</phrase> and sold faster than any other &pound;1 scratchcard launched by Camelot since November 2002. A second edition was issued in September 2005. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February 2006</phrase>, a new &pound;1 winter sports scratchcard, &quot;Win Gold&quot;, was also launched. During its recent visit, the International Olympic Committee expressed itself well pleased with the progress that is being made.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.2/4">In 2003 the Government agreed a public sector funding package of &pound;2.375 billion to deliver the Olympic venues and infrastructure and to secure the development of athletes. The package will be funded from the Olympic lottery, the sports lottery, other lotteries, the Greater London Authority and the London Development Agency. The bulk of the package&mdash;&pound;1.5 billion&mdash;will be met from the lottery. The Olympic lottery has already raised some&pound;16 million. It is expected to raise a total of &pound;96 million in 2006-07 and to deliver a total of &pound;750 million by 2012. The sports lottery will deliver &pound;340 million for elite athletes and associated sports infrastructure. The &pound;200 million of Exchequer money that the Chancellor announced in the Budget is on top of that.</p>

	<p pid="b.240.0/1">That is at the heart of the debate. Is the Minister saying that the &pound;2.375 billion is robust?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16b.240.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" speakername="Richard Caborn" colnum="240"  time="012:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0007.htm#06051659000485">
	<p pid="b.240.1/1">I will come to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.1/2">Other lottery funding of up to &pound;410 million will come on stream from January 2009-10. The London Development Agency will deliver up to &pound;250 million from 2008-09. The GLA has agreed to contribute up to &pound;625 million from the London council tax precept. The funding that comes on stream this year accounts for around a quarter of the public sector funding package. I recognise&mdash;this was clearly spelled out during the London local elections&mdash;that hon. Members are concerned about the impact of the precept on London council tax payers, particularly in west London. However, to put the financial impact in context, it is expected that average London home owners in band D properties will pay 38p a week, or a total of &pound;20 a year. As hon. Members know, that formula has been used in many United Kingdom cities, including Manchester for the Commonwealth games and Sheffield for the World Student games. That is reasonable because those cities received considerable investment in their infrastructure. The formula has been tested, and given the massive benefits that the games will bring to the UK and particularly to London as a whole, we feel that it is justifiable to put that financial burden on London.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.1/3">I recognise that hon. Members are concerned about the risk of increased gambling addiction&mdash;the hon. Member for Bath raised the matter&mdash;resulting from the Olympic lottery. The Gambling Commission will be looking at the monday lottery, and if there is a move away from what Parliament intended, we will revisit the matter. We believe that the risk of problem gambling will be very low. The national lottery is not generally associated with problem gambling. Indeed, around70 per cent. of the adult population play the National Lottery, but spend relatively small amounts of money. The average weekly spend on the lottery was just over &pound;2.84 in 2004-05. In 2004, only 3 per cent. of calls to GamCare&mdash;the organisation that looks into problem gambling issues&mdash;concerned national lottery products. Olympic lottery games need to be approved by the National Lottery Commission, and the NLC's statutory duties include preventing excessive play. It would not license a game that it considered encouraged that.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" name="Hugh Robertson">The hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson)</phrase> raised the issue of how cost increases would be addressed. We went round the world and looked at cities that had staged the games: Munich, Barcelona, Sydney and Moscow. We also looked at what Athens and Beijing were doing. The cities that we looked at, Sydney especially, were generous in giving us advice. As I have said before, two or three major themes emerged from that. One is that the first two years are crucial if people are to keep costs on track. What is needed is a company with the powers of compulsory purchase, which we have, and planning, and a robust budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.1/5">It is also important to ensure that there will be a sustainable legacy. If there was any failure in Sydney, it related to the legacy. Sydney is spending &pound;10 million a year servicing not debt but a main stadium that does not have a tenant. Another problem is that there are now two arenas in Sydney, although it wishes that there was only one. The tennis went down to Melbourne, which now has a massively underused tennis park. The legacy is important in terms of both sports infrastructure and the cost of that. We have considered the issue carefully as we have gone through the process.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.1/6">It also became apparent to us that there are three stages to an Olympics. One is winning the right to stage the games, and we put together a formidable team to do just that for 2012. The second stage is producing the infrastructure, which basically involves construction and which we are doing through the ODA. The third stage is to deliver the games, which is the role of LOCOG. That body is chaired by Seb, and Paul Deighton is the chief executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.1/7">The overarching body is the Olympic board. There are three stakeholders: the Government, the Mayor and the British Olympic Association. The Olympic board provides a strategic overview. The Government have learned the lessons of Wembley and the dome. There will be no Government interference in the ODA other than to give clear instructions and to ensure that it carries out its duty within a budget that will be defined and negotiated with the ODA. The ODA board is skilled; indeed, it has expertise like no other board that we have put together. I am very confident that the chief executive, the chairman and indeed the entire board will carry out the project and will do so with transparency.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.1/8">We are committed to tight control of the funds, but we have never shied away from the possibility that costs will increase. The Government have given assurances that they will act as ultimate financial guarantor should there be a shortfall between Olympic costs and revenues. The 2003 memorandum of understanding between the Government and the Mayor envisages how any cost increase would be managed. We have rehearsed this many times in Committee, but I repeat that the memorandum explains that, should the shortfall between Olympic costs and revenues exceed &pound;2.075 billion, the Government would expect to discharge that responsibility in a sharing arrangement to be agreed as appropriate with the Mayor of London, and through seeking additional national lottery funding in amounts to be agreed at the time.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.1/9">A number of hon. Members are suggesting that we place a cap on the amount of London council tax that can be drawn on to support the development of venues and infrastructure for the Olympic games. As we have rehearsed, we do not accept that proposal. Capping the share of one contributor would simply increase the amount required from others. That would not be consistent with the pressure that needs to be exerted to keep costs down. Nor does it seem reasonable that council tax payers in west London should not make a contribution to the cost of the games. London as a whole is a major beneficiary of the games, so it is only fair that council tax payers in London as a whole should bear an appropriate share of the costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.1/10">Hon. Members will know that we are undertaking a review of costs, which includes building inflation. In the light of that review, we shall consider howany additional costs should be met within the terms of the arrangements agreed. The cost review work embraces many strands, including security, venuesand infrastructure, reducing risk, contingencies and taxation. Maximising private investment is also important in the review. Any revised estimates will be reported only when they have been agreed and when the cost review has been completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.1/11">The staging of the games is the responsibility of LOCOG, whose budget is now &pound;2 billion, which takes into account inflation from 2004 through. The move from &pound;1.4 billion to &pound;2 billion is due to the costs of inflation over the period of the games.</p>

	<p pid="b.242.0/1">Wait a minute. Inflation over a six-year period cannot be 33 per cent. If the budget has gone up from &pound;1.5 billion to &pound;2 billion, that is a&pound;500 million or 33 per cent. increase. Is the Minister really saying that he expects inflation to equal 33 per cent. over the relevant period? That would be far in excess of the Treasury's estimates.</p>

	<p pid="b.242.1/1">The advice that I have been given is that the reason for the move from &pound;1.5 billion to &pound;2 billion is the calculation on inflation. If the calculation is less, the figure will be less than &pound;2 billion, but that is the calculation that has been made, and that is why the figure has moved from &pound;1.5 billion to &pound;2 billion. Ifthe hon. Gentleman wants, we can go back to that issue. I shall write to him.</p>

	<p pid="b.242.2/1">For clarity, will the Minister confirm that he is saying that the operating costs of LOCOG to run the games are, on a real-cost basis, exactly the same now as when we first discussed them, and that the only difference is in which year's base we are talking about?</p>

	<p pid="b.242.3/1">Yes, the advice that I have been given is that the reason for the move from &pound;1.5 billion to the figure that I have given was the calculation on inflation. If that is wrong, up or down, we shall adjust the figure.</p>

	<p pid="b.242.4/1">One final problem: it seems extraordinary to me that that figure should not have been used in the first place, because presumably that calculation can be made. Will the Minister guarantee that the same problem will not occur with all the other budgets, and that they have been done at 2005 figures? Will the &pound;2.375 billion, for example, need to be compounded by 33 per cent. as well?</p>

	<p pid="b.242.5/1">As I said, there has been a review on costs. The hon. Gentleman asked me about LOCOG and I gave him the answer on LOCOG. We are reviewing those costs. In 2004, the figures in the17 chapters of the candidate file were costed at 2004 figures. That is now under review. As the hon. Gentleman knows, before we won the bid on <phrase class="date" code="">6 July</phrase>, we had to keep very firmly to those 17 chapters because we were making a bid. From November 2004 to <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-06">6 July 2005</phrase>, we kept to that very religiously, as any change in cost would have been detrimental to our bid.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.5/2">Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-06">6 July 2005</phrase>, we have gone through the cost review to which I referred. The KPMG study will be built into the ODA's. It is looking at areas such as construction inflation as well&mdash;the hon. Gentleman said that that was 7 per cent., although I do not know whether that is true. These are exercises that we would expect to go through after making the bid. I have said clearly that once the cost review has been completed, we shall come back and report.</p>

	<p pid="b.243.0/1">I am confused. Thirty-three per cent. is a hell of a hit and considerably in advance of the Treasury's estimates. Inflation is running at about2 per cent.; if one compounds that over six years, there is no way that it comes to 33 per cent. Clearly, we are not going to make much further progress on the issue this afternoon. Will the Minister agree to write to all Members who have attended this debate to explain the situation? There is a disparity between 2 per cent. compounded over six years and 33 per cent.&mdash;one does not need to be a banker to work that out. We need to nail the issue down.</p>

	<p pid="b.243.1/1">I was asked why the figure had moved from &pound;1.5 billion to &pound;2 billion. My answer was based on my officials' advice, which was that the later figure included the inflation from 2004. If the figure is greater or less than &pound;2 billion, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman to inform him. However, that is the reason for the increase.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.1/2">A substantial proportion of LOCOG's expenditure will be met by sponsorship and the legislation has been drafted specifically to protect LOCOG's right to raise sponsorship. LOCOG has the rights to deal with the sponsorship and any illegal actions, as was clearly explained when the Bill was going through Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.1/3">Finally, we have a lot more to do to convince people that the games are going to be beneficial throughout the UK, and not just in London.</p>

	<p pid="b.244.1/1">Helen Jones (Warrington, North) (Lab): I begin by congratulating the Government on the improvements that they have made in further education and on recognising the importance of the sector in their White Paper. The contribution that FE can make to improving our skills base, widening opportunities for 14 to 19-year-olds and addressing my particular concern of giving second chances to those who may not have had the educational advantages that they deserved is vital if we are to improve our educational standards and maintain a vibrant economy. It is fair to say that the Government have recognised that with the investment that they have put in; I believe that it has increased by 48 per cent. in real terms since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/2">The results can be seen in bricks and mortar in constituencies such as mine. My local college has a&pound;27 million new build, which will replace outdated and unsuitable buildings with something fit for the21st century. In turn, the investment has produced rising success rates in FE; there has been a rise from59 per cent. in 2001-02 to 72 per cent. in 2003-04. We know that more 19-year-olds get level 2 qualifications and that more people are completing apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/3">Nothing that I say today is intended to detract from that success, which is real and life-transforming for many people. I do not suggest that we do not need to focus on skills and on ensuring that more people stay on at 16. That has been a blot on our educational record for far too long in this country, but we are making progress in that area. Some 8 per cent. of people in their 20s do not have any qualifications, and although that figure is still far too high, we are making progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/4">We have a mountain to climb in respect of the people who left school 20, 30 or 40 years ago. We should focus on one stark fact: 24 out of every 100 adults aged between 40 and 64 have no qualifications. Those adults will need to reskill if they are to participate in the labour market. It is estimated that in the next decade two out of three jobs will be filled by adults rather than by new entrants to the labour market, so we should not neglect their needs. The difficulty that we need to discuss is how we get such people, particularly those with no qualifications, back into education. That is not always done in the way that we might expect. In my experience, many people first come back into education by doing shorter courses at venues that are not threatening. We should not underestimate how difficult it is for people who have failed in the past just to get through the doors of a college.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/5">If we do not succeed, the penalties will be stark. I looked at the latest figures that I could find&mdash;those for 2004&mdash;and they were clear. Some 49 per cent. of those with no qualifications were in employment, whereas71 per cent. of those who had a level 1 qualification and 75 per cent. of those who had a level 2 qualification were. I am sure that the figures have risen since then, but the ratio will have remained similar.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/6">The penalties for a lack of learning are low income, periods of unemployment and even an effect on people's health. I looked at the 2001 census, and it struck me starkly that the rate of limiting long-term illness among men who are long-term unemployed or who have never worked is three times that among people who have worked. Of course, some of that is because such people have been ill and cannot work, but some of it represents a consequence. There is an associated set-up of low income, unemployment and ill health, which costs not just the individuals, in wasted talent and blighted lives, but all of us.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/7">I understand why the Government wanted to focus adult learning on those without qualifications and set key targets on skills for life and on first level 2 qualifications. Rightly, there are now no fees for people seeking first level 2 qualifications, and under the train to gain programme employers can obtain free training and development for those working towards a level 2 qualification. I applaud that, because it is the right thing to do, but I want to examine its unintended consequences&mdash;I stress that they are unintended.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/8">We are losing many courses that bring people back to education in the first place. Let us be frank. We have not been very good at reaching those with no qualifications in the past. The last time I asked, last year's national adult learning survey was not available, but the trend in previous surveys is clear. Participation in adult learning is highest among people with professional and managerial jobs and lowest among unskilled manual workers.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/9">The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education surveys show the same sort of pattern. We have been much more successful in increasing participation among people in socio-economic group C2, but the participation rate of people in groups D and E has remained almost constant from 1996 to 2005; it is still 26 per cent. My hon. Friend the Minister will know that the one area in which that trend is bucked is adult and community learning. In the winter of 2002, 9 per cent. of people in adult and community learning had no qualifications. By winter 2004, that had gone up to 17 per cent. At the same time, the rate in FE hardly rose. It went from 6 per cent. to 7 per cent. We need to learn the lessons of that and apply them elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/10">I fear that our targets might have different effects to those intended. It is easy to meet the targets for people getting a level 2 in colleges by taking on people who are already close to that level. I was surprised to learn, when the Learning and Skills Council came before the Education and Skills Committee, that it did little in the way of considering the social profile of adult learners. The council admitted that it could have the same number of people on courses but an entirely different profile to the target group. In other words, it could be that while targets are being met, some of those who are most in need are being neglected. Although the council considers the socio-demographic characteristics in an area before planning its courses, we need to do much more research into those who are actually engaged in learning. I have not seen the results of the Mosaic pilots, but I hope that we will see them soon, because there needs to be more research in that area.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/11">The Government rightly want to improve qualifications among 16 to 19-year-olds, but while spending on them will increase by 4 per cent. in the coming year&mdash;we are spending more on people with disabilities and on learning difficulties&mdash;part of the adult learning budget will be squeezed. I asked a parliamentary question about the changes in the budget for adult and community learning in different LSC areas, but have not yet received an answer. The Association of Colleges estimates that there will be a7 per cent. drop overall. We therefore assume that asking colleges to increase their fee income from certain courses would mean focusing money on those most in need. I accept that that is the Government's intention, but I do not think that it always happens in reality. Some of the reductions being made are in courses such as first aid, food hygiene and health and safety, which are often the first courses that people take which bring them back into education.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/12">Liverpool community college&mdash;I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1688" name="Louise Ellman">myhon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside(Mrs. Ellman)</phrase> has secured a debate on Liverpool later today&mdash;is looking at a reduction of &pound;1.5 million next year. In North Yorkshire, there was a 16 per cent. cut from 2004-05 to 2005-06 in the adult learning budget. Some of the courses that went were courses for classroom assistants and on British sign language, and some craft courses. There is an argument that some of the people on those courses can afford to pay, but there is also an argument that some people take them precisely because they are not threatening. They are the courses that get people through the door to adult learning in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/13">To give the Minister an example, the college in my area ran very successful courses in schools and community centres on subjects such as &quot;Help your child to read&quot;, first aid, and the one that I always call &quot;Computing for the terrified&quot;, although that is not its name. A lot of mothers went on those courses because they were directly relevant to their children, but I can point to people who went on to further education after one of those courses. Some have become classroom assistants, and highly qualified classroom assistants at that, but normally we would never have got them through the doors of the college in the first instance, and that is the key. We need to know what motivates people to take up learning.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/14">Let me give the Minister another example. The union learning fund and the college run a learning centre in a council depot in my constituency. A lot of our bin men take courses there, and when I went to ask what the most popular were, they said computing. Also, a lot of them learn Spanish for their holidays. Are those courses directly relevant to being a bin man? No, although I would like to say that they are very good bin men and they never drop things on the paths and so on. Do courses then spark people's appetite for learning, because through them people achieve things that they never thought they could? Yes.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/15">The problem is that we do not have real research on what sparks people's appetite for learning; we do not really know. However, the history of adult education in this country shows that it has been most successful when it has built on people's interests and led them on from there. We need to learn those lessons. The union learning fund, which is one of the unsung successes of this Government, and the adult and community learning fund are very good at doing that, but adult and community learning is only 6 per cent. of the Learning and Skills Council's adult learning budget, which is itself being squeezed. According to the Department's own estimates, the result will be a loss of about 500,000 adult learning places from one year to the next.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/16">I know that my hon. Friend the Minister will quote the neighbourhood learning in deprived communities fund, and that is an excellent initiative, but when I last looked, there were only 30,000 places under it. That does not replace the other adult education places that are being lost.</p>

	<p pid="b.247.0/1">My hon. Friend has talked a lot about adult courses being lost, and that is a concern for a college that I represent in Gateshead, but there is a further point that she has not picked up on; I do not know whether it applies only to Gateshead&mdash;perhaps the Minister can help on that. It is the loss of dedicated courses for people with learning difficulties. Rightly, the learning opportunities for people such as bin men, who I have had the privilege of representing for many years, are about much more than just what they do at work. However, for people with learning disabilities, the issue is actually about their whole life; not just education but what they do if they are not in education. What do they do with their lives during the day?</p>

	<p pid="b.247.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Clearly, in some areas there is a difficulty for colleges and social services about what should be provided for people with learning difficulties and where that should be provided. We see that in my area, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/2">My plea is for the Minister to look again at the subject. I accept that the Government did not intend there to be such consequences; the law of unintended consequences operates in so many areas. We should get some proper research on the effect of the policy on some of the people whom we most need to bring back into education. I ask him to imagine what the situation would be if he had failed in education in the past, and had had a very bad experience of education. What would bring him back? I suggest that it would be something immediate, fairly short and with an attainable goal; something not directly related to work skills at first, but that could lead on. If there is to be progression, which the Government want&mdash;and I accept that that is the right goal&mdash;we must first get people through the doors. If we do not do that, they cannot progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/3">I hope that the Minister will look at the 1999 report from the policy action team in the social exclusion unit, which said that we needed to take a much broader view of the skills needed. People need a wider range of skills to keep themselves in employment, including confidence, motivation and the ability to present themselves and navigate the labour market. A lot of courses give people confidence and motivation. We could have an entire debate about the structure of adult education and education as a good in itself, which I firmly believe in, but I am concentrating on those who might fall through the net because courses are disappearing.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/4">I urge the Minister to look at our successes in adult and community learning, at how the trade union learning fund has worked and at some proper research on what is happening and who is losing out, and not to see all adult education or adult and community learning as the same thing. I urge him to remember that those adults whom we need to get into learning and on to the skills path will be the mainstay of our economy as the population changes and ages.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/5">The Minister is interested in the issue and has some concerns about it, so let me tell him that the experience of many of us on the ground is that sometimes what happens is not necessarily what those in Whitehall think happens. Let us take a real look at what gets people back on to the learning path. We talk about the learning society, but we always talk about the supply side. Let us also talk about how we create the demand for learning and try to ensure that we do not let people with no qualifications at all lose out.</p>

Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones)</phrase> that I would like to intervene in her speech, but having listened to what she said, I should like to congratulate her on the timeliness of this important debate and to take a minute to make a few points to the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.0/2">Self-improvement is important to all members of the community. Does the Minister agree with the women's institute in my constituency, which says that cuts in the adult learning budget are &quot;very short-sighted&quot; and that they will impact on local communities and social groups, as well as on individual learners? I am sure that the Minister agrees that democratic adult learning, as part of a tradition of self-improvement, has changed the lives of people who, for social or economic reasons, have had little or no access to education, and that it should be safeguarded by public funding policies. Does the Minister understand the dismay that women's institutes throughout the country have expressed at older learners being excluded from adult education because of the cut in funding? Older learners are being denied their right to lifelong learning in the way that the hon. Lady so well articulated.</p>

	<p pid="b.248.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1907" name="Helen Jones">my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones)</phrase> on securing a genuinely important debate and on the consistency with which she pursues such issues. It is right and proper that we should be having this discussion.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/2">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for rightly giving credit for what has happened in the further education sector generally since 1997. We can collectively be proud of what we have achieved. She referred to the48 per cent. real-terms increase in funding since 1997, which contrasts favourably with the 14 per cent. real-terms cut that took place in the five years running up to 1997. I agree with her that that transformation can be seen most effectively in capital expenditure. I visit further education colleges up and down the country, so I have seen the practical progress that is being made, including in qualifications. The latest figures show that the success rate has risen from 59 per cent. to 75 per cent. That is a genuine improvement.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/3">My hon. Friend raised a number of issues to which I want to respond, but before doing so I should like to outline the backdrop, to explain the policy direction in which we are moving. Our overall objectives are to meet our future skill needs; to ensure that people maximise their potential through learning both as individuals and as members of families, local communities and a flexible and adaptable work force; and to establish the priorities for public funding of adult learning and a new balance of who pays for what, between the state, employers and individuals, in line with the benefits that they receive. Finally, we aim to reform the further education sector, to make it more responsive to the needs of the economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/4">The skills strategy is at the centre of the debate. We live in a world where new markets, new places of production and new skilled work forces are emerging with astonishing speed. World trade is doubling every decade. Last week I visited China with a higher and further education delegation, where, unbelievably, trade is doubling every three years. Chinese wage costs are still just 5 per cent. of those of the European Union. We face a colossal challenge from those pressures, and if we do not respond we will be blown away by the global competition.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/5">A few figures bring home the scale of the challenge and the skills gap that we face in this country: one third of adults are not at full level 2, which is the basic school-leaving qualification; 6 million adults are without functional literacy; and 17 million adults are without functional numeracy. The matter is a social and an economic imperative. The most effective way to tackle poverty and social exclusion is to give people skills so that they can get into the workplace.</p>

	<p pid="b.249.0/1">I made the point earlier about what happened at Gateshead. There is an economic impact as 30 jobs might go among the teaching staff because of the decisions that have been made, but there is also an economic impact on other public bodies. If disabled people are not in the classroom learning, they will probably have to go to day centres or hospitals, where they do not necessarily need to be. That will be the upshot of a policy that is not at all welcome in our area.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16b.249.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" speakername="Bill Rammell" colnum="249"  time="012:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0008.htm#06051659000499">
	<p pid="b.249.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that contribution. I actually signed a letter to him last night about the situation at Gateshead college. One of the points I made is that the Learning and Skills Council has gone through a very elongated process during the current allocation round in order to allocate funds to colleges. That happens at various stages. I ask my hon. Friend to wait until the end of the allocation round before passing judgment about the end game. I am reasonably confident that once we reach that stage the picture of overall funding for FE colleges will be very different from the one suggested by some. Regarding his second point, which he made earlier, the LSC has made it clear, as have the Government, that people with learning difficulties remain a priority. The figures that I have seen suggest that an overall cut is not taking place, but we undoubtedly need to keep the issue closely under review.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.1/2">The skills strategy is an imperative, and like my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North, I believe that the impact of qualifications and skills on people's health, overall participation in society and access to income-generating jobs is crucial.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.1/3">I shall now respond to some of the detailed points raised by my hon. Friend. She talked a lot about the danger of unintended consequences. In driving the policy through during the past year, both the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1512" name="Phil Hope">my hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Phil Hope)</phrase>, and I have been very conscious of the danger of unintended consequences, and we will keep the matter under active review.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.1/4">I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North that we do not want to lose good courses that demonstrably lead to progression. We made that clear in the grant letter from the former Secretary of State, when we asked for a good balance of learning opportunities for adults in every area. However, we also know that too much of the current provision, which is called &quot;first steps&quot; or &quot;return to learn&quot;, is more of a revolving door than a true pathway to progression. I shall explain what I mean by that.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.1/5">Our research suggests that the average number of years between attaining a qualification below level 2 and studying for full level 2 is 14 years. Most of us feel that that is far too long, which is why we announced in the recent White Paper the development of a new foundation learning tier. Through that, we intend to turn the current complex range of qualifications below level 2 into a coherent system of units that are easier for learners and employers to understand and which are based fundamentally on employability and life skills. The foundation learning tier will encompass a range of programmes, including clear pathways to progress to level 2. For those not able to achieve a full level 2, the foundation tier will also provide a rich mix of courses. As we made clear in the FE White Paper, over time and as resources allow, we intend to make that an entitlement.</p>

	<p pid="b.250.0/1">Will my hon. Friend undertake to look at the effect on women of the disappearance of some community courses? In my experience, a lot of women access learning in that way. Will he keep that matter under review?</p>

	<p pid="b.250.2/1">I will keep the matter under review, and to answer the hon. Gentleman, I shall meet the women's institute shortly to discuss some of those issues. The figures that I have show that women are well represented in the further education sector. We want to maintain that, and we must keep the issue under review.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/2">My hon. Friend also made important points about the social profile of learners. I take her point that there is concern that the lowest take-up is among the poorest groups. However, we have more information on the social profile of learners than is sometimes suggested. For example, of those doing their first full level 2 qualifications, almost one in four had no qualifications at all, and the remaining 76 per cent. had a qualification below level 2. I cite that example just to suggest that the targeting strategy has an effect and is working. However, I accept her point, and we must keep the matter under review and conduct more research into who benefits. I intend to take that work forward, and I shall keep in contact with her about that issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/3">I very much take my hon. Friend's point about family learning and extended schools. She gave as an example local courses where parents have the opportunity to help their children and, at the same time, help themselves through reading. There is no reason why such courses, where they are valued, should be lost. For example, we have specific programmes through the Learning and Skills Council, often run by local authorities and aimed at helping families learn together. The wider family learning programme is worth &pound;12 million a year and helps 50,000 families. The specific programme for family literacy and numeracy is &pound;25 million a year and helps 70,000 families.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/4">In addition, the Government have committed&pound;680 million in start-up funding during 2006 to 2008 to enable schools to provide access to the core offer of extended services. Part of that offer is parenting support, including sessions for parents to read with their children. It is an important initiative, and I am sure it will be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/5">My hon. Friend also talked about short courses and the policy that we are pursuing of moving away from short courses towards longer courses. The issue must be seen in perspective: the majority of short courses are short skills for life programmes and other&mdash;particularly IT&mdash;courses. The short skills for life courses should be part of larger programmes aiming for the achievement of qualifications. Other short courses appear to be of limited benefit to the progression of learners, and we must consider the issue in that context.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/6">My hon. Friend talked about the importance of personal and community development, and as she knows, we have maintained its level of funding. However, we have rightly said that we want LSC partnerships at a local level to determine better the priorities for that expenditure. We do not want it centrally driven to the same extent.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/7">My hon. Friend discussed the union learning fund, and like her I think that it is an unsung success story of this Labour Government. If I may make a political point, it is one of the most effective ways in which the Labour party and the trade unions work together. It has brought real benefits by introducing into the education and training system, through the support of their peers, people who would otherwise not have taken that approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/8">My hon. Friend talked about having a mountain to climb in terms of people who left school or college 20, 30, 40 years ago with no qualifications. It is the most significant challenge that we face. On all the evidence they are the people who miss out on social, economic, health and other advantages. We need to focus on reskilling those adults, and we are doing so through the level 2 &quot;Train to Gain&quot; initiative. It is one of the most radical policies that this Government have pursued: for the first time saying to adults in the workplace who do not have a full level 2 qualification that the state will guarantee that level of education and training.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/9">The recent change that we made in the further education White Paper to extend the free entitlement up to level 3 and the age of 25 is a significant step forward, as is the foundation learning tier to which I referred earlier. However, all that comes down to priorities, and we are a Government who have significantly increased investment in the further education sector. In that context, we have rightly said that the priorities must be 16 to 19-year-olds, adult basic skills, and the roll out of &quot;Train to Gain&quot;. We want to do more than that, but we cannot say that we have those priorities and then have a set of other priorities. I know that that is not what my hon. Friend is saying, and we need to keep the issues under review to monitor their impact. However, if we are saying that those core priorities are genuinely important, we must commit resources to them&mdash;</p>

	Tax Credit System (Angus)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16b.253.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" speakername="Michael Weir" colnum="253"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0009.htm#06051659000503">
	<p pid="b.253.1/1">I am pleased to appear for the first time under your distinguished chairmanship, Mr. Williams, and I am sure that this will be the first of many such occasions. I should say at the outset that the debate is not about the effectiveness or desirability of tax credits but about the way in which the system that is used to calculate and deliver them fails many of my constituents. Although I shall be referring to specific cases, they illustrate a general problem with the tax credits system.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/2">In my first term in Parliament, by far and away the most complaints that I received concerned the Child Support Agency, and no one was at all surprised when the Government effectively threw in the towel, conceded that the agency was unworkable and ordered a redesign. Sadly, over the past two years, the number of complaints about tax credits has risen substantially and now rivals the number of complaints about the CSA. Unless the Government take urgent action to tackle the problems, they will simply multiply, and we will end up in the same situation as we did with the ill-fated CSA. Several constituents have told me that they are so dispirited and worn down by the problems that they have encountered that they will no longer claim tax credits, even though they are entitled to them. That is a terrible indictment of a system that is supposed to help those who are most in need.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/3">The problems that I shall describe affect constituents across my constituency and, I assume, across much of the rest of the country. The first case that I want to bring to hon. Members' attention is that of Katie Adamson, from Forfar, who first came to my office in December 2005. She applied for child tax credit first as a single claimant and then jointly with Anthony O'Hare. Her problems began with the annual review in September 2005, when she received a letter asking whether there were any changes in her circumstances. There were not, so she phoned the department, and the person she spoke to told her that she could send the form back blank or not send it back, because confirmation that there had been no changes had, in effect, been recorded as a result of her call. Being a cautious and sensible young woman, however, she sent the form back anyway.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/4">Soon afterwards, Katie received a letter from the tax credits office informing her that it had heard nothing further regarding changes in her circumstances, so her tax credit would be stopped. At that point, she contacted the citizens advice bureau. The tax credits office told the bureau that it acknowledged the error and would recommence the payments. It may come as no great surprise, however, to hear that that did not happen, and that brings us to the crux of many of the problems with the system. As MPs, we contact the tax credit hotline or the tax credits office, and those involved acknowledge that a mistake has been made, but they seem incapable of rectifying it, because of the computer system that they operate. In many cases, we seem to have slipped into the &quot;Little Britain&quot; sketch in which the computer says no, and that is it.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/5">To return to the long-suffering Katie, however, nothing happened for 11 weeks, and the arrears accumulated. The computer system was blamed for the problem, although, to be fair, the department agreed to make a manual payment for four weeks. However, Katie had to make a 40-mile round trip to Dundee, at a not inconsiderable cost, to collect it, and she received nothing further after that. After she contacted my office, we contacted the technical department and were assured that the error had been sorted out and that payments would be made to her bank account as normal. Bizarrely, however, she was then told that she would receive the full arrears for 11 weeks, but that she would have to pay back the four weeks that she had received as a manual payment in the interim. Quite how that was a sensible way to deal with the situation escapes me.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/6">Finally, my office managed to secure arrears payments of &pound;224.94 for Katie. Even then, however, we noticed that she was still due &pound;85.96, so we contacted the department again to point that out. It accepted that there was an error and agreed to forward the arrears, but nothing has been received to date. That was bad enough, but at least Katie had got through the maze and got most of the money that she was due. However, nothing about the tax credit system is quite as simple as that. She and her partner Tony then received three award letters on the same day.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/7">The first letter related to Katie's single claim prior to December 2005 and claimed an overpayment of &pound;1,383.12. The tax credits office has since agreed that that was sent in error. The second notice claimed an overpayment of &pound;224.92. Yet that related to the period for which it had already been agreed that a payment of &pound;85.96 remained due to her. That contradicted what she had previously been told. The last letter referred to the new tax year, 2006-07. However, a portion of the overpayment referred to in the previous letter had been deducted wrongly from the award. We are still chasing the office about that. I do not know whether hon. Members can follow those complications, but I am sure that they can begin to appreciate the &quot;Little Britain&quot; sketch.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/8">Worse still, the tax credits office claimed an overpayment of &pound;1,210.20 for the tax year 2004-05. My office raised that several times, until the tax credits office finally responded that there was no record of any overpayments for that year, but repeated the claim that there was an overpayment of &pound;1,383.12 for 2005-06. That was the sum that it had previously agreed in writing was an error. It was going back and claiming something that it had already said was not due.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/9">This is just one case, but it is a complete mess and it illustrates a problem. Both my constituent and my office have been told one thing, only to receive correspondence totally at odds with the verbal advice and sometimes at odds with previous written advice. The computer gets the blame, but is there no point at which human interventions in the system can stop cases spiralling out of control and creating havoc for people like Katie Adamson?</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/10">If the case were an isolated one, I should put it down to bad luck, but it is far too general a problem. Ishall briefly note a few points about other cases. Another Forfar constituent&mdash;Forfar seems particularly unfortunate in experiencing such cases&mdash;faced a claim for more than &pound;10,000. The couple had made an application and received an award. Before it was paid, the husband was paid off, but quickly got another job at a reduced income. They received a letter telling them how much they would be paid, which they queried, saying that they thought it was incorrect; but they were assured that it was correct.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/11">Eventually, when the inevitable happened and money was reclaimed from them, they were told that the problem was that their two children had been input into the computer system twice. They appealed on that basis, only to discover later that the real reason was that the wrong income had been entered on the computer. Part of the problem appears to have been that the couple never received a formal award notice after the change of job setting out how the amount was calculated, but the tax credits office refuses to accept that.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/12">I can do no better than to quote a paragraph from a letter from my constituent:</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/13" class="indent">&quot;I still get the impression, from the person I spoke to, that the only way they will reconsider the matter is for me to prove that I did not receive a proper award notice, which is impossible. She said that the computer showed an award notice was sent and that would be correct&mdash;she could not answer when I asked whether their computer showing that I worked forty hours a week for nil pounds while claiming for child care would be correct too.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/14">Again, the computer says no. That seems to be the crux of the problem. The department relies on the computer absolutely, but will not consider that it could be wrong. It reminds me of the constituent who repeatedly questioned the amount that was awarded, and was assured that it was right. When, inevitably, a repayment was claimed, she received a letter saying that although she had been assured that it was correct, it was not reasonable for her to accept that. What definition of &quot;reasonable&quot; does the department use?</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/15">Yet another Forfar constituent had been receiving working tax credit since 2003. In October 2005 she was told that she was no longer entitled to it, and a repayment of &pound;1,200 was demanded. That was queried and the office agreed that it was a mistake and that she was still entitled to working tax credit. However, no payments were made in November, which left her very worried. When she contacted my office we contacted the department, which again pleaded computer error and promised manual payments. A manual payment was made in December, but in the same month she received three applications to complete and two demand letters, one for &pound;1,000 and one for &pound;700. She went to the Dundee office and was advised to appeal on both demands. She was then also told that the computer had now ended her claim&mdash;the computer seemed to be dealing with things all by itself.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/16">My office contacted the tax credits office and received a letter in response that was totally incomprehensible. I am a lawyer, and I could not understand what it said, so we contacted the tax credits office. Surprise surprise, it could not understand the letter either, even though it had sent it out. Perhaps the computer had moved on to composing the letters as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/17">In early March, the department promised to cease sending demand notices and to try to resolve the problem. Thankfully, for once, no more notices have been received but there has been no resolution either. That lady is still not receiving the money to which she is entitled. The case is unacceptable, and it has left this lady in worry. I wrote to one of the Minister's colleagues on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-03">3 April</phrase>, but I await a response.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/18">It is not just the people who have come to see me in my office who are having problems. After I secured the debate, Arbroath citizen's advice bureau&mdash;we have left Forfar, for a change&mdash;contacted me and brought to my attention a case that it was dealing with. A young couple had received an overpayment demand for more than &pound;19,000 for the period between 2003 and 2005. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-07">7 November 2005</phrase>, the CAB wrote to the Department and said:</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/19" class="indent">&quot;Please treat this case as a matter of urgency as it is having a major impact on the well being of our clients as well as creating a crisis in their ability to manage their finances.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/20">The department asked for a copy of the original application, which had been made online and of which the constituent had no copy, although I appreciate that that system has been changed in the interim. No response was received until April of this year, when the constituent received another demand notice. The CAB wrote again on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-10">10 April</phrase>, and made a formal complaint. It has now received an acknowledgement and a promise of a full reply, but that came only after a formal complaint was made. It is simply not good enough that it has taken six months from when the original application was made to reach that stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/21">Even this morning, I got yet another letter. A constituent had come to my office who had been chased for a repayment. The tax credits officer said that the payments had been made to their employer, but the employer denies that any such payments have been made. The letter states that due to technical difficulties the office is unable to bring my constituent's records up to date. Again, the computer is unable to deal with it.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/22">It seems to me that the problem is that the system is too complex and relies on a computer system that is not up to the task. There appears to be no process that allows human intervention to deal with a problem once it occurs. The demands keep coming, irrespective of what is said to me or to anyone else. Even when it is agreed that manual payments will be made and the person goes to collect them, the situation is not resolved, the computer does not deal with it and there seems to be no way to break into the cycle of the computer program. That is exacerbated further by the forms and letters, which are very difficult to understand. As I say, I am a lawyer and I find them difficult. Many of my constituents, who are far from being lawyers, simply cannot follow the information that is given to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/23">The time frame for dealing with cases often means that people are trying to reconstruct information from a number of years with little written information from the applicant, but a mountain of often contradictory information from the department. As I said at the outset, it seems that the complaints about tax credits are now rivalling those about the Child Support Agency. I appeal to the Minister to consider the problem seriously. I am sure that he will tell me that tax credits are a good thing, and are helping a lot of people. I am not here to dispute that or agree with it. I am here to ask about the system, in particular the computer system that seems to have a will of its own in dealing with my constituents. Unless the problem is tackled now, things will continue to deteriorate until, like the CSA, the tax credit system cannot continue. I appeal to the Minister to deal with the matter now, and to tackle that dreadful computer system.</p>

	<p pid="b.257.0/1">I begin by welcoming this debate, which is the first that I have answered as Chief Secretary. I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" name="Michael Weir">the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir)</phrase> for raising the topic and for his interest in and concern about the tax credit system. The debate is focused on Scotland, and the hon. Gentleman gave a number of examples of the unhappy experience of some people in Angus. However, it raises United Kingdom-wide tax credit policy issues. Alongside child benefit, the tax credit system now delivers significant financial support to the vast majority of families with children in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.257.0/2">I shall not even begin to attempt to defend the unhappy sagas described by the hon. Gentleman. He named Katie Adamson, but he did not name the individual concerned in the second case.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="b.257.1/1">I specifically asked Katie Adamson whether I could name her, because of the complexities of her case; for obvious reasons, other constituents preferred anonymity. However, I am happy to givefull details to the Minister if he wants to look into them.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16b.257.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1563" speakername="Stephen Timms" colnum="257"  time="013:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0009.htm#06051659000506">
	<p pid="b.257.2/1">I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman did so, because I shall certainly want to take up those cases with officials.</p>
	<p pid="b.257.2/2">As the hon. Gentleman anticipated, I want to tell the Chamber that we must not lose sight of what has been achieved through the tax credit system. It has beenvital in two important areas. First, it has reduced the extent of child poverty; and, secondly, it has made work pay.</p>
	<p pid="b.257.2/3">The system provides financial support, which is worth more than &pound;15 billion this year, to nearly 20 million people. In Scotland, it is worth about &pound;1.5 billion; and in the hon. Gentleman's constituency last month, 7,100 families benefited from tax credits, including 10,900 children. The hon. Gentleman is right to highlight the problems faced by some of his constituents, although they form only a small proportion of the 7,100 families who benefit from the system.</p>
	<p pid="b.257.2/4">The hon. Gentleman has raised 10 cases this year in which people have had a problem with tax credits, and I readily concede that it would have been much better if he had not had to raise any. My right hon. Friend the Paymaster General and I will be happy to look at the cases that he has referred to today, but I hope that he will acknowledge how much the tax credit system is delivering to a large number of families in his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.257.2/5">We have set a target&mdash;I am sure that the hon. Gentleman supports it&mdash;to eliminate child poverty within a generation. Tax credits have helped lift some 700,000 children out of relative poverty since 1997, including 80,000 in Scotland, which is broadly in line with the milestone that we set to reduce the number by a quarter by last year. The UNICEF report &quot;Child Poverty in Rich Countries 2005&quot; states:</p>
	<p pid="b.257.2/6" class="indent">&quot;The proportion of children living in poverty has risen in a majority of the world's developed economies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.257.2/7">However, it says that there are exceptions, and the country achieving the biggest reduction in that proportion has been the UK. It points out:</p>
	<p pid="b.257.2/8" class="indent">&quot;Until the late 1990s, the United Kingdom had one of the highest child poverty rates in the OECD.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.257.2/9">It then says that</p>
	<p pid="b.257.2/10" class="indent">&quot;over the last six years, the UK government has pioneered an approach to the monitoring and reduction of child poverty that seems to be working.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.257.2/11">The tax credit system has been key to that success.</p>
	<p pid="b.257.2/12">For a family with two children on half average earnings, the tax credit system provides &pound;4,400 a year. The least well-off can now receive up to &pound;107 a week, compared with just &pound;20 per week in 1997; and the number of people receiving tax credits is seven times higher than the number of those who received family credit.</p>

	<p pid="b.258.0/1">As I said at the outset, I am not here to criticise or agree with tax credits; it is the system that bothers me. Although I appreciate what the Minister says, does he not accept that, if constituents are telling me that they are no longer prepared to go through the hassle of claiming tax credit because of the situation that they find themselves in, something is wrong and that a simplified system is needed to deal with the problem?</p>

	<p pid="b.258.2/1">To be fair, that is not what I said.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16b.258.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1563" speakername="Stephen Timms" colnum="258"  time="013:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0009.htm#06051659000510">
	<p pid="b.258.3/1">That is what I understood. I would be happy to give way again in a moment, but it is important in the backdrop to this debate to set out why the system was introduced, why it has the characteristics that it has and what a great deal has been achieved through it, including for more than 7,000 families in his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.3/2">I accept that the system ought to work smoothly and that the problems to which the hon. Gentleman rightly drew attention must be put right. We have made several changes. Last year, my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General made some announcements which I shall outline in a moment. They started to take effect from last month and will continue progressively to take effect in the coming year. I hope that in the hon. Gentleman's constituency they will tackle effectively the kind of problems that he described.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.3/3">I do not for a moment want to gloss over the problems that he described or pretend that they do not exist. I know that there are significant problems exactly along the lines that he described. However, I should point out, first, that the system has achieved a great deal and, secondly, that we are on the case. I hope that he will detect over the coming weeks that we are putting right the problems that he drew to our attention.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.3/4">The tax credit system has had a big impact in reducing child poverty. Take-up has been high from the start&mdash;much higher than for predecessor income-related benefits. The system has also had a big impact in helping to make work pay. Together with the national minimum wage, it can guarantee a minimum level of income for people moving into employment, thereby helping to ensure that work pays over welfare. For example, a lone parent with two children moving into full-time work on the national minimum wage will have an income gain from working that is 40 per cent. greater in real terms than would have been the case in 1997. That contributes to stability in the economy and has helped to increase the number of people in work by 2.3 million to the historically high levels of employment that are such a positive feature of the UK economy today.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.3/5">As I said, it is certainly not my intention to gloss over the serious difficulties that the hon. Gentleman highlighted. The system is complex and has to be because of the complexity of people's lives. Every year, 3 million people change jobs, and 200,000 men and women move into new or better jobs and raise their family income by more than &pound;10,000. We need a system that reflects that and that can support people as they move between jobs and change their circumstances, and that is what we have designed the system to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.3/6">Overpayments, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, are a consequence of a responsive system. Under an annual system, given that a family's final entitlement cannot be known until the end of the year, we have to be able to make end-of-year adjustments. We can avoid that only with an entirely inflexible fixed system that would not offer the flexible support that is such a valuable feature of the present system.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16b.259.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" speakername="Michael Weir" colnum="259"  time="013:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0010.htm#06051659000511">
	<p pid="b.259.0/1">I understand what the Minister is saying, and I do not dispute much of it, but does he not accept that if the system is to be responsive, it is vital that notified changes are correctly put in the computer and that the computer is able to deal with them? From the cases that I have come across, it appears that that is not happening. Either the information is wrongly inputted&mdash;perhaps it is not inputted&mdash;or the computer does not react to it. In some cases, it does not seem to be able to take on board the changes that are given to it. That is a serious drawback to the system.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16b.259.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1563" speakername="Stephen Timms" colnum="259"  time="013:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0010.htm#06051659000512">
	<p pid="b.259.1/1">I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman. The system should not fail to work because of that, and we have made some important improvements to tackle the problems. This is the first time that I have had the opportunity to look in detail at it, but the incidence of problems is limited, as far as I can see. There are 10 too many problems in his constituency, but that is 10 out of 7,100. It is not the normal experience of people who send in information about a change of circumstances that the system fails to register it. I agree that no one should have that experience and that too many do at present, but they are a small proportion of the total and I hope that it will get smaller over the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.1/2">We have made changes. From last month, the disregard for income increases between one tax year and the next has risen from &pound;2,500 to &pound;25,000. Almost all families with rising incomes will not have their tax credit entitlement reduced in the first year in which the increase occurs. We believe that that will lead to a big fall in the number of overpayments. Other changes will be introduced in the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.1/3">The aim is to provide more certainty for tax credit recipients&mdash;the hon. Gentleman's constituents&mdash;particularly for families who see a rise in income, and to keep the benefits of the system's flexibility to respond to falls in income and changes in circumstances. We estimate that overpayments will be reduced by around one third. Families will have a clear responsibility to report changes promptly and will be helped to keep their records up to date. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs will take a more proactive approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.1/4">There have been significant further improvements in our administration systems. With effect from last month, a new award notice is being issued to give claimants a clearer summary of their award, explaining how it was calculated and what they will be paid. I hope that that will help people in the circumstances described by the hon. Gentleman. The guidance notes that accompany claim forms have been replaced with a clearer, shorter version. The tax credit section of the Revenue and Customs website has been redesigned to make it easier to access information.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.1/5">Since the beginning of the year, there has been a publicity campaign reminding people to notify us promptly of changes in their circumstances. The helpline, which dealt with 22 million calls in 2004-05, has been improved. Call-back arrangements providing more targeted, fuller support in the most complex cases are now in place, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman's constituents will see improvements as a result. Major software releases were successfully implemented in November last year and again last month and are delivering real improvements in operational performance. Again, I hope that that will directly address the concerns that the hon. Gentleman expressed. New procedures to suspend recovery of a disputed overpayment were also introduced last November and we published a revised and clearer version of HMRC's code of practice on overpayments. I hope that that will also help.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.1/6">I know that hon. Members on both sides of the House have appreciated the willingness of my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General&mdash;who is out of the country on ministerial business today&mdash;to meet hon. Members about the problems that we have had, to assist in resolving them and to make changes to put them right.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.1/7">Today, tax credits are helping millions of families throughout Scotland and the UK. We are determined to improve the system further, to remedy the defects that have affected a minority of tax credit recipients in the way outlined by the hon. Gentleman today. We want to give families more certainty about their tax credit awards, but we want to hang on to the crucial ability that characterises the current system of being able to respond to changing circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.1/8">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for setting out on behalf of his constituents their wholly proper concerns and for helping us to ensure that the system provides the help that it was designed to provide. I hope that over the next few weeks or months he will notice the significant improvements that are being made to the administration of the system and that the incidence of the problems that he described will become significantly less frequent than in the past few months.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.1/9">Finally, I note that we received a helpful and interesting brief from the National Council for One Parent Families to coincide with the debate. It made a number of points rightly emphasising that there is more to be done to ensure that the system delivers what we want it to. It started by welcoming the fact that the Government have listened to concerns about the operation of the tax credit system and that we are introducing changes that should improve income stability for claimants and reduce hardship. That is our aim and I hope that we will be successful.</p>

	SECOND CHANCE EDUCATION
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16b.262.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1688" speakername="Louise Ellman" colnum="262"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0010.htm#06051659000513">
	<p pid="b.262.1/1">I am pleased to have been able to secure this important debate. I am aware that there is a great deal of interest in this topic, and I wish to associate myself with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1907" name="Helen Jones">the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/2">I want to draw attention to the problems that are being experienced in adult education in Liverpool and in other large urban areas as the unintended consequence of changes to Government funding for further and adult education. In particular, I want to focus on a highly valued course at risk, &quot;Second chance to learn&quot;, in the hope that the course's future can be secured.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/3">There are three key players in this matter: the Government, the Greater Merseyside learning and skills council and Liverpool community college. Government provide major funding and set national priorities, the Greater Merseyside LSC allocates funding based on those priorities, and the college itself makes decisions on specific courses, although that is strongly constrained by the priorities already set and the funding allocated.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/4">The Government, through the Department for Education and Skills, have given priority to securing employable skills and expanding participation among 16 to 18-year-olds. They prioritise level 2 and level 3 qualifications to be funded partly by transferring money from level 1 and courses inauspiciously designated &quot;other&quot;. That is where the problem lies. The transfer of funds threatens the adult skills for life provision and second chance learning, where Liverpool community college has been judged as &quot;outstanding&quot; by Ofsted's adult learning inspectorate in its 2005 inspection.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/5">Greater Merseyside LSC's initial allocation to Liverpool community college reduced its adult further education budget by &pound;2.7 million&mdash;8 per cent. That was in order to transfer money to fund higher priority courses. Following representations, the allocation has been increased by &pound;1.2 million, and I understand that further negotiations are still under way.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/6">The Government's national priority of improving employability is to be commended, and is highly relevant in Liverpool where, despite the city's growing economic success and a 43 per cent. reduction in unemployment since 1997, high unemployment persists. For example, in the Riverside constituency the unemployment rate is 12 per cent. and male unemployment runs at 18.1 per cent. If we look more closely at local areas, we see that those figures increase. For example, in the Granby ward, the unemployment rate is 26 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/7">It is essential that people are equipped with the skills to take up growing opportunities provided by successful regeneration. The unanticipated consequence of this national policy is, however, to reduce funding for people who either need support to enable them to step on the skills ladder or require education that boosts their confidence as individuals and as active citizens. The courses at risk include those that address that objective. The courses may well become the gateway to further qualifications, but they are valid in their own right.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/8">The courses are highly relevant to Liverpool, where long-term deprivation persists: 46 per cent. of Liverpool's special output areas are in the highest 5 per cent. in England, and 23 per cent. of Liverpool's SOAs are in the 1 per cent. of most deprived areas in the country. According to the Basic Skills Agency, 27.3 per cent. of Liverpool people between the ages of 16 and 60 have poor literacy skills; the corresponding rate for England is 24 per cent. In addition, 32.3 per cent. of Liverpool people in this age group have poor numeracy skills, compared with a figure of 24 per cent. for England. The constituency of Liverpool, Riverside alone has 10,900 people on incapacity benefit&mdash;the highest number for any constituency in the country. For many families with that long-term problem, formal education has not been seen as a high priority and there is a high level of alienation. That is why provision characterised unflatteringly as &quot;other&quot; is so needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/9">Liverpool community college remains the arbiter on the provision of specific courses, although, as I said, its decisions are heavily constrained by funding decisions taken elsewhere. It is an exceptional college, whose skills for life agenda and approach to social inclusion and widening participation were judged by Ofsted to be &quot;outstanding&quot;. The Ofsted inspection also found that there is &quot;consistently good teaching&quot;, &quot;strong strategic leadership&quot; and &quot;strong financial management&quot; at the college. That is praise indeed.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/10">I am concerned that a range of the college's courses is at risk because the national funding priority does not take full account of Liverpool's needs; similar problems are also found in respect of other urban areas. I wish to draw attention to the future of the long-standing course, &quot;Second chance to learn&quot;, which is now in jeopardy. That stand-alone course is provided at the college's new city centre, Duke street premises, and attended by 180 students. It has run for 30 years, originally through the Workers Educational Association and the Liverpool university Institute of Extension Studies. During that time, 3,000 students have participated.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/11">Although there are exceptions, most students are aged over 50, have limited formal educational qualifications&mdash;many have none&mdash;and do not progress to higher education. They do not fit employment-oriented priorities. Yet the course is highly valued. Recently, I met students who attend the course. They described their experience as &quot;life transforming&quot; and explained how it had given them new confidence, encouraging them to be active citizens fully engaged in the regeneration of local communities. They recounted how they had influenced younger members of their families, who otherwise would not have been so influenced, to become interested in education. That demonstrates how second chance learning has helped individual development and community cohesion.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/12">The college, under the pressure of its funding constraints, now proposes to disband that stand-alone course in the city centre. It plans to provide the individual subject options in the course through local drop-in study centres or DISCs. Those would become part of foundation programmes that address basic skills needs and work towards level 2 entitlement. The proposal has been met with consternation. It means the end of the stand-alone &quot;Second chance to learn&quot; course, which will no longer remain an entity in its own right and no longer be held in the city centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/13">Students have told me how coming to a stand-alone course has made them feel part of something important and given them a feeling of belonging. They have explained how meeting in the city centre is stimulating and enables them to join students from other parts of the city whom they would not otherwise have met. They talk about how misconceptions have been broken down and how prejudice has been addressed. They talk avidly and enthusiastically about how going to a course in the city centre brings them into contact with younger students. They find that to be part of an important learning process for themselves as individuals. One student who had no formal qualifications told me:</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/14" class="indent">&quot;I have a thirst for knowledge. A light has been switched on; now it is to be switched off.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/15">Another said:</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/16" class="indent">&quot;The course should stay city centre-based so that students like me, who have never wandered out of my own neighbourhood, can meet other students from across the city.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/17">The students on the course are predominantly older people with few formal qualifications, who had a gross lack of self-confidence but found a new sense of well-being and optimism by attending the course. The local newspaper, the <i>Liverpool Echo</i>, has drawn attention to the city centre, stand-alone course. Numerous students, some of whom progressed to employment and others who found a new sense of confidence, praised its worth. They stressed its value in making them more aware and active citizens as an essential part of the widespread regeneration in Liverpool.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/18">I appreciate the context in which the decision is being made. The Government's stress on employability is commendable, and certainly highly relevant to Liverpool, but it has led to a reduction in funds for confidence-building courses that develop and educate individuals, which are also required. Such courses might be the gateway to qualifications, but they are also important in their own right in encouraging active citizenship, awareness and confidence, and are part of urban renewal and local need.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/19">More joined-up thinking at Government level is required. Civic engagement and social cohesion are important parts of the Department for Communities and Local Government's strategy on urban regeneration. Liverpool has benefited greatly from those regeneration strategies, with significant funds coming to the city, particularly into my constituency, to develop local neighbourhoods, improve housing and employment prospects and develop a sense of civic renewal.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/20">In 2001, the Department of Health launched the national service framework for older people. That identified the importance of lifelong learning. The Centre for Educational Research and Innovation atthe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development highlights the link between learningand health for older people. It seems perverse to jeopardise courses that have such a positive effect on both of those areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/21">The Government's national priority of increasing employability is extremely important to Liverpool, but so is the need to build confidence and develop the individual. The facts that I have recounted today about the long-term deprivation in Liverpool, the need to upgrade basic skills, and the long-seated deprivation that leads to too many people feeling that education is not for them, emphasise the importance of courses that boost self-confidence and self-awareness. Those issues are being addressed successfully by Liverpool community college, which is an outstanding institution, but they are being put at risk by changes in funding priorities decided nationally.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/22">Liverpool community college is renowned for its work with under-achievers. It has already secured, from its initial application, additional funding from Greater Merseyside LSC, which is aware of local needs, but is constrained by national priorities. A significant funding gap remains, and I urge the three players&mdash;the Government, the LSC and Liverpool community college&mdash;to ensure that those important parts of adult education do not fall victim to the schools-based priority. I urge both the Government and the LSC to make funding available so that both local priorities can be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/23">Liverpool's needs require a combination of employment-related courses following the national priority and others that develop citizens as individuals. Those two objectives might well go together, but do not necessarily do so. This is an essential part of adult education in the area of under-achievement. Both aspects are important and a part of regeneration. &quot;Second chance to learn&quot; should remain a stand-alone, city centre course, and I call on Liverpool community college to review its proposal. I ask the Government to look again at the implementation of the strategy and to increase flexibility, so that national Government policy can bring the maximum benefit to areas such as Liverpool.</p>

	<p pid="b.265.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1688" name="Louise Ellman">my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside(Mrs. Ellman)</phrase> on securing the debate. I am aware of the level of interest that people in Liverpool are showing in the proposals of Liverpool community college to reorganise its &quot;Second chance to learn&quot; programme. I have also had representations from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1687" name="Maria Eagle">my hon. Friends the Members for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle)</phrase>, for Wallasey (Angela Eagle), and for Wirral, West (Stephen Hesford) and from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1664" name="George Howarth">my right hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth)</phrase>. I appreciate the opportunity to explain the Government's and the Learning and Skills Council's strategy in this context.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/2">In response to my hon. Friend's opening remarks, I want to outline the Department's overall strategy for dealing with the nation's skills needs, and then to consider local issues in Liverpool and describe our commitment to providing learning to all those who missed out earlier in life, as she described, and to those who want to update their skills or to continue learning.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/3">The Government have developed what I believe is a strong and coherent strategy. To meet our future skills needs, we shall ensure that people realise their potential through learning, both as individuals and as members of an adaptable and changing work force. We shall reinforce the priorities for the public funding of adult learning and we want to find the right balance between the state, employers and individuals for the costs of adult learning. We are reforming the further education sector to make it much more responsive to the needs of the economy, employers and individuals.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/4">My hon. Friend described the situation in Liverpool in graphic terms, and I think that we all know that the global economy presents some unique new challenges. We live in a world where new markets, productivity and new skilled work forces are emerging with extraordinary speed. However, as my hon. Friend probably knows, our productivity levels are still among the poorest in western Europe, so boosting our productivity will be a key factor in our long-term future economic success; that is true for the whole of the UK, and for Liverpool in particular. Our skills gap&mdash;the gap between our skills and those of other countries&mdash;is one of the main reasons for our productivity being poorer than it should be in comparison to those countries. That is the challenge that faces us, and it is a stark one.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/5">The Chancellor said in a recent Budget statement:</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/6" class="indent">&quot;It is because education is the 21st century road to prosperity that Britain must become the best educated, best trained, best skilled country in the world. ... Unleashing the potential of every individual in the country is key to the economic success of the future of our country.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-16">16 March 2005</phrase>;Vol. 432, c. 267-8.]</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/7">The Government's skills strategy is essential.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/8">I want to give some figures to bring home the scale of the skills gap. There are 12 million adults who lack a full level 2 qualification&mdash;the basic school-leaving qualification, the equivalent of five good GCSEs. Some 6 million adults lack basic literacy skills and 17 million adults lack basic numeracy skills. It is true that our plans to transform the fortunes of young people will improve those figures over time, as young people leave school better equipped with skills. However, as Lord Leitch demonstrated in his report, that is not enough.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/9">Today more than 70 per cent. of what will be the 2020 work force has completed compulsory education, so if we are to tackle the figures that I have just given we shall have to transform the fortunes of our adult population at all levels. It is not only an economic imperative that we face; we know that adults with low skills have lower than average levels of employment and lower earnings. That is a point that my hon. Friend made. We have a stretching public service agreement target for 2010, which is to reduce by 40 per cent. the proportion of the work force without a level 2 qualification. However, as many as 25 per cent. of the work force lack that level 2 qualification today. Those with level 2 qualifications are three times more likely to receive further training than those without qualifications. It is a key to unlocking future individual success.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/10">How do we match funding with those priorities? We have records of public funding for adult learning. Our planned funding for the Learning and Skills Council's major adult programmes is nearly &pound;3 billion for both of the next two years. However, we cannot transform skills at every level through public funding alone. We have to prioritise where public funding is targeted. We have made it clear that our priority is to give help to those adults who need it most. We have prioritised for free provision those without functional literacy and numeracy and those without the foundation of employability skills, as represented by a first full level 2 qualification.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/11">To support that shift, there must be a new balance of responsibilities between the state, employers and learners. We do not accept that the withdrawal of LSC funding&mdash;where that happens&mdash;means that a course automatically has to close. If employers will benefit, it is only fair that they share the cost. Where learners and employers are prepared to pay more, we expect providers to provide courses on a full cost-recovery basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/12">We need a cultural shift that will lead to new and better targeted investment by employers in their work force and to individuals investing in themselves. There is a lot of evidence that individuals accept the case for investing in their own learning. MORI polling and recent research by the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education show wide acceptance that adults should make a contribution to the costs of learning.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/13">There is a long backdrop to the moves by Liverpool community college to restructure its provision to meet the priorities that I have outlined. I mentioned earlier the national figures for adults without a level 2 qualification or with basic literacy and numeracy needs. My figures&mdash;I hope that these are in accord with the ones that my hon. Friend mentioned&mdash;show that 120,000 adults in Liverpool are without a level 2 qualification. That is 44 per cent. of the working population in Liverpool, as compared with 27 per cent. in England. That is a major gap that we have to fill. Some 80,000 adults in Liverpool are without basic literacy and 89,000 are without basic numeracy. My hon. Friend was right to highlight that need, and I am highlighting it too. It is because we have identified that need that we have no choice but to prioritise our resources to address the demand for learning. That is what Liverpool community college is doing.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/14">Liverpool community college's &quot;Second chance to learn&quot; programme has been part of adult education in Liverpool for nearly 30 years. The programme currently helps 180 individuals, out of the college's 17,000 adult learners. Many of those 180 learners have been attending courses for a number of years&mdash;I have received correspondence from hon. Friends on that. Some of those learners travel into the city from the Wirral and elsewhere. However, the college has decided that the programme no longer meets the needs of many learners, mainly because it does not encourage progression to higher qualifications.</p>

	<p pid="b.267.1/1">If I may say a little more but do not address my hon. Friend's concern, she may intervene on me.</p>
	<p pid="b.267.1/2">The college recognises that the &quot;Second chance&quot; curriculum is an ideal base to support the recently established foundation programmes. The &quot;Second chance&quot; subjects have been tried and tested throughout the course's long history. They will attract a wider range of students if they are delivered in the college's local drop-in study centres, which my hon. Friend mentioned. The college will retain the best aspects of &quot;Second chance&quot; as part of a foundation programme for students that addresses their basic skills needs and works towards level 2. The broad range of subjects available through the programme will continue. That includes courses such as &quot;Introduction to history&quot;, women's studies, creative writing, citizenship and sociology. Many students will have the opportunity of a second chance to learn when those subjects are delivered in local communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.267.1/3">My hon. Friend mentioned the need for joined-up government and neighbourhood renewal programmes being funded through the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;the Department for Communities and Local Government, or the DCLG, as I shall get used to calling it. By delivering those courses in drop-in centres in local communities, we shall see a greater joining up between the needs of local communities and the courses that the college offers, because they will be provided where more students can access them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16b.268.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1688" speakername="Louise Ellman" colnum="268"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0011.htm#06051659000517">
	<p pid="b.268.0/1">I thank the Minister for his comments, which give a full explanation of how the Government see their policies unfolding. As I have said, I support a policy of creating greater employability, but my concern is that the needs of people who may not progress to further qualifications but who nevertheless get a sense of self-confidence and of becoming active citizens&mdash;another part of the Government's programme&mdash;are being put to one side in the search for greater employability.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16b.268.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1512" speakername="Phil Hope" colnum="268"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0011.htm#06051659000518">
	<p pid="b.268.1/1">It gets complicated, in that there is a strand of funding that we call PCDL&mdash;personal, community and development learning&mdash;which funds learning for its own sake; it does not have to lead on to a qualification. That fund covers some of the themes that my hon. Friend described. We have protected the budget for PCDL at &pound;210 million across the country, but the way in which that money is spent in different parts of the country is patchy. That is why I have asked the learning and skills councils to bring together the local partnerships, including themselves, providers, local authorities, the health service&mdash;which often provides education for health reasons&mdash;and voluntary, third-sector organisations, and to consider how the money allocated to PCDL is spent in their area, who goes on what courses, and how PCDL can be developed further. We are alive to, and committed to, that concept of learning for its own sake, but we are mindful that the ways in which budgets are spent locally do not necessarily meet all the needs or cover all the gaps.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/2">As the hon. Lady mentioned, Liverpool community college recently received recognition from a number of sources for being a place of high-quality learning. It has two centres of vocational excellence and is involved in another, too. It has had good inspection results, and is a beacon college. It will receive extra funding for personal and community development learning in recognition of that excellence. This year, Liverpool community college received some &pound;32.7 million&mdash;that is 61 per cent. more than five years ago. My hon. Friend mentioned &pound;1.2 million that had been brought back to help the college. I can tell her that the Learning and Skills Council has now agreed to give the college an additional &pound;450,000 to support adult learning, so there has been recognition of the local priorities and needs, and of how the college can respond to those needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/3">We have mentioned further education, adult learning, particular courses and so on, but on the wider policy area and the direct funding that we are giving, we expect colleges to focus on meeting people's needs at work. Particularly for employers, there is the &quot;train to gain&quot; stream of funding, which is rolling out nationally from <phrase class="date" code="">1 August</phrase> this year. That is a &pound;230 million programme to help employees who do not have basic skills and level 2 qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/4">Finally, on the worry about focus on level 2 leading to the withdrawal of adult courses, it is not our policy to lose good courses that lead demonstrably to progression and to level 2; we make that clear in our grant letter to the Learning and Skills Council. I say to my hon. Friend that too much of the kind of provision that is called &quot;First Steps&quot; or &quot;Return to Learn&quot; is not so much a pathway as a revolving door; people go round and round on courses and do not move on. That is why we announced our new development value, the foundation learning tier, in the White Paper.</p>
