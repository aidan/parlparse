<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-28b.190.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" speakername="Michael Weir" colnum="190"  time="009:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090428/halltext/90428h0002.htm#09042837000493">
	<p pid="b.190.1/1">Certainly not. We need to develop our own energy future. We currently have substantial amounts of North sea oil and gas, and a renewable future on which we should concentrate. Nuclear is a thing of the past and not the future. Moreover, we should consider its moral implications and its connection with weapons. We told Iran and North Korea that they could not have nuclear power because of what they might do with it.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.1/2">Plainly, renewables, as a share of our energy generation, are increasing while nuclear is decreasing. I was much alarmed by the outrageous call of the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire for the power of the Scottish Government to be removed. This is a matter for the Scottish Parliament, and it is part of the devolved solution and a matter for the Scottish people. A majority in the Scottish Parliament are opposed to nuclear power stations and they were elected by the Scottish people. It is up to the Scottish people to change the situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.1/3">We believe that it would be wiser to invest the billions that would be required for new nuclear power stations in Scotland's vast renewable potential. I appeal to hon. Members to get over their obsession with new nuclear and let us consider what we can agree on rather than raking over the embers of something that we are highly unlikely ever to agree on. On that basis, I should like to concentrate on some of the more positive aspects of electricity generation and consumption, and to highlight a few areas in which urgent action is needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.1/4">As I indicated, Scotland has a huge potential for many forms of renewable energy. The Scottish Government are on target to exceed their aim of generating 31 per cent. of electricity demand from renewables by 2011, with capacity, which is either installed or consented to, exceeding 5 GW. They are determined to meet, and if possible exceed, the target of 50 per cent. by 2020 through a balanced mix of technologies. They also wish to continue working with European partners to look at better offshore grid connections, which are essential for the large-scale export of renewable energy.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.1/5">The Scottish renewables obligation will give a much greater incentive to wind and wave technology, which has a huge potential for the future. In the spirit of co-operation that I am trying to engender, I also warmly welcome the recent announcement by the UK Government to extend the renewables obligation until 2037. That is very positive and gives us a potential to expand important energy sources. The Crown estate's recent announcement of offshore wind licences also has the potential to increase our renewables. Some such licences may cover the Firth of Tay in my own constituency. I await with interest the reaction to offshore wind given the problems that there have been with onshore wind. None the less, it is an area that we need to continue to develop.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.1/6">The &pound;13 million wave and tidal energy support scheme awarded grants to eight marine energy projects, and the Scottish Government have indicated that they intend to introduce, by June, the most generous support in the UK for commercially deployed and marine renewable energy projects on five renewables obligation certificates for wave and three for tidal. That is a real attempt to kick-start renewables and put in place all the renewable generation.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.1/7">Moreover, we should not forget that we have North sea oil and gas. As the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West well knows, the Energy and Climate Change Committee is currently considering the oil and gas industry. We have had some very interesting meetings on the subject which included a visit to Aberdeen. There is still an immense amount of oil and gas in the North sea, and potential development west of Shetland. The UK Government must consider that as part of a medium-term energy future. Changes in the Budget will help a little, but more needs to be done to ensure the development west of Shetland, which is a very difficult environment from which to extract oil and gas.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.1/8">The future of the industry goes beyond that, however. The hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire talked about carbon capture and storage, but the North sea has huge potential. We have the undersea aquifers and the old oil and gas fields which have huge storage potential for carbon capture and storage. Moreover, in the North sea we have the skills, through the oil and gas industry, to develop CCS and offshore wind. The other week, I visited Petrofac, which has a facility in my constituency, to look at its offshore safety work. It said that it was getting increasing interest from those who wish to get involved in offshore wind and other offshore renewable projects, thus highlighting that there is the potential to develop our existing North sea industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.1/9">I should also like to talk about carbon capture and storage. Again, in the new spirit of co-operation, I welcome the statement on the subject made by the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change. I am tempted to say that it is better late than never, because had the Government not pulled the rug from under the Peterhead project, we could have been well ahead with carbon capture and storage. As it happens, that project is now proceeding in Abu Dhabi. We are now, at last, considering movement with CCS. Obviously, Scotland has huge potential with the possible development at Longannet. At the moment, Longannet is the second largest coal-fired power station in Europe. The project that is being developed there, in a consortium led by Scottish Power, includes Aker Clean Carbon's technology and Marathon Oil Corporation's drilling and transportation expertise. It is one of the three bids that is going forward in the bid process and, if it is successful, it could be the world's largest fully operational system on site by 2014, and that would go a great distance to putting Scotland at the forefront of carbon capture and storage and developing industry for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.1/10">The hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire made an important point about the number of coal-fired power stations throughout the world and the continuing development of them in China and India. Longannet will be a retrofitted carbon capture and storage facility, which is vital because we have to retrofit the existing stations if we are to reduce their emissions. It is no good looking only at carbon capture and storage for new build, it must be developed to retrofit existing stations so that we can move forward and drastically reduce our carbon capture and storage.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.1/11">There are problems with CCS, however, which stem from the transmission grid. I have often talked about the need to strengthen the grid, particularly for the north of Scotland, to take the renewables into account. The regime is distance based and that works against the development of renewable energy resources in Scotland as well as providing a disincentive to thermal-based generation. In effect, it is technology neutral, but any technology in the north of Scotland faces the same problems. It is high time that we moved from that to a charging model based on a flat rate&mdash;the so-called postal system. Each generator would pay the same for access into the grid. Such a system would go a long way towards helping the development of renewables and will enable us to meet the challenging targets that we are all signed up to&mdash;or that most of us are signed up to. National Grid is consulting the UK industry and generators for their views on the Scottish proposal, which I hope will move forward.</p>
