<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-26a.144.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1663" speakername="Roger Berry" colnum="144"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090326/halltext/90326h0001.htm#09032635000275">
	<p pid="a.144.1/1">I recall that conversation. The Committees have again recommended that there should be a register. I, too, look forward to the Minister's response on that issue later in the debate, as it is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/2">Given that the Government have progressively extended extraterritorial controls, the obvious question is why they do not extend such controls to cover trade in all items on the military list. For a long time&mdash;I cannot remember how many years&mdash;the Committees have argued that the logical solution to the Government's recognition that there is a problem is to have full extraterritorial controls over all items on the military list. Those of us who can recall the Labour party's 2001 manifesto read it to mean that&mdash;sort of. However, I have quoted that in previous years, so I will not do so again today. I merely note that if there is a problem with people avoiding UK domestic legislation by simply popping overseas, or doing deals overseas indirectly through brokering and trafficking arrangements, that loophole needs to be closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/3">We have recommended that all military items should be covered. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> rightly said, the Government have responded by saying that discussions are ongoing between NGOs and defence manufacturers. I echo his comments: when do the Government expect to hear the outcome of those discussions? Are they planning for the extraterritorial controls at least to include anti-vehicle land mines, and if not, why not? Finally, to summarise the point, having been persuaded to move so far, why on earth do the Government not simply legislate for full extraterritorial controls over goods on the military list? Can the Minister advise us on any progress made to analyse the merits of a register of brokers, which the Government seem to have recognised in numerous comments?</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/4">On end-use monitoring, I always remind myself that the only thing that really matters in the arms trade is the end use. It is simply about ensuring that whoever ends up with UK arms exports does not use them to abuse human rights through external aggression or internal repression. It is the ultimate end use that matters. How the arms get there, and through which countries they might be trans-shipped, are issues that help us understand how the end user gets them, but the bottom line is that when answering the question of whether an export licence should be granted for a particular set of equipment, the answer depends on knowing the end use. Enforcing policy on the arms trade must be all about ensuring that what we are told about the end use is correct and, if not, making sure that sanctions can be applied to put it right or to ensure that we are not deceived again.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/5">End use is what it is all about, which is why the Committees have argued for many years that end-use monitoring is necessary. We welcome the Government's intention to introduce some end-use controls through the European Union. In their response to our report, the Government promised an update on EU action on the issue by the end of 2009. They also promised to seek unilateral action if the EU route proved unpromising. In January, we were advised that there was some movement, but that it was slow. What progress has been made in discussions on end-use controls within the European Union, and how long will the Government wait before beginning unilateral action?</p>

	<p pid="a.146.4/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman's request for the inclusion of re-export licences. It is beyond me why the Government will not simply accept that as a matter of course. Perhaps the more fundamental issue is enforcement. One can easily see if an aircraft has been moved, but with smaller arms and military hardware and software of a less observable nature, it is probable that unscrupulous states will make promises and completely ignore them. Unless we have an enormous infrastructure, we will not be able to track those with nefarious intentions.</p>

	<p pid="a.146.5/1">There are laws, both domestic laws and laws with extraterritorial implications&mdash;on sex-trafficking for example&mdash;that we know are difficult to enforce. We legislate because we believe that we have a responsibility to say, &quot;This should not be done, we do not approve. It will be a criminal offence if we catch you doing it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.146.5/2">Suppose we grant a major export licence to India, for example&mdash;I am sorry, I do not want to pick on India&mdash;which involves aeroplanes going to a particular country. There could be a clause stating that those aeroplanes, or other military equipment, cannot be re-exported to an embargo destination. If that country re-exports, we can say, &quot;We don't trust you. In future, we will grant no more licences.&quot; Sanctions can be applied. In such cases, it will be clear what is going on, although in other cases it might be more difficult.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-26a.148.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1663" speakername="Roger Berry" colnum="148"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090326/halltext/90326h0002.htm#09032635000287">
	<p pid="a.148.1/1">I can confirm only that I have read that in press reports, so the Minister might be the best person to answer the factual question. I picked F-16s because of their unique role in conflict in the middle east, but I could equally have selected Apaches. I have read in the press that Apaches were used&mdash;no doubt the Minister will respond to that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/2">On direct exports to Israel, the Minister said, in the <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-21">21 January</phrase> evidence session, that the Government would not issue a licence where they had human rights or other concerns under the consolidated criteria. He also said that it was not clear which equipment had been used in the recent conflict, and that that was being investigated. Will the Minister advise the House as to the outcome of that investigation?</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/3">Let me speak personally on this issue. I have heard similar sentiments to mine expressed by other members of the Committee, but this is not the Committee's policy. I have always had some difficulty in understanding the practice of UK policy on this issue. Leaving the incorporation issue aside, the policy has been that licences would not be granted for arms export sales to Israel if there was a risk that they would be used in the occupied territories. We all know the UK Government's position on the legal status in the middle east, so it is hardly surprising that that would be a desirable thing to do, but I have never understood how that policy works in practice. Do the Israel defence forces have one stash of weapons with a Union Jack on it, which it has been told it cannot use in the occupied territories, and another stash that it can use in Gaza, the west bank and east Jerusalem? I genuinely do not understand how that works.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/4">There is another issue that I do not understand. Like everyone else in the Chamber, I am sure, I condemn violence unequivocally. One reason why I wanted to be a member of the Committee when it was set up is that I believe that conflict represents the failure of diplomacy, as the clich&eacute; goes. I think that we should try to resolve conflicts without violence wherever humanly possible, and that we should certainly try to control the arms trade to ensure that arms do not get into the wrong hands. I passionately believe that it is deplorable that Hamas sends rockets into Israel, and I believe that Israel's armed intervention in the occupied territories, some of which I have seen, is equally deplorable. I am even-handed on this issue, but our policy on arms exports and embargoes is not even-handed. On one hand, we have Israel, the most powerful military state in the middle east, being in breach of countless United Nations resolutions and in illegal occupation of much of the middle east, but there is no arms embargo on it. On the other hand, there is an arms embargo on Hamas. I am not a defender of either side; I simply make the observation that it is extraordinary that there is no such arms embargo, given the conflict over the years and certainly the recent conflict in Gaza. Why is that?</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/5">There was an announcement that the UK Government would do all that they could to prevent arms from getting into Gaza. That is fine, but there was no announcement at the same time that there would be an embargo on arms sales to Israel. I find that double standard difficult to comprehend, and it prompts me to ask what Israel would have to do in the middle east to qualify for an arms embargo. I do not raise this issue flippantly, and I do not believe that my view will command universal support. Indeed, I have been verbally abused by otherwise reasonable people for expressing such views. I am simply asking why there is that double standard in arms export control policy in the middle east. That question deserves an answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/6">Finally, let me address the happier topic of the international arms trade treaty. Our report concluded that the Government were to be commended for and supported in their efforts to achieve a comprehensive and effective international arms trade treaty. In December, a large majority of Governments voted in favour of a UN General Assembly resolution to establish an open-ended working group on such a treaty. The only state to vote against the resolution was the United States, but perhaps it will change its view in a few months. I hope that it does. Of course, there were also a number of abstentions. Non-governmental organisations were adamant, in their evidence to the Committees, that if the scope of the treaty was not wide enough, the UK should not be a signatory to it. I have two questions for the Minister on that. First, what took place at the first open-ended working group on the treaty? Secondly, does he share the NGOs' concerns about its scope?</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/7">There are many other topics that I could discuss, such as bribery and corruption, but in fairness to colleagues who wish to speak, and to give the Minister plenty of time to respond to the long list of questions that is building up, I shall conclude. I reiterate that the Committees believe that the Government have made substantial progress in recent years on controlling UK arms exports, and that we are pleased that they have accepted a number of our recommendations. We recognise that they have also disagreed with a number of recommendations, but honest people may have different views.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/8">However, we have real concerns about the issues that I have raised in the past half an hour and the issues that colleagues will raise. We want further progress to be made on extraterritorial controls, which should be a simple matter. We also want the Government to do their level best to ensure that the re-exporting of UK arms does not continue to be a problem. All of us, whatever our views on arms sales to Israel, would also desperately like to know what the Government's policy on the issue is. There are therefore big issues to consider further, and I am grateful that the Minister is here to respond to all our questions.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.0/1">I am sure that the Minister who is replying to the debate has heard what my hon. Friend said.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/2">I turn now to the two countries to which I want to refer. The first is China. I have been going through with considerable interest a very useful report entitled &quot;Good Conduct? Ten years of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports&quot;, which was produced by a variety of EU NGOs in June 2008. The report states that in the five-year period 2002 to 2006, the UK received approval for licences to export military equipment to China valued at just over &euro;450 million. That represents a substantial element of arms export business. That value of that business must, I believe, be set alongside China's performance on human rights. I shall not go into that in detail, because all hon. Members present will be familiar with China's human rights record, but I shall clarify one area: the Chinese record on capital punishment.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/3">As hon. Members may have seen, Amnesty International has recently produced a further, updated report on the matter, and it was covered in detail in <i>The Independent</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-24">24 March</phrase>. The newspaper report stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Death sentences handed down by China for crimes including tax evasion and bag-snatching represented three-quarters of the 2,390 executions carried out around the world, up from 1,252 in 2007.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/5">Elsewhere in the two-page spread is a picture of a rather attractive tourist-type posh bus. When one looks at it more closely, the bus is distinctly more sinister. The report about the bus states:</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/6" class="indent">&quot;China is innovating in the market of death with a fleet of execution buses in which convicts are efficiently and cleanly put to death by lethal injection.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/7" class="indent">The mobile death chamber means executions can be ordered and carried out by courts in towns and villages around a particular province, with executioners and medical staff shuttling between different jurisdictions. Authorities say the initiative is a deterrent against crime.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/8">The report continues with a quotation:</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/9" class="indent">&quot;'First we established there was a demand for execution vehicles. Then we designed the vehicles and applied to the government for certification. This procedure is a must,' said Mr Zhang, from the marketing department of Jinguan Auto&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/10">It concludes:</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/11" class="indent">&quot;The makers of the van say sales are steady, and urge any foreign governments interested to get in touch.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/12">I fear that around the world there will be Governments who think that a death bus is an important item of public expenditure for their regime, and that they will make purchases.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/13">If the record of China on human rights internally is put alongside its systematic, ruthless and continuing denial of human rights in Tibet, its continuing threatening posture towards Taiwan and the close interest that it now takes in its near neighbour Nepal, which itself has a Maoist-led coalition, the British Government need to look closely at the question whether we should be doing hundreds of millions of euros of arms-export business with China. I urge the Minister to review policy in that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/14">Last week I went with members of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs to Israel and the occupied territories and Gaza. I want to tell the House what I saw with my own eyes in Gaza. I want to make it clear at the outset, as I have done every time I have spoken on this subject, that I condemn absolutely and unreservedly the sending of rockets by Hamas into Israel. We started at a hospital in the centre of Gaza City. It was burnt out, through the use of phosphorous munitions. It was not possible tell whether, or to find anyone who would say whether, there were any Hamas fighters in the hospital. I have no grounds for believing that there were any, but equally I cannot say absolutely that there were not. However, there could not be any conceivable justification for burning out an entire hospital on the ground that one or two Hamas fighters, or a small group of them, were in the vicinity, or possibly on the roof of the hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/15">We then went to one of the two very large Commonwealth war grave cemeteries in Gaza. In the cemetery, which has 4,000 headstones, we met the splendid Palestinian gentleman who is in charge of it and keeps it immaculately. He came to meet us in his suit and tie, wearing his decoration, an honorary MBE. He showed us the 300 headstones that had been destroyed or seriously scarred, which will all now have to be replaced. He also showed us, a considerable distance away, the Israeli tank firing-points from which shells had come into the cemetery. I asked him whether any Hamas fighters had been in the cemetery at any point, to which he replied, &quot;Absolutely not.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/16">We went to a relief distribution centre, run by Islamic Relief&mdash;a very good charity among the Islamic countries&mdash;and funded by the Department for International Development. It distributed food, tents, kitchen equipment, sanitary items and so on. I had heard and read about&mdash;and hon. Members will have seen in the press&mdash;the extent to which the Israelis targeted food production and Palestinian farms during the recent offensive. I met a Palestinian farmer who told me his farm had been destroyed; his orange trees had been smashed. He told me it would take at least 10 years to replant those orange trees and bring them to maturity for fruit. I asked him, &quot;Were there any Hamas fighters in your farm?&quot; He said, &quot;Absolutely not.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/17">Then, perhaps most disturbingly of all, we went to one of the largest industrial estates in Gaza. If there had been Hamas fighters there one might, yes, have expected one or two of the factories and warehouses to be destroyed, and a few others to be damaged. It was a huge estate, providing employment opportunities and income to what must have been many thousands of people. It had been flattened. Not a single building was standing. It had been destroyed, brought down to the ground, for as far as one could see. It was a horrendous sight. I came away with only one conclusion. The engagement was not military to military, with armed people on either side engaging each other. It was an engagement about collective punishment, and that is what has been inflicted on Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/18">That brings me to my next point, about an interesting and important piece of information given to me about the rules of engagement under which the Israelis operated during the recent Gaza conflict. I was told on very high authority, completely independently and not by Palestinian or Israeli sources, that in the rules of engagement&mdash;I have not had sight of them, which is not surprising, as they are highly classified&mdash;the members of the Israeli defence force were told that above all else they must avoid being captured.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/19">Hon. Members will know the extent to which Israel is transfixed by the Corporal Shalit case. Corporal Shalit was kidnapped and is still a hostage. He has been a hostage for three years. Indeed, outside the Prime Minister's house in Jerusalem we saw the demonstrations and the tents of the people there who are calling for Corporal Shalit's release.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/20">If someone's rules of engagement include an overriding requirement that they should under no circumstances allow themselves to get captured, an absolutely certain military consequence is that the fire positions in which they engage will be of a stand-off nature and will be at a considerable distance. Indeed, I was told that the vast majority of the IDF forces that were engaged did not at any point see a Hamas fighter. If someone engages at a great distance, they can also be certain that they will maximise civilian casualties.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/21">So, I ask the Minister to consider what happened in southern Lebanon three years ago, when, as he knows, a vast number of cluster munitions were sown over the whole of southern Lebanon&mdash;including in the civilian areas&mdash;in the 72 hours after the ceasefire had been agreed and before it came into effect. He should also consider the degree of destruction of Gaza, where there were nearly 1,500 civilian casualties&mdash;including hundreds of women and children. Against that background and the background of what I have said about the rules of engagement, which are likely to be the same in any future conflict and are likely to lead to a high level of civilian casualties, the Minister and his colleagues must look extraordinary closely at the compliance by the British Government in respect of weapons systems and the components of weapons systems sold to Israel&mdash;either directly or indirectly&mdash;in relation to the EU combined code.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-26a.155.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" speakername="Lembit Öpik" colnum="155"  time="015:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090326/halltext/90326h0003.htm#09032635000295">
	<p pid="a.155.0/1">It is a pleasure to be involved in this important debate. We are good at making weapons and weapons systems in the UK, not least because we have a thriving aviation industry with decades of experience in the field. We are also good at producing the IT to go with those weapons and weapons systems. Some of the finest companies in the field are based in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/2">It is no surprise that there is an enormous temptation and attraction for the UK to export weapons, which is unquestionably why this debate is so important. Arms export controls are thus vital for ensuring that we have a transparent arms trade and that corruption and bribery are stamped out. Every effort should be made to ensure that arms are not supplied to terrorist groups or misused by countries with poor human rights records. When introducing the debate, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1663" name="Roger Berry">the hon. Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry)</phrase> covered those issues in extensive detail, and the arguments do not need to be repeated. The Committee has established a good rapport with the Ministry of Defence and lobby groups in order to work for the best solutions to these problems, and I congratulate it on its body of work so far.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/3">I would like to draw the Minister's attention to a number of issues raised in the report on which I hope he will be able to provide an update&mdash;again, some of those matters have been raised already, so I do not need to discuss them in great detail. The hon. Member for Kingswood mentioned man-portable air defence systems&mdash;MANPADS. Could the issue of the transporters of such category B weapons relate to some sort of register of arms brokers and traders more cohesively? The Minister also needs to address the open general licence issue, and enforcement and punishment issues are also relevant. How can we monitor the resale of goods to prevent weaponry from ending up being used in undesirable conflicts abroad, as has happened in Burma?</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/4">I hope that the Minister will respond to the points already made, but let me add a few of my own. We are approaching the proposed date for the introduction of the final tranche of secondary legislation under the Export Control Act 2002, which will extend controls on light weapons. Will the Minister update us on the effectiveness and progress of that legislation so far, especially in light of how British-made weaponry often still ends up in the wrong hands? I raised that concern in an intervention, because is easy to see where an aircraft ends up, but it is not so easy to see where light weaponry ends up. If the Minister is so minded, he may admit that that the tracking of light weapons and smaller weapons products is impossible. However, the Government might have come up with creative solutions to that problem. One of the hardest aspects of this whole issue is tracking small-scale weaponry and, indeed, IT systems, which are easy to move under the radar and difficult to find when they fall into the wrong hands.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/5">The Committee has suggested previously that</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/6" class="indent">&quot;the roles of broker and transporter can be tightly linked, with the dividing line between them difficult to draw&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/7">That is right. As a consequence, there should be an extension of the roles covered extraterritorially in category B to include transporters of those items. That might go some way towards resolving the issue, so I would welcome the Minister's views on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/8">The Government's previous response to the report did not show a commitment to extending controls to transporters of category B goods. Will the Minister provide an update on that, or indicate whether there has been further consideration of the issue? Have the Government considered extending arms controls over the transporters of category B goods? I recognise that there is an economic implication and that the Government will not want to promote the potential loss of some business at this difficult time, but the cost of not taking action far exceeds the benefit of leaving things as they are due to the destabilising elements of what happens if illegal movements go unchecked.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/9">In a similar vein, a register of brokers would also extend arms control extraterritorially. A register of all licensed traders and brokers has long been advocated, and it was discussed at length during the CAEC inquiry sessions. Belgium, France and Sweden, among others, already operate a system of registration that has the clear advantage of better monitoring and transparency. Such a system will not be perfect but, as the hon. Member for Kingswood said, sometimes we have to pass laws notwithstanding the difficulty of enforcement. If the Government are going to be true to their decade-old promise of an ethical international policy, they have to grab this bull by the horns.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/10">The Government recognise the advantages of a register: increasing compliance, and raising the awareness of companies and individuals of the controls that they need to satisfy to get a licence, and for what they can get one. That is good. Such a system would also have the advantage that it could be linked to an offence, and that an individual or company could be struck off the register for breaking the rules. Therefore, I would like to ask whether there has been further development of the idea following the Government's response to the report, what the criteria would be for the register, what mechanism there would be for removing offenders and when that would be appropriate, whether the register would be a public document or available only to the Department concerned, and whether a registration fee would be charged and what that would entail.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/11">The most controversial of licences to trade in arms&mdash;the open general licence&mdash;still poses many problems. It is intended to apply to low-risk goods and countries that are not problematical, but there are serious concerns that OGLs can easily be exploited. There are questions about what is done once the licence has been obtained. In theory, an individual or company could then simply act as it wanted and exploit the various loopholes, and be caught only if Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs happened to perform a spot check on the right company at the right time.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/12">The Government's view seems to be that spot checks and monitoring would eventually bring up any breaches and that the necessary enforcement action would follow. I do not agree. I think that there needs to be more systemic intervention that will require intelligence and close monitoring of this sensitive sector. Data provided by the Export Control Organisation and quoted by the UK working group on arms indicate that OGL registrants constitute the largest and fastest growing body of users of the UK export control machinery. The number of licence holders has risen in just four years from 779 in January 2003 to a staggering 3,114 in December 2007. Therefore, while the number of spot checks and compliance officers may increase, the rise in licence holders minimises their effect. Indeed, as shown in the report, the number of goods seized by HMRC has fallen from 120 in 2000 to 44 in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/13">While most of those licences involve relatively non-sensitive goods being exported to uncontroversial end users, in certain circumstances they can be used to export lethal military and security equipment to sensitive destinations. I do not believe that the 60 per cent. fall in goods apprehended means that there has been a 60 per cent. fall in breaches of compliance, although the Minister may have a more optimistic view. I suspect that many organisations and individuals have found a way to get through.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/14">On top of that, the lack of enforcement and penalties linked to breaches was found to be a concern, even if breaches were minor in character. This is really important: to date, the only significant custodial sentence was through the successful prosecution of John Knight of Endeavour Resources Ltd, who was sentenced to four years for trading arms from Iran to Kuwait without a licence. As the first successful enforcement under the controls, it was widely welcomed and considered to be an extremely important step. However, Saferworld has rightly commented that evidence that emerged from the case raised serious concerns about the effectiveness of the licensing and enforcement regime as a whole, and the willingness of the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to pursue clear breaches of the 2002 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/15">To some extent, the situation is understandable. One of the main difficulties for a successful criminal prosecution is that the burden of proof is extremely high, as the prosecutor is required to disprove all possible defences. Civil penalties, on the other hand, would offer an easier alternative with a slightly reduced burden of proof. Will the Minister outline the progress of the Government's endorsement of that recommendation? It may not be perfect, but it would probably broaden the room for manoeuvre to enforce legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/16">As has already been pointed out, the Committee contrasted the US and UK systems. Non-compliance with the UK system can actually make economic sense for UK exporters, whereas the harsh penalties in America never make that the case. That suggests that the Government urgently need to look at the case study of another country, not very different from ours, where the system is designed to work better.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/17">We have heard about various re-export breaches. I shall not repeat them, but I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about them. The infamous case of the maritime patrol aircraft that were sold by the UK to India, and then resold to Burma, is an example of what can happen if we are not careful about re-export conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/18">Serious concerns remain about the lack of a re-export clause. By comparison, that is a standard element of all US contracts. If there were a blanket clause rather than a subjective choice based on the recipient country, one country would not be treated differently from another, which would negate claims of possible insult to other states. Additionally, given the long life of many military goods, it is important to note that the stability, administration and character of states can change dramatically over, say, 20 years, but the goods could still be perfectly usable and available for re-exporting. That mitigates strongly in favour of a blanket clause.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/19">Have the Government given any further consideration to implementing a single-action clause, as is used by Germany? Such a catch-all clause could give the Government far more flexibility to deal with fast-changing and complex goods. One thing is certain: something has to change. The Government are obligated to respond to the concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/20">The European Union's role also remains crucial. The EU code of conduct was adopted as a common position in December 2008, which means that it is legally binding on member states. The code's eight criteria that any arms sale should satisfy include respect for the UK's international commitments, in particular sanctions decreed by the UN and the EU, and other international obligations, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the country of final destination. However, the licensing of defence exports still remains at the discretion of member states. Will the Government offer a commitment to the code of conduct, which I am sure all parties in this Chamber want? It seems sensible and consistent with applying common criteria across the EU as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/21">I cite a concern that comes from the overall sense that this sector has enormous vested interest in finding ways through. With the best will in the world, hard-pressed companies will seek buyers and will sometimes be tempted not to ask too many questions about what those buyers want to do with the products. We have made some specific points, but the macro issue is that if there is one sector that is open to corruption, it is this one. If one looks at the mechanics, one understands that perfectly honourable UK companies could end up indirectly providing goods to dishonourable clients. That is why these matters are so important.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/22">I congratulate the Committee on the insights that its work has provided. The report is exhaustive, precise and well researched. The Committee's work is vital if we are to prevent weaponry from ending up in the wrong hands. To that extent, the Minister is lucky, because this is an action-oriented debate. As far as I can tell, it is not particularly partisan, but concerned with closing loopholes. That is consistent with ensuring that an ethical foreign policy is not just an aspiration, but a fact.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/23">I end with a disappointing and saddening statistic. I am told that for every &pound;2,000 spent on arms, &pound;1 is spent on conflict resolution. I predict that, for many reasons that we understand, we will continue to sell weapons of war, but the greatest single export will be the tools of conflict resolution because human beings, being the creatures that they are, will stop buying arms only when they find an easier and less violent way to solve their natural but tragic conflicts.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.0/1">It is good to serve under your chairmanship, Sir Nicholas, and to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit Öpik">the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase>, and it is nice to see the Minister in his place today.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/2">This has been an interesting debate, and I sincerely congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1663" name="Roger Berry">the hon. Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry)</phrase> on the way in which he chairs a quite difficult Committee. It is not easy to chair a joint Committee of four Committees, to secure a unanimous agreement and to come up with a constructive report within the constraints of the Official Secrets Act, which we have all heard about today. So, I welcome the opportunity to reply to this debate on behalf of the Opposition for the second time running. It is a pity that more right hon. and hon. Members are not present, considering its importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/3">This country should have three arms exports controls objectives: first, that our export policy is concurrent with our global status as a trusted and reliable trading partner, but equally, as a nation that recognises its role in fostering and developing peace and upholding the highest standards of human rights; secondly, that the reporting and scrutiny of our arms exporters occurs without providing an unnecessary burden on the industry, which is a vital part of our economy; and, thirdly, that our export policy considers the interests of our defence exporters.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/4">In recognising the need for the comprehensive scrutiny system that we have in place, we must not underestimate the importance of our defence exporters to this country. Although it is right that we scrutinise, we must not ignore the skills of those in the industry or the excellent quality of the equipment that they produce. It is of huge benefit, not least to our own armed forces. Defence exports assist the UK in strengthening our relations with allies and in reducing the unit cost of equipment to our own armed forces. Given that our defence manufacturers produce some of the most respected military hardware anywhere in the world, and given the current need for such equipment within our overstretched armed forces, that point simply cannot be ignored. The capacity to produce the best kit for our troops is dependent on a world-leading and thriving defence export industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/5">Figures for 2006-07 show 25,000 jobs dependent directly on the defence export industry, with a further 30,000 people indirectly employed in the supply chain, as sub-contractors or as suppliers, as part of a &pound;5 billion industry. The industry is very important to this country, and it is therefore equally important that we strike the right balance with our regulatory regime. I have just returned from India, where I found that the country spends 2 per cent. of its GDP on defence, an increase of 34 per cent. on last year, and plans to spend $29 billion on major acquisitions over the next five years. BAE Systems is targeting that major industry, and it will be of considerable benefit to this country, notwithstanding the remarks made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> about India's re-export of arms to Burma. Our regulatory regime should be well capable of dealing with that.</p>

	<p pid="a.160.2/1">I was not going to, but, to make the point completely clear, I shall quote from the report that the hon. Member for Kingswood produced and in which my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1877" name="John Stanley">the Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)</phrase> participated. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.160.2/2" class="indent">&quot;In the past the Government produced the annual report about seven months after the end of the calendar year around the time (in July) that we are usually finalising our Report. This has meant that we have not been able to carry out any detailed scrutiny of the annual report until the following year. This year the Government indicated that it would produce the 2007 Annual Report on Strategic Export Controls in May 2008. In the event it was not able to produce the 2007 report by the time that we concluded our deliberations. The latest indication we have is that the 2007 Annual Report will be produced in July. This is no improvement on previous years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.160.2/3">I hope that that clarifies the report for my right hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.2/4">The Defence Export Services Organisation has been moved from the Ministry of Defence to UK Trade &amp; Investment within the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, but today's debate has not mentioned how the licensing regime affects DESO, whether DESO is happy with the regime and what criticisms DESO has of it. In considering these regulatory matters, one needs to take particular account of the Government organisation that is responsible for our defence exports.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.2/5">Two points that were raised in last year's debate still feature in this report, and the Minister of State, Department for International Development, did not comment on them when he responded last year. I have already commented on the timings of the Select Committee's reports and, on intervention, about the issue of defence attach&eacute;s, but the report says that</p>
	<p pid="a.160.2/6" class="indent">&quot;all of the departments concerned with the scrutiny of export licences need to keep under review whether the cutbacks in defence attach&eacute; posts is having a detrimental effect on the UK's export controls.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.160.2/7">Indeed, the then Secretary of State for Defence, the right hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, said in evidence on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-17">17 January 2008</phrase> that only about 5 per cent. of a defence attach&eacute;'s role was associated with any aspect of that work. But, as I stated last year, no one knows when that 5 per cent. of time occurs, given that 100 per cent. of a defence attach&eacute;'s time is spent dealing with defence matters.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-26a.161.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" colnum="161"  time="015:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090326/halltext/90326h0004.htm#09032635000302">
	<p pid="a.161.1/1">I entirely agree with my right hon. Friend. That is a very helpful intervention all round, so I am grateful to him for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/2">I shall move on to open general export licences. The UK Working Group on Arms reports that</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/3" class="indent">&quot;in 2004, 5 per cent. of OGELs were seen to be misused; in 2005, 8 per cent. were seen to be misused; and in 2006, 11 per cent. That is, just over one in 10, from compliance visits, are shown to have problems with their use.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/4">Indeed, David Hayes, the chairman of the Export Group for Aerospace and Defence, felt that it was a consequence of ignorance about the controls and a lack of concern for the consequences of non-compliance&mdash;an issue that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/5">That feeds nicely into the issue of enforcement, which the hon. Gentleman also raised. It is surely one of the most important issues, because, without effective enforcement, the rest almost become meaningless.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/6">This issue is worthy of debate, as Mark Pyman notes in his evidence to the Commerce Department in the USA, when saying that in the late 1990s</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/7" class="indent">&quot;50% of the complaints were about...bribery, even though that is only about 1% of the world trade&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/8">But of course that 1 per cent. is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/9">Rightly or wrongly, a large number of people view the defence trade with suspicion, because of allegations of bribery or because of the equipment that is traded. A good way of redressing this balance in the eyes of the public is to offer sizeable penalties for breaking the rules, as hon. Members have said. Paragraph 51 of the report notes that David Hayes from EGAD said:</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/10" class="indent">&quot;non-compliance with the UK system can make economic sense but non compliance with the US system never makes economic sense.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/11">That quote was also used by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire to prove that the US system is tougher than the UK system. Does the Minister agree that the potential damage to this business caused by breaching the rules would be a far greater deterrent than any excess legislation or red tape?</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/12">The Committee makes the sensible suggestion, in paragraph 117, that</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/13" class="indent">&quot;in a case where subsequently an exporter is convicted of corruption the Government revoke all his or her export licences.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/14">That was not mentioned by the Committee Chairman, but it is a good idea. Is the Minister still actively considering that? The Committee is also right to suggest that the Government should</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/15" class="indent">&quot;set out the timetable for bringing a fully searchable and regularly updated database of all licensing decisions into operation and publish details of its functionality and operating arrangements&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/16">as recommended in paragraph 85. The Government's response suggested that this would occur in early 2009. Perhaps the Minister will give an update and say exactly where we have got to on that project.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/17">Cluster munitions were mentioned by the Committee Chairman, I think. We Opposition Members support the agreement that was reached at Dublin and the treaty's subsequent ratification at Oslo. Cluster munitions have caused far too many indiscriminate casualties over the years. We saw that, as has been mentioned, in Lebanon; the maiming and killing caused by cluster munitions was a disgrace. However, it is also essential that the operational capability of our armed forces and their safety in a battlefield situation are not compromised. Therefore, alternative solutions need to be found.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/18">In an intervention, the Chairman raised the issue of re-exports, which is a serious matter for concern, particularly in view of the allegations relating to India's re-exporting maritime aircraft to Burma, which we need to consider carefully. The Committee suggests at paragraph 40</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/19" class="indent">&quot;that it should become a standard requirement of licensing that export contracts for goods on the Military List contain a clause preventing re-export to a destination subject to UN or EU embargo.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/20">That seems to me to be not only eminently sensible but a vital requirement. If there is an EU or UN embargo, why on earth are we even contemplating that somebody should be able to re-export arms to such regimes?</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/21">In his evidence, Mr. Doddrell, the director of the Export Control Organisation, noted that the</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/22" class="indent">&quot;preferred approach for some time has been to factor all these considerations into the initial licensing decision&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/23">That is the Government's procedure at the moment, so perhaps the Minister will tell us whether that remains their preferred option or whether he would be prepared to put in a clause physically preventing re-export to those countries with sanctions on them. There remains the concern that items may not be sold on for maybe 10, 15 or even 20 years, until the first trading partner has finished with them. The threat of re-exporting is now far easier to assess, through predicting how a country will behave in 20 years' time. Given our better knowledge these days, collected on the ground, surely it should be possible to assess such matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/24">Extra-territorial and dual-use regulations, internal agreements and end use have been mentioned. The report also raises other hot issues in terms of arms exports in respect of extra-territoriality and dual-use regulations. These areas are obviously a matter of concern and, as with previous subjects, we should not overlook them. But it is imperative that we remember that the British defence industry already adheres to some of the highest trade standards in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/25">As a nation with a proud heritage and respect abroad, I feel that our high standards are well recognised abroad. Although we must not take our eyes off our own exporters, it is vital that we expend a significant amount of time continuing to pursue agreements with our partners in the EU and beyond&mdash;I am sure that the Minister will say something about this in his summing up&mdash;without which continued domestic regulations and restrictions will put British defence exporters at a disadvantage. That will happen if we have a higher regulatory regime than is common for the rest of Europe. Furthermore, that will enable funds to go into the hands of nations without the principles that we adhere to, which will then have the funding to produce ever more abhorrent weapons, leaving our own armed forces, as a corollary, less well equipped to respond to potential threats. Surely we are in the business&mdash;I encourage the Minister to say this in his response&mdash;of trying to encourage others to live up to the highest standards that we set ourselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/26">Although good work has obviously been done with the international arms trade treaty so far, there remains much to be done in ensuring a high-level consistent approach to arms trading across the globe. The arms trade is worldwide and there is a clear limit to the effectiveness of national controls. Perhaps the Minister will say something about the progress on the arms trade treaty.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/27">Criterion 8, sustainable development, remains a key feature of this report and merits further consideration. Last year, as has already been mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling, Oxfam produced a report entitled &quot;Africa's Missing Billions&quot;, at the heart of which was the fact that armed conflict costs Africa around $18 billion per year, seriously derailing development. Some 95 per cent. of the weapons and ammunition used comes from outside Africa. Interestingly enough, because of our arms control regime, British arms exports to Africa in 2007 totalled a mere &pound;44 million. That is still a substantial figure, but small in relation to the whole trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/28">There seems to be quite a flaw in scrutiny when an export that should be subject to assessment by the Department for International Development as part of Criterion 8 can be &quot;sidestepped&quot;, to use the words of the Committee, if the end user is a private company, seemingly regardless of the company's ties to the Government. Perhaps the Minister, with his DFID and DBERR hats on, will say something about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/29">Once again, I congratulate the Committee Chairman on this excellent report. He has done well to get agreement across the four Committees, but&mdash;there is always a but, isn't there?&mdash;it is a shame that so many of the issues discussed last year remain as part of this report. Given the importance of the subject of the debate, it should be up to date, highlighting again the importance of the defence industry to our country without ignoring the importance of scrutiny. Tied to this, there is concern that the report gives too much weight to the views of the public sector directly tied to the industry and non-governmental organisations, but contains little about the views of the defence exporters, which, I have to say to the Committee Chairman, is a weakness. Where are the views of defence exporters and the Defence Export Services Organisation? What do those bodies find are the problems with this licensing regime? It would be interesting to hear from them about those problems.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.3/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Sir Nicholas. I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the issues that have been raised during this high-quality debate. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1663" name="Roger Berry">the Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry)</phrase> on the way in which he has carried out his role as Chair, and the constructive way in which he presented the reports. As always, we have had some thoughtful contributions from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1877" name="John Stanley">the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)</phrase> and the hon. Members for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik) and for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), who speaks for the official Opposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.3/2">I appreciate the acknowledgement by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood that substantial progress has been made on arms export controls over several years. I also appreciate the comments from the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling saying that, in broad terms, the UK is in pretty full compliance with the EU's consolidated criteria. He went on to raise issues concerning components, China, Israel and Palestine, and I will come to those shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.3/3">I support the comments made by the hon. Member for Cotswold in reference to the defence industry's importance to the United Kingdom, not only as the bedrock of providing high-quality goods and services to our armed services, but through the role that arms exports and the jobs associated with them play in the UK's economy. A key to the continuing success of the industry is good regulation, which is where effective licence controls are relevant. The UK can be proud of the standards that it sets and maintains, but it is important continually to be challenged. That is the purpose of this debate, and hon. Members do that regularly throughout the year. We may not always agree&mdash;I shall point out some areas where there are honest disagreements&mdash;but we will always engage, listen and consider thoroughly the reports that come from Committees.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.3/4">Hon. Members will be aware that we are coming to the end of the post-implementation review of the controls introduced in 2004. We are grateful for the input of the Committees, NGOs and industry stakeholders. All parties were struck by the collaboration that we managed to achieve together, and I look forward to that continuing. We will soon have completed implementation of most of the changes coming out of the review. We have taken significant steps to strengthen export controls where there has been concern, and to fulfil commitments and our responses to the public consultation. Hon. Members will be aware that we have introduced controls on sting sticks, and fully extended extraterritorial controls to UK persons anywhere in the world trading in small arms and man-portable air defence systems&mdash;MANPADS. We changed the controls on cluster munitions, subjecting them to the strictest controls, and we have controlled both extraterritorial trading by United Kingdom persons and trading within the United Kingdom, in addition to the full range of support activities. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April</phrase>, legislation will come into force to extend the fully extraterritorial trade controls to light weapons and to tighten controls on the transport of those weapons and similar goods of heightened concern between overseas destinations, and controls on their transit or transhipment via the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.3/5">Officials have started work on pursuing our commitments on torture and military end-use controls at European level. Thanks to the positive and constructive engagement of our stakeholders, we have a strong package that will significantly enhance our controls where concerns have been expressed for a considerable time.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.3/6">I want to refer to some significant successes over the past year or so, and to respond fully to the many points that have been made during this debate. I was pleased that when I appeared before the Committee, I was able to announce that we were proceeding with plans for the introduction of civil penalties. I am firmly convinced of their value, and hope that we can obtain the necessary consensus in government so that the process of introducing a regime can begin in earnest. We have also introduced procedures for companies or individuals to have their registration for open general export licences withdrawn if they have a poor compliance record, or for other appropriate reasons, such as being convicted of export control-related offences. The hon. Member for Cotswold raised that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.3/7">There have been two major successful prosecutions. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire mentioned John Knight, who was convicted of transferring machine guns between Iran and Kuwait, and sentenced to four years' imprisonment with a confiscation order of &pound;53,000. Mehrdad Salashoor was convicted of illegally exporting to Iran navigation equipment that could be adapted for use in missile guidance systems. He was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment with a confiscation order of &pound;433,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.3/8">On enforcement activity, we have increased the number of awareness events by 10 per cent. and the number of company training visits by 80 per cent. We are developing, and are about to launch, an online searchable database to improve access to publicly available licensing information. The industry and NGOs have been involved in the development and testing of the database, and we have offered to organise a demonstration for the Committees.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.3/9">We introduced SPIRE on time and within budget, which was an outstanding achievement. Despite that introduction and a 35 per cent. increase in applications, we have exceeded performance targets over the past 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.3/10">Hon. Members will be aware that a directive to simplify the terms and conditions for the transfer of defence-related products in the EU was adopted by the European Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-16">16 December</phrase>. It will now be considered for adoption by the Council of Ministers. Due to the efforts of the UK delegation, which included the Export Control Organisation, and representatives negotiating the directive, the Government believe that there will be few practical implications for the UK export licensing system, which remains robust.</p>

	<p pid="a.171.1/1">I have explained why I think it would difficult, if not impossible, to enforce that outside the UK's jurisdiction, and I have nothing further to add. However, when licences have been issued but information subsequently comes to light of an undesirable re-export, we have the power to revoke the licence under secondary legislation. The impact of doing so would obviously be limited if the goods had already been re-exported, but we would be able to factor that information into subsequent licensing decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.1/2">I turn to some of the points made by the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling, as well as to picking up on points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood and others. The right hon. Gentleman raised the question of components. He spoke specifically about F-16s, Apache helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles. When we are talking about components that potentially have a dual use, there can be a risk of diversion. In some clear cases, such as those involving head-up displays, which he mentioned, components have been incorporated into systems in a way that causes extreme concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.1/3">I cannot, as the right hon. Gentleman asked, undertake today to review our policy, but I shall give the matter some consideration and report back to the Committee on whether, based on our evidence, a case could be made for reviewing our procedures.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.2/1">I asked the Minister whether he would conduct a very carefully considered review of whether this substantial trade with China, as shown in EU figures, is fully compliant with the terms of the EU combined criteria. For example, is he satisfied that every item that has received a licence from his Department is compliant with criteria 2(a)? That states:</p>

	<p pid="a.172.3/1">The Government rigorously assess all licence applications for exports to China and other countries, and we have no reason to believe that any of our decisions have been wrong, so no case could be made for a review.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.3/2">Many hon. Members have rightly taken a strong and close interest in defence exports to Israel, which is entirely understandable, given what happened in Gaza recently. I can only repeat what ministerial colleagues have said many times before: the licensing criteria must be the basis of all our decisions. If issuing a licence would be inconsistent with those criteria, the licence will be refused. That policy has remained constant over many years&mdash;it has not changed because it has not needed to. However, the circumstances to which the risk assessments are applied do change. As the Committee knows, the circumstances at the time of the application are taken fully into account when decisions are made.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.3/3">Not all licences granted for exports to Israel are for equipment that will remain there. Many involve equipment for incorporation into larger equipment and onward export to a third country. Also, many are for dual use rather than military items. Overseas posts have standing instructions to report any misuse of UK-supplied equipment, and should any relevant information come to light, whether through the media, non-governmental organisations or intelligence reports, it will be taken into account when assessing future licences. Those issues might also be raised with the authorities in the country in question. Hon. Members will be aware that the FCO will shortly make a statement, and on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-04">4 March</phrase>, the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" name="Bill Rammell">the hon.

	<p pid="a.173.2/1">May I respond to what the Minister said to me about a review of policy towards Israel? He spoke as if the policy is set in stone and does not take into account events&mdash;particularly recent events. Does he not agree that it is incumbent on him and his colleagues to look at recent events and consider whether the uses that have been made by Israel of military equipment are still compliant with EU criteria? Again, I refer him to criteria 2 (c), which says that member states shall</p>

	<p pid="a.173.3/1">Absolutely; I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that decisions on licensing must take account of current and recent events, and that is exactly what they do. The licensing criteria and policy itself has not changed, and does not need to change. None the less, it should be looked at in the light of current events. Any future licensing applications for exports of goods and components to Israel will have to bear in mind the recent events that have tragically taken place in that country.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/2">At the risk of being controversial, I should like to respond to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood about the moral equivalence of an arms embargo on both Hamas and Israel. One is a terrorist organisation and the other is a democracy. It is right that we should apply different criteria to terrorist organisations and democratic countries. That is not to say that we do not have concerns about the use of military goods exports. Clearly, we do, and we take it into account as part of the licensing criteria. I do not accept the rationale of my hon. Friend's argument, but if he wants to explain it again to me, I will happily give way to him.</p>
