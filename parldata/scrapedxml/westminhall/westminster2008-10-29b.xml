	<p pid="b.233.2/1">I am grateful to have the opportunity to debate this important subject and I am pleased to do so under your chairmanship, Mr. Hancock.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/2">I have had the honour of being a Member of Parliament for more than 21 years. During that period, I have spoken in many debates on a large number of issues. Uniquely on this occasion, however, it is an extremely humbling experience to speak on this subject and I am acutely aware of the sensitivities of the families who have lost loved ones due to the acts of terrorists, irrespective of whether their loved one was a member of the armed forces, the emergency services, the police, or whether they were on holiday, at work or going to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/3">The pain of losing a loved one is both physically and mentally traumatic. Life for the living is changed for ever. For those who survive a terrorist attack, including many with the most horrific injuries, their courage and determination are such that I find words inadequate to describe my personal admiration for them all.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/4">I am absolutely sure that I speak for the whole House in saying that, whatever the outcome of today's debate, there is an overriding patriotic case for establishing a fund to compensate fellow citizens and their families who become victims of overseas terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/5">As a constituency MP, I have seen and heard at first hand the suffering, both mental and physical, of innocent victims who are placed on the front line by the perpetrators of terrorist acts. They are not volunteers or conscripts. They are all innocent men, women and children who are abused by the vilest and most cowardly of acts.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/6">As a Cabinet Minister, I was confronted by the realities of terrorism and, for a period, I was appointed a member of the Cabinet Sub-Committee that brought together Ministers and Departments across Whitehall to consider the plight of British citizens who are victims of overseas terrorism and to consider the Bill presented by my noble Friend Lord Brennan in another place on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-20">20 April 2007</phrase>, the Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/7">In paying tribute to Lord Brennan and his continuing efforts on this matter, I would like to quote his opening statement in support of his Bill in the House of Lords:</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/8" class="indent">&quot;The spirit of our nation includes a sense of wanting to help those in need and wanting to right an injustice. In both those characteristics of our national spirit, we are failing the victims of terrorism abroad. For them, there is no system of assistance, compensation or, in simple terms, justice. Wherever the grieving spouse of a victim or an injured person might be, they are in a country abroad, suffering mentally and physically, culturally adrift and often without the means, either financial or organisational, to remedy their predicament.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2007-04-20.447"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 20 April 2007; Vol. 691, c. 447</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/9">For me in the Foreign Office, it was just another Monday morning when I was asked by the current Minister for Housing, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1533" name="Margaret Beckett">the Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett)</phrase>, who was then the Foreign Secretary, to attend a Cabinet Sub-Committee meeting on behalf of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to consider the Government's response to Lord Brennan's initiative of trying to establish a fund for victims of overseas terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/10">I will be frank with the House: my brief from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office was first to oppose the extension of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1995 to take account of overseas incidents and, secondly, to oppose any Bill proposed in another place on the grounds that the issues were technically too difficult. Being a person of independent thought, it took me all of five seconds to put the brief in my red box and leave it there.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/11">I knew from my constituency experience that it was a national scandal that nothing had yet been done to assist our citizens&mdash;our innocent citizens&mdash;who were devastated by terrorist incidents abroad. At that meeting, I argued strongly that there should be equality of treatment for all British victims of terrorism wherever they are attacked in the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/12">Victims of terrorism overseas were highly unlikely to receive any compensation through existing schemes or insurance schemes, or from the Government in the countries where such attacks have taken place. Although European Union member states and a handful of other countries do compensate foreign nationals, to my knowledge at that time there was no evidence that any British victims of overseas terrorist attacks had been compensated by the state in which the attack had occurred.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/13">I understand that, in the past 10 years, British citizens have been killed or injured in numerous terrorist attacks across the globe: in Afghanistan; Bangladesh; Egypt; Greece; Bali, in Indonesia; Israel; Iraq; Jordan; the Maldives; Pakistan; Qatar; Russia; Saudi Arabia; Sri Lanka; Spain; Thailand; Turkey; the United States, and in other countries. Sadly, by the Government's best estimates, 190 of our fellow British citizens have died and another 156 have been injured as a result of terrorist incidents abroad.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/14">During the Cabinet Sub-Committee meeting, I set out from my own memory what the Government had done or had committed to do&mdash;quite rightly in my view&mdash;in furtherance of its counter-terrorism policies. The Government's counter-terrorism strategy is based on a number of distinct strands, which can be summed up in four words: prevent, pursue, protect, prepare. The Government have spent hundreds of millions of pounds on increasing funding in a range of areas: more than &pound;85 million was given to the NHS to counter bio-terrorism; &pound;56 million was given to the fire service for decontamination programmes; a further &pound;132 million was given to the fire service for search and rescue equipment; &pound;49 million was given to the Metropolitan police, and &pound;12 million was given to other national police forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/15">The Government have also tightened port, airport and border security; speeded up extradition processes; frozen the assets of international terrorist organisations; increased joint working and intelligence sharing internationally; increased the size of the Security Service, so that it can analyse and act on more information; introduced exercise programmes to deal with terrorism scenarios; established chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear resilience programmes; and allocated millions of pounds to equip acute hospitals and the ambulance service against terrorist attacks</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/16">Absolutely nothing is left to chance in this wide-ranging programme of investment, restructuring, change of ethos, partnership working and pre-incident and post-incident planning. Sadly, from their perspective a terrorist only has to get it right once; as a country, we have to get it right all the time.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/17">In identifying ways of protecting the UK, however, we are in danger of forgetting the victims of terrorist attacks. Surely, action to assist victims of overseas terrorism is the last piece in this jigsaw of measures that the Government have so wisely invested in.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/18">I agree with the views expressed by Amnesty International that victims of such attacks must have the rights to justice, truth and reparation; that states must not neglect the needs and rights of victims, and must move beyond rhetoric that shows solidarity with victims and ensures in law that the victims are protected, including providing dedicated resources, without discrimination, in recognition of their mental and physical suffering; and that we must understand that no citizen can plan for an attack or, in practice, have the means, either financially or organisationally, to remedy their predicament if they become an innocent victim of a terrorism attack.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/19">At this point, I want to pay a genuine tribute to my right hon. Friend, the Minister. I have known her for more than 20 years and I worked with her for a period when she was a mental health commissioner. For 11 years, we were ministerial colleagues and members of the Cabinet. Above all, however, it is in her role as the Minister with responsibility for humanitarian assistance that I genuinely admire her most. This is a role she has undertaken since the appalling attacks in the United States on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>. I have listened to her in Cabinet meetings and in small groups, speaking with passion, compassion, empathy, love and understanding of the most grievous of situations faced by families of the victims and survivors of terrible incidents in London, the United States, Bali, Egypt, Iraq and Turkey, among others. I know that she is deeply committed to the cause of British victims of terrorist incidents and I know that she particularly feels that there is an absolute need for both formal recognition and sympathy from the Government for all those who are victims of these attacks, whether the tragedy has been of a domestic nature or one that has happened overseas. I know that equality of treatment for victims is my right hon. Friend the Minister's personal aim and I genuinely hope that the debate today will assist her in achieving that goal, which she and Lord Brennan have so assiduously campaigned for inside and outside Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/20">As I stated earlier, during my time in Government, I was exposed to the reality of the effects of terrorist acts on numerous occasions. The plane attacks in the United States on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase> raised the profile of terrorism and brought to the world's attention the horrific nature of such attacks on people who are completely innocent. Sadly, I was in office as Minister without Portfolio during the Sharm el-Sheikh terror bombings in Egypt in July 2005. In that tragic incident, 88 people were killed, the majority of them Egyptian citizens, and more than 200 other people were wounded by the blasts. 13 British citizens died in the attacks. It was the worst terrorist incident in Egypt's history. But it, like all overseas terrorist attacks, returned to the house in the street, village or city where the victims came from. Sharm el-Sheikh came to my town, Ashton-in-Makerfield. A matter of hours after the terrible atrocity, Sharm el-Sheikh was on the lips of every person in my community.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/21">My constituents John Green and his son were in one of the hotels hit by the bombers on that fateful day. Mr. Green and his son were on holiday, enjoying the summer sunshine on the Egyptian coast. On the night of the bombing, Mr. Green and his son decided to retire to bed, as they had a father-and-son trip planned for early the next day and wanted to get some well-earned sleep. Not long after retiring, a truck bomb blasted through the reception area of Mr. Green's hotel, killing many innocent people. Some of those killed were his friends who had been socialising with him only an hour or so before the blast. After the bomb went off, guests were evacuated from the hotel. Mr. Green sheltered his son's eyes from the horror of the surrounding scene, which was caused by the huge blast. Then, he bravely went back in to the hotel, trying to help blast survivors to get out and receive medical attention. What he saw when he returned to the hotel is far too horrific for me to describe in this Chamber. The images still haunt him to this day.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/22">Mr. Green and his son were helped by the Red Cross and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to return home to Ashton-in-Makerfield. But that is where the help ended. Mr. Green quickly discovered that his insurance scheme did not cover terrorist incidents, and that he was not eligible for any compensation from his insurance company or from the Government. This distressed him a great deal. Worse still, being self-employed, there was no mechanism for him to take sick or compassionate leave, so, despite suffering from extreme trauma, as his child was, he had to return to work straight away. To keep his family income going, he returned to work when he should have been recuperating from his horrific experience. There was nothing else he could do, and that is utterly and completely unacceptable&mdash;in all circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/23">The help that Mr. Green was given in Egypt was excellent in terms of the care and the understanding that he received from Government officials and Red Cross workers. But, he believes it to be a national shame that on his return to the United Kingdom, there was no financial aid to ensure that he and his son could maintain their lives while they tried to come to terms with what they had seen, and to put their shattered lives back together.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/24">Trevor and Jill Lakin's 28-year-old son, Jeremy, from London, was killed in the bomb blast in Sharm el-Sheikh, along with his girlfriend, Annalie Vickers. His parents have been emotionally devastated by their deaths, as have his two brothers, and neither Jill nor Trevor has returned to full-time work. Their insurers paid for the repatriation of the bodies, and Trevor and Jill's original travel expenses to Egypt were paid by the tour operator and insurers, but, because of the terrorism exclusion clause in their son's travel policies, there was compensation neither for his loss of life, nor for his girlfriend's. I pay tribute to Trevor Lakin, who has assiduously campaigned on behalf of other victims. I understand that he was present at an event organised by the Minister's office earlier this month to promote engagement between Government and the insurance industry on the establishment of a compensation scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/25">Another case involves Glenn and Ian Shadbolt, from Midhurst, West Sussex. Glenn was badly injured in the Sharm el-Sheik attack on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-23">23 July 2005</phrase>, and, as he was in critical condition, he was flown to Cairo. After three days he was flown to London, where his wounds were found to be badly infected, and he required seven and a half hours of emergency surgery. Glenn suffered chest, arms, face, neck and eye injuries. He was transferred to Moorfields eye hospital for a further four and a half hours of surgery on his eyes. He has since lost the sight of his right eye, and he spent three weeks in London hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/26">No financial aid was given to Glenn's parents, who had to provide themselves with accommodation in London. Glenn also lost all his belongings and has not received any insurance payment. He has used all his savings and is now in debt, with little hope of being able to repay the loans. Glenn continues to have glass removed from his body as it gradually comes to the surface. Sadly, there are many more cases, and I want to apologise because in the limited time available, I am not able to outline other victims' cases, all of whose losses have been extremely grievous.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/27">Trying to understand grief and loss is very difficult for people who have not experienced that situation. I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> for coming to today's debate, as I know from his experiences how difficult this issue must be for him. I lost a child&mdash;not through terrorist activity, but I lost a child&mdash;so I know what it is like to focus on the life lost, but at the same time to try to cope with the loss of the life that was to come. We can try as hard as we can to cope with the death, or the reality of the death, but all that was to come&mdash;all our hopes and aspirations&mdash;has been wiped out, too. The friendship and companionship; the experience of simply growing up with one's child and helping them to be the best that they can be; the loving relationships; the possibility of grandchildren; the birthdays and holidays yet to come; the opportunity just to be there for each other; hearing their voice and feeling their touch; their smell, their laugh and their smile&mdash;all are lost, and lost for ever. Hope is replaced by simple hopelessness&mdash;the feeling of being powerless to change anything. All those feelings are the feelings of the survivors, but, in addition, they find that they are rejected by their own nation, simply because the loss that they suffered was in a place far away from the shores of their homeland.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/28">In all circumstances, that cannot be right. It is indefensible and needs to change. The Bill of my noble Friend Lord Brennan sought to make provision, first, for advice and assistance to victims of acts of terrorism taking place outside the United Kingdom and, secondly, for arrangements under which insurance is made available to individuals in respect of risks against injury resulting from acts of terrorism taking place outside the United Kingdom. It was an eight-clause Bill, dealing with issues such as advice and assistance, arrangements with insurers, overseas terrorism awards scheme, the basis on which compensation would be calculated, how to claim the awards, reviews and appeals procedures, and the relationship between the criminal injuries compensation scheme and the potential overseas terrorism awards scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/29">Lord Brennan's Bill sought to address many questions of principle, and he eloquently raised many of the issues that I shall speak about today. He highlighted the importance of travel insurance, the need for a focus on consumer awareness of travel insurance policies, and ensuring that policies that offer cover in the event of a terrorist attack are available. I know that my right hon. Friend the Minister agrees with that, and I am sure that she will set out her views in response to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/30">Lord Brennan further proposed the principle of the Government reinsuring terrorism risks. This practice exists and is well known to the Government in relation to terrorism and terrorist attacks. For example, following the IRA bombings in the City of London, the Pool Reinsurance Company scheme was established, which, over the years, has grown significantly and is designed to be used in the event of terrorist attacks on buildings in the City of London. Without tempting fate, the threat of IRA attacks has receded owing to the changing political landscape in Ireland. However, al-Qaeda and other terrorists have, no doubt, a miserly, fanatical and dangerous eye on the City of London, its citizens, its workers and its infrastructure. Although the funds do not belong to the Government, there is a direct relationship. The Government helped to put the scheme in place and they act as the guarantor of last resort. As a consequence, the Treasury receives income from the interest that the Pool Re scheme generates from its &pound;1.6 billion of assets. If the Minister knows, perhaps she will tell us about the interest income that the Treasury receives from that &pound;1.6 billion investment. If she does not, perhaps she will write to me.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/31">I believe that there is sufficient good will and wriggle-room to engage the City and the Treasury in finding a way of deploying some of those resources to assist our hard-working citizens, who become the front-line victims of fanatical terrorists. Unfortunately, without Government support, my noble Friend's Bill could not find a passage from the House of Lords to this place, so, sadly, it did not make it on to the statute book.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/32">It is not for me to steal my right hon. Friend the Minister's thunder, but no doubt she will outline all that the Government have done since our meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-30">30 January</phrase>, and, in particular, her efforts since my noble Friend's Bill was proposed in the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-20">20 April 2007</phrase>. However, her esteemed efforts have so far failed to secure Treasury agreement&mdash;even in principle&mdash;to the establishment of a compensation fund. To assist the process, following the meeting that I had with her and her officials on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-30">30 January</phrase>, which included the head of the consular crisis group and the deputy head of the humanitarian assistance unit, I wrote to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-19">19 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/33">In my letter I asked the Treasury to agree a mechanism that would, I hoped, create a fund similar to the one managed by the Home Office for victims of terrorism in the United Kingdom, and to include a commitment in the then upcoming Budget to create a fund to compensate British citizens who become victims of overseas terrorism. Unfortunately, I was advised that the work of the humanitarian assistance unit and Treasury officials had not yet been concluded, and that therefore at that point the Government could not</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/34" class="indent">&quot;consider making any announcement of a new compensation mechanism&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/35">I would like to pass on my continued thanks to the Minister's humanitarian assistance unit. I know that its members are absolutely dedicated and committed, not just as civil servants but as human beings, to resolving this issue. They have been extremely helpful to me and my office, and I want to place that on the record.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/36">Basically, the response from the Chancellor of the Exchequer's office was saying, in a polite way, &quot;So far&mdash;no further forward.&quot; I believe that either today or as soon after today as possible, the Government should set out a way forward. Victims and their families have been waiting such a long time. They have said much about their concerns, and have bravely campaigned for the recognition that this scheme would provide for them. The one thing that I and they all fear, as does my noble Friend Lord Brennan, is that there will be another atrocity involving innocent British citizens and the cycle of violence and non-recognition will continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/37">I therefore propose a potential way forward. There should be an agreement in principle to establish a scheme and possibly for that to be announced in the pre-Budget report. We need a timetable to conclude discussions between the Government and the travel insurance industry and to establish a scheme with costs being met on a shared basis. My noble Friend Lord Brennan proposed a 50:50 split. I do not say that at this stage&mdash;it should be a matter for negotiation. However, a scheme could be established by the proportion of the market insured by the industry&mdash;for example, 87 per cent.&mdash;with the Government picking up the remaining uninsured section. According to market analysts, at the moment that would cost the Treasury about &pound;330,000 per year. That is thousands, not millions, of pounds per year to establish and develop the fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/38">In establishing a new scheme, we should also look at the issues associated with retrospective measures to assist the 190 families of the victims who have died and the 156 victims who have been injured in the last 10 years by terrorist incidents abroad. In 2007, market penetration for all travel insurance was 87 per cent., which implies that 13 per cent. travel uninsured. Twenty million people per year are estimated to buy travel insurance. In 2006, the premium income from the UK travel insurance market was valued at about &pound;709 million. That is forecast to rise, even in current conditions, to at least &pound;838 million by the turn of this decade. That figure puts into stark reality how little we are talking about in terms of known managed risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/39">My noble Friend, Lord Brennan, speaking in another place, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/40" class="indent">&quot;I shall make two points about the insurance industry. If there are 10 million holidays to countries that do not have systems of compensation that we can call upon and we say that the average premium is &pound;15 or &pound;20, that is touching &pound;100 million for the two-thirds of the 10 million who might take out a policy. Out of that &pound;100 million, our Government takes 17.5 per cent. insurance premium tax, which is &pound;17.5 million. They are acutely aware of the value of the travel insurance market. There are six national insurance firms providing cover, and they must be doing so on the basis that it is economic, it covers the risk and there is a reasonable premium to be charged. So this is a case not of insoluble complexities but of a meeting&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2007-04-20.462"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 20 April 2007; Vol. 691, c. 462</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/41">He then proposed a meeting between the Government, the insurers, the British Insurance Brokers Association and all interested parties in order to come up with a solution. I am sure that my right hon. Friend will inform the House of progress in the discussions between the Government and the insurance industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/42">At this point I would like to thank Lovells, acknowledge the personal briefing that I received before today's debate and recognise the pro bono work that it carries out on behalf of the victims of terrorism. I also thank Amnesty International and Liberty for communicating with me with substantive, excellent background papers, and the Association of British Insurers for its helpful note on insurance issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/43">It would be wrong not to acknowledge that there has been some movement in recent years to recognise the need to establish funding for UK victims of overseas terrorism. I have no doubt that my right hon. Friend the Minister will set out in detail how the Government have assisted the British Red Cross in setting up a charitable fund for the victims of terrorism overseas. However, the sums are small indeed: between &pound;3,000 and &pound;12,000, and it is not a compensation scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/44">Having set out a plan of action, it would be remiss of me not to, at the very least, give some examples of what compensation schemes would look like in terms of cost. No longer being a Minister, and having no inside knowledge of the Treasury, I am not privy to any financial modelling that has been or is being done to evaluate the cost of compensation schemes, borne either wholly by the public purse or by my suggestion of a shared cost between the public purse and the insurance industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/45">It is extremely difficult to predict how many people might be affected in years to come, so the likely cost of such a scheme is hard to calculate. Tragically, however, we have previous incidents from which to gauge what could be payable to UK victims utilising either the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1995 tariff, or the more generous level offered to the <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-07">7 July</phrase> victims by the London Bombings Relief Charitable Fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/46">In 2005, the Sharm el-Sheikh attack affected 25 of our fellow citizens; 13 died, three had severe injuries, five had permanent injuries, and four had short-term injuries. Using those four categories and a number of legitimate assumptions regarding matters such as the cost of fuel expenses, special care and loss of future earnings, the Treasury and the humanitarian assistance unit would be able accurately to assess potential awards. In the case of the 7/7 victims, several awards reached the maximum cap of &pound;500,000. For the similarly tragic incident in Sharm el-Sheikh, absolutely nothing was received in recognition of the tragic loss of loved ones&mdash;that is, in terms of the financial loss; the human loss is incalculable.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/47">At the Cabinet Sub-Committee meeting that I attended on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-22">22 February 2007</phrase>, there was much in the briefings about the technical difficulties surrounding the establishment of a scheme. It is, in the light of my experience in Government, the intent to overcome detail that is the determining factor in whether a decision will be implemented. No issue that I dealt with in my 11 years as a Minister could have been seen through without willingness and intent to provide the capacity and resources to overcome detail. Sometimes detail is a mere fig leaf of an excuse&mdash;to put off or simply refuse to take the necessary action.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/48">Let us be clear, we are talking about our fellow human beings&mdash;our fellow citizens who have been killed, had limbs shredded, been blinded, burned and maimed. As a consequence, their whole lives have been destabilised. For those who are killed there is no life at all; for their loved ones, it is a life devoid of a loving relationship, of a father, a mother, a son, a daughter, a brother, a sister, or the dearest friend they could ever have had. We must not continue to compound that loss by failing to act this time. If the Americans, Australians, French, Italians, Finns, Swedes, Israelis can find a way through the detail and complexities to provide cover, why can we not? Ours is a Government who in recent weeks have brought forward proposals that have saved the world's international financial system, yet they find it so difficult to recognise this wrong and make it right.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.2/49">I conclude by saying that in the second world war, when London was subjected to a savage attack during the blitz, the Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill, said that it was unfair for British society to place the entire burden of the destruction on those unlucky enough to be hit. It is equally unfair not to compensate and assist those killed or injured by terrorism abroad. We rightly give assistance and compensation if terrorism occurs in this country, and not only to our own citizens, I am proud to say, but to the citizens of other countries who visit our shores and are affected by terrorism here. I therefore urge my right hon. Friend the Minister to act now in bringing the insurance industry and the Government together, to establish as soon as possible an agreed scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" name="Ian McCartney">the right hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase> not just on securing this debate but on delivering a speech that was full of passion and detail. I certainly found his arguments compelling. I hope that the Minister and those who read this debate will also find the arguments compelling, because there is a proven need for the kind of scheme, without going into the detail, that the right hon. Gentleman proposed.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/2">Indeed, in 2005, the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said that he would consider setting up such a scheme. It is a shame that almost four years later we seem to be no further forward and that schemes proposed in the other place have not received Government support.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/3">Ten million Brits travel to countries outside Europe and the USA that are not covered by schemes. Some of those people will have insurance, some will not. Some will think that they have insurance but then discover when they try to claim that they do not because the policy excludes acts of terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/4">It seems a shame that, whenever someone from this country leaves these shores, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office seems to want to wash its hands of them. It is as if they shake the sand off their shoes and leave everything behind. We have good consular services, and I do not question what the FCO is able to achieve for people who have difficulties when they are abroad. However, there seems to be a difference between the attitude of this country and that of other countries. The countries that set up schemes show a desire to protect their citizens anywhere in the world rather than just within their own shores.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/5">The current Prime Minister has asserted his Britishness. He has spoken about it. I would hope that his Britishness is not bounded by the shores of this country but that it embraces all our citizens, wherever they travel around the world. As the right hon. Member for Makerfield said, we have a Prime Minister who seems to be capable of understanding very big numbers, but schemes such as this involve very small numbers. It is the negotiation around who pays the small sums that seems to cause so much difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/6">It was said in a debate in the other place that travellers should have their own insurance. I have travel insurance. I have a specific policy and believe that I also have two others: I have a bank account that I am told gives me a level of travel insurance, and a credit card which I believe does as well. I could not say whether any of those three policies would cover me for an act of terrorism; for example, if I had been in the bar in Bali or Sharm el-Sheikh and had been a victim of those terrorist attacks. I suspect that any hon. Member in this place would struggle to say what cover they have under their insurance. Some will know because they religiously go through all the detail, but most of us do not, because we do not have time to do that. We have travel insurance and therefore think that we are covered, but that is not always the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/7">Some people who travel find the additional cost of &pound;100 for insurance slightly excessive and therefore travel without it. It is now the case that one can travel to Egypt and other countries very cheaply at certain times. In fact, it can be cheaper to travel to some of those places than to holiday in Europe. Sometimes it is even cheaper than holidaying in the UK. Sometimes when people aspire to broaden their outlook and to enjoy the treasures that are there to be explored when abroad, they are working on a tight budget and cut the travel insurance. They are unwise to do so, but the only way to stop that would be to have compulsory travel insurance, and I do not think that that is a line that we would want to take.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/8">The right hon. Member for Makerfield referred to insurance picking up the costs of people who are insured and the state picking up the costs of people who are not insured. I do not have a problem with that model, but some might argue that it would be unfair because some people would pay for cover while others would not. There is also the risk that some insurers would exclude terror if they knew that the Government would pick it up if the person had an insurance policy that did not cover it. I understand that complications with the model would have to be worked out.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/9">Other countries successfully provide such insurance, as the right hon. Gentleman said. The USA has the international terrorism victim expense reimbursement programme, which covers medical, mental health, property loss, funeral and other miscellaneous expenses. Australia does not have a comprehensive package but it does have individual packages. Again, they are funded by the Government. They are run by Medicare, which is a separate Government agency. Finland has extended its general criminal injury policy to cover people who are injured while abroad. The French started to bring in schemes after a wave of terrorist attacks in France in 1986. They were based on a levy on property insurance and were primarily intended to cover internal acts of terrorism but now also cover people who travel abroad. Israel, which has had compensation schemes for acts of terror since the state was founded, primarily covered people on its borders but extended coverage in 1970 with compensation for victims of hostile acts. It is paid through the National Insurance Institute and involves a universal insurance contribution. Italy also has a Government-funded scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/10">Why should a Government help to ensure that such a scheme is provided? I would argue, in principle, that somebody who is the victim of a terrorist act while travelling is not the victim of an act aimed at that individual. The situation is not the same as being robbed or mugged, or coming down with an illness while travelling. The person is the victim of an act against the state in which they are travelling. In cases such as Bali, the act was not just against the state they were travelling in but against the states from which they came. That act of terror was aimed as much at the west and Australia as it was against Indonesia.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/11">If acts are aimed not at individuals but at the state, surely the state has a duty to try to compensate and to protect. Sadly, Government actions sometimes exacerbate acts of terror. It was predicted that the war in Iraq would increase acts of terror, and that has happened. I shall not use this debate to argue about whether the war in Iraq was right or wrong, but sometimes the things that we do provoke a reaction from other groups, and people become the victims of a reaction to the actions of the state. That does not in any way justify acts of terror, but we must understand that sometimes the sad consequence of trying to do something right is that other people will use that act as an excuse for an act that is evil.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/12">I will not go into detail about what type of scheme, whether Pool Re or a straight levy on insurance, should be used because, in a sense, that does not matter. What matters is that we have a scheme that is simple for people to claim on. Such claims must be quick, not complicated. They should not take a long time, because when people are grieving the last thing they want is long arguments with lawyers and others to try to recoup, at least financially, what they can&mdash;although they can never recoup the emotional costs&mdash;in a way that does not worsen the bereavement and pain that they already feel.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/13">I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on securing this debate. I hope that the Minister will listen carefully to the points raised and that, in the near future, the Government will come up with their own scheme that allows those people who, sadly, have their lives destroyed or maimed by acts of terror to be compensated, at least financially.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-29b.243.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" speakername="Tobias Ellwood" colnum="243"  time="010:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081029/halltext/81029h0002.htm#08102933000454">
	<p pid="b.243.0/1">I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" name="Ian McCartney">the right hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase>, who secured this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/2">This is a sensitive subject that exposes Members of Parliament directly to those people affected by a situation or a circumstance that is often so horrific that we cannot but be moved by what we are speaking about. That point was illustrated by both the right hon. Gentleman and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1870" name="Richard Younger-Ross">the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/3">It is important to remind ourselves that this is the first such debate that we have had; it is long overdue. The right hon. Gentleman mentioned Lord Brennan's private Member's Bill, which went to some lengths to try to illustrate the problems and difficulties that we face in providing compensation for overseas victims of terrorism. I am grateful for this chance to put on the record my thoughts, both personal and from my party's perspective, because we face a dilemma that needs to be resolved.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/4">I pay tribute to the Minister for the Olympics, the Minister present this morning, whom I met before I became a Member of Parliament because of the involvement that I had with the Bali bombings. She has been stalwart, both personally and from her party's perspective, in trying to promote an understanding of the situation. I speak for all the victims' families, who have been pleased with the sensitivity with which she has conducted these affairs and with the way in which she has tried to pioneer a way forward in reconciling the problems relating to compensation for terrorist attacks that take place overseas. I place on record my gratitude to her for all her hard work, which I appreciate personally. I think that I speak for the whole House when I thank her for the dedication that she has shown to the families, for looking after and nurturing the individuals' needs and for doing other things, too&mdash;from making the Government recognise their role in alleviating some of the pain experienced from the event itself, all the way through to the creation of a memorial and trying to establish some funding to help those who may yet experience a horrific terrorist attack.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/5">I also place on the record my appreciation of the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor, who when Foreign Secretary summoned me to see him after the Bali bombings when I lost my brother on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-12">12 October 2002</phrase>. I was not a Member of Parliament then. I made a bit of a song and dance about the lack of support that the Government provided; there was no ambassador there, no Land Rover with a British flag on it and no support of any sort. The right hon. Gentleman kindly invited me and my sister to see him and, for an hour and a half, we made some recommendations, including on the establishment of an emergency response team, which is now up and running and, I am pleased to say, working effectively, not just helping out in respect of terrorist attacks, but helping in natural incidents, such as the tsunami, providing support for British citizens who are caught up in such horrific events overseas.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/6">I ask the Minister to explain and place on the record how she has continued to keep this brief, in respect of which she has been effective. She clearly works as part of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport team and sits in the Cabinet, which is important, but for any layman it would seem more obvious and sensible for her, given her role, to sit with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Home Office or the Ministry of Justice. I should be grateful if she explained how her position, away from those Departments, can be more effective, so that right hon. and hon. Members can understand whether, should there be an election, the responsibility for looking after victims of overseas terrorism should remain away from those Departments, which sit at the Cabinet table, or whether that role should be drawn in and linked much more closely with the criminal injuries compensation scheme, for example.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/7">The dilemma that we face, as the right hon. Member for Makerfield mentioned, is the discrepancy that we find in respect of those affected by terrorism in the UK and those affected, perhaps, by the same terrorist organisation abroad. We are familiar with what happened in the 7/7 attacks in London. The support provided by the Government was prompt and, in most cases, well received. It was provided regardless of nationality, whether people were British or otherwise, and the levels of compensation were linked through the criminal injuries compensation scheme. That is right and correct. However, as has been mentioned a number of times, that scheme is limited to British borders alone and the problem with travel insurance covering terrorist attacks is that it is limited, meaning that any individual Briton choosing to holiday abroad who is affected by terrorism does not receive the same compensation as they would if so affected in the UK. We are not talking about large numbers of people. A parliamentary answer to a question asked by the shadow Foreign Secretary stated that about 190 Britons have been killed since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/8">As the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, huge sums of money have been invested by this Government, the police, the emergency services and so forth to try to protect Britons from terrorism here in the UK. We have legislation, going back to the threats from the IRA, including the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1974, the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998, the big Terrorism Act 2000, the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, which is a large piece of legislation, all of which were designed to build the barriers higher to protect us here in the UK and to try to identify those who wish to cause us harm. I do not have a problem with any of that legislation per se; I am concerned about what we do when attempts to protect us fail. When all the legislation designed to provide an umbrella of security does not work, we are left with a few people who are exposed and are then killed or injured. It is those people on whom we are focusing today.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/9">The terrorist does succeed on occasions, despite all our efforts to try to legislate against that happening. We may build the walls even higher, but no matter how much we protect ourselves here in the UK, the terrorist will wise up to that and wait for us to step off an aeroplane abroad. That brings me to the question of how we provide support for citizens who choose to travel.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/10">I have been in contact with various victims support groups, including those for the victims of Bali and Sharm el-Sheikh. I pay tribute to the work that they have done in trying to push forward legislation. I also pay tribute to the pro bono work, which has been mentioned already, by Lovells and Allen &amp; Overy, which are providing support to Lord Brennan's Bill. We must recognise that no matter how vigilant we are and how much legislation we pass, it is virtually impossible to prevent an attack from taking place, if not here, certainly abroad.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/11">When we see problems on television, they often seem to be other people's and not ours. When we see an event on television, we may think, &quot;Oh, isn't that awful?&quot; but we then switch back to doing something else, oblivious to the pain and suffering that that person or family will have to go through. MPs have been lobbied individually, because the lives of each community, person or family whose loved one may be injured or maimed for life are changed for ever, abruptly and dramatically. Every Christmas and birthday is then a reminder of the missing person to the person whose life has changed. We live in a dangerous world, and it is easy to think that such things happen only to a minority of people&mdash;perhaps 200&mdash;so why are they so important?</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/12">On the night of <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-12">12 October 2002</phrase>, I was in the little village of Aldbury in Hertfordshire when I became aware that something had happened in Bali, where my brother, who was a teacher, was at a conference. My mother tried to call him, but could not get through, and we had to go through an agonising two or three days before my sister could travel to the holiday resort to check the hospitals and to try to find him, but there was still no news. The chaos in Bali was horrific. As with many places that are affected by terrorism, it was not geared up for an explosion, and not ready to take on the mass confusion that occurs after an event of such magnitude.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/13">I was living in Aldbury and was a parish councillor at the time. The biggest issue facing us was the number of ducks on the village pond because there were too many. There was a big argument about whether we should cull them, and that horrific story was rippling around the village. That was the scale of problems that we were dealing with when, suddenly, the news came through about Bali and the likelihood that my brother was involved. The whole village, which is a close-knit community, was affected and worried about the possible loss of my brother.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/14">When my sister could not find my brother, I flew to Bali. I have served in the armed forces in a number of operational environments, and am familiar with working with dead bodies and injured people. I was shocked at what I found. There was no British support. The ambassador had turned up for an hour, and then disappeared. There was complete confusion, and the honorary consul&mdash;he was a part-time consul who owned a pub, but dealt with births, marriages and deaths&mdash;suddenly had to deal with families wanting answers and direction about how to find their loved ones, whether they were injured or dead. After a week, I decided that I could not wait any longer, so I waded through 200 dead bodies, and was eventually able to identify my brother. His body was so mutilated that I identified him only from a keyhole surgery scar on his back, but I had taken his dental records with me, and was able to confirm who he was.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/15">I was the first to identify a British body, and was then able to pioneer a way of getting through the massive Indonesian red tape to enable bodies to be checked, embalmed and provided with death certificates and licences to move them abroad. There was a series of requirements that I had been unaware of and for which no one, including the British embassy, could provide support. That is when things went wrong for the British Government, because they were unused to such terrorism, which had not previously struck British citizens in that way. Although 9/11 had taken place, most people in that attack had been vaporised, so there were no bodies to deal with, and the American system and the emergency services there were much more geared up to a large-scale attack. It was on a different scale.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/16">Bali was a learning curve for the Government. When I came back, I spoke to the then Foreign Secretary, now the Secretary of State for Justice, and there have been huge improvements to the website and the provision of travel information, which was previously confusing. In those days, one could apply and pay money for more detailed travel advice, which advised people to stay away from Bali at that time, but the free advice on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website suggested that people could go there with no problem. Many of those aspects have been cleared up, and we now have an emergency response team ready to help in all parts of the world, which is good news. I was in Thailand at the time of the tsunami, and the team did a wonderful job helping victims.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/17">One matter that has not been cleared up is how to support and compensate people who are faced with the loss of a loved one. Travel insurance is important, but how much of a responsibility is it for an individual to obtain suitable travel insurance before they depart? For me, the suggestion of obligation is tricky, but must be debated. What is flawed is the advice that travel agents give about travel insurance to people wishing to travel abroad. The details are often unclear about the cover, and in the dangerous world in which we now live we must be a little clearer about the level of travel insurance and what it covers. About 60 per cent. of travel insurance now covers acts of terrorism, but the industry is large and is, as was said, worth &pound;709 million. We can do more work to educate travel agents and the public on their responsibility not to depart British shores without appropriate travel insurance.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/18">I was critical of the Government in the aftermath of Bali, but work has been done on the aftercare plan&mdash;the Minister may want to expand on that&mdash;which now has the rather long title of the exceptional assistance measure for terrorist incidents overseas. It provides around &pound;3,000 via the Red Cross for immediate assistance to families that are affected by a terrorist attack. That is welcome, because an element of confusion arises&mdash;it did in Bali&mdash;and clarity is needed on paying for the return of a coffin back to the UK and the cost of the funeral service. That will go a long way in helping people.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/19">However, more can be done to provide assistance to victims' families and particularly to people who survive. A friend of mine lost his arm in the Bali attack, and is still waiting for support from the Government or elsewhere to help with a prosthesis so that he can continue to work properly. Thankfully, the company he works for has been supportive, but he has found it difficult to obtain support from the NHS or compensation from the Government. That needs to be clarified.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/20">I shall speak briefly&mdash;I want to give the Minister plenty of time to respond&mdash;about the Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill, which Lord Brennan introduced. It was a useful vehicle for raising issues that have been inconclusive. It was passed by the House of Lords, but did not receive a Second Reading in this place because of lack of time. That was a shame. Some amendments would need to be introduced but, as it was a private Member's Bill, perhaps the Minister could say whether, if the Bill were introduced a second time, it might at least be debated in the House. That would allow us to thrash these issues out a little further.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/21">On the Pool Reinsurance Company Ltd system, I have spoken to one of the directors of the system, which was set up in 1993 in response to the IRA terrorist attacks that were taking place. The system provides commercial properties with a level of insurance. A premium is paid each year and if anything should happen to the building, it is covered for terrorist attacks. That cover would not be provided by normal insurance. The system now has &pound;1.66 billion in its coffers, which is a huge sum of money. However, of course, if there were a mass flood or some major attack, that money would dwindle quickly. That system shows how easy it is to accumulate money that can be used to help those few people who are killed or injured when these horrific events take place.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/22">As already mentioned, other countries have different models&mdash;for example, the United States, Australia through its Medicare system, France through a system linked to property insurance, Switzerland, Finland through its various general criminal injury policies, and Israel. At the moment, we do not have a credible system, but many models exist that do work. Until we get some parity whereby each country matches the good will that we showed when 7/7 struck here&mdash;when there was no discrimination between nationalities&mdash;we need to ensure that there is some form of cover for British citizens who choose to travel abroad. Frustration is felt by the survivors and the families of the victims of terrorist attacks. The energy and determination that are expended to fight terrorism are not matched by other countries, and the energy and determination to prevent a bomb going off in the first place are not matched by the commitment and support to the victims once that bomb has gone off. That needs to be reconciled.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/23">In conclusion, terrorism is a tactic that is unlikely to disappear. If the blanket of security has failed, Britons need to be assured that the Government will ensure that the appropriate mechanisms are in place&mdash;whether that is through an insurance system or direct support. Thanks to the new counter-terrorism legislation, we indeed feel safer in this country, but we are still exposed to the same dangers when we disembark abroad. Terrorism recognises no borders, but nor should our support for Britons. If the global threats that we now face have changed, our response and support must adapt to meet the needs of UK citizens and we must change as well. Terrorism is used to send a message to the state and victims are used as pawns to convey that message. For that reason alone, the state has an obligation to support those victims.</p>

	<p pid="b.248.0/1">Before I call the Minister, I would like to thank you, Mr. Ellwood, on behalf of the whole House for having the courage to refer to your personal experiences. Doing so could not have been easy, but it was extremely moving and very helpful for the debate.</p>

	<p pid="b.248.1/1">I would like to join in thanking my dear right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" name="Ian McCartney">the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase> for taking the initiative to have this debate. I also thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> for his contribution and both for their remarks about the role I have played. I respond to this debate, in a sense, in two capacities. First, I respond as the Minister for humanitarian assistance and as the person responsible for ensuring that there is a proper and co-ordinated response across Government to meet the continuing needs of bereaved families and survivors in the long aftermath of a terrorist attack. Secondly, I particularly feel myself to be the advocate of those families because I know almost all of them well and I have long-standing relationships with the leaders who have emerged from their groups. For reasons that I know hon. Members will understand, that role rarely sees the public light of day, but it consumes an enormous amount of time, as, indeed, it should.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/2">I pay reciprocal tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield for the way in which he has pursued this issue; he has been motivated by his well-known compassion. I also pay tribute to him for representing the particular experience of his constituent John Green and his young son. That provided a horrific illustration of the impact of terrorist attacks and the need for the action that we are discussing.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/3">I would like to chart what I believe is the real progress that has been made. In trying to reach a solution, we are on a journey. We have not yet reached the destination, but my confidence has been reinforced by the nature of the contributions we have heard. There is a will from all parties to ensure that we reach a solution to the problem and that has been driven by the intrinsic merit of the issue, rather than by the horrific prospect of yet a further terrorist attack in which UK citizens are killed and injured abroad. That would prompt a crisis response, but the solution needs to build what I might describe as a sense of serenity within the UK citizen travelling abroad.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/4">As hon. Members have reflected, in past years, there has been an increase in the number of UK citizens affected by terrorism. Since 2001, the Foreign Office figure is that 141 Britons have been killed in terrorist attacks overseas, and many more&mdash;a much harder figure to quantify&mdash;have sustained life-changing physical and psychological scars. It is important that our thoughts and focus are on those who have been bereaved as a result of terrorism. However, we must also never underestimate the extent to which thousands and thousands of people's lives are changed for ever as a result of surviving such an experience. Survivors too often say to me that, in their words, they wished they had not survived. Our obligations are to both groups of people.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/5">It is a clear fact&mdash;this is the dilemma on which we focus today&mdash;that British residents who are the victims of terrorism abroad do not receive the same level of financial assistance as those who are caught up in similar attacks in Britain. It is worth reminding the House that of the 52 innocent people killed in London on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July 2005</phrase>, some 20 were foreign nationals who died because they happened to be in London and were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Their families were compensated as if those victims were British citizens. That discrepancy cannot be right and until we resolve it, we have to recognise the injustice and inequity that exist.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/6">In addition to the psychological trauma and bereavement, families are often left with severe financial problems. Obviously, in the immediate aftermath when I meet families, money is the last thing on their minds. They are focused on survival&mdash;on managing from one hour to the next&mdash;but in the weeks and months that follow, people are often unable to carry on working. They may find it difficult to provide for their dependants. Families rally round but may exhaust their resources, leaving people unable to pay their bills. If they are injured or suffering from mental trauma, they may also worry about meeting the costs of continuing treatment, support and aftercare.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/7">We have devoted enormous efforts to ensuring that the 7/7 survivors who need treatment for post-traumatic stress receive treatment for as long as they need it. There is no neat pro forma that can be completed. We cannot say, &quot;If we do all these things, the results will be satisfactory,&quot; because everyone has a unique and individual response to these catastrophic circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/8">Let me deal with the machinery of government point raised by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East. I was asked to take on the responsibility for co-ordinating the response for UK families bereaved in the attack on the World Trade Centre on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase> at the Cabinet meeting on the day following the attack. That was an ad hoc appointment because it was the first time that British citizens had been involved in a terrorist attack on that scale. We should remember that, mercifully, the ultimate number of casualties was smaller than had been expected in the days immediately after the attack on New York. Probably for the first four months, that appointment took up 80 per cent. of my time, even though I was Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. I visited New York on half a dozen occasions, accompanying families and overseeing the arrangements for bereaved relatives and the people who were searching desperately for the relatives whom they knew were in New York but had been unable to contact.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/9">The process is a long one. It includes support in the immediate aftermath and trying to lift the practical burdens that are unendurable for families experiencing the shock of realising that they have been bereaved and their Christmases will never be the same again. I tend to think of it as a four to five-year process. Initially, it involves assistance with the immediate aftermath and support during the period of shock.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/10">The process also involves learning the lessons. The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East paid tribute to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor, who, as Foreign Secretary, bore a heavy responsibility in relation to the aftermath of the Bali bombings and the tsunami. The lessons include the way in which people are responded to in the hour after a catastrophe has struck. That will have a lasting impact on what they feel about the treatment that they receive. Someone who is dealt with in a rather dismissive, unsympathetic and unconfident way in that first hour may never feel that support was there when they needed it, no matter what support is subsequently available.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/11">In Government, as we address this new challenge, we also have to recognise that we will never get it absolutely right. We can go on learning from the experiences of families and survivors and ensuring that our organisations and agencies build a greater capability for responsiveness, but we will never get it completely right and we have to be, in all humility, cognisant of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/12">My role as the Minister responsible for humanitarian assistance started at the time of 9/11. I was then asked to provide co-ordination and support for the families whose relatives had died in Bali and, later, for the relatives affected by the tsunami. Then, at a time I remember so vividly, I was given responsibility for those who had suffered, who had been bereaved and who had died in the London bombings of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July 2005</phrase>. As Minister for the Olympics, I had been in Singapore celebrating the fact that London had won the Olympics. The day after, the news began to come through of the attack on London. As Seb Coe, Ken Livingstone&mdash;the then Mayor of London&mdash;and I boarded a plane in Singapore, the celebrations were cancelled. We arrived in London the next morning and stepped into an armoured convoy. Ken Livingstone was to go to the emergency centre. I was to help to set up the family reception centre for the family members who were still wandering around London trying to find out, in the intensive care units of London, whether their mother, their son or their daughter was alive.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/13">From the ad hoc, we now have proper ministerial function, with the humanitarian assistance unit established in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. There will always be questions about the appropriate machinery of government. I place on record my tribute to all the staff who, over the past seven years, have worked in the humanitarian assistance unit and shown the capacity of public service to go beyond any call of duty or job description. They have, in so many cases, altered the course of grief for the families with whom they have worked, and I am intensely proud of them.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/14">That advocacy role is embodied in the humanitarian assistance unit; it is advocacy across Government. That is why the issues of speed of compensation, the level of compensation and the ability to identify the gaps in the compensation system have become so sharply defined. The humanitarian assistance unit is in regular contact with bereaved families and survivors from 11 separate terrorist incidents since 2001. By listening to victims and their families, we have been better able to understand the support and care that they need. The process ranges from dealing with the immediate incident to support in the aftermath, to the memorial service, to the second memorial service, to the development of the memorial, to the dedication of the memorial, to the establishment of the friends and long-term support group, and then making it clear that, for as long as necessary, we will continue to be available.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/15">Obviously, much of the humanitarian assistance work for victims abroad is led by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Again, I commend the extent to which some of the very harsh lessons and the harsh things said about the treatment that survivors have received have been incorporated by the consular services around the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/16">In the time available, let me focus specifically on financial assistance. Because of the critical gap in the compensation system created by the fact that the criminal injuries compensation scheme does not extend to UK citizens killed or injured abroad, we secured the establishment of a charitable fund for UK victims of overseas terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/17">The fund was launched in May 2007 with a Government contribution of &pound;1 million. Because of its size, the fund has a specific scope and remit. It makes immediate payments to all UK residents injured or bereaved through acts of overseas terrorism. Those payments are immediate so that relatives do not have to worry about the costs of getting home. The fund has made a total of 22 initial payments of &pound;3,000 and 19 second-stage payments of &pound;12,000 for five overseas incidents. That total of &pound;294,000 takes us up to <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-30">30 September</phrase> this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/18">I underline the fact that those payments are intended to meet immediate financial needs, such as mortgage or rent payments, long-distance phone calls and travel to the affected area, but the speed and simplicity of the way in which the payments are made is most important. Speed and simplicity are the tests against which any further measures are judged.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/19">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office also provides a package of assistance, through its exceptional assistance measures, to cover actual expenditure in the immediate aftermath of terrorist incidents overseas if no alternative funds are available. That provision takes account of the exceptional nature of terrorism, in which individuals are the random victims of attacks directed at society as a whole and not specifically at British nationals. However, I absolutely recognise that neither the Red Cross charitable fund nor the FCO's measures provide compensation. That leaves a disparity in the levels of financial assistance available to victims of terrorism, depending upon where the act of terrorism occurs.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/20">I shall try to do justice to the question of why such a simple proposition is a matter of complexity for the Government. We have been looking closely at the various financial options available for victims of overseas terrorism. For a start, a proposal for compensation has to consider two key questions of principle.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.1/21">The first question is whether we should continue to look to the country where the attack occurs to provide compensation for UK citizens. In the aftermath of Sharm-el Sheikh, I raised that question repeatedly with the relevant Egyptian Ministers on visits to Egypt, but no agreement on compensation was forthcoming. As we know, many countries offer their own compensation schemes. A 2004 EU directive compels member states to offer &quot;fair and appropriate&quot; compensation to victims of violent intentional crime, including terrorism, committed within their territory. However, none of the overseas terrorist incidents that involved British residents over the last few years have occurred in EU member states. Through the FCO, I will obviously continue to pursue the question of compensation more broadly, through bilateral policy agreements with other countries. However, I do not hold out much hope of that being fruitful in the short term.</p>

	<p pid="b.252.0/1">This is an important debate, and I fully support the remarks made by other speakers on the importance of compensation. I have met victims of 7/7 and of other terrorist acts in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. Is there not a real concern among victims about the difference in approach taken by our Government compared with that taken by other Governments in Europe and elsewhere? Last week, there was a debate in Westminster Hall on compensation for the victims of state-sponsored terrorism. There is a difference in the approach taken by the American and French Governments and ours. Surely it is time for our Government to take the same approach as other Governments, and say that compensation needs to be paid wherever terrorists strike against our citizens.</p>

	<p pid="b.253.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. That is precisely the issue with which we are grappling. He is right to say that the EU makes provision, but within that the schemes offered by EU member states are substantially different, and they are often represented as being more comprehensive than they are. Of course, the many people who died as a result of the conflict in Northern Ireland are very much on our mind in shaping a fair long-term response.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.0/2">The second principle is whether we should treat victims of terrorism differently from victims of other crimes, many of which are just as horrific and life changing. The criminal injuries compensation scheme recognises terrorism as a crime, so victims of terrorism are treated exactly the same as victims of other crime. The scheme is not perfect, but I pay tribute to the efforts made in the aftermath of the bombings of <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-07">7 July</phrase> to ensure that claims were settled as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.0/3">It is my view&mdash;I hope it is clear&mdash;that British residents affected by terrorism overseas should be treated in exactly the same way. I recognise that such an arrangement would create an anomaly, as British victims of violent crime overseas would not be covered. The Government also recognise that any commitment to provide compensation would have to open-ended and thus impossible to cost with any degree of accuracy. Despite those difficulties, I am committed under those two principles to finding a solution.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.0/4">I pay tribute to Lord Brennan for adding further impetus to the debate through his private Member's Bill. Since then, a lot of work has been done by the insurance industry to ensure that travel insurance policies that include terrorism cover are readily available. Sixty per cent. of British travel insurance companies now cover terrorism through their policies&mdash;that is major progress&mdash;and a further 30 per cent. of companies now explicitly exclude it, although they may offer an ex-gratia payment. Those percentages are increasing year on year.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.0/5">I welcome the fact that, in 2007, the insurance industry called for a &quot;strong partnership&quot; between it and national Governments to manage the risk of global terrorism. The way forward is through a partnership between the insurance industry and Government. I hosted a meeting earlier this month for insurance industry representatives to start building the next stage of that discussion. Trevor Lakin, whose son Jeremy was killed Sharm el-Sheikh, has been working tirelessly to seek a resolution on the issue&mdash;not for his own benefit, but for future victims.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.0/6">Lovells is contributing to the development of that work on a pro bono basis. Given the current difficult economic climate, the response has been encouraging. I believe that we now have a fresh momentum, moving forward in a spirit of partnership with the industry. However, because that work is at a very early stage, I am not in a position to set out the detail of the conclusions that I hope for, but I undertake to keep the House informed.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.0/7">Today's debate has shown the extent and breadth of cross-party interest. We must find a solution&mdash;and not be prompted only by the next atrocity. Nothing is more compelling and impelling to finding a solution than the memory of those whose lives have been wasted, and the misery and hurt that will be with their families for ever. I thank Members on both sides.</p>

	<p pid="b.255.1/1">On a point of order, Mr. Hancock. I am sorry to bring this to your attention but there was a minor degree of panic, in that there was no Opposition spokesman for this debate. There is a misprint on the front of the Order Paper today&mdash;it says that this debate should take place between 10 o'clock and half-past 11; of course, it should say that it will begin at 11 o'clock.

	<p pid="b.255.3/1">It is a delight to be able to introduce this debate under your chairmanship, Mr. Hancock.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.3/2">It is quite unusual for a Member of Parliament to decide to spend three weeks of August in a country that they have never visited before. I had read about Sierra Leone and taken part in debates in the House on it, but I decided to get more involved. I was able to do so via a new scheme run by Voluntary Service Overseas called Volpol, which allows Members of Parliament to immerse themselves as other volunteers would in countries in which VSO is present. It was an amazing experience&mdash;one that I shall never forget.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.3/3">I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Minister is replying to the debate. I had enormous respect for him in his previous role and I know that he will be a great champion for Britain and its development work in the world. I am looking forward to hearing his response to my remarks on some of the things that I found Sierra Leone, and the fact that I would like to see that work continue. I believe that the work is valuable and that it is making progress in that country.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.3/4">Sometimes, we feel a little bit guilty when we do things outside our constituency, but my largest regular postbag from people in my constituency contains letters from those who care about the poverty of some overseas people and the conditions in which they have to live. It was with that in mind that I felt able to travel and work there for three weeks in August. I should like to pay tribute to Dawn Powell, one of my constituents. She is a tireless campaigner on world poverty, and never stops beating a path to my door to tell me to encourage the Government to do more. Nevertheless, it is widely recognised that the Government have done more than any previous Government to develop the way in which we engage with the rest of the world&mdash;we need to have that on the record before we go further.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.3/5">Most people will have seen the old Bounty bar advert in which a gorgeous girl bites into a Bounty bar on the most fabulous beach in the world. That advert was made in Sierra Leone. It should be paradise, but in fact it is hell. It is hell for women who deliver babies&mdash;it is the most dangerous place in the world to have a baby. Mothers are also likely to lose children to a preventable disease such as malaria; one in four children dies that way. Health care is almost non-existent, and what there is has to be paid for. People have to scrimp and scrape to save someone who might be the person who earns a living for the family. The nation was born in what should have been a fantastic spirit of freedom from the slave trade&mdash;the capital is called Freetown&mdash;but it has become one of the most difficult places on earth to live. That is why I wanted to go. I felt that there was no point in taking part in a programme such as Volpol unless I was going to engage fully in the things that other people immerse themselves in.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.3/6">Of course, the country has seen the horror of a war that lasted for more than a decade. The effects are apparent everywhere. Roads and buildings have been destroyed, and infrastructure no longer exists for most people. Day-to-day living in Sierra Leone is difficult, which is why I was delighted that VSO went back into the country following the war. The organisation works not in countries where there is strife or difficulty, but in places where it can build capacity and work with people to develop their skills. In just three short years, the organisation has done an amazing job.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.3/7">I want to focus on the work of VSO and the Department for International Development&mdash;many other aid organisations are doing fantastic work in Sierra Leone&mdash;because you will be very cross with me, Mr. Hancock, if I do not focus on issues that directly relate to the Government. DFID is the major donor to VSO&mdash; &pound;28 million of the &pound;40 million it receives comes directly from the Government. I should like to demonstrate why I believe that that is good value for money. The organisation uses its resources to procure skills, and not only in the UK. Amazingly, although most are from the UK, volunteers come from around the world. Those volunteers could earn thousands of pounds here working as consultants, for example, but they do not. Instead, they get only a stipend, and go to live and work in the community that they are trying to develop. They become immersed in the culture, thereby gaining the strength and the commitment of people who, on the whole, feel utterly hopeless about the conditions in which they have to live. The volunteers learn to lift those people's spirits and skills to a level that allows VSO to walk away and say that those people are able to get on with the job themselves. That is what is spectacular about their work.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.3/8">I should like to pay tribute to those fantastic volunteers. I was slightly worried that I would be unable to live up to their fantastic reputation, being a lowly Member of Parliament, and I probably did not do so most of the time. The volunteers truly were amazing people, dedicated to their work, and a credit to this country. It was impossible to walk down the high street in Freetown without people asking whether I was from the UK or from VSO, so people have a real sense that we are doing good work in the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.3/9">I wanted to focus on nursing and nurse education, because that was my profession. The needs of Sierra Leone are overwhelming, so it was vital that I stuck to that one aspect. What patients have to endure, day in, day out, in the Connaught hospital in Freetown&mdash;it is the major hospital&mdash;is appalling, but what nurses and nurses in training have to endure made me break down in tears in the first week. Those dedicated people have little or no equipment to work with, or leadership, and although they tried their best, and were paying to become nurses, they were faced a most difficult task. We often complain in the UK. I talk to student nurses here all the time about what is happening in their lives but frankly, having seen those students in Sierra Leone, I can say that we have absolutely no idea of how difficult things can be.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.3/10">I also felt it necessary to talk to all the other aid agencies in the country. The United Nations is pulling out bit by bit because the emergency situation is relaxing, and World Health Organisation officials are there in numbers, but the most impressive organisation that I found in the country was DFID. I was utterly impressed with Joanna Reid, who does an amazing job developing a child and maternal health strategy to ensure that the system has capacity, so that not as many children are lost and not as many women die in childbirth. Listening to the day-to-day stories of the struggle to build capacity in the health and sanitation department was amazing. I am utterly in awe of the quiet and steady work that Joanna Reid did. The work was not easy and not many people hear about it, but I want to ensure that the work being done out there is properly recognised in the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.3/11">I am sure that the Minister will be kind enough to tell us about the sums that are involved. Although I was given an indication of the spend in Sierra Leone, that is not the only issue; it is about helping those who are working in the Department to lift their game, so that they use the money effectively and ensure that it does not get lost in the system or go missing through corruption.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.3/12">It was such a struggle to see the work going on in Sierra Leone, but it was excellent work and I have a huge admiration for it. It is okay for someone such as me to skip in for three weeks and then walk away&mdash;although I have no intention of walking away from those fantastic nurses in Sierra Leone&mdash;and quite another to work day in, day out with the huge structural problems of Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.3/13">With its little office in the heart of Freetown, VSO looks after its volunteers very well. During our stay in the country, we lived with the volunteers. There were no grand hotels in which to stay. The visit was about immersing Members of Parliament in the work. Eleven of us were working in nine different countries over the summer. I felt that the best thing that I could do was to support those who were trying to provide a decent education for the nurses in Freetown.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.3/14">I was working on the day that the student nurses' exam results came out. I was amazed because, overwhelmingly, they had passed. Those students had no equipment. They did not even have the equipment to take someone's temperature or blood pressure, or to raise a bed properly. They did not even have proper pillows to make patients comfortable, and yet, through their dedication in reading their textbooks, they learned how to nurse. I, like others in Sierra Leone, want to assist those nurses to ensure that they have the equipment to do their work.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.3/15">I was so impressed with Matron Thomas, who was looking after me in the Connaught hospital. She was a truly formidable matron. She reminded me of the matrons who were about when I was doing my training decades ago. All the nurses respected her tremendously because she was doing such a fantastic job.</p>

	<p pid="b.258.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that because I might have given the impression that it is all absolute disaster, but it is not. Those elections last year were a tremendous success. They were peaceful and everyone was greatly relieved by that. A huge amount of development work is happening. The newly elected Members of Parliament and the President are working to ensure that those who are in positions of power can govern in a fair and honest way. Although the little contretemps that we have in the UK are replicated in Sierra Leone, the system, on the whole, is well supported. The potential to improve is massive. Real opportunities exist, which is why I initiated the debate today. I want to ensure that the UK remains engaged with Sierra Leone. I believe that we have a responsibility to the country, and I want to ensure that we stay there and continue with the fantastic work.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/2">Let me return to the work that I did in the country. I was most impressed with Dr. Etam-Hoteh, who lives in London but who was asked to take on the job of dean in the faculty of nursing. He took a sabbatical from his own top-level NHS job in the UK to go to Sierra Leone to do the work&mdash;for no pay whatever. He is doing an immensely worthwhile job as he licks that school of nursing into shape. We would love to see our nurse education being delivered in the same way. I ask DFID to consider supporting that post. I believe that if we support those who have the ability to give lots of information and skills to many people, that is an effective use of UK money. Supporting that one man as dean of the faculty would mean that he could oversee the education of 200 nurses in training. He could increase nurses' abilities and clinical skills, and improve the health in Sierra Leone. That is the crux of my debate. I have written to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to see whether it is possible to support the post, because I believe that enormous strides could be taken in the teaching hospital in Freetown.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/3">My plea is that we stay in Sierra Leone and continue with the tremendous development work that is going on. We should support VSO, which is doing an amazing job of transferring skills from the UK to Sierra Leone. Even if such transfers are for a short time only, it will help. Short placements are a great idea. Clinical tutors who go to the country for a month to give specialist education to nurses would be incredibly valuable. Recent changes from the Department of Health mean that people's pensions and contributions can continue to be paid while they volunteer. That is such a good move, allowing skills to be shared around the world. It ensures that other countries can benefit from fantastic technological advances and a world-class health service.</p>

	<p pid="b.258.1/1">I am delighted to appear under your chairmanship, Mr. Hancock&mdash;I think that it is the first time. As this is my parliamentary debut in this brief, I can think of no better person to debate with than my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" name="Laura Moffatt">the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt)</phrase>. I reciprocate her very kind remarks; it was a great privilege to work with her at the Department of Health. We both feel that we contributed towards the significant progress in reforming and improving the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.1/2">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for making the decision to spend some of her summer finding out the challenges that ordinary people&mdash;people on the front line and our employees&mdash;face on a day-to-day basis in a country such as Sierra Leone. When we have debates in the House, it is important that, wherever possible, they are informed and that hon. Members have experienced the realities on the ground. Such experience gives us a unique insight and capacity to shape and influence the development of parliamentary debate and, more importantly in this context, Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.1/3">I thank my hon. Friend making the decision to go to Sierra Leone. The feedback that we have from VSO and from the project at which she worked suggests that she would be more than welcome to return. She made a tremendous commitment while she was there. Her nursing expertise and professionalism were very relevant and useful. The fact that she has committed herself to continuing that involvement with those projects will be a source of great comfort to the people involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.1/4">It is also important to pay tribute to VSO. The organisation provides opportunities for a whole range of people, including many of our constituents, to go out there and contribute. We know that we live in a shrinking world and an increasingly interdependent world. As my hon. Friend said, people such as Dawn Powell who visit her in her surgery, and others in my constituency, care and are passionate about the importance of this country's leadership role in addressing poverty and inequality in the developing world.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.1/5">In any debate about the kind of society that we live in&mdash;we are often told that we live in a broken society&mdash;we may forget that there are hundreds of thousands of people who in one way or another care enough about another individual or another part of the world to want to make a difference and a contribution. I echo what my hon. Friend said about that. That army of people such as Dawn Powell&mdash;the fact that we have such domestic support&mdash;is incredibly important to the Government's ability to take a leadership role in the world on such issues. I discovered only recently that 10 million people bought one of the wristbands that were part of the Make Poverty History campaign&mdash;a massive number of people who made a positive choice and said &quot;This really matters to me, my family, and my country.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.258.1/6">We can be very proud of the fact that, as my hon. Friend was good enough to say, addressing poverty is a moral mission on which the Government have chosen to provide leadership around the world. The Prime Minister has also shown personal moral leadership; he has made poverty one of his top policy priorities at home and abroad. In my short time in my job, I have found that that is reflected in the reputation of the Government and the Department for International Development in the developing world, which should be a source of great pride to this country. We can have debates about foreign policy and this country's reputation and how it is perceived in different parts of the world, but if one goes to the developing world, one will find time and again in countries where we are active and involved that when it comes to agencies making a difference, the DFID brand is the most positive.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.1/7">Non-governmental organisations also play a crucial role; it is a question of partnership involving the Government and other Governments around the world. Of course, it is not only the fact that we provide aid and run programmes, but the fact that we have banged the table in international institutions and demanded that the world step up to the mark and take responsibility, that has an effect; and it is a matter not just of individual nation states or consortiums of nation states or multilateral institutions, but of the voluntary sector and the contribution of NGOs in this country. My hon. Friend referred to that fact.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.1/8">In the end, we need to be about the business of empowering and enabling the people in the relevant countries&mdash;their Governments, professionals, project leaders and ordinary people&mdash;to help those countries to develop through aid, economic growth, tackling the scourge of HIV/AIDS and making sure that people have access to universal primary education and health services. Our job, essentially, if it is to be sustainable, is to support those countries with confidence, knowledge, skills, systems and structures, so that we can feel that our aid is about enabling and supporting them to rebuild, often in incredibly difficult circumstances, such as those in Sierra Leone.</p>

	<p pid="b.260.0/1">The Minister may be interested to know that the Conservative party this summer took 100 people to Rwanda, entirely in their own time and at their own expense, and will be taking 200 people next year to take part in such programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.0/2">My question is about the fact that the UK has a 10-year memorandum of understanding, and a considerable amount of money is going to Sierra Leone, which has one of the poorest poverty indices of any country on the planet. The International Monetary Fund also gives a considerable amount of money for poverty reduction, and has been critical about the rate of progress in reducing poverty in Sierra Leone. How is DFID getting on in that respect?</p>

	<p pid="b.260.1/1">I welcome the fact that the Conservative party is sending people to experience and contribute in the developing world. That is a good thing and Members on both sides of the House would applaud it.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.1/2">To deal specifically with the hon. Gentleman's question about poverty reduction, we have been providing poverty reduction budget support to Sierra Leone since 2002. Our annual contribution is between &pound;10 million and &pound;13 million. That support is given alongside that of other donors in Sierra Leone: the World Bank, the European Community and the African Development Bank. The provision of budget support since the end of the war was not without risks, but it secured macro-economic stability, without which peace would have been much more difficult to achieve. Alongside that poverty reduction spending by the Government has been protected, and the Government have made significant progress in improving their financial management systems, albeit from a low base. We are reviewing how to maximise the impact of providing budget support as we look across the programme of support for the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.1/3">When we analyse progress, we must consider the baseline. Sierra Leone started in a dreadful place. As a result of the aid that we have provided and the commitment from some sections of the leadership in that country, which has a new Administration, we must acknowledge the progress that has been made, compared with the situation only a relatively short time ago. The country has only recently emerged from 10 years of brutal conflict, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase> is fully aware. My hon. Friend the Member for Crawley referred to the recent elections; they were an example to the rest of Africa&mdash;and we in this House all know of recent concerns about electoral situations in Africa. However, we are not complacent, and our message to Sierra Leone, in discussions with its Government, is that progress must be sustained.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.1/4">The challenge now is to fulfil the country's rich economic potential, and to achieve the millennium development goals, particularly in relation to its appalling health indicators, which, as the hon. Member for Cotswold said, are among the worst in the world. My hon. Friend the Member for Crawley will be interested in that point. In a sense we need, in our approach to Sierra Leone, to go from the point of view that the country has done well in an impossible situation to expecting more. We need high aspirations for the aid that we and others give, and for the democratic institutions that now exist. Those are not without problems; we still have concerns about corruption in the country, and we are dealing with them. We must do more than say simply that in difficult circumstances there has been stability. We must move from stability to real progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.1/5">Peace, security and stability: that is a great success story. There will be a long-term commitment from this country, but it is related to an expectation that there should be strong, accountable institutions, and that tackling corruption is non-negotiable. We shall be keeping our eye on the ball with respect to the importance of the country's getting back on track to achieve the millennium development goals by 2015. At the moment Sierra Leone is, on any projection, going to miss all those targets and goals. We shall expect urgent action to get back on track. We are particularly concerned, as we should be in any society, about the fact that child and maternal health indicators are among the worst in the world. I hope that my hon. Friend, with her experience, will be able to help me to think about some of the practical, tangible measures that we can take that could make a difference. She referred to the tremendous work of Joanna Reid, which we want to support, and the role played by Dr. Hoteh. I cannot, much as I should like to, give a cast-iron commitment today on providing practical assistance to him, but I shall certainly look into the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.1/6">We also need the Sierra Leone Government to raise more revenues of their own, and rapidly to implement a comprehensive public sector reform programme. We need to ensure that the anti-corruption commission, which we now believe is, after a period of great concern, well led, will genuinely become an effective institution.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.1/7">I again congratulate my hon. Friend on going out to see Sierra Leone for herself. Our commitment to Sierra Leone is cast iron and authentic, but we want to move on from being satisfied that it is a stable country that has done well in difficult circumstances; we want it to raise its aspirations and ambitions, so that its people can have the quality of life that so many people in this country take for granted.</p>

	<p pid="b.263.3/1">Mr. Taylor, it was good of you to arrange such conditions to add authenticity to the debate. I am glad that we have this opportunity to debate Afghanistan and the Government's strategy and objectives, particularly as we have not had a statement from the Prime Minister on the subject since December. I think&mdash;this is a point that I hope the Minister will take back&mdash;that there is a desire in the House for more regular statements on what is happening in Afghanistan, particularly as the news about what is happening there seems rather gloomy. I pay tribute to the magnificent work done by our armed forces in Afghanistan, and I honour their sacrifice, as I know everyone in this Chamber does.</p>

	<p pid="b.263.5/1">I am happy to do so. A number of Members and hon. Friends have had that role and been to Afghanistan. We all admire what they have done.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.5/2">From the beginning of this year, we have heard a series of gloomy reports from Afghanistan. Four reports came out at the beginning of 2008 from reputable think tanks questioning what progress we were making in Afghanistan, and in recent days a series of further reports have caused a great deal of concern. First, of course, was the national intelligence estimate leaked in America, which talked about a downward spiral in Afghanistan. We know that the White House ordered a major review&mdash;General Lute went to Kabul&mdash;and we are waiting to know the outcome. I hope that our Government have been closely involved in that process, and that we too are having a review. If there are changing circumstances on the ground, it is not good enough if our Government are not prepared to order the same sort of serious review as Washington.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.5/3">A series of generals have also made remarks in recent days. General Craddock, speaking a few days ago to the Royal United Services Institute, said that he felt that we needed far more troops on the ground and fewer restrictions on them so they could be used more effectively. General Sir David Richards said recently that we need more men and should move towards a negotiated settlement. Brigadier Carleton-Smith has warned against ideas of a decisive military victory, saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.263.5/4" class="indent">&quot;If the Taliban were prepared to sit on the other side of the table and talk about a political settlement...that's precisely the sort of progress that concludes insurgencies like this.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.263.5/5">Yesterday, we heard in the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs that an Afghan diplomat in New York said that in Helmand province we control only one district. That was disputed, but reports are coming in from many respected sources suggesting that the situation is going backwards, that more troops are needed and that it is urgent. What are we doing to address that set of reports, and will we have a major review?</p>
	<p pid="b.263.5/6">Some of the emerging concerns involve our objective. As I saw it, the objective in 2001 after the atrocity at the twin towers was to get rid of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, because that was where they were training their people. I imagine that our objective now should be to keep al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan and prevent them from training there, but is the Minister prepared to concede that that does not mean necessarily that we need to impose in Afghanistan a westernised form of government that might be inappropriate to its history, traditions and culture? Also, I accept the point made yesterday that it is a good thing to bring people together to hold elections, but perhaps the Minister will tell us his view on what sort of government might be acceptable there, granted that it will none the less be elected.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.5/7">On the border issue, the Afghan Foreign Secretary, Dr. Spanta, has pointed out that neighbours are important. In his words, Afghanistan is a land bridge between central and south Asia. He has made the point that the border with Pakistan is porous, and more needs to be done about that. The Pashtun lands in south Afghanistan and north Pakistan extend across the border. Local people do not recognise the border; they just ignore it. In fact, some communities are right on the border, and there is no sign that it exists.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.5/8">In that environment, what is the way forward for security? Does the Minister think that the yesterday's mini-jirga, which involved Pashtun tribal leaders from both sides of the border as well as Muslim clerics, might, with the support of the new President, Zardari, lead to joint patrolling of the border? Is there some way forward in tackling that long-standing issue of the porous border?</p>
	<p pid="b.263.5/9">Because the Afghan Government came substantially from the Northern Alliance, one long-standing problem has been that not enough Pashtun tribal leaders are involved in the process of government in Afghanistan. I welcome the fact that King Abdullah had a breakfast meeting in Mecca with the Afghan Government and with Pashtun leaders, some of whom are aligned with Taliban officials, but how credible a process is that? Do the Government feel that there is some prospect of sitting down with Pashtun tribal leaders who may be aligned with the Taliban and reaching the sort of political compromise that generals have been talking about recently? General Petraeus said today that he feels that American military negotiators might get involved in that process.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.5/10">Why has progress been so slow in expanding the Afghan national army? It looks like an army that knows how to fight, and it has 60,000 men, but it needs 120,000; I understand that the plan is to double the size. When will that happen, and how will it be achieved?</p>

	<p pid="b.264.0/1">One point made to us when we were in Afghanistan was that Iraq has roughly 600,000 security forces of one sort or another, is smaller than Afghanistan in both population and area and is a less complex problem. That implies that 120,000 troops are far too few. Will my hon. Friend comment on that?</p>

	<p pid="b.264.1/1">I always respect my right hon. Friend's knowledge of such matters; I do not claim for a moment to be a military man or an expert in them. The geography of Afghanistan is rather different. My right hon. Friend will recall that Afghanistan is divided by a central mountain range, the Hindu Kush. North of that, the area populated by the Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras is fairly peaceful. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Some may disagree, but I understand that it is relatively peaceful at the moment. The area of concern is to the south and east, where the Taliban are effective in the fighting season. That area has a limited number of roads and communities, so the military effort might be about a smaller number of concentrated communities and roads than in Iraq, but my right hon. Friend will, I hope, have a chance to outline his thoughts on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.1/2">One point keeps coming up&mdash;indeed, this is the point that my right hon. Friend made: we need more troops on the ground. Yesterday, Lieutenant-General Wall said that he did not believe that having a lot more troops was the answer until it was possible to have an immediate reconstruction effort following tactical victories. Does the Minister have a plan that brings together those elements in a comprehensive way so that if we were to put in more troops&mdash;and, I would hope, more helicopters&mdash;reconstruction efforts could be made almost immediately, perhaps with a substantial separate budget for the military? I understand that the Americans have tried that in Iraq successfully, so the Minister might like to address that issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.1/3">My next point concerns the bureaucracy and dishonesty of public administration. We know that the national intelligence estimate has talked about Government corruption as being a major problem in Afghanistan. Earlier this year, a village leader was quoted by the BBC as saying that people who go to the Administration for help with a problem</p>
	<p pid="b.264.1/4" class="indent">&quot;have to give a lot of money in bribes and then they get stuck there&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.264.1/5">and that the least one could say about the Taliban was that they were reasonably efficient and honest. Does the Minister recognise the problem of corruption, and does he have any thoughts on how it might be dealt with?</p>
	<p pid="b.264.1/6">What is to happen about the lead nation approach, under which countries were given a role at the beginning of the process? I shall give an example of a problem. The Germans were given the role of training the police, but the Americans have spent 50 times more than the Germans and have trained many more police. So, some police were trained in a German way of policing and some in an American way, and I understand that there was no co-ordination with the Italians, who were introducing the new laws. They ended up with a police force with either a German flavour or an American flavour, but none of the officers knew the new laws that they were to enforce. If there is a problem with having lead nations, how is it to be resolved? Is it not a question of having much better co-ordination between the countries involved?</p>

	<p pid="b.265.0/1">In those last two comments, my hon. Friend has identified an inherent difficulty in the Afghan situation, has he not? Either we help the Afghan Government to get greater capacity, which means having fewer lead nations but a risk of greater corruption, or, if we are concerned about corruption, we impose more control on the Afghan Government, which gives the impression that we are occupying forces and thus alienates the towns. We cannot have it both ways; we have to decide. We cannot simultaneously enhance capacity and seek to run Afghanistan; it has to be one or the other.</p>

	<p pid="b.266.0/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right to make that point. However, one of the reasons why the generals are talking about trying to reach a negotiated settlement is that if more of the Pashtun leaders were involved with the process and supported the Government rather than the Taliban, many of those problems would be less important because there would be the sort of security that allows civil administration to build and to have the sort of principles that we wish for.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/2">I do not want to speak for too long, because many colleagues want to speak, so I shall conclude by asking the Minister some questions. What are the Government doing about the review that the Americans are conducting? Are we having a review, too? Is the force size adequate and do we have the equipment that we need? How does he reconcile the comments of one set of generals with what Lieutenant-General Sir Peter Wall said yesterday? What hope is there for our NATO partners? Are they going to do more, and really put their shoulders to the wheel? Are there any signs of improved commitment? What hope is there for reconstruction almost immediately after tactical victories, so that we gradually win hearts and minds by showing that a victory means something good for the Afghan people? Will our armed forces have a substantial budget to enable that to happen? That is important, given that voluntary and non-governmental organisations might be too frightened to come in and do the reconstruction work speedily.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/3">What is to happen about bureaucracy and corruption? Do our Government have any leverage with President Karzai and his team? How are we to get effective peace talks, and will we and the Americans be involved as negotiators, as has been mentioned in the news today? On poppies, does the Minister have any idea how we should tackle narco-terrorism? Finally, will he give a commitment that we will have the regular statements from the Prime Minister on this very important area&mdash;after all, it is a war we are conducting&mdash;to which we are entitled?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-29b.266.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" speakername="Paul Flynn" colnum="266"  time="014:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081029/halltext/81029h0006.htm#08102933000478">
	<p pid="b.266.3/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" name="Oliver Heald">the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase> on securing the debate, which is timely because we are at a tipping point in Afghanistan. The last tipping point was in March 2006, and we had a debate in Westminster Hall about what the position would be. Then there was almost unanimity in support of the Government's actions, which were to move into Helmand province. The then Secretary of State for Defence said that he hoped that that operation would last for three years at the most, without a shot being fired.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.3/2">In that debate, a comparison was made between the movement in Helmand province and the charge of the Light Brigade. It is significant that we remember what was said then. To paraphrase the words of the poet, there was, &quot;Bush to the right of them, Blair to the left of them, who Holler'd and thunder'd. Theirs not to reason why, Theirs but to do and die. Someone had blunder'd. Into the mouth of Helmand, Rode the five thousand. &quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.266.3/3">At that time, things were peaceful in Helmand and throughout Afghanistan, and only seven of our soldiers had died&mdash;five in accidents and two as the result of military action. I pay tribute, as everyone does, to their valour and professionalism. They do a magnificent job there. Now, the number of soldiers who have died is 121&mdash;three more than the number killed in the charge of the Light Brigade, but the operation has, in common with that charge, the futility and stupidity of those who gave the orders at the time. Clear warnings were given that going into Helmand would stir up a hornets' nest, and we are now seeing the truth of that. We are in a far more dangerous position than any that we have experienced in the seven years that we have been in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.3/4">Is it sensible to send in more troops? Our ambassador, Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, has made it clear that what we are doing&mdash;sending in more troops&mdash;will</p>
	<p pid="b.266.3/5" class="indent">&quot;identify us even more clearly as an occupying force and multiply the number of targets&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.3/6">That is precisely the role that they will have. He went on:</p>
	<p pid="b.266.3/7" class="indent">&quot;The current situation is bad. The security situation is getting worse. So is corruption and the Government has lost all trust&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.3/8">The Government are rotting from the head down. The only reason why Karzai remains in power is because of the presence of NATO troops.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.3/9">It is foolish to believe that the number of NATO troops from our fellow European countries will increase. I have spoken to Hungarian Ministers and a member of the Western European Union's defence committee, and I have been in many debates with French, German and other members. They clearly see no future in sending their young men to die in Afghanistan. I asked the chairman of the committee on defence in the Hungarian Parliament&mdash;the Hungarians were talking at one time of replacing the Dutch in Afghanistan&mdash;whether his people were prepared to accept the casualties on the scale that we have suffered here, in the Netherlands and in Canada. He said emphatically that his people were not prepared to accept that.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.3/10">Can we look and find any hope? I do not believe that there is any chance that we can do what has been suggested and is still being suggested, which is putting in troops and having a surge that would be successful. That idea demonstrates misunderstanding of the success of the surge in Iraq, which was mainly due to the skills of General Petraeus and the fact that there were talks between the two groups. The talks, not military might were, responsible for bringing peace. Military might will not solve the problem in Afghanistan; it never has.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.3/11">On a visit to the Pentagon in July, we received briefings from different people there. Some of them were the crazies who really believed the Bush line that victory was possible and that all we needed to do was send more troops to sort out the opposition; they saw the situation in Afghanistan in very crude terms. However, other people at the Pentagon were intellectuals or military strategists. They gave us histories of insurgencies and said that, in almost every case, the insurgents win; if troops go into a country as an alien army, whatever happens the ultimate outcome is a victory for the insurgents if they have the support of the rest of the population.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.3/12">We are in a very dangerous situation now. When we went into Afghanistan in 2001, much of the Afghan population were really hostile towards the Taliban; they were fed up with the restrictions that the Taliban had imposed. The position now is that the Afghan people have a new fear; they are afraid of the words that are coming from Washington&mdash;words that we have heard here. A think-tank in Washington said that we would be in Afghanistan for generations. We have also heard talk in this House about having a war in Afghanistan that will last for 38 years. The Afghans are saying, &quot;What on earth are we doing? We have got these people in our country and we are suffering war eternal.&quot; They would prefer to have the Taliban back in control than continue with warfare in their country.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.3/13">I do not want to deny that there have been improvements and gains made in Afghanistan, in schooling and around Kabul. I believe that it is possible for us to consolidate those gains and reach some kind of deal, but it has to be a political deal and not a military one. We must resist the presumption that Iraq and Afghanistan are the same and that we can repeat in Afghanistan what happened in Iraq. Iraq and Afghanistan are not similar; they are very different.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.3/14">The Government in Afghanistan are deeply corrupt. That is nothing unusual in Afghanistan; corruption has been the lubricant for running Afghanistan for centuries.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.3/15">Another figure is terrifying, but accurate. If we compare the number of our troops who have died&mdash;121&mdash;with the number of new millionaires in Kabul, the likelihood is that the number of new millionaires is very similar, if not greater. We know that for every British soldier who lays down their life, a new millionaire is created in Afghanistan, because of the money that we ourselves are pouring in. We were putting in small amounts of money between 2002 and 2006, but the figure is now up to the scale of a billion a year, and more money is being poured in by the Americans. Huge fortunes are being made by the corrupt oligarchy in Afghanistan, many of whom are in government and some of whom are related to the President.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.3/16">Sadly, although we look to our soldiers and say that we want to honour their lives and honour their sacrifices and we believe that there is nobility in the cause that they are fighting for, I am afraid that the truth is very different. We will see more inquests; there is already a backlog of inquests, the findings of which are now coming out. I believe that each one of those inquests will show to the country that the blame for the deficiencies that led to lives being lost, often in very difficult circumstances, will be spread everywhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.3/17">As we see the cost in terms of the lives lost and we dwell on those fatalities, the clamour from the public for a change of policy will be intense, and I believe that a change of policy is the right thing to do. We cannot go on making decisions like before; decisions have been made not in Washington but in this place, which have sent young men to die, I believe, in vain in a war that is impossible to win.</p>

	<p pid="b.269.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" name="Oliver Heald">the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase> on securing this very important debate, for reasons that I will come to in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.269.0/2">First, I want to say that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" name="Paul Flynn">the hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> will find it disturbing that I agreed with quite a lot of what he had to say, until the very last part of his speech when he unfortunately linked the deaths of our servicemen in Afghanistan with the increase in the number of millionaires in Kabul. The two things are quite clearly not related and, frankly, I think that it was rather distasteful to have made that link. However, I agreed with much of the rest of his speech, for a reason that I will explain.</p>
	<p pid="b.269.0/3">I do not speak here as any kind of expert on Afghanistan or on defence, and I am looking forward to hearing contributions from a number of my colleagues who have been to Afghanistan more recently than I have and who know far more about the country than I do. I think this debate is so important because it makes me think back to the time of the Iraq invasion, when I resigned my post as shadow Defence Minister because I was very much opposed to the invasion; I regret the fact that I did not vote against it and instead abstained, when I should have voted against it. At the time, I was deeply unhappy about the invasion. Since then, in my constituency and elsewhere, I have gone to great lengths to seek to justify what we are doing in Afghanistan; no one will find a more robust supporter of our strategy in Afghanistan than me.</p>
	<p pid="b.269.0/4">Increasingly, however, as I have listened to some of the people who have already been quoted in the debate today, I am finding myself beginning to ask the questions, &quot;Why are we in Afghanistan? What on earth are we trying to do there? And is there any chance that we can achieve the great aims that people are laying down for us?&quot; I must say that I find the quotes that are emerging about Afghanistan deeply worrying. I know that our ambassador has denied the quotes that are reported to have been contained in a secret memo to President Sarkozy, quotes that said that it was not possible that we could win in Afghanistan and that showed that he was extremely negative about the situation there and that expressed the hope that there might be dictatorship there within four or five years. He denies that he said all that, but none the less it is worrying that it has been reported that he said it to President Sarkozy.</p>
	<p pid="b.269.0/5">It has also been reported that Brigadier Carleton-Smith has said that he has been misquoted as saying that we cannot win in Afghanistan. Nevertheless, if one looks at both his interview on Sky Television and in <i>The Times</i>, the words that he used are very precise and very specific and he is not a person who would use language that could be misquoted. So a lot of people are saying that things are not going quite the way that they should be in Afghanistan. Having followed these matters for a number of years, I do not know why we are there.</p>
	<p pid="b.269.0/6">It seems to me that the purpose of today's debate ought to be to come up with some kind of grand strategy for what we are doing in Afghanistan, if we can do that. There seem to me to be six possible reasons for our being there. The first reason, of course, is counter-insurgency. However, counter-insurgency means putting down insurgents, and who are the insurgents against? They are, of course, insurgents against us. The memo from Sherard Cowper-Coles, our ambassador, says very specifically that he thinks that we are now becoming part of the problem rather than part of the solution. If we were not in Afghanistan and if Afghanistan was as it was before we went there, would there be an insurgency? No, of course there would not, because there would be nobody to &quot;insurge&quot; against. There has to be an invasion force to have an insurgency against, so I doubt very much whether counter-insurgency works as a justification. What about counter-terrorism? Of course, that was the 9/11 justification.</p>

	<p pid="b.270.3/1">&quot;The Government of Afghanistan&quot; is, of course, rather an odd expression. President Karzai's writ does not run much further than Kabul. The notion that there is some kind of Government rather akin to our own running across the whole of Afghanistan, which these awful people in the Taliban oppose, is an odd one. Incidentally, the Taliban were our allies in Gulf 1. The Taliban fought with us against Saddam, so they are not necessarily all bad people at all; many of them are quite good people. However, as I was saying, the notion that somehow or other we have a Government of Afghanistan who are being &quot;insurged&quot; against by the awful Taliban is, frankly, nonsense. Afghanistan does not work that way. I do not necessarily believe that there is really a counter-insurgency role for us in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.3/2">Counter-terrorism is a possible justification, but it is well accepted by everybody that most of the al-Qaeda forces have withdrawn from Afghanistan and are now in the tribal areas in north-west Pakistan. Perhaps we should have a presence in Afghanistan to prevent those forces from coming back, but if so, how the heck are we going to do that? The border is porous; there are vast numbers of al-Qaeda forces, and the more that we are in Afghanistan, the more they come across, so I am not certain that a counter-terrorism role necessarily works very well either.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.3/3">Are we seeking to establish some kind of western-style democracy in Afghanistan&mdash;a sort of Guildford lookalike in Kabul? No, we are not. That is totally impossible and it would be absurd to seek to do it. We often hear from those on the Labour Benches about the notion of gender balance in the Afghan Parliament, and all of that&mdash;it is nonsense. Afghanistan is not like that. The notion that, if we were there for years and years, we might establish something that looks a bit like this great Parliament seems to me, frankly, nonsensical.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.3/4">Are we in Afghanistan to reconstruct the nation through aid? Yes, I hope that we are and the fantastic operation that was the guarding of the Kajaki dam is a good example of precisely what we could do in the future. The more that we can conduct operations such as the Kajaki dam and provide electricity for the people of Helmand province, the better the situation there will be and the more likely it will be that they will say, &quot;We like peace, we like democracy and we like the west.&quot; Frankly, at the moment, there is not much reconstruction going on; we are mostly warfighting, and I am not certain that that works.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.3/5">Finally, are we there as some kind of springboard into Pakistan? Certainly, the United States of America seems to believe that aggressive operations across the border into Pakistan are justifiable. Just as I did not believe that our invasion of Iraq was justifiable under international law, I do not believe that any intrusion into Pakistan's airspace or land is justifiable under international law, so I do not accept the argument for our presence in Afghanistan as some kind of springboard for intervention in Pakistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.3/6">These are difficult questions to which I do not have the answers. There are people in this room who know far more about the situation than I do, but, speaking on behalf of the people of North Wiltshire, I must say that these are the questions that people are asking. People are saying, &quot;Why are we in Afghanistan?&quot; I hope that my colleagues will shortly be able to enlighten me.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-29b.271.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1953" speakername="Hugh Bayley" colnum="271"  time="015:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081029/halltext/81029h0006.htm#08102933000484">
	<p pid="b.271.0/1">I returned from Afghanistan on Monday evening. I was there for four or five days and had the opportunity to meet President Karzai and General Wardak, the Defence Minister. One of the success stories of Afghanistan has been the creation of a disciplined and effective Afghan national army, but I agree with hon. Members that the army needs to be increased in size, so I am glad that there is now approval, including funding approval from donors, to double its strength to about 135,000. There are political risks in having a long-term foreign military presence in the country, and also huge cost implications. It costs $50 billion a year for the NATO and allied military presence in Afghanistan, but when the Afghan national army reaches its full strength, although funded largely by donors, it will cost about $3.5 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.0/2">I met General McKiernan, several other senior military commanders, the international security assistance force senior civilian representative, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, Governor Atta in Balkh province and others, and I fundamentally disagree with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" name="Paul Flynn">the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase>, who said that the Afghan public would rather have the Taliban back than have conflict. Absolutely nobody to whom I spoke&mdash;none of the women and none of the women MPs&mdash;wants to see the Taliban back. There is a danger that they will get back into power if the Afghan Government, who&mdash;let us get the facts straight&mdash;have a presence way beyond Kabul, do not provide the security that people desperately need, or deal with corruption, especially within the police, who prey on, rather than protect, the people of Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.0/3">One positive thing that I saw in Afghanistan, however, was last week's presidential decision to sack the notoriously corrupt Interior Minister and replace him with the capable former Minister of Education. It will not be long until the election&mdash;probably in September next year&mdash;and it is extremely important that President Karzai's Government make real and tangible progress that people can see on dealing with corruption. That means getting rid of the vast majority of the police chiefs, because they have bought their jobs at $200,000 a piece. They think that they can extract a rent from the people in the provinces where they are chiefs, and that has to end.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.0/4">I visited the country about a year ago with the Select Committee on International Development, and we published our report in February. My impression from my recent visit is that the security situation has certainly deteriorated. The Taliban and other insurgents have turned more to terrorism and away from straight-on fighting with allied troops. They know that they cannot defeat ISAF or the Afghan national army, but then neither can ISAF defeat the insurgents militarily; the best that it can do is to provide conditions of sufficient order to find a political solution. That will include talking with elements of the insurgency. I am not sure that I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" name="James Gray">the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase>, who said that there are some good guys in the Taliban with whom we ought to get together, but there are some guys who have support, and it is important to try to do the politics and align as many tribal leaders&mdash;it is a tribal country&mdash;as possible with the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.0/5">Our capable ambassador in Kabul was recently reported, through a French leak, to have said that he does not believe that the war in Afghanistan can be won militarily. That is not a new view; he expressed it to the International Development Committee a year ago. The point of the military presence is to provide the conditions for economic development that improves the material welfare of the Afghan people, so that they see some benefit from President Karzai's Government, and to provide security until such time as the Afghan forces can provide it themselves. The comprehensive strategy, which ISAF follows, of providing security, working with the Government to improve governance and providing development assistance to address the material needs of the people is the right strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.272.0/1">I welcome the thrust of my hon. Friend's argument. When he was in Afghanistan, did he get a clear idea of the constraints on a more rapid expansion of the Afghan army? Is that not an essential path to establishing the security that we both want?</p>

	<p pid="b.272.1/1">That is absolutely essential. It is an effective force because it is well trained, disciplined and well recruited. There are people in this room with military experience, which I do not have, but if one were to try to wave a magic wand and create that situation in three months, one would fail. One has to work to provide the skills and the command structure to enable a larger army to do the job that the smaller Afghan national army does.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/2">Owing to time, I shall not talk about the difficulties that I saw with the caveats and other differences of policy between partners in NATO, but I am happy to talk to colleagues outside the Chamber about those difficulties, although I am sure that most people are largely aware of them.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/3">On development assistance, however, it is as important to co-ordinate development strategy among the donors as it is to co-ordinate military strategies within ISAF. The International Development Committee, when we were writing our report, received from the Peace Dividend Trust and others evidence that was reinforced by my meetings with UNAMA over the weekend&mdash;evidence that when aid is spent directly, it produces substantially less per dollar than when it is channelled through the Afghan trust funds to enable the Afghan Government to deliver to the people benefits such as schools and wells in villages.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/4">It is important that the Afghan Government provide those benefits. In Helmand province a year ago, I saw some of the many wells that the Department for International Development had funded. However, the work is done by the Afghan Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development. If they were sunk by a British contractor with a Union flag on the top, the Taliban would blow them up the following day, but if the Afghan Government provide them, it is very difficult for the Taliban to blow them up, because they are also fighting a battle for hearts and minds.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/5">There is a huge problem with corruption in the Government, and we have to address it, because if they remain a corrupt Government who are unable to deliver improvements in basic welfare for their people, the project will fail. Although people express doubts about what is happening in Afghanistan, and I certainly came away from my visit with some doubts that I had not had before, fundamentally, what is the alternative? It is one of the poorest countries in the world. We, as a development donor, would need to work with partners in Afghanistan for 30 to 50 years whether or not the current security situation existed. We have a responsibility to stick with Afghanistan. The problems are great, but I have confidence in our military and civilian teams in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/6">Time prevents me from talking about the new anti-drugs strategy that ISAF will follow, which has been authorised by NATO Defence Ministers. The situation is, I accept, not an easy one, but it is not a situation that we can walk away from.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-29b.273.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" speakername="Tobias Ellwood" colnum="273"  time="015:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081029/halltext/81029h0007.htm#08102933000487">
	<p pid="b.273.0/1">It is a pleasure to participate in this important debate. I am delighted to see the Minister here, although I was hoping to see a Foreign Office Minister, to explain the strategy. Our soldiers are working extremely hard on top of the hill to try to protect what is happening down in the village. My concern is that not enough is happening down in the village; that is why our soldiers on top of the hill are being shot. That is the fundamental issue with respect to what is going wrong in Afghanistan. I hope that the Minister is taking notes, because we are keen to learn what has happened. There has been a huge amount of mission creep since we first went in to try to deal with al-Qaeda. Now we are, as I heard a few months ago, dealing with counter-narcotics. We need to understand exactly what our mission is, and the end game.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/2">I am very concerned. I visit the country every five to six months, and I predict that there will be civil war there unless there is a turnaround in four key areas. The first of those is a review of the constitution. The idea that the one-size-fits-all approach with Kabul and President Karzai at the top should suddenly work for the whole of Afghanistan is fundamentally flawed. It ignores the wonderful celebration of ethnic mixes, alliances, allegiances and tribes that makes up Afghanistan. It is not really a country; it is a wonderful tapestry of different alliances. That should be celebrated and recognised in the constitution, instead of everything pointing to Kabul. If one speaks to someone in a village in Sangin district, they do not really look to Lashkagar, let alone Kandahar, and Kabul is another country away. That is ignored in the constitution and I am afraid none of the provincial leaders is given the autonomy or operational funding to enable them to conduct their activities and allow the local system of governance to grow. That was the first, and fundamental, error, which has meant that we will be there much longer than we should have been.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/3">The second key area is improving local security capability. I bet that we will hear again the numbers that are thrown out about how large the Afghan army is, and how it will double in size, along with the police force. I am afraid that in reality the operational effectiveness of both is very weak. The police force is 70 per cent. illiterate and most officers have a day job in the police and at night are involved in counter-narcotics.</p>

	<p pid="b.274.1/1">Absolutely&mdash;they are involved in narcotics; I stand corrected.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.1/2">Helmand province has been mentioned, and yes, we are making a fantastic job of teaching and training a new Afghan army, but there are four battalions based in Helmand province and just one is of operational effectiveness. That means that there are just 400 people we can work with in the whole province. Those are minuscule numbers, which is why we need to be able to train much faster. It should have happened. I am angry with the Germans about that; they were the ones who put their hands up in 2001 and said that they would train the police force. Did that happen? No, it did not. That is why the Americans have had to come in.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.1/3">The third key area is to do with the vision of the country itself. There is huge agricultural potential in Afghanistan. At the moment there is only one market&mdash;the black market&mdash;and everyone is engaged in the poppy trade. The only way we will change that is by improving infrastructure and allowing the three main arterial routes to be improved. No one is working on railway lines, or, really, to improve the dual carriageway system, to get the produce&mdash;whether that is apricots or dried fruits&mdash;to the Indian ocean or, indeed, on to the Trans-Siberian railway. Everything must be flown out, which is far too expensive, and because of that there is no market. Therefore, the only market people rely on is the black market, which is why everyone is involved with poppies.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.1/4">Fourthly, I want briefly to talk about Helmand province&mdash;I am trying to stick to your guidance on time, Mr. Taylor. The province is a British affair. We can criticise and be upset about the fundamental lack of co-ordination between our NATO allies, but what is happening in Helmand province is a British responsibility, and I am afraid DFID does not do danger. It does a wonderful job in places such as Africa and in other parts of the world, but when it comes to working in an insecure environment, it does not happen. We need a revolution in the way we approach our reconstruction and development works. That happened with respect to the way our armed forces operated when we moved from a cold war scenario to counter-insurgency operations, and it worked well. The same has not happened as far as dealing with reconstruction and development. I want to state firmly my desire that the British Army should take over that responsibility. There is a window of opportunity of about six months to a year, on going into an insecure environment, in which to create and build the necessary hearts and minds projects, until it becomes safe enough to allow DFID and the other agencies and contractors to come in and take over. Until that happens, what is going on in Helmand province will continue: that is very little, while the locals get frustrated because their life has not changed enough to have an effect.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.1/5">I am very concerned that the police do not have the necessary ability, and I think that we should listen to General Rose's comments and have a debate about whether to follow the line that we took in Iraq&mdash;the awakening process, under General Petraeus, by which we allowed local militias to grow. That happened in the UK 500 or 600 years ago, and in America during the revolution. It happened all over the world. That is how police forces develop in poor and underdeveloped countries&mdash;not by shipping in people with no alliances or allegiance to the local area. We need a debate about that; it would expedite the security process, which is so fundamental if anything else is to happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.1/6">There are some serious questions, to which I do not think we will hear the answers today. I should like a regular debate to be held in the House of Commons, not in Westminster Hall and not just with the Minister who is present today but with the Secretary of State for International Development and the Foreign Secretary. All three of them are tied in to what is happening in Afghanistan and we do not get enough feedback, and cannot contribute to debate on those important issues. I hope that the Government have the strength to listen to what is being said today, recognise what is not working and be brave enough to take a new direction.</p>

	<p pid="b.275.2/1">I shall be very brief. The House owes a debt of gratitude to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" name="Oliver Heald">the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase> for obtaining the debate. Both he and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> have made an important point: there is insufficient parliamentary scrutiny of what is happening in Afghanistan, insufficient time for debate and an insufficient number of statements.</p>
	<p pid="b.275.2/2">No one who has so far spoken in the debate has shown great optimism or confidence about what is happening or is likely to happen in Afghanistan. The policy clearly does not enjoy universal support in the Chamber, or, I suspect, among the British public. The last opinion poll showed that 54 per cent. of the population of the country want the troops to be brought home. I suspect that those opinion polls are mirrored all over Europe and in many other parts of the world. There is, however, a degree of unity in the United States about continuing with the policy. Both Barack Obama and John McCain are pursuing essentially the same policy on Afghanistan. It is a question of who would put in the most troops the quickest, and who would bring about a solution to the war quickest. I would caution both of them to think back a little to how we got involved in the mess in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.275.2/3">Only nine days after 9/11, President Bush made a blood-curdling statement to Congress, demanding all sorts of things of the then Afghan Government, led by the Taliban, which he decided were not delivered. A war was therefore unleashed against Afghanistan. Many thousands of wholly innocent ordinary Afghan people died as a result of high-level bombardment from the west. Their families have not forgiven or forgotten what happened then. The war was meant to solve the problems of 9/11 and teach the world that the US was in charge, after which all would be well.</p>
	<p pid="b.275.2/4">It is now seven years since that happened. The war has taken considerably longer than the second world war, and has cost a vast amount of money. It has not brought about the peace or justice it was supposed to bring about. One should not forget that the behaviour of US forces shortly after they arrived in Afghanistan in 2001 led to imprisonments at Bagram air base, the establishment of Guantanamo Bay and the gross abuse of human rights by a country that claimed it was defending them.</p>

	<p pid="b.276.0/1">Is the hon. Gentleman's difficulty that we got rid of the Taliban, or that we messed things up in the seven years since&mdash;or both?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-29b.276.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="276"  time="015:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081029/halltext/81029h0007.htm#08102933000494">
	<p pid="b.276.1/1">First, the Taliban have not been got rid of; they are clearly still there. Otherwise, I suspect the war would be over. I also think that the whole philosophy and strategy were fundamentally flawed from the beginning. However, it suited the purposes of President Bush at that time to pursue the war. We have thus suffered a serious loss of liberties. That applies not just to the people who unfortunately ended up in Guantanamo Bay, but to every country that has pursued the absurd war on terror.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.1/2">These things are dangerous, and they go on for a long time. The war has now actively spread over into Pakistan and we have the ludicrous situation that occurred a couple of weeks ago: because unmanned aircraft are bombing villages in Pakistan, people are now fleeing across the border into Afghanistan to avoid the US bombing, and then when the US starts bombing villages in Afghanistan they go back across the border. We should put ourselves in the position of the Pakistan; Government, who are in a complicated bind. Do they pursue a war in support of what the US wants, knowing that it is unpopular with a majority of the Pakistani people, or do they nothing about it and allow the US to invade their country, when they are supposed to be allies of the US? These are dangerous times that could well lead to a political crisis and collapse in Pakistan&mdash;a country that possesses nuclear arms. The situation is not simple; it is in fact very dangerous.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.1/3">I urge an end to the fiction that there is going to be a military victory in Afghanistan, or that western-style government covering the whole of Afghanistan is going to be imposed. Everybody knows, including the braver people in the military, that to end this war, there will have to be political dialogue&mdash;yes, with the Taliban and yes, with elements of the Taliban. The Taliban are not a seamless whole. One cannot go to Kabul, knock on the door of the Taliban head office and ask to see the general secretary of the Taliban to have a discussion; it does not work like that. There are lots of different factions and elements. There has to be that dialogue process; otherwise, we will end up with the most terrible loss of life among British soldiers, coalition forces and civilians in Afghanistan, and we will see the extension of the war way beyond the borders of Afghanistan. This is a time for reality check and a time to look for peace, not an expansion of this ghastly conflict.</p>

	<p pid="b.277.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" name="Oliver Heald">the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase> on securing this important debate. It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase>. All I would say in response to his comments is that I do not think that anyone but a fool would think that this campaign, war, policy, insurgency&mdash;call it what we will, although the language is important&mdash;can be won by military means alone. I am sure that the Minister would agree with that.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.0/2">I was brought up with tomes of counter-insurgency documents, such as Frank Kitson's books or Robert Thompson's books, based on the British and American experiences of counter-insurgency. I was surprised, therefore, after Baghdad fell, when I spent some time on the Iraq-Iran border at a relatively benign time, to be told by the locals, &quot;Listen, get your reconstruction right, because if you don't, you're going to have a Shi'a uprising, you just are. Iran is going to be drawn into this conflict, as sure as eggs is eggs.&quot; That comment was clearly made to me. Thompson, Kitson and the higher command and staff course all teach that counter-insurgency is not fought by bombs and bullets alone.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.0/3">I do not mean to patronise the Minister in any way, but I hope that he will allow me to reflect some of the comments of a certain infantry battalion&mdash;its name he can probably guess&mdash;which returned from Afghanistan recently with nine dead and more than 30 injured, and which is due to return in the near future. I shall set out what my former comrades are telling me of their deepest and most grave concerns for their return to Helmand next spring.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.0/4">The first has been touched on by a number of different people. My former comrades are not clear in their minds what the relationship is with the Pakistani Government, what the position is of the Inter-Services Intelligence&mdash;the Pakistani intelligence service&mdash;or exactly what is being done to control the movement of foreign fighters to and from the border. They are happy, and I hope the Minister believes this, to kill those people, but by golly, every time that they knock one down, three more seem to spring up. They are not clear about that. That has a major impact on their morale, particularly for men who are now seasoned fighting soldiers.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.0/5">The second point is an unlikely one to come from a military mouth, or at least I thought that it was. They are unclear about where the future lies for the process of security sector reform and reconciliation in particular. I was asked, for instance, what exactly was the position with Michael Semple and the United Nations official Mervyn Patterson? What were they trying to achieve? If they were doing what it is said they were trying to do, which was broadly praised by my former comrades, why were they arrested? Why were they ejected? What is the position on reconciliation? Going back to Thompson and Kitson, reconciliation means talking to the enemy, trying to turn the enemy into our friends, and heavens above, that was the secret to our supposed, or at least our partial, success in Northern Ireland. Where do we stand on reconciliation?</p>
	<p pid="b.277.0/6">The next point, which I thought was absolutely crucial, was the question of why we are so poor at communicating our views with the world through the national and international media. They made the point that all that the Taliban have to do is to pick up a mobile phone and speak directly to al-Jazeera to allow their particular bit of poison to drip into the world's ear, yet if a military public information strategy is being thought up it is &quot;staffed to death&quot;&mdash;their phrase, not mine. Nothing is agile about how we put our views, or our propaganda, into the world arena. It is slow, cumbersome, risk averse and too often, it is politically correct. The enemy are defeating us with propaganda just as surely as they are damaging us with bombs and bullets.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.0/7">The next two points fall under one generic heading, which concerns the key to local success. I am not of the school that believes we will ever see an established democracy with universal peace in Afghanistan, any more than we did in the 19th or 20th centuries&mdash;it is not that sort of country. None the less, the key to that peace lies in two places: the Afghan national police and the Afghan national army. I will not repeat the points that have been made much more eloquently by my some of my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Islington, North. If we wish to have a competent police force, and not, to quote a former colleague of mine, one that is</p>
	<p pid="b.277.0/8" class="indent">&quot;seen by the Afghans as corrupt and narco-ridden&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.277.0/9">and if we are to have a reliable army, we must provide the right number of instructors, trainers and mentors, in a benign environment in which training can occur. If the trainers and the operational mentoring liaison teams keep getting killed and shot, and if that job is seen as the single most dangerous military job in Helmand province at the moment, we are simply not progressing.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.0/10">On a point that is more wide-ranging, but which is really the same argument, if redevelopment and reconciliation occur and if security sector reform generally occurs and an area is pacified&mdash;although that is a relative term&mdash;and it becomes as benign as Kabul or Lashkagar have been, the rules of counter-insurgency dictate that there must be enough troops, police, or paramilitaries, whatever they are, to hold those areas and to keep them benign. We cannot have the sort of operations springing up behind our front lines that we have already seen.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.0/11">In conclusion, I ask the Minister to address those specific points and to add his weight to the argument that if we are going to try to contain the situation, if not triumph in this area, there have to be enough troops properly equipped with enough transport, aircraft and resources.</p>

	<p pid="b.278.0/1">I shall be brief, and not inflict my dreadful voice on everyone for too long. Clearly, we will win this only with a political settlement. People have spoken about increasing the capacity of the Afghan national army. That is probably a much more important way forward than increasing the number of foreign troops, apart from those with niche capabilities. We are always told that it is hard to generate an army quickly, but Afghanistan is probably the one country in the world where one can generate large numbers of men under arms quite rapidly. What is happening at the moment and what has happened in history teaches us that in Afghanistan, foreign troops are a problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.0/2">On the subject of the police, we have spoken about police mentoring teams. Actually, what we need more than mentoring teams teaching people how to be good detectives or gather evidence, is political commissars, in terms of the appointment of police chiefs.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.0/3">Finally, we talk about corruption, but we are supporting a deeply corrupt Government. If we do not deal with that, we will be finished. If we cannot ourselves deal with corrupt senior officials, we can use our intelligence services and police forces to put together dossiers with incontrovertible evidence for the President and thereby get high-profile prosecutions of a few of those people.</p>

	<p pid="b.279.0/1">I want to try to give a positive, upbeat message after what we have heard over the past hour. I have visited Afghanistan twice this year, most recently last month, to meet members of 16 Air Assault Brigade from the Colchester garrison, which I have the pleasure and privilege of representing. I am delighted to say that the last of the 2 Para soldiers returned as recently as Monday, as a big spread in the local newspaper reported. I want to home in on comments made by the commander of 3 Para, Lieutenant-Colonel Huw Williams, who said that the insurgency in Afghanistan will go on for a long time. He said that the international community would not let go, and that it would be wrong to desert the Afghan people now, especially after what has been achieved.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/2">It is in that spirit that I want to quote the words of Victoria Bateman, who contacted me. She is the young widow of James Bateman, one of the young soldiers from 2 Para who lost his life in June. She stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/3" class="indent">&quot;The one wish that I have now is that James' work is not forgotten and his memory is preserved in a positive manner, and I will do everything that I can to ensure this.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/4">Tomorrow, Victoria Bateman will be joining other members of the families of 2 Para at a regimental church service at St. Peter's church, Colchester, where they will remember the nine soldiers from 2 Para and four others attached to 2 Para who have lost their lives in the past six months. They are among the 32 in total from 16 Air Assault Brigade who have lost their lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/5">It is in the spirit of remembering good work in a positive manner that I want to inform Members of the visit to the House of Commons early in the summer by the chairman and deputy chairman of the Helmand provincial council. They were accompanied by two women members of the council, and of course that would not have been possible if the Taliban were still running Afghanistan. Mr. Anwar Khan thanked Britain, especially our armed forces, for all that this country is doing to help his country and its citizens, whom he explained wanted once again to be part of the civilised world after experiencing some 30 years when their country was systematically destroyed. He mentioned the positive role of the help given to provide security against insurgents, the training being given to the Afghan police and army, and reconstruction work, including the building of schools, hospitals, clinics, houses and roads.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/6">As we heard, the Afghan national army is expanding. It will virtually double in size over the next four years to about 130,000 or 135,000 soldiers, and, as I witnessed when I was in Camp Bastion only last month, it is increasingly playing a role in the security of the country. It is losing more men than the allies are.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/7">Having heard the upbeat message from the chairman of the Helmand provincial council, I hope that it is in that spirit that we in the British Parliament look at Afghanistan. The solution cannot be a military one only&mdash;I believe that that is accepted&mdash;but our military personnel are making a huge difference to the lives of ordinary Afghan people, ensuring that the country does not return to being a haven from which terrorism is exported around the world.</p>

	<p pid="b.280.1/1">I must confess that he did not say that, but I would like to move on to how I see Afghanistan in the future. It has to be decentralised, with province-led governance and administration. Yes, there must be a national umbrella, but the reality of tribal loyalties and allegiances must be recognised. Taking that line and bringing in the various factions would be the way forward. The solution cannot be a military one only&mdash;politicians and the military have to work together.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.1/2">As I have indicated in the Chamber in the past, and in Prime Minister's questions not that long ago, there is a problem, and it is the failure of our European NATO allies to deploy sufficient troops to support the effort. For example, there are 70 caveats which result in other European NATO countries finding it difficult, to put it mildly, to play their part. That is not acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.1/3">I endorse the words of Brigadier Mark Carleton-Smith, commander of 16 Air Assault Brigade, whom I met at Camp Bastion. I am sure that it would be difficult to disagree with the top man in Afghanistan when he says that there will not be a military solution. He said that the British troops had taken the sting out of the Taliban in 2008, but that it would be necessary to engage with the Taliban in the future governance of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.1/4">I appreciate that time is against all of us who would like to contribute to the debate. There is another example of the British military playing a crucial role in the redevelopment and reconstruction of Afghanistan: their incredible achievement only a few weeks ago in taking a turbine through 50 or 60 miles of hostile Taliban country to the Kajaki dam. That was the biggest military effort since the Falklands war. I am told that it was the first time since the second world war that all four battalions of the Parachute Regiment have engaged on a single mission. We should celebrate such achievements.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.1/5">I regret observations that could be misinterpreted not only by the British people and Her Majesty's armed forces but by the people of Afghanistan. I cannot speak for the whole of the United Kingdom, but I can certainly speak for the garrison town that I represent, where there is considerable pride in what has been achieved and a certain knowledge that lives have not been lost in vain. It is in the interests of this country and the whole democratic world that Afghanistan does not return to what it was six, seven or eight years ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.1/6">I hope that the Minister will accept that there is a message of hope, and that the British armed forces are doing a good job. That is recognised by many people in Afghanistan. I can only repeat what was put to me by the chairman of the Helmand provincial council. He does not want his province to revert to what it was&mdash;a place in which women had no say, girls did not go to school and society was run by tribal warlords. It is important to bring everybody together, and the way forward is to engage the Afghan people more, decentralise, have provincial governance and assist our troops, who need more support from our European NATO allies.</p>

	<p pid="b.281.0/1">It is good to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Taylor, and to hear so many luminaries speak this afternoon. It is a pity that we could not get everyone in. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" name="Oliver Heald">the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase> on securing this extremely important debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/2">It is a great pity that, six or seven years on, we are here with a Defence Minister. I like the Minister very much indeed&mdash;he is a great man&mdash;but it is a pity that he is not a Minister from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office or from the Department for International Development. That would have been a mark of where we might have been but, sadly, we are not.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/3">Arguments about Afghanistan being a proving ground for NATO, for being an exercise in facilitating the ability of Afghans to cast a ballot, or for the lifting of a country out of poverty are supplementary. Although worthy, they are intermediate goals that are admissible because they facilitate the reduction of the threat of terrorism on Britain's streets, and the desolation and criminality caused here by Afghanistan's chief export. That should be our lodestar.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/4">In 1936, the sociologist Robert Merton published &quot;The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action&quot;, which I am sure the Minister is familiar with; he will certainly be familiar with the law of unintended consequences, which is the guts of it. In Iraq, all five contributing factors that Merton identified as likely to lead to unexpected and perverse outcomes from Government action were satisfied. I suspect that Merton would have been less alarmed by Afghanistan. However, a jaw-dropping failure to understand what was going on was evidenced by the estimation of one of the Defence Secretary's predecessors, which was that we could do whatever he then had in mind without a single shot being fired. We see it also in a complete failure to get to grips with the nature of the Taliban.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/5">Brigadier Mark Carleton-Smith has had to write 32 difficult letters during his six months in command of 16 Air Assault Brigade in Afghanistan. His view is:</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/6" class="indent">&quot;We're not going to win this war&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/7">If winning means establishing a Jeffersonian liberal democracy in Afghanistan, he may be right. The brigadier says that, at some point, we will have to sit around a table with the Taliban. Well, it is their country; they are not going away. This appears to have dawned, belatedly, on the Kabul Administration. Having laid into western leaders for parleying with insurgents, we now find that Karzai is opening up lines of communications with Mullah Omar. That is good. But we really should have no truck with the conceit of not treating with those we define as terrorists. Indeed, the Government have more experience than most of dealing with those at what we might call the fag end of statecraft, both at home and abroad. Already, the Government are having to hold their nose while dealing with the fragile, corrupt and potentially capricious regime in Kabul and, at the same time, training up their army and police force. Without tackling endemic corruption, there can be no chance of success in Afghanistan by any measure.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/8">During the ultimately successful counter-insurgency war in Dhofar, it was necessary in 1970 to secure regime change: the sultan had to go. But in Afghanistan, in wondering how much progress we will see under the current management, we have to ask&mdash;no doubt Brigadier Carleton-Smith has&mdash;whether the alternatives would be very much better.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/9">We talk about winning the battle of hearts and minds in a fairly loose way. In total war, the attitudes of civilian populations are of secondary importance to the need to secure military advantage and military victory. The reverse is the case in the sort of counter-insurgency operations we have seen since 1945. With the United Nations reporting that Afghan civilian deaths as a result of coalition action have risen by 40 per cent. this year, I wonder whether the Government have had sufficient regard to the primacy of heart and minds in the ultimate outcome of the two major conflicts that have occurred on their watch. Hearts and minds means aid and development. The UK has chosen to channel its aid largely through the Afghan Government. Will the Minister say whether, in retrospect, he feels that this has been wise?</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/10">United States aid is always clearly badged; we see on our television screens buckets of gear going out, clearly marked with the stars and stripes. That helps to paint America in a favourable light and helps give it mitigation in the eyes of many Afghans. The drug barons and the Taliban are building schools and hospitals in the south of the country and making it abundantly clear to the population who they are indebted to. Surely, we should also be shouting our philanthropy from the rooftops.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/11">Government strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan is underpinned by the extraordinary service of the men and women of our armed forces. Last week, I had the great privilege of visiting our troops in Iraq, most of whom seemed to have recent experience of Afghanistan. All of them reckon that this will be their last tour of Iraq; all of them reckon they will be going to Afghanistan in the fullness of time. My trip to Iraq allowed me to inspect our range of quaint airborne antiques, which are part of the problem and about which the Minister and I have corresponded. I know that he has also corresponded with my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> on this issue, in respect of rest and recuperation leave for our troops.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/12">It is important to understand that our troops are first rate. They are doing the bidding of the Government. They must not be taken for granted and I know that the Minister does not intend that they should be, but it is clear to me, having spoken to our troops in Iraq and having had a range of correspondence on this topic, that one of their chief bugbears at the moment&mdash;I suspect that this also applies in Afghanistan&mdash;is a problem with the airhead, which cuts into their rest and recuperation leave. I hope that the Minister is able to reassure me on the subject of troop transport aircraft and that he will also say categorically that troops are not being delayed at airheads because of the want of aircraft anti-missile kit, which makes service aircraft incapable of operation for trooping flights in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/13">May I also press the Minister on equipment in general? The good news is that the message I am getting is that the new kit coming on line is good, albeit belated. I welcome the Minister's statement today on the protected mobility package, which looks like it will help to improve safety and security in Afghanistan, particularly. But&mdash;there will always be a &quot;but&quot; from me&mdash;not all of these are new orders. It would be useful to hear him say how the total of &pound;700 million that is cited is arrived at: whether it is &pound;600 million for the mobility package plus &pound;96 million for Talisman, which is what I think it means, or something different. Perhaps he can say whether we can assume that the element of the mobility package not funded by the reserve will, at &pound;100 million, have to be paid for by the Ministry of Defence or whether it will be in excess of that. In addition, is the &pound;500 million to be taken from the reserve already included in the latest reserve estimates? The Minister will know the implications of that if is so.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/14">May I also press the Minister on training on this new kit? I heard from people in theatre that it is all very well having kit&mdash;I saw a lot of it when I was in Iraq&mdash;but it is no good if they have to train on it when it is in theatre; they need to train on kit when they are in the UK. Of course, we are cutting back on training because of overstretch, but it is a pity that that appears to be impinging on vital training on the new kit being introduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/15">The platoon house strategy has been tried and found costly. If it is the Government's intention to avoid search-and-destroy operations in favour of &quot;clear and hold&quot;, would the Minister agree that we must find more soldiers? Training and recruitment of the Afghan national army, particularly senior officers, have been slow and our European so-called allies have been found unwilling. That leaves, for practical purposes, ourselves, the US, the Dutch and the Canadians, and at least three of those countries will continue to be over-committed, even post-Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/16">We may have to start thinking outside the box. General Sir Michael Rose argues that irregular Pashtun militias might be conscripted as force multipliers, citing experience in Oman in the 1970s. A combination of collateral reduction and force multiplication could be crucial as we reach a tipping point at which the uncommitted majority in the south and east of Afghanistan start to decide which side looks like a winner and therefore which one they should back.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/17">More in hope than expectation, I must press the Minister on countries that are not pulling their weight in the coalition, despite being signatories to it. It is accepted that our role in Afghanistan is to protect the home front. If that is so, the same goes in France, Germany and Italy. How long must we indulge national caveats that mean, in the words of one soldier I met last week, that many coalition troops in theatre are about as useful as a chocolate fireguard? It is not just an aversion to losing soldiers. Britain alone has given &pound;600 million in aid to Afghanistan since 2001 and has been at the forefront of what redevelopment has been achieved. Yet the Germans and Italians, for example, having undertaking responsibility for police and judicial reform respectively at the Tokyo conference of 2002, have left both chaotic and inadequately funded. How odd then that our newly minted Defence Secretary should think that the solution is a European army and that those who oppose it are &quot;pathetic&quot; and</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/18" class="indent">&quot;don't understand the nature of the modern world&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/19">since a European force would, apparently,</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/20" class="indent">&quot;project power, strength and conviction around the world.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/21">Not, it seems, in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="b.284.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" name="Oliver Heald">the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase> on securing this important and timely debate. We have 8,000 military personnel and 400 civil servants and contractors in Afghanistan, and we have lost 121 people in that benighted country since 2001. During 16 Air Assault Brigade's recent six-month tour&mdash;it has just arrived home&mdash;we lost 32 people, and a further 30 were seriously wounded. In recent days, the murders of Gayle Williams and David Giles by militants in Kabul reminded us that the country's capital remains a dangerous place. I am sure that we all pay tribute to those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice, and to all those who take such a risk on our behalf. Our thoughts are with the families of those we have lost, and our eternal gratitude belongs to all those who serve our country.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/2">Such investment in blood and sweat, to say nothing of pounds and pence, rightly raises challenging questions. Why are we doing this? Is it worth it? Should we continue and, if so, for how long? A further key question, which I have heard only my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1953" name="Hugh Bayley">the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley)</phrase> ask so far today, is: what are the consequences of our not continuing? A related question is: how much is our effort in Afghanistan in our self interest? My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" name="Paul Flynn">the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> said that we should never have gone in there in the first place because were stirring up a hornets' nest, and it is all terrible. That presumes that if we had not stirred up the hornets' nest, the hornets would have remained quietly buzzing in the corner, and would not have stung us hard.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/3">My hon. Friend complains and worries about the furore at the loss of life, and at the inquests into the loss of some of our people, which will continue. But what about the furore if we have another 9/11 or 7/7? We cannot say that the country is over there and unconnected with our national interest and security. Yes, I want us to open schools, I want women to be able to participate in education, and I want Afghans to be relieved of the mediaeval tyranny of the Taliban, but that is not my main motive for allowing our people to go to, and sometimes to die, in a faraway place. My main motive is the protection of our people back home. If I did not believe that our involvement in Afghanistan was inextricably tied up with our security back home, I would not support our involvement in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="b.285.0/1">I think we all agree that we shall be in Afghanistan for some time, so perhaps I could bring the Minister back to that debate. I understand from my visit to Helmand recently that the Americans are building a second runway at Camp Bastion, and are introducing 9,000 combat troops. That will dwarf the British presence there at the moment, and change the dynamics considerably. Will the Minister explain why that move has been made, and how command and control will work?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-29b.285.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1516" speakername="Bob Ainsworth" colnum="285"  time="015:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081029/halltext/81029h0009.htm#08102933000503">
	<p pid="b.285.1/1">The move has not yet been made, but it is under consideration, as the hon. Gentleman knows. Several hon. Members have said that the Americans are having a review, and asked whether we are having one and should have one, and the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire made that a central point. I sometimes think that when we have review after review, we are in danger of pulling up the plant to see whether the roots are growing. Of course, the Americans are having a review. They will shortly have a new President and a new Administration, and they will want a completely fresh look at what they do, how they do it, and so on. We will be involved in that. We will have our people there, and we will try to exercise whatever influence we can over American interests, but our policy is still totally and utterly justified in my opinion, and I have heard nothing today to suggest that it is not.</p>
	<p pid="b.285.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West said that we must move away from the fiction of military victory, but I do not know where that fiction comes from. It is not a fiction that the Government have ever spread around. It is not new when people say that the military alone cannot win in places such as Afghanistan. Everyone understands that, from the Prime Minister down to Defence Ministers, commanders on the ground, and right down to captains. They know that the operation is about winning the people; it is not about killing the Taliban. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1726" name="Patrick Mercer">The hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer)</phrase> understands the military procedures and doctrines better than I do. The operation is counter-insurgency. That is well understood at every level in our military, and is built into our thinking.</p>

	<p pid="b.285.2/1">The troops have been in Afghanistan for seven years, and the Ministry of Defence talks openly of their staying there for another 30 years. How much longer does the Minister honestly expect us to bear the cost of deploying the troops and suffering the loss of life in Afghanistan before there is any political settlement?</p>

	<p pid="b.285.3/1">We have never tried to say, and no one has ever suggested, that our involvement in Afghanistan would be short-term, or an easy and quick win. I return to the question: what if we were not involved? <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">The hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase> asked the question, as did my hon. Friend the Member for City of York. There is no easy way of walking away and turning our backs on the situation.</p>

	<p pid="b.286.0/1">The hornets' nest that we stirred up was the incursion into Helmand province. Our decision to invade Afghanistan was originally supported by every member of the House, including me, on the basis of reducing the threat of terrorism by weakening the Taliban and removing al-Qaeda's safe base from which to operate against us, but the Taliban have been greatly strengthened, and Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda have an even safer base in Pakistan, so the threat of terrorism is the same.</p>

	<p pid="b.286.1/1">The heart of the insurgency is in southern Afghanistan, in Kandahar and Helmand. To suggest that one can go into benign parts of the country, but not the dangerous parts, and somehow deal with the insurgency is not reality.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.1/2">The situation is far from perfect. There is much to be done and there are major challenges ahead, but we should not allow the fact that the situation is difficult make us defeatist. We must be strong and determined, and we must remain unflinching in our commitment to Afghanistan, because our vital national security is at stake. This is a question of our national interest. Unless we are happy for those who seek to wreak havoc on the streets of our country to be free to train in the ungoverned space that is there, as they were doing before 2001, our involvement is inevitable.</p>

	<p pid="b.286.2/1">The right hon. Gentleman makes some eminently sensible points, but it seems likely that, with either new President, we will be asked to take part in some kind of military surge in Afghanistan. This debate has shown that all parties are very concerned and that there needs to be considerably more debate, understanding and confidence that the Government will support a policy of engagement with the tribal leaders to promote local governance in the provinces to ensure that this campaign is effective. Will he undertake to have a debate on the Floor of the House, before those decisions are made?</p>

	<p pid="b.286.3/1">The hon. Gentleman knows that I cannot promise debates on the Floor of the House. He knows that we have five defence debates every year and that Afghanistan features significantly in those. We have Defence questions next Monday and we will have debates here in Westminster Hall. In addition, the Opposition have their own opportunities to raise these issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.3/2">Reconciliation has been mentioned by the hon. Member for Newark and other hon. Members. Our policy has always been that we are not against reconciliation. It is part of our strategy in Afghanistan, but one can reconcile only with the reconcilable. One cannot reconcile with the top end of al-Qaeda who have shown no propensity to talk to anyone, and one cannot reconcile with the hard-line end of the Taliban leadership who are totally and absolutely at one with al-Qaeda. We will reconcile where it is possible as part of our strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.287.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Taylor. I am grateful for the opportunity to make the case for a new cancer treatment unit at Westmorland general hospital. Over the past few months, I have been in discussion with the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust and Cumbria primary care trust about the need for a cancer unit in south Cumbria. I am delighted that the trusts are now pushing forward with that bid and that only last week the local cancer network agreed to go ahead with the feasibility study, with a strong steer that the unit should become a reality as soon as possible. My hope in this debate is that the Minister will give us some commitments as we seek to establish the cancer treatment unit in Kendal, and encourage us in our campaign and our bid.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/2">The need for the new unit is clear: residents of south Cumbria face some of the longest travelling times in the country when they go to receive vital cancer treatment. The Minister will know that NHS Cumbria has provided figures showing that from some locations in south Cumbria, cancer patients have to make a three-hour round trip to receive treatment. In my constituency, cancer patients living in the main town of Kendal must travel 41 miles, taking almost 50 minutes, to receive treatment. That is just a one-way journey. For residents in Grange-over-Sands and Windermere, the one-way trip to Preston takes an hour. For the vast number of my constituents&mdash;for example, those in Coniston, Grasmere, Sedbergh, Chapel Stile, Elterwater, Ambleside and Cartmel&mdash;the journey to Preston takes in excess of an hour, and in some cases an hour and a half. Patients from other towns and villages in south Cumbria outside my constituency also suffer as a result of the ludicrously excessive travelling times.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/3">The Minister will know that Cancer Reform Strategy supports the findings of the National Radiotherapy Advisory Group, which concluded that radiotherapy units should be planned so that no patient has to travel for more than 45 minutes by car to receive treatment. The appalling reality is that not one cancer patient in my constituency can reliably access radiotherapy treatment within that time. Cancer patients in Westmorland and Lonsdale have, on average, to make a round trip of more than 100 miles every time they have to go for treatment. For some cancers, patients need to make daily trips. Those living with and fighting to overcome cancer should not have to face unnecessarily arduous, stressful and painful journeys to receive essential care.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/4">Many people have spoken to me of their difficulty in coping with the journeys involved. They tell me that they feel worn down, and ready to give up treatment that could save or extend their lives. In talking to Cancer Care, a local charity in south Cumbria and north Lancashire that takes care of and provides counselling and support for cancer sufferers, it is also clear that a cancer unit in Kendal would make a huge difference to the lives of children and young people who have cancer, or whose siblings, parents or other carers have cancer.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/5">The trauma is bad enough without the additional logistical difficulties of having to arrange time out of school and the other child care problems that treatment at a distant centre can throw up. For those who have to spend half a day travelling, the opportunity to take advantage of vital counselling, through charities such as Cancer Care, is massively squeezed.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/6">On a personal level, my wife and I lost our mothers to cancer during the last four years. In both cases, we saw the outstanding way in which NHS staff, at all levels, showed commitment and compassion, along with tremendous professional skill and expertise. We also witnessed the reality, which is that cancer treatment is extremely gruelling, and the fact that tackling the disease can often wear down and debilitate the patient. Indeed, many patients decide to discontinue treatment because they are so badly affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/7">When patients, families and clinicians are considering initial treatment, or its continuation, one of their concerns is the reality of travel times. Putting it bluntly, the requirement on people who are extremely poorly to make a difficult regular round trip of up to three hours leads many to decide against treatment that could extend their lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/8">[John Bercow <i>in</i><i> the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/9">I am sure that you will agree, Mr. Bercow&mdash;I welcome you to the Chair&mdash;that it is scandalous that people should effectively be forced to give up life-saving treatment simply because it is too painful for them to get to the units where the treatment is delivered.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/10">I have bags of evidence from my constituents that backs up the reality, but I shall concentrate on a few statistics. The NHS recommends that around 52 per cent. of patients with cancer should receive radiotherapy, but for patients in south Cumbria the figure is only 30 per cent., 10 per cent. lower than for our neighbours in the north of Cumbria. Cancer admissions for south Cumbria are 10.6 per 1,000, compared with 11 per 1,000 for Cumbria as a whole and 11.9 per 1,000 for England. Our cancer admissions are among the lowest in the country, and the number of patients receiving radiotherapy is also one of the lowest in the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/11">Furthermore, the average cost in south lakeland of GP prescriptions for malignant disease and immunosuppression is, at &pound;900, the highest in our area. For our neighbours in north Cumbria and Carlisle, the figure is &pound;400 and in the Eden district, the figure is &pound;325. It is not rocket science to infer that the huge difference in those figures is due to the fact that those patients in south Cumbria who are much further from radiotherapy centres are opting for drug treatments closer to home rather than having more effective radiotherapy many miles away.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/12">There can be no doubt that the staggering distances between patients in my constituency and the nearest radiotherapy treatment centre are having a tragic impact on survival rates. That is why NHS Cumbria has stated that the siting of a new cancer unit at Westmorland general hospital would significantly benefit patients from south lakeland and Barrow, as it would hugely reduce travelling times.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/13">I encourage the Minister to support the bid being made by NHS Cumbria, the North Lancashire primary care trust, the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, the Lancashire and South Cumbria Cancer Network and me for a new cancer treatment unit to be established in Kendal. The need for such a unit is clear, and we believe that Kendal is undoubtedly the right place to locate it.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/14">Westmorland general hospital is easily accessible. It is on the edge of town and about eight minutes drive from the motorway. There is plenty of space around it for expansion, it has good car parking provision and it is set in tranquil surroundings. That is important, because the feel and atmosphere of a cancer unit is of the utmost importance when people are attending for treatment under extreme emotional pressure. It is the most central location for a population who would be drawn from Barrow in the west to the villages of the Yorkshire dales in the east, and from the Eden valley in the north to the Lancashire border to the south.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/15">The Minister will recall that I have raised concerns about the future of Westmorland general hospital on numerous occasions, and I am grateful for her continued attention and for her interventions over the past year or so since she took up her post.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/16">Westmorland general hospital is the only hospital in south lakeland. In other words it is the only hospital serving an area that is larger than Greater London. It has recently lost many of its emergency medical services, although a strong local campaign succeeded in winning back a cardiac assessment unit and two GP-managed medical wards, for which we are grateful. Our fight to bring back other medical emergency services, especially for heart patients, continues. Nevertheless, the Minister will doubtless understand our real fears about the future of our hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/17">The primary benefit of a cancer unit in our hospital in Kendal would be for cancer patients and their families, but there would be a further benefit of vast importance: locating a new cancer centre at the hospital would demonstrate a commitment to retaining and strengthening Westmorland general. Indeed, it would reinvigorate our hospital. I speculate that the Minister would find herself a Westmorland heroine if she made that happen on her watch. What is more, I will personally make arrangements for the statue! That is a promise.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/18">Over the next few weeks, I shall be meeting Professor Mike Richards, the national clinical director for cancer, and Mike Farrar, the chief executive of the strategic health authority for the north-west of England. My aim is to win their support for the bid and to get the wheels in motion, so that we can see the unit built and operating within two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/19">The Cancer Reform Strategy requires strategic health authorities to take an overview of radiotherapy planning. It also requires that the cancer action team should keep a national overview of locations for treatment. Given that the Cancer Reform Strategy is clear in saying that no one should have to undergo a journey of more than 45 minutes to receive treatment, and that no one in south lakeland can access treatment within 45 minutes, I hope that the Minister will put her full weight behind our bid to win support for the proposed cancer treatment unit at Kendal. I encourage the strategic health authority and the cancer action team to do the same.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/20">For the record, let me explain exactly what we are asking for. We want a unit that will deliver radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The unit would need a CT simulator, laboratory facilities and on-site oncology support. In my view, the presence of on-site clinical oncology in Kendal would underpin the new unit, ensuring that long arduous journeys for patients for the purpose of treatment planning as well as for the treatment itself were rendered unnecessary. We must ensure that chemotherapy treatment is available at the new unit, along with radiotherapy. If we are to put an end to unacceptable journey times, we need to do so for as many treatments as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/21">There is some discussion about whether the trusts should bid for one linear accelerator or two. The population comfortably create demand for at least one accelerator, but along with local clinicians I can make a strong case for two. Senior oncologists have told me that it is essential to have two accelerators to allow for down time and to ensure that there is no interruption in service, which is vital.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/22">Such a unit will clearly involve a significant capital investment in new buildings and equipment, and the local NHS trusts estimate a total bill of about &pound;15 million. It is estimated that the running costs would be about &pound;1 million. We must also ensure ongoing capital support to sustain the Kendal cancer unit. Once built, it is essential that the unit keeps up with advances in technology, and that the machinery is properly maintained over time. With developments in technology such as image-guided radiotherapy and intensively modulated radiotherapy now available, we would want to be sure that our new unit was able to keep pace with, and to provide equivalent quality treatment to, other centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/23">Our previous radiotherapy units have been funded through national capital, and I would be interested to know how the Minister thinks the Kendal cancer unit could and should be funded. I also ask for her support in allowing us to fast-track the procurement process for the unit, essentially to allow the NHS to run the service and to get on with the job, given that it is extremely unlikely, as with all units of this type, that a private provider would come forward. Of course, the new unit would also need staff, so I ask the Minister to work to front-load the recruitment process, given the need that we would have for nuclear physicists, radiographers and clinical oncologists.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/24">Now that the Government are, rightly, bringing forward public works as they seek to employ the wisdom of the great Liberal, John Maynard Keynes, to counter the economic downturn, may I encourage the Minister to do all in her power to bring the construction of the unit into being as soon as possible? With her support, I believe that it could be up and running by 2010, a time scale that the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, the primary care trusts and the local cancer network believe to be entirely feasible.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/25">On Saturday, I stood in the rain in Kendal town centre&mdash;it was slightly better than being involved in the marathon near Keswick&mdash;with a petition calling for the establishment of the unit. Despite abysmal weather, I was overwhelmed by the support of local people. Many of them shared personal testimonies with me, of relatives who gave up on treatment because of the journey times involved, and of how those relatives' last weeks were rendered all the more painful and dismal by soul-destroying, painful round trips of 100 miles or more. I also heard tales of the wonderful treatment that is provided at existing centres such as Preston, where my own mum was cared for. There was a strong desire for care to be provided as close to home as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.2/26">It is a great honour to speak on behalf of local health professionals, trust managers, patients and their families, and the whole community of south lakeland, and to make what I hope the Minister agrees is a considered and realistic bid for her support for a new cancer unit at Westmorland general hospital. The unit will save and extend lives. It will provide accessibility of care for patients throughout south Cumbria and new cause for hope and confidence in the future of our much-loved hospital in Kendal.</p>

	<p pid="b.291.0/1">May I say what an absolute pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Bercow? I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1923" name="Tim Farron">the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron)</phrase> on securing this debate. He has shown an acute interest in the welfare of his local health services and I commend the dedication with which he serves the needs of his constituents. I share his gratitude for the care that his family members received from the health service&mdash;it is a tribute to all health service staff and to the care and commitment that they show.</p>
	<p pid="b.291.0/2">I am pleased to hear that the local health community across Cumbria and north Lancashire is working on proposals to develop a new cancer unit in the region. Importantly, however, I also acknowledge that the plans are at a very early stage&mdash;the hon. Gentleman will be interested in how I develop the discussion on that. I understand that the relevant organisations are putting together a feasibility study to identify the service specification and to consider a number of care models. Once that is done, clarity will be gained on the specifics of the scheme, which will allow detailed and well considered plans to be put in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.291.0/3">It is right and proper that that initial scoping process and subsequent decision making be undertaken in a thorough and impartial manner, so that the local health community can ensure the most effective use of money, and so that it can be assured that it decides on the model of care that is best suited to the needs of the local population. Furthermore, I understand that the project structure has yet to be agreed and that a stakeholder group is in the process of being convened.</p>
	<p pid="b.291.0/4">A number of work streams have been identified, including the much-needed clinical pathways work force, business and financial planning, and estates and facilities. Those will inform the commissioners' service specification. However, I understand that preliminary plans by the Lancashire and South Cumbria Cancer Network suggest that the first satellite unit in the area should be commissioned between 2010 and 2012. I am advised that Cumbria PCT has identified cancer as one of the main priorities in its commissioning strategy, particularly because of the gap in life expectancy between those from the most affluent and the most deprived parts of the county. Its strategy includes initiatives to increase investment in cancer services, coupled with a radical reform of service delivery. That includes increasing the number of oncologists and radiotherapy treatments. The plan is that those services will be provided increasingly within the Cumbria area, in line with the &quot;closer to home&quot; strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.291.0/5">The hon. Gentleman has tabled an early-day motion on the proposed cancer unit for Kendal, and he is keen to see a clear way forward for funding. As I hope I have made clear, the plans are at too early a stage reasonably to give assurances on that. The next steps are for the local NHS to produce a strategic outline case, which must be agreed by all affected NHS organisations, and then an outline business case, which, in addition to being supported by local parties, must be approved by North West SHA, given the size of the scheme. There are no shortcuts around that, but there is no reason why work cannot start immediately.</p>
	<p pid="b.291.0/6">The purpose of the strategic outline case is to demonstrate that there is at least one feasible option for delivering the proposed scheme. The outline business case is required to explore several options, including &quot;do nothing or do minimum&quot;, and to choose a preferred option. It must show that a site capable of securing planning permission is available for the preferred option and, if it is not already owned by the NHS, that the owners are prepared to sell to it. It must also show that the proposed development is technically feasible on the chosen site, by means of an outline design; that it is affordable, given reasonable assumptions of activity funded under tariff; and that local NHS organisations support the preferred option.</p>
	<p pid="b.291.0/7">I understand that the proposals by the Lancashire and South Cumbria Cancer Network, as they stand, aim to meet recommendations made by the National Radiotherapy Advisory Group on travelling time for patients&mdash;the hon. Gentleman made a strong point on that&mdash;and access to services. In a visit to Preston last August, I was made aware that cancer patients in south Cumbria have to endure very long travelling times to access radiotherapy treatment. Within the very large geographical scope of University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, there is no radiotherapy provision. Patients must travel to Preston, which is more than 60 miles away. Oncologists and the very knowledgeable specialist nurses who are involved in this area of care made points about that to me on my visit. The advisory group has recognised that a maximum of 45 minutes' travel time for radiotherapy patients is good practice. It acknowledged that that might not be achievable in some areas of the country, and I am pleased to report that a survey of driving times revealed that 87 per cent. of the population already live within 45 minutes of a radiotherapy centre, and that Cumbria PCT is taking steps to achieve that aim for the local population.</p>
	<p pid="b.291.0/8">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-03">3 December 2007</phrase>, the Government launched the cancer reform strategy, which sets out plans further to improve and develop cancer services throughout England over the next five years. It includes measures to improve cancer prevention, speed up the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, reduce inequalities, improve the experience of people who live with or who are beyond cancer, and ensure that care is delivered in the most appropriate settings and that patients can access effective new treatments quickly.</p>
	<p pid="b.291.0/9">The December strategy sets out the fact that to achieve world-class radiotherapy services nationally, local investment is needed, both in equipment and work force. In addition, in line with the recommendations of the advisory group's report, the strategy recommends that local PCTs, with their cancer networks, review their local radiotherapy services to ensure that recommended levels of treatment activity are achieved. Cumbria PCT and the local cancer network are proactively addressing those issues, and should be commended for that.</p>
	<p pid="b.291.0/10">To support local clinical teams and commissioners as they review and develop radiotherapy services, the National Radiotherapy Advisory Group Implementation Group has been set up. The group is chaired by members of the Royal College of Radiology, and has representation from all appropriate royal colleges, other professional bodies, radiotherapy service managers and cancer networks. However, the location of new radiotherapy equipment or centres will remain a matter for local determination.</p>
	<p pid="b.291.0/11">Those plans and recommendations are in place to capitalise on the progress made in NHS cancer services over the past decade.</p>

	<p pid="b.293.0/1">I am encouraged to hear the Minister say that the location of centres such as the one that I have been talking about will be chosen locally. However, will she specify whether she is talking about the local primary care trusts in north Lancashire and Cumbria or the strategic health authority?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-29b.293.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1448" speakername="Ann Keen" colnum="293"  time="016:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081029/halltext/81029h0010.htm#08102933000513">
	<p pid="b.293.1/1">I am talking about both. We should always communicate with the strategic health authority and local PCTs when we are making changes of the nature that we envisage.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.1/2">I am pleased to advise that nationally, cancer mortality among people under the age of 75 fell by over 18 per cent. between 1996 and 2006, which amounts to 9,000 saved lives. Whenever I am asked to hold meetings on long-term conditions, I am pleased to say that many of them are on cancer. Cancer is no longer considered to be an acute, lethal diagnosis; it is a long-term condition. Many more patients are living longer and now require totally different services, such as those offered by specialist cancer nurses.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.1/3">Such a change is down to significant improvements in NHS cancer services. The improvements include extending breast screening to women aged up to 70, and significantly reducing waiting times for patients. The latest figures show that 99.9 per cent. of patients with suspected cancer were seen by a specialist within two weeks of a referral from their GP. There are now more cancer specialists. An extra 1,655 consultants have been employed in the NHS since 1997. We are going even further on cancer waits by extending the existing cancer waiting times targets to more patients. That will include extending the 31-day standard to cover all cancer treatments, not just the first, which will enable hospital specialists to place patients, where appropriate, on the 62-day treatment pathway.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.1/4">I know that the hon. Gentleman will continue to champion and support health services within his constituency, and I encourage him to engage with local organisations through the planning stages of the cancer centre in Kendal. I feel that he needs little encouragement because leadership is already being demonstrated. The past 10 years has seen real progress in cancer services nationally, and I hope that his proposals will make a real and tangible difference to the people of Kendal.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.1/5">The hon. Gentleman set me quite a challenge when he asked me to approve and fund the work force and have everything built by 2010. If I achieve that all by myself, a statue is more than required. I would not feel in the slightest bit embarrassed if a statue were erected. However, I feel that the challenge may be a little beyond my bounds. I end by saying to the hon. Gentleman, &quot;Trust me, I am a nurse.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.294.1/1">I am pleased to be having this debate under your capable chairmanship, Mr. Bercow.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.1/2">I welcome the new Minister to his post and to what I guess is his first debate on social enterprise. Knowing him and knowing how well briefed he will be, I will not need to define terms for him. The key and distinguishing factor of social enterprises is that they are profit-making businesses that are established to tackle social or environmental need. As he will discover, if he has not already, the social enterprise movement is extremely active and diverse, and encompasses organisations such as development trusts, community enterprises, co-operatives, housing associations, social funds and leisure trusts.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.1/3">Such businesses operate across an incredibly wide range of industries and sectors including health and social care, renewable energy, recycling and fair trade. They are also of all scales, from small operations to large international companies. They range from the small community social enterprise to the Divine chocolates of this world.</p>

	<p pid="b.294.3/1">I paused for the Division on the happy thought of Divine chocolate, which has seen me nicely through the Lobby, although some of the real stuff would have been better.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.3/2">I should declare an interest because, in the real world, before coming to this place, I was the chief executive of a housing association that had the twin aims of addressing housing need and tackling unemployment. I now chair the all-party group on social enterprises, and a black and minority ethnic-led social enterprise, eQuality Networks, which does a superb job, particularly in regeneration, community engagement and digital inclusion. That is my plug for today, although today's debate is a big plug for all social enterprise.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.3/3">Some would say that it is strange, at this time of global economic downturn, to be discussing how the Government might increase their support to social enterprises, but they are coming forward with some good measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises generally. My first plea, therefore, is to ask them to remember that many social enterprises are SMEs with a social purpose, and not to ignore them in any reference to assisting SMEs. Why is social enterprise scarcely mentioned in &quot;'Solutions for Business'&mdash;funded by government&quot;, the national package of publicly funded business support products announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-23">23 October</phrase>? In the package, social enterprise is mentioned only twice&mdash;once as a case study and once under the section describing who is eligible for one product.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.3/4">I am not here with a begging bowl for social enterprises. I want to raise with Government the undoubted fact that, at times when businesses face problems with liquidity and there is a prospect of them laying off staff, this sector is most likely to be fighting to retain staff. Social enterprises provide the jobs, skills, and services that are needed to hold the economy and communities together in times of crisis. They are also effective agents of social and economic resilience. Consequently, now is when we need our social enterprises the most, and supporting them will require a fraction of the resources being used to recapitalise major financial institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.3/5">There are several ways in which we can support social enterprises. First, the Government must recognise that SMEs are a priority when it comes to protecting the real economy and protecting hard-working people and communities from the effects of the downturn. Social enterprises, most of which are SMEs, have support needs that are distinct from those of mainstream businesses. Secondly, the role of social enterprises in maintaining services and jobs, especially in the communities that are most at risk, is even more important in the current economic climate. Some 85 per cent. of social enterprises recently surveyed by the Social Enterprise Coalition expected that the needs they serve, either social or environmental, will increase in the coming period.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.3/6">Thirdly, social enterprises have already developed skills, expertise and the trust of their communities, which should be utilised. Social capital is even more valuable when other capital is in short supply. Fourthly, social enterprise lenders are better than high street lenders at providing liquidity where it is most needed. In particular, CDFIs&mdash;community development finance institutions&mdash;and credit unions are among the few who have increased their lending to those who need finance most.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.3/7">Fifthly, social enterprises reinvest their profits in the business and for the benefit of the community. They have a strong local multiplier effect, stimulating local economic activity rather than capital flight.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.3/8">Sixthly, I believe that more attention should be given to supporting social enterprises that provide embedded employment solutions as the job market shrinks. That may include redefining what counts as &quot;results in payment by results contracts&quot; for employment services.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.3/9">Seventhly, employees taking ownership and converting failing private businesses into social enterprises is an opportunity to keep jobs, skills and productivity. Therefore, there is a need to join up some of the agendas of the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, or BERR, and the Department for Work and Pensions, or DWP&mdash;I give up on the acronyms&mdash;to support that activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.3/10">Finally, the Government really must get their act together and consider the leverage that they have through contracts, procurement and tendering, so that we can rapidly take advantage of the economic opportunities and provide a level playing field for social enterprise.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.3/11">I want to develop a few of those themes to see how the Government can take advantage of the new opportunities that I believe social enterprises bring in troubled economic times, in the process recognising their unique ability to stimulate local economies, particularly in the most deprived areas. As I said, we first need to take practical steps to ensure that the help that is in place for SMEs also clearly applies appropriately to social enterprises and that we monitor that such help is taking place effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.3/12">In a recent survey, late public service payments were cited as a problem for 37 per cent. of social enterprises, more than any other issue. So I believe that the Government need to provide details on the progress of their plans to extend the payment target to social enterprises and explain how social enterprises can hold to account those who do not meet that target.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.3/13">As I have mentioned before, the Government have also committed to supporting SMEs in these difficult times by providing free business health checks through Business Link, a service that I must say many social enterprises have had some mixed experiences with. I would like the Government to assure us that health checks will also include specialist advice that is appropriate for businesses with primarily social or environmental objectives and that that advice and those support services will be made accessible and promoted to social enterprises.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.3/14">The good news for the Minister is that, as I have mentioned, there is liquidity in the sector, which is vitally needed at this time. Social enterprise lenders such as credit unions and CDFIs are increasing their lending. They provide liquidity where it is most needed, often in areas where conventional finance markets have failed. They often support those who are most excluded from financial services and support those social enterprises that support the communities in greatest need. The Government need to recognise that while they continue to negotiate with high street lenders. Could the Government provide even more effective liquidity where it is most needed by channelling capital through social enterprise lenders such as CDFIs and credit unions? I therefore ask the Government to negotiate to encourage high street lenders to work with CDFIs and credit unions as trusted intermediaries to improve liquidity where it is needed most.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.3/15">The Government need to ensure that banks' commitments to the financial inclusion action plan 2007 are delivered soon. Those commitments included support for institutions such as credit unions, which provide services to the most excluded. The Government are already working with four high street lenders to access European Investment Bank funding. Will the Government support building a pool of social lenders, such as CDFIs and credit unions, to make a second-tier approach to the EIB?</p>
	<p pid="b.294.3/16">The Government also need to speed up the review of credit unions that is going through the Treasury to ease access to their services. Will the Government consider amending that review to include incorporated associations and corporate bodies, such as full credit union members, so that small and community organisations can access services?</p>
	<p pid="b.294.3/17">Another major area that the Government can address is that of larger-scale investment. Many social enterprises suffer from the fact that, beyond start-up, borrowing is a problem as major banks really do not &quot;get&quot; them, despite their excellent business plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.3/18">We urgently need to set up the social investment bank, using the estimated the &pound;2 billion worth of unclaimed assets, of which banks are being asked to stump up a mere &pound;400 million. At this moment, the Government have unprecedented leverage with major banks, but they must not allow the cries from banks about their own travails, which were largely self-made, to overshadow or delay social enterprise access to capital at the moment that it is most needed and in the areas where it is most needed. Right now, we need to grow social enterprise, maximise the triple bottom line effect and promote effectively our wish to see a diversity of public service delivery that is most appropriate.</p>

She talked about the need for a social investment bank, and I also welcome the initiative to encourage banks to look at dormant bank accounts and transfer capital from them to the voluntary sector and social enterprises. However, does she share my understanding that that is going to be a voluntary initiative on the part of the banks and, if that is the case, does she also share my view that there should be regular reviews in this place of the effectiveness of those proceedings and the voluntary arrangement?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-29b.297.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1698" speakername="Margaret Moran" colnum="297"  time="017:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081029/halltext/81029h0011.htm#08102933000517">
	<p pid="b.297.1/1">I certainly agree with that. However, my argument is rather stronger, in the sense that I think that the Government should be using their leverage in the current economic climate to ensure that the arrangement is more than voluntary and they should not allow themselves to be swayed by arguments to the contrary.</p>
	<p pid="b.297.1/2">The advantage of providing capital funding through a social investment bank is that most of the capital and most of the investment will come in the form of loans, so that we would be effectively recycling money to get maximum value. In a very sustainable way, therefore, such a bank will be able to grow the social enterprise sector and create new businesses in a continuous loop.</p>
	<p pid="b.297.1/3">I also believe that the Government need to use their leverage, particularly as they bring forward large-scale investment, as an opportunity to conduct smarter tendering and procurement, ensuring that social enterprises genuinely have a level playing field in tendering for contracts. Furthermore, I believe that the Government also have the opportunity to work with private enterprise, through corporate social responsibility schemes or whatever people like to call them, to demonstrate community gain via social enterprises as part of any public sector contract that has been tendered and won. For me, that would be the Government using smart leverage at a time when we are proud to say that the Government will step in to help when times get tough, so that we can demonstrate to ordinary folk in areas that need our help most that we are not just bailing out the big boys at the expense of the rest.</p>
	<p pid="b.297.1/4">Another area that needs to be addressed is employment. Social enterprises delivering employment services have contracts where payments are made according to results, which are defined as getting people into full-time paid employment. That model assumes a number of vacancies in the labour market that, frankly, is unlikely to be sustained in the current economic situation. The Government recognise the value of different activities, from volunteering right the way through to paid employment, and they recognise that volunteering both develops skills for jobseekers and benefits the community. However, volunteering is specifically not seen as an alternative to full-time paid employment. Social enterprises can effectively tackle unemployment, but they can also reinvest any surplus within the communities that they work in, which is the local multiplier effect that I referred to earlier. They can also create jobs for those people who are furthest from the labour market. Employee ownership can keep local business functioning and maintain levels of employment, but a narrow policy of addressing employment by delivering placements will not deliver the necessary job creation during this economic downturn. We therefore need the Government to review the employment service contracts definitions of &quot;results&quot; to include constructively engaged employment that benefits the community, such as volunteering.</p>
	<p pid="b.297.1/5">Will the Government develop a wider employment policy that recognises and includes job creation, investment in communities and employee ownership? Will the Government ensure that that includes all relevant Departments&mdash;the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Communities and Local Government and Her Majesty's Treasury? And why should we not use our employment budgets more imaginatively, for example, by giving folk the equivalent of six or so months' benefit up front to set up social enterprises with support? It could be the fastest and smartest way to get people back into work and to create new jobs, and it has been done elsewhere: some aspects of the co-operative movement in Spain are an imaginative way of creating and maintaining jobs in difficult economic circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.297.1/6">The Department for Work and Pensions has taken a more innovative approach to bidding for employment contracts, and the recent announcement of the introduction of the right to bid looks at ways in which we can develop more innovation in job creation, rather than what I would call the usual bums-on-seats approach of most employment schemes. As chair of EURIM, we are working with DWP civil servants to do a &quot;Dragon's Den&quot; to ensure that social enterprises bring forward the best ideas to enable us to innovate in the way that we look at employment contracts and job creation. Working with Futurebuilders will also help us to spot good investment opportunities. The Government could be more imaginative and inventive across the board and encourage enterprise in such ways&mdash;particularly enterprise that brings multiple benefits to those communities that the Government have done most to support.</p>
	<p pid="b.297.1/7">My final plea is to ensure that we look at what regional development agencies are doing in times of constrained budgets. In some areas, the support for social enterprise is, frankly, patchy, and we need a map of the gaps to show where social enterprise is not in good health or not being well developed. The resources to support social enterprise networks are distinctly patchy, and the Minister would be well advised to ask the regional Ministers to ensure that they give greater priority to the support of social enterprises. If we are serious about the agenda, particularly at the moment, we must recognise that social enterprise is identified as a significant business model that plays a major role in the UK economy. It is estimated that social enterprises contribute 1 per cent. to UK gross domestic product, which is not large, but it could be much greater. If we are really committed to the social enterprise agenda and to recognising the contribution to our communities and to employment, let us have a target whereby social enterprises contribute up to 5 per cent. of GDP. It is, I think, a modest aspiration.</p>
	<p pid="b.297.1/8">I hope that this debate gives the Minister some food for thought and demonstrates some areas where Government action could support social enterprises&mdash; supporting them to support local economies, local employment and local job solutions at a time when, I believe, we need social enterprise most.</p>

	<p pid="b.299.6/1">Thank you, Mr. Bercow, for clarifying that. I do apologise to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1698" name="Margaret Moran">the hon. Member for Luton, South (Margaret Moran)</phrase>, for no discourtesy was intended; it was just ignorance of procedure. I certainly do not want to eat into the Minister's time; I just wanted to congratulate the hon. Lady on her speech, support her pressure on the Government and place on the record the Conservative party's strong support for social enterprise and the voluntary sector generally. There is a strong cross-party consensus about the need at the moment to strengthen and support them&mdash;the hugely valuable people who are helping us to cure and to tackle some of the most stubborn social problems in the country, while generating wealth that stays in the community. It is an enormously important section of society that we want to encourage, and in our green paper we have set out some ideas on exactly how to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.6/2">I wanted to support the hon. Lady in pressing the Minister on two matters. First, like most small businesses, the current primary concern of social enterprises is cash flow and liquidity, so will the Minister be explicit in responding to the hon. Lady and place on the record what the Government are doing in their conversations with the high street banks to encourage them to work with organisations such as the community development finance institutions and credit unions to extend liquidity to that sector?</p>
	<p pid="b.299.6/3">Secondly, the hon. Lady was right to say that for social enterprises helping the Government get people back into work, payment by results, whereby &quot;results&quot; are defined as full-time employment opportunities, is now an extraordinarily difficult regime in which to work. Are the Government rethinking that definition to provide some scope for social enterprises to help people into situations where they may do some public good and benefit the community through voluntary opportunities, or is their mind still closed on the definition of results?</p>

	<p pid="b.300.0/1">It is, as ever, a great pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Bercow. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1698" name="Margaret Moran">the Member for Luton, South (Margaret Moran)</phrase> on securing the debate, her commitment to the cause and her contribution to today's debate. I thought it appropriate to allow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" name="Nick Hurd">the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)</phrase> to speak; we have not had a chance to cross swords or to joust properly in the House since he took his place on the Opposition Front Bench, and I congratulate him on his appointment. I shall make a few remarks at the outset, then try to deal with some of the points that my hon. Friend made. She made many points, and my time is limited, but I shall try to make some broader remarks, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/2">Social enterprise is certainly not a new subject for me, and neither it is for the Government nor for the party that makes up the Government. When I left university, I began my career as a volunteer in a social enterprise. We did not call it that in those days; I think we called it a community business. Eventually, I gained paid employment with that community business, organising volunteers as part of a social enterprise that produced a community newspaper and ran a small publishing company, some projects for unemployed people and a small community printing business.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/3">In the short time that I have been in this post, I have had the opportunity to meet several inspiring social entrepreneurs, which has taken me back to those early days. They have included Dai Powell at HCT, the Hackney community transport group, which, despite its name, is now a significant player in the bus industry, and Sam Conniff, at Livity in Brixton, where I had the opportunity to see his passion and energy for bringing young people into training and work experience, giving them the chance to produce their own magazine. So, I welcome the opportunity both to recognise the important contribution that social enterprises make to our society and economy, and to talk about why the Government value social enterprise and how we have supported and will continue to support it. First, however, I shall refer to some of the specific points that my hon. Friend made.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/4">My hon. Friend asked about improving liquidity by using negotiations with high street lenders to encourage them to work with community development finance institutions and credit unions. We have already secured a commitment from the banks participating in the recapitalisation scheme to maintain the availability of lending and marketing at 2007 levels, and Government support for the banking system is tied to conditions. We have made it absolutely clear that there will need to be a strong focus on making available lending for small businesses, including social enterprises. Additionally, we have created a small business finance forum, again including social enterprises, to ensure that business and lenders meet regularly. We want to build on sustainable working between mainstream lenders and CDFIs.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/5">My hon. Friend also asked about the Government's ensuring that the banks' commitments in the financial inclusion action plan of 2007&mdash;to support institutions that provide services to the most excluded, such as credit unions&mdash;are delivered soon. I can tell her that banks have committed to support third sector affordable credit, including through action to develop new provision in the 25 high-priority areas identified by the financial inclusion taskforce.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/6">My hon. Friend asked me about building a pool of social lenders, and Government support for that in relation to CDFIs and credit unions. The Government are working with the European Investment Bank to see how it can help other smaller lending institutions to access its funds. I am sure that I can provide her with more detail if she would like, in respect of her role as chair of the relevant all-party group. She also asked me about speeding up the review of credit unions that is going through the Treasury. We are making good progress with our proposals for legislative reform regarding credit unions, and the Treasury is collating and analysing the responses to the consultation. I am pleased to tell her that we hope it will be able to publish a summary, along with the implementing orders, next month, so I hope she will agree that there has been good progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/7">My hon. Friend asked about payments from the Government. The Department that I shall call &quot;BERR&quot;, given that she did, is taking the lead on prompt payment across Government, including measures to address transparency and consistency of payment processes, as well as the issue of speed. We have been delighted by the response from business&mdash;again, including social enterprises&mdash;to our commitment on prompt payment. Others have followed suit, including the Scottish Executive and regional development agencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/8">I was also asked about ensuring that health checks will include specialist advice appropriate for social enterprises. I can confirm to my hon. Friend that they are available to all businesses, regardless of their size, including social enterprises. Health checks will be promoted to all business by local Business Link providers, and I will certainly ensure that that includes social enterprises. She also asked about the references to social enterprises in the &quot;Solutions for Business&mdash;funded by Government&quot; package. I can confirm that all the business support products outlined in &quot;Solutions for Business&quot; are available to social enterprises, and I put that clearly on the record for her. In addition, the Office of the Third Sector and BERR are working together to improve advisers' understanding of the needs of social enterprise, and we are investing &pound;6 million over the next four years to support that.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/9">My hon. Friend referred to the Social Investment Bank and the funding from the unclaimed assets Bill. The Commission on Unclaimed Assets recommended that a minimum of &pound;250 million should be made available for social investment out of the unclaimed assets. We must ensure that there is no infringement of state aid in doing that, but once the Bill has passed, funds will be agreed. The role will be to act as a wholesaler to try to capitalise the entire third sector, including social enterprises.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/10">Finally, my hon. Friend asked about regional development agencies. Some &pound;6 million has been provided to RDAs for Business Link, specifically for social enterprise support, and &pound;6 million has been provided to capacity builders, which is also available to social enterprises. The Office of the Third Sector is visiting all regional development agencies to assess the impact of funding, which is strong in some areas, such as the north-east.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/11">In the remaining time I would like to make a few more general remarks, perhaps leaving out some of the detail that I was going to refer to. We are facing tough times, economically and environmentally. I recognise that and I think that everybody in the country is aware of it. However, I believe that in the new age of responsibility that we are entering, people are looking for the assurance that businesses will act ethically, act in a sustainable fashion and be reliable and trustworthy. That makes social enterprise more relevant than ever. Social enterprises, like any other businesses, will face huge challenges in the current economic climate, but equally, there are real opportunities for them, as my hon. Friend indicated. People are increasingly looking to buy from and invest in businesses that have strong social and environmental values, and social enterprises are well placed to meet that demand. Those with strong business models&mdash;they are enterprises, after all&mdash;will be well placed to survive the current economic situation and may even be able to step in, as my hon. Friend said, if the private sector is unable to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/12">So why do the Government value social enterprise, particularly now? Why is it important? At its best, social enterprise can transform communities and improve people's lives for the better. I have seen that in a practical way in my own city of Cardiff. The Pack-IT social enterprise, which has been in business for 20 years or more, does a wonderful job creating employment for the most disadvantaged. Last week, I gave out awards at Fyndoune community college, which was the winner of the socially enterprising schools award. I was proud to present it with that award. I was also able to present awards to the Wise Group, which, particularly in Glasgow, has for more than 25 years provided meaningful employment to people who would otherwise be excluded.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/13">When I visited Hackney community transport, I met people such as Nadia, who has been trained as a bus driver, and all the other wonderful women who have been trained as bus drivers by that organisation. It is an inspiring example of social enterprise in action. I was delighted to be interviewed at Livity in Brixton by Bianca, who has been through the training programme there and is now working as a journalist. That is a result of the work being done by that wonderful social enterprise in Brixton.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/14">Social enterprises can set high standards in ethical markets, and they can raise corporate social responsibility. In some ways, corporate social responsibility is the new bottom line in this age of responsibility. That is the special flavour that social enterprise brings to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/15">I do not have time to go through all the Government's initiatives, as I have tried to answer my hon. Friend's questions.</p>

	<p pid="b.302.1/2">There has been a step change in the past 10 years in the way that social enterprises are valued and understood. This Government have led that change and will continue to do so because we have supported social enterprise for more than 100 years through our relationship with the co-operative movement. We need a robust evidence base of the impact of social enterprises, so we are starting work on a project to measure social value, and last week I was able to launch a third sector research centre at Birmingham university. It will have a distinct work stream on social enterprise.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/3">Whenever I visit social enterprises, they reinforce my belief, which is shared powerfully by the Prime Minister and the rest of the Government, that social enterprise can really help to make this a fairer country. For this Government, social enterprise is not a one-night stand but a long-term commitment. We will continue to promote and nurture social enterprise because the values that drive social entrepreneurs are our core values. Like them, we believe that economic prosperity and social justice are two sides of the same coin. Those values are more relevant than ever at this time of economic upheaval.</p>
