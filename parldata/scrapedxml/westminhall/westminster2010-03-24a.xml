	<p pid="a.71.1/1">I agree wholeheartedly with my hon. Friend. I will touch on some of his points as my speech develops.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/2">There is little merit in apportioning blame for the PMS's difficulties. Last month, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-18">18 February</phrase>, the Treasury Committee, chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1972" name="John McFall">the right hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire (John McFall)</phrase>, published a report entitled, &quot;The failure of the Presbyterian Mutual Society&quot;. Although I welcome the fact that the report highlighted that many people are still suffering, I feel that it entered the territory of who was to blame for the crisis, without finding any solutions. The questions posed when the Chair spoke at Stormont might have added to the debate and, indeed, such finger pointing might have momentarily given a grain of comfort to those who are hurting most. However, the report was disappointing, because it contributed nothing in terms of the real positive solutions that are necessary. That is exactly what I want this debate to touch on today: the positive solutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/3">During this morning's debate, I will not be distracted by a blame-game attitude. I will strain every muscle to focus every effort on seeking a quick and genuine resolution to the issue. We must all vigorously pursue such a resolution, so that we can alleviate the distress and hardship that are genuinely being experienced by these savers, many of whom have been caught in the valley of despair. Many ordinary PMS savers are asking how we have got into this situation, and it can be rightly acknowledged that many factors were at play, including the downturn in the property market and the instability of the UK's established financial institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/4">Again, I stress that we need to find a solution for those people who have been affected by the difficulties, rather than simply blaming those at fault. I have no doubt whatsoever that the matter of who is to blame will be a challenge for another day, but it is not something to be considered now. We must recognise the impact that the crisis is having on thousands of savers who lodged money in the PMS. We, as politicians in Northern Ireland, have received hundreds of letters from distressed savers who cannot afford to pay the fees of old peoples' homes, their children's university tuition fees or the tax bills incurred by selling off property and lodging money in the society until they purchased their new home.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-24a.72.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1376" speakername="William McCrea" colnum="72"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100324/halltext/100324h0001.htm#10032437000483">
	<p pid="a.72.3/1">I wholeheartedly agree and thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. I have major concerns that yesterday's announcement will only put many of the smaller savers into deeper despair. Unfortunately, in February this year, the High Court in Belfast made a ruling that investors with less than &#163;20,000 could not be considered creditors of the PMS and therefore could not share the &#163;20 million of income that the society has generated since it went into administration. We need Government action to resolve the issue, so that all who placed money in the PMS-both small and large savers-can get their money back.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/2">I am not suggesting that nothing has been happening to take the issue forward. I know that the First and Deputy First Ministers have had meetings with the Prime Minister and Treasury officials on several occasions. In addition, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" name="Sammy Wilson">the Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase>, the Minister for Finance and Personnel in the devolved Administration, and Mrs. Arlene Foster, the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, have been actively engaged in these negotiations. I pay special tribute to them for that. However, the bottom line is that my constituents are still without their much needed money-indeed, the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1693" name="Gregory Campbell">the Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell)</phrase> showed how much that money is needed and how people are hurting.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/3">Some people have been credited with talking a good talk on the issue, and have gleefully pointed the finger at others while stating that others have all the responsibility to resolve the matter. However, we all carry a responsibility to use our best efforts to bring about a solution. The Moderator-and, indeed, the past Moderator-of the Presbyterian Church in Northern Ireland can confirm that I, as the Chief Whip of the Democratic Unionist party, have hosted with my right hon. and hon. Friends a number of meetings to discuss the in-depth issues that are pressing their congregational members. Indeed, I have made a further request with the Prime Minister's office for a meeting with the moderator.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/4">In June 2009, the Government set up a ministerial working group to deal with the issue. The group was comprised of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Minister for Finance and Personnel, the Northern Ireland Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the First and Deputy First Ministers of Northern Ireland. Much work has been done and continues to be done behind the scenes to find a satisfactory resolution to the matter for those who have lost money through the PMS. However, it is vital-indeed, imperative-that the Government here in Westminster, together with the local Administration in Northern Ireland, redouble those efforts and work to find a resolution to the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/5">Savers with the PMS have waited too long; they need assistance from the Government on the matter. We have already seen our Government help to protect the interests of those who have money saved in the Icelandic banks. Is it too much to ask for the Government to help savers who have money saved in Northern Ireland? The PMS is not simply a Northern Ireland issue any more than Dunfermline was simply a Scottish issue. Only a UK solution is fair and equitable.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/6">One might well ask what the rationale was for what is believed to be the Treasury view that the Northern Ireland Executive and the Presbyterian Church should contribute to a hardship fund. That is only necessary because the Government have failed to treat PMS members like other savers in other failed financial institutions. Why were the Scottish Executive not required to contribute to the rescue of the failed institutions within their jurisdiction? I am sure that the Treasury is aware that the only resources available to the Presbyterian Church are those contributed every Sunday by the people in the pews. Is it not wholly unfair that the community that has been directly hit by the failures of the PMS should be required to pay in part for the rescue?</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/7">The PMS was a completely autonomous institution over which the Church had no control, and its failure was a local manifestation of a general failure of the UK financial sector. Do the Government realise the huge sense of injustice and unfairness that the handling of the PMS issue has generated? We are talking about thrifty, decent and hard-working people who had every reason to believe that they were ordinary savers. They believe that they have been singled out for discriminatory treatment by the Government, who have shown little regard for the dire consequences of what they have failed to do. My constituents genuinely feel that the Government have not seriously addressed the arguments put forward in support of their case by the PMS lobby group.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/8">The reality of the situation is that for eight months after the PMS collapsed, London displayed a lack of interest. Although I appreciate that the ministerial working group and supporting officials have been working closely with the administrator to seek a commercial resolution to the winding-up of the PMS and are considering other alternatives to assist PMS savers before reporting to the Prime Minister when they conclude their deliberations, the savers are the only ones in the UK who have been denied access to their savings during the most severe period of the recession.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/9">In the Minister's opinion, is the idea of facilitating a commercial solution still a viable and practical option that is being followed seriously? I have been asked whether a commercial solution for the PMS would be facilitated if, as was done in some other cases, the riskiest assets were removed for separate, bad bank-style treatment. Did the Treasury consider such a move and feature it in any discussion with the financial sector? If not, is that not another example of the lack of innovative thinking in tackling the matter, compared to the resourcefulness and urgency shown in the rescue of other failed financial institutions?</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/10">It is also fair to say that as recently as <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-03">3 March</phrase> the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee that a commercial solution was the best solution. What role has the Treasury, which is the lead Department for the financial sector, played in seeking to interest a bank in absorbing the PMS assets and liabilities? How many meetings did the Treasury have with the financial sector on the PMS and what kind of support did it offer? Perhaps the answers to those questions would give concrete evidence of the significant action taken by the Treasury and the Westminster Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/11">Perhaps I should also touch on the question of culpability. Reference is sometimes made to the culpability of the PMS for the misfortune of its members, but the same could be said of other failed institutions and the culpability of their boards, managements, advisors and auditors. The crucial point that I want to make in response is that none of the savers in any of those institutions was allowed to suffer as a result. The Government's declared aim throughout was to protect the innocent victims of the economic and financial crisis. Surely their treatment of the PMS savers must stand out in sharp contrast as the exception. Indeed, the Government go even further and find the PMS savers themselves culpable for not appreciating, as the Government continue to assert, that they were not savers at all, but investors. I resolutely challenge that contention.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/12">I appreciate that many other Members want to speak in this important debate, but before concluding I will ask the Economic Secretary a further question. Does he subscribe to the view expressed by a Treasury official to a visiting delegation that a major reason for the PMS not being treated in the same way as other failed financial institutions was that, unlike them, it posed no systemic risk to the economy? In other words, the others were too big to be allowed to fail, whereas 10,000 savers in Northern Ireland are expendable. Does he not agree that that is a shameful and deeply offensive comment that fully justifies the suspicion that the Government never intended to include PMS savers within their boast that</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/13" class="indent">&quot;no saver has lost money as a result of the economic and financial crisis&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/14">We all believe that we must do something, but time is running out. Possibilities seem to be getting limited, but one possibility that is not acceptable to my constituents and, I believe, those of my right hon. and hon. Friends, is for those honourable people to be left stranded. Reams have been written on the subject and column inches thick with suggestions have been recorded by the wise and the good, but a resolution is still not a reality. I hope that in the debate we will get cross-party support on the matter. I urge Members to encourage the Government to redouble their efforts to find a solution to that urgent and important matter. I tell the Minister to be innovative and bold, to take the lead and to make his name for the good people of Northern Ireland.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-24a.78.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1400" speakername="Peter Robinson" colnum="78"  time="010:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100324/halltext/100324h0002.htm#10032437000485">
	<p pid="a.78.0/1">It is an honour today, as it always has been, to serve under your chairmanship, Sir Nicholas. We have always appreciated the extensive interest that you have taken in the affairs of Northern Ireland, and you will be greatly missed by this House, not least for the authority and command that you have exercised. The House is to lose one of its star performers. We very much appreciate the role that you have played and your interest in the affairs of our Province.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/2">I have no direct interest to declare, as I am neither a Presbyterian nor a saver, anywhere, but I should at least declare my membership of the Prime Minister's ministerial working group. The working group was not set up as the result of any call made in the House of Commons. I was present at the meeting when the group was put together; I was present when its terms were agreed; and I was present when the statement was agreed on its being set up in direct response to a request made by the Deputy First Minister and myself. The Prime Minister readily made that response because he accepted that there was a &quot;moral obligation&quot;-that was the term that he used-on the Government to assist the savers of the Presbyterian mutual society. He did not use the term &quot;savers&quot;-that has always been my term. He prefers &quot;investors&quot;, but we have already heard the challenges to the use of that term.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/3">Like others, I do not want to involve myself in a blame game, nor do I want to make claims about how we might move forward. It is clear to me that the problems faced by the PMS arise directly from the fact that the Treasury restricted the guarantees if offered to financial institutions to those that were authorised by the Financial Services Authority. There is a special set of circumstances in relation to the PMS which I believe should have been taken into account. The society should have been covered by that umbrella, but it was not, which led to a run on the liquid assets of the PMS as soon as it was discovered that guarantees were available in other banks. People started to move money across and pressure came on the PMS, with the consequences about which we are all aware.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/4">I have constituents who are facing real hardship as a result of their circumstances, just as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1376" name="William McCrea">the Member for South Antrim (Dr. McCrea)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1589" name="Mark Durkan">the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)</phrase> outlined. I have a constituent who is in precisely the circumstances outlined by the hon. Member for Foyle: they were seriously injured in a car accident and received a compensation payment, which was placed in the PMS, but they cannot get access to the funds for their care and are having to rely on family members to provide them with help, enabling them to mark time until the moment when the problem is resolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/5">There are four ways forward. One of them, which in my view should not be entertained, would be to allow events to take their course and allow someone to go to the courts and force the administrator to have the fire sale that my hon. Friend the Member for South Antrim spoke of. That would be the worst set of circumstances. I suspect that that course of action would lead to most, if not all, of those who have lent money receiving their funds back, but all those who have less than &#163;20,000 probably not getting anything back. That would lead to considerable hardship on the part of those who need the funds most of all.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/6">The next option is to set up a hardship fund, which would allow the previous option play out, but ensure that help was available to those in the greatest difficulty. That would have limited appeal. It might take away some of the pain, but it would take a very long time for the administrator to work through his end of the problem, it would probably be several years before the fire sale took place, and it would take considerable time for the hardship fund to be put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/7">The next option is for assistance to be given for an orderly run-down of the affairs of the mutual society. All of us recognise that the administrator has indicated that we are not dealing with a society that is holding on to toxic assets. The fact that it was said that, recently, lenders were given 12 pence in the pound because funds of more than &#163;20 million were available to the administrator to disburse indicates that funds are coming in to the mutual society. Its assets are solid and strong. It is the problem with the property market that gives the greatest difficulty to the administrator. Given time for the property market to recover, I believe, on the basis of what the administrator has indicated, that it will be possible for the administrator to be able to recover the funds not only of the lenders, but of those who would be described as shareholders-those with less than &#163;20,000 saved.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/8">That option should be seriously considered, but only if there is no commercial option available-that is, no banking option. That is much the best option open to the society. All of us recognise that, the longer we go without someone stepping forward and indicating that they are prepared to take over responsibility for the society, the more likely it is that we will have to consider other alternatives. I understand that a commercial interest is still looking at the society's affairs and carrying out due diligence, so there is a strong possibility that something may come from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/9">The Deputy First Minister and I have been considering this matter for a long time with our colleagues, including the Finance Minister and the DETI Minister. I say to the hon. Member for Foyle that those people happen to be members of my party, but their portfolios and their ministerial responsibilities bring them together with the Deputy First Minister, who, in spite of the fact that he can, like myself, say that he is neither a Presbyterian nor a saver in the PMS, has shown an interest and has attempted at all times to be helpful in this matter. We are agreed on a proposition that we have put to the Treasury. It would be a fall-back position-an option to be picked up if it is not possible to move ahead with a commercial proposition. It would require the support of the Executive and the Assembly, and changes to Assembly legislation would be required to bring it about.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/10">The real problem is timing. The more I speak to savers with the PMS, the more I realise that this affair cannot go on until the next Government are in place. It has to be brought to a head and dealt with now. This Administration have the detailed knowledge of the issues involved. On behalf of all those who have been involved with the ministerial working group, I want to put on the record our appreciation of the work done by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, who has at all times been helpful and has been prepared to extend himself to see if a solution can be found. I trust that, working closely with the Northern Ireland Executive, we can within days, and certainly within a few weeks, allow some hope to be expressed tangibly to those who have funds locked in the PMS.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/11">All of us know about the difficulties being experienced by people in our constituencies, including those whose money is in the PMS for the purposes of funeral expenses. I cannot overstate the extent to which the thought that their funds will not be available in such circumstances causes anxiety and concern to elderly people who are without other means. Businesses have funds locked in the PMS, as do churches, whose building programmes have ground to a standstill because funds cannot be realised as a result of the present difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/12">I urge the Minister to look favourably on the solutions and to assist in whatever way he can any commercial interest that is still sitting there, so that this matter can quickly be resolved.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.2/1">As well as congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1376" name="William McCrea">the hon. Member for South Antrim (Dr. McCrea)</phrase> on securing this debate, I join others in congratulating you, Sir Nicholas, on your esteemed career in this House, not only as a friend of Northern Ireland, but-dare I say it?-as a loyal friend to Northern Ireland. You were a great help to me when I was a young-<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I thought that that would raise a reaction-first-time MP. I thank you for your help and guidance over the past five years, and I wish you and your wife well for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/2">The Presbyterian mutual society is an issue that has hung like a dark cloud over our Province for far too long. My constituency has been steeped in Presbyterianism for many hundreds of years. Indeed, the current moderator, who is with us for this debate, lives there. I pay tribute to him for his tireless efforts in trying to resolve the problem for his congregations. I also pay tribute to his predecessor.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/3">The prolonged crisis of the Presbyterian mutual society has many complex and technical aspects, but above all we must never forget the severe impact on ordinary, decent people. Suddenly, in October 2008, as a result of a dramatic run on its resources, caused by the Government's decision to guarantee deposits in conventional banks, the PMS collapsed and savers were plunged into a nightmare. Not surprisingly, they were consumed by panic and despair. If words could solve the problem, it would have been sorted a long time ago. We have had numerous debates and questions in the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the matter was debated again as recently as Tuesday last week, but words are not enough; we need action. My party has worked tirelessly to try to achieve a satisfactory outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/4">When the news broke, we took immediate action to try to create some stability, and to allow room for a solution to be found. Following an approach by the directors of the PMS, my party colleague, Arlene Foster, the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, made an order under insolvency legislation to give the society the option of going into administration. That prevented an immediate sale of the assets belonging to the society and provided an opportunity for an administrator to manage its affairs with a view to safeguarding its assets and funds, and preserving the interests of its members.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/5">The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment has worked tirelessly, as have the First Minister, who is with us today, and the Minister of Finance, to bring the crisis to a satisfactory conclusion. The PMS working group was set up as a result of pressure from my party and it continues to work for a resolution. With my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1693" name="Gregory Campbell">the Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell)</phrase>, I sit on the Assembly's Select Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and the matter is regularly raised. I also sit on the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs at Westminster, with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1551" name="Lady Hermon">the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon)</phrase>, and again the matter is raised regularly, because we know the difficulties that many savers are going through. We continue to lobby hard on behalf of investors.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/6">I was disappointed by the recent court ruling, which indicated that savers who had deposited &#163;20,000 or less could not be classed as creditors and therefore would not be entitled to a share of any of the &#163;20 million income generated by the PMS since it went into administration. I, for one, certainly see considerable merit in the idea of a bank-based rescue plan, and I look forward to hearing what the Minister says about that commercial route.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/7">Last month's report from the House of Commons Select Committee on the Treasury has not helped. Instead of suggesting a solution, it seemed more concerned to pass the buck by blaming Stormont, particularly the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. We want a resolution.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.1/1">I do not think that the number of meetings should be seen as a reflection of progress. I have met the moderator and representatives of the PMS and I have had discussions with officials. As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, the working group is chaired by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. I sit on the group, and other members include the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Minister of Finance and Personnel, the Northern Ireland Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1400" name="Peter Robinson">the right hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/2">As the First Minister said in his helpful contribution to the debate, and as he has said on other occasions, a range of options is under consideration. One is a commercial solution, which would see another financial institution involved in the PMS's portfolio of assets and liabilities. While I recognise that that is the preferred solution for people in Northern Ireland, the fact that a commercial organisation has not so far come forward leads me to conclude that this option is starting to look more unlikely, although it is still being discussed. Clearly, as hon. Members will understand, discussions with commercial institutions must remain confidential.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/3">The Northern Ireland Executive have taken the lead in exploring the possible options, commercial and otherwise, and it is right for them to do so, because the legislation governing IPSs in Northern Ireland is a devolved matter. We need properly to take into account all the issues when working with the Northern Ireland Executive, to see whether we can come up with a solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/4">The right hon. Member for Belfast, East mentioned the other options that need to be considered, and there have been discussions about a Northern Ireland solution. A hardship fund for the hardest hit is also being actively looked at. We have reached a stage where, within a short period, the working group can, I hope, produce a report to go to the Prime Minister. There is a basis on which a solution can be found.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-24a.99.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1953" speakername="Hugh Bayley" colnum="99"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100324/halltext/100324h0005.htm#10032437000527">
	<p pid="a.99.2/1">Today's debate gives us an opportunity to discuss the Africa all-party group's latest report, &quot;Land in Zimbabwe: Past Mistakes, Future Prospects&quot;. I begin by declaring an interest: the Royal African Society seconds a member of its staff, Alex O'Donoghue, to work three days a week for the all-party group, and I sponsor her parliamentary pass.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/2">I thank colleagues from all parties and from both Houses of Parliament who have contributed to the report. I also thank Alex O'Donoghue for her work in collecting the evidence and setting up our oral evidence sessions. Finally, I thank the Secretary of State for International Development for considering our report and its conclusions, and for responding, on behalf of his Department and the Foreign Office, to those conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/3">Our all-party group chose to investigate this subject because it is a pivotal and emotive issue in Zimbabwe. The violence from farm invasions has destroyed the livelihoods of 200,000 farm workers and halved the commercial agricultural output of Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's current land reform policy is a barrier to both the county's economic recovery and its longer term development.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/4">We also decided to address this subject because of our concern that UK policy is misunderstood in Africa. Many Africans, particularly those from southern Africa, believe that the UK promised to fund land reform in Zimbabwe as part of the deal made 30 years ago at the Lancaster house talks, which brought to an end the illegal unilateral declaration of independence by the white settler regime in Zimbabwe. Furthermore, many in Africa believe that we oppose farm invasions in Zimbabwe principally because it is white farmers whose land is being expropriated, and many believe that we support the European Union's restrictive measures-often referred to as sanctions-because we have political differences with the President of Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/5">I do not believe that any of those views are right or true. For example, the EU's restrictive measures ban arm sales to Zimbabwe because of the human rights violations that the armed forces in that country have committed against civilians. Those measures also freeze the assets of 203 individual members of ZANU-PF, which until recently was the sole ruling party in Zimbabwe, and of 40 parastatal companies. Those assets abroad have been frozen because of the real fear that Government or state property from Zimbabwe was being taken out of the country and used for personal benefit, rather than for the benefit of Zimbabwe's people.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/6">I must say, however, that sometimes the comments made by Members of this House about land invasions in Zimbabwe reinforce the belief that our concern is based principally on kith and kin. I do not believe that that is the case. Addressing that concern was one of the reasons why the all-party group decided to write our report.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.0/1">I should declare an interest, as my nephew is a Zimbabwean who has been evicted from farmland.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/2">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the change in process that led to the collapse in productive capacity. One of the biggest underlying problems it is that, because the process does not give legal title to the new owners and the transfer has no proper legal underpinning, the new owners have no means of investing in the farms. We therefore need to bring back legal stability and a proper legal process to land ownership in countries such as Zimbabwe, to enable investment for the future so that productive capacity can be restored.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.3/1">With the hon. Gentleman's support, I am damned sure that the Bill will go through. I believe it will make a real difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/2">In 2001, the law on bribery in the UK was changed to make explicit for the first time that transnational bribes made by British citizens or companies were contrary to law. That meant that the UK complied with the requirements of the OECD convention on bribery. However, it was not an effective law in terms of bringing cases before the courts. A few cases have been brought recently by the Serious Fraud Office, with convictions being secured through the courts or civil penalties being paid by companies in breach of the law. If the Bribery Bill becomes law, it will significantly strengthen the powers of the Government and help to prevent bad apples from the UK fuelling corruption abroad.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-24a.124.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" speakername="Tony Lloyd" colnum="124"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100324/halltext/100324h0009.htm#10032437000567">
	<p pid="a.124.0/1">Let me begin by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> on securing this timely debate. When I reminded him that the integrated transport authority had not bothered to consult Members of Parliament in its wider consultation, that was not a matter of vindictiveness on my part. Together with some of my local councillors, I will go to see the chair of that body on Friday, so the debate is timely in that sense and it is helpful to concentrate people's minds on the exchange that will take place later this week.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/2">I share my hon. Friend's unease. We all agree that in Manchester in particular, and for bus transport in general, the idea of a modal shift and getting people out of their cars and on to buses is right and proper. Improving the quality of the bus travelling experience is important as part of that process, and where possible, part of that means taking buses out of congested zones and helping them to move more quickly. That makes a lot of sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/3">In Manchester the concept of the bus corridor attempts to tick a box. For virtually all my life and that of my hon. Friend, Manchester has been a city with its north and south broken apart. Integrating transport systems to give proper through transit is a good idea, and I concede that that concept has merit. However, the specifics of this scheme are difficult in two ways. First, it is not certain that it will make the difference that we are told it is intended to make. Secondly, if the scheme makes a difference, under the law of unintended consequences, improving the lot of some will have a potentially serious and deleterious impact on the lives of others. Those who will experience the downside of the scheme are more likely to live in my constituency and that of my hon. Friend, because our constituencies are at the centre of the conurbation. Of course, if we see the affluent suburbs of Greater Manchester shifted into bus transportation that will be a good thing, but not if the cost is borne by our inner-city constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/4">My hon. Friend concentrated his remarks on the north of the city, but I want to mention the route through the Wilmslow Road and Oxford Road corridor that comes in from the south of the city. It is probably one of the most bussed routes in this country; there might be parts of London that can out-bus it, but there is nothing in the north of England. It is the student corridor, and a huge number of buses go up and down that route.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/5">The present proposal is for everything to be de facto pedestrianised, except the public transport systems. The Oxford Road corridor goes through the university area of the city, which is a heavily congested part of the road system in the morning, so the concept makes a degree of sense. The problem is what happens to the traffic that is displaced from that corridor. The planners told me that in their view, traffic will simply disappear long before it hits the central part of the city, and people will find other ways into the city leading to a reduction in car transport. However, the models are frankly bizarre and perverse. I was shown what was described as the industry model. I do not say this boastfully, but many years ago I used to be a statistician so I probably know a little about mathematical modelling. I know that the old concept in life, &quot;Garbage in, garbage out,&quot; applies to mathematical and road transport models just as it applies to everything else. If we do not provide the proper parameters on the way in, we do not get the results coming out.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/6">One bizarre thing that the model showed me was how traffic coming in from the south of the city in the morning-this will mean something to local people; I do not expect my right hon. Friend the Minister to follow it in detail-would turn right past Manchester Royal infirmary and then turn right again as it passed the infirmary, which would take it back out south of the city. No one going into the city in the morning chooses to joyride and hit the congestion zone simply to go out of the city again at that point, or at least if they do, they are crazy, and there cannot be too many people in Greater Manchester who are crazy enough to want to do that. Therefore the model, of itself, did not fill me with confidence that the modellers knew what they were doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/7">I am concerned that there will be a displacement factor and that the displacement will move the traffic that currently uses the Wilmslow Road and Oxford Road corridor on to, in particular, the Lloyd Street corridor in Moss Side. That road has a number of secondary and primary schools. It is a residential part of the city. When the planners said to me that they wanted a reduction in the accident rate because some students are injured in accidents on the Oxford Road corridor, which is a serious point, I said that we do not advantage things if we reduce accident rates for students and simply move the problem on to younger people and young children on a road a little way away as we move the traffic past those schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/8">The point that I want to establish for the Minister is that the modelling has not been convincing. When I challenged those putting the case, they were not convincing in their response. That is the first point. The second point is that in a system such as the one that we are discussing, there may be a benefit, but we must ensure that there are not disbenefits that are sufficiently large or sufficiently concentrated to outweigh it, at least for those local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/9">There is another part of my constituency where there will be other traffic flows. I am referring to Upper Brook street and the fact that there is already the disadvantage that some of my constituents are cut off from the university area. I want to see that situation made better, not worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/10">My final point is that significant public moneys will be put into the scheme. We need to know that it has been robustly tested so that the costs are acceptable to those who will bear them, that the benefits are real and that the cost-benefit in total is worth having, but that case has not yet been made.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-24a.129.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2036" speakername="Andrew Pelling" colnum="129"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100324/halltext/100324h0010.htm#10032437000569">
	<p pid="a.129.1/1">It is a great pleasure, Mrs. Dean, to serve under your chairmanship. I thank the Minister for taking time out of his busy diary to respond to this debate. I am pleased to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1786" name="Andrew Rosindell">the hon. Member for Romford (Andrew Rosindell)</phrase> here, as he has done so much on this matter with his private Member's Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/2">It is very much within the context of the Government's planning for Her Majesty's diamond jubilee that I believe we should have a festival of Britain, and I am keen to push the idea to the Minister. Indeed, I have raised the subject before in the main Chamber, and I was most grateful for his response; the idea of that happening in conjunction with Her Majesty's diamond jubilee was something that he welcomed as having an excellent socialist genus.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/3">I believe that we have the opportunity to hold a year-long festival of Britain, with the Olympic games being a dramatic crescendo. I would like particularly to thank Mr. Malcolm Felberg, who took the effort to lobby me on the idea; he is a constituent of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" name="Malcolm Wicks">the right hon. Member for Croydon, North (Malcolm Wicks)</phrase>. It would give us the opportunity, in line with the Government's approach, to have activities taking place in villages, towns and cities across the country, perhaps avoiding some of the pitfalls of the grands projets that sometimes come with such occasions.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/4">It has been the style and approach of the Government to give good notice of the jubilee week. It is testament to the way in which the Government are listening to proposals that nothing is cast in stone at this stage. However, a good deal of planning would be necessary. I believe that it would be right to have some activity on the south bank, and I am grateful for the local and regional media's interest today in the idea of having a 1951-style festival. It would be most apposite, given the First Secretary of State's antecedents and his grandfather's involvement in the 1951 festival.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/5">It would be good to have some activity on the original south bank site; that would cheer the nation and promote British technology. Indeed, although there might be a danger of there being some Wilsonian white-heat-of-technology ideas, it would nevertheless be useful to celebrate manufacturing excellence, given that the Government are trying to manage the economy in such a way as to reduce slightly our dependence on financial services.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/6">Most importantly, however, it will give us the chance to celebrate these glorious Elizabethan years. It will also give us a chance to capture the attention of visitors to the United Kingdom during the Olympic year and, in line with the Labour Government's slogan of 1946, to show that &quot;Britain can make it&quot;. These are challenging times-times of austerity, perhaps-and to be able to say that we have excellence in manufacturing and that Britain can thrive and recover would be a good theme between now and 2012, as the economy recovers.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/7">The year 2012 should be a festival of Britain that celebrates British talent in art, culture and sport as well as in industry. However, there is clearly an important royal process for it. Only Queen Victoria has celebrated a diamond jubilee. That was pushed for by Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain, who really wanted to celebrate the British empire.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/8">Now is our chance, with such a celebration, to reflect positively on our Commonwealth ties, and to consider the changing nature of British society in the context of our imperial history. It is regrettable that our children do not learn as much about our imperial past as they could, particularly as its history has made our country what it is today. Such teaching would go a long way towards redefining the nature of migration in the minds of the young. I hope that I do not offend too many colleagues in the Chamber by saying this, but it would also provide many salutary examples of how foolhardy military engagements in far-off places can be a great trap for our nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/9">Beyond schools, I believe that a 2012 festival of Britain would bring the chance for scholarships and apprenticeships to assist the disadvantaged, to show that their talents are most applicable as Britain rebuilds her economy and as we move away from services-particularly financial services-to manufacturing, technology, innovation and science. Perhaps we could have diamond jubilee scholarships, open to students from Commonwealth countries, that could foster British values overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/10">It is right that we should have a physical presence. I am aware of the danger of being accused of saying that significant public sector finances should be made available for such an initiative, but we would clearly want to catch the spirit of the silver jubilee. I remember attending street parties in 1977-I am sure that other Members remember it too-and I believe that that is the community approach that the Government would like to adopt.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/11">It might be appropriate, with many people going to the Olympic site, for them also to have the opportunity to go to a site here in the centre of London, behind the London Eye. It might be apt to have a new Skylon. I know that Winston Churchill took the original down very snappily after he was re-elected. That emblem of the original festival of Britain was the subject of teasing; it was said that, like the economy, it had no visible means of support. Perhaps that approach could be pursued now.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/12">I am attracted by the idea of a permanent legacy for the festival of Britain jubilee year. In some ways, that is a criticism of what is going on with the Olympics. Some of the legacy prospects for the Olympics are less ambitious than they were at the start, and some of the ambitions for a cultural Olympiad have unfortunately had to be put to one side. Perhaps that is something that could be dealt with as part of a diamond jubilee for Her Majesty. After all, when we look around our country, we see in many towns and villages that a great many of our commemorations of Queen Victoria are the result of her diamond jubilee.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/13">Hardly ever does a debate go by without my mentioning Croydon; I have mentioned Croydon 42 times during this Session of Parliament. A permanent legacy could be found in the neighbourhood of the London borough of Croydon in a rebuilt crystal palace. Another Minister described me as living on another planet for suggesting the idea, but there would be some value to it. Situated in the demographically dynamic south of London, a new palace could embody all the elements of art, culture, sport and industry that the festival would promote.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/14">A crowning glory in jubilee year would be for a British museum extension to be built in south London-a testimony to south London and to Britain's global reach. After all, it was after the 1851 exhibition that the original palace was exported to Crystal Palace. In many ways, one can see a continuity in the prospects for any general exhibitions that we might have. The 1851 exhibition was clearly industrial and technological, and the 1951 exhibition was about post-war reconstruction.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/15">A 2012 jubilee commemoration and exhibition could be based on green jobs and technology, perhaps emphasising LED technology. In Croydon, a green energy technology exhibition could rejuvenate the failed Skyline project, which I am sad to report to the House went into administration this week. It would also brighten up our lives in this time of economic downturn, perhaps with a project to light up London. That would be a very bright way in which to celebrate.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/16">I feel that Her Majesty commands our respect and allegiance as our monarch, but she has earned our love by the manner of her reign. As in previous jubilee years, we can look to our sovereign lady as a symbol of unity in difficult times.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/17">Moreover, there is much to celebrate from the original festival of Britain. I am pleased to have a facsimile of the official festival of Britain book, which was produced by HMSO and written by Mr. Ian Cox. Many of the themes mentioned are similar to those of today. Tolerance, for example, was one such theme, although ethnicity was somewhat different. The book said that the British nation was one of the most mixed people in the world, and it emphasised the importance of tolerance. Moreover, it tried to define-this was one of the difficult challenges-what it is to be British.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/18">When I was on the Education and Skills Committee, we asked our witnesses, &quot;How do you treat Britishness?&quot; They had the temerity to reply, &quot;How do we define that?&quot; It is a very difficult thing to do. The HMSO book defined Britishness as a mixture of the lion and the unicorn, the lion being about realism and strength and the unicorn about fantasy, independence-something that I very much appreciate-and imagination.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/19">Colleagues will be most amused to hear that reference is also made to a new initiative in west London-the new London airport sited 15 miles west of London. The HMSO book said that the terminal would be grouped on a 50 acre site in the centre of nine main runways, and that the facilities would enable the airport to handle &quot;4,000 passengers&quot;. That shows how modest the ambitions were, and how easy it is for a project to grow and grow-no talk there of third runways.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/20">I feel that the jubilee festival of 2012 provides us with an excellent opportunity to celebrate our cultural diversity and helps us to crystallise a sense of national identity.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.1/1">Indeed. The Queen fulfils an extraordinary and demanding role, but the respect that she is held in shows how well she has performed that singular role in the past 60 years.
