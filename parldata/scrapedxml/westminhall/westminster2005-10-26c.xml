<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.71.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" speakername="Vera Baird" colnum="71"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h01.htm#51026h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="c.71.3/1">I must declare an interest at the outset. Before I came to the House of Commons, I earned my living from the criminal legal aid fund. Occasionally, I still do short cases, usually in a recess when people who have more sense are on holiday. Again, that work is paid for from what actually should be called the criminal defence service budget.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.3/2">The criminal Bar and the Government have recently been at loggerheads about the increase in criminal legal aid. We are told that between 1997&mdash;when the budget was &pound;1.5 billion&mdash;and 2004&ndash;05, there has been a 37 per cent. increase in criminal legal aid, meaning that the total budget is now &pound;2 billion. I shall make a few, fairly basic points. No one can have a fair trial, and all of our much-prized legal principles are as nothing, if people are not adequately represented. &quot;A Fairer Deal for Legal Aid&quot; committed the Government to quality services that were all fairly remunerated. Another fairly obvious point is that it is hard to cap the legal aid budget for crime because, although there are probably some core crimes that are reasonably predictable, one cannot predict when the next great train robbery and subsequent trial will happen. The budget cannot be capped.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.3/3">There is a good analysis of the changes that have taken place in the criminal justice system over the period during which costs have inflated in some research undertaken by Professors Cape and Moorhead, which I have been privileged to examine. Crime is now falling, but that is a bit of a false point. The real point is: who is being caught and processed? Some 34 per cent. more people are now being charged with offences than at the beginning of the decade, and 18 per cent. more go to the Crown court than at that time. Between 2001&ndash;02 and 2003&ndash;04&mdash;these are the latest figures that I can find&mdash;the number of cases at Crown courts increased by 116,000. That is probably because magistrates are sending many more cases that could be tried either by them or the Crown court up to the Crown court, because there is a general trend towards taking cases more seriously and sentencing more heavily.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.3/4">There are two elements to the average solicitor's costs. One has decreased over the period with which we are concerned and the other has slightly increased, but only in line with inflation, so in net terms solicitors costs have gone down. In the case of barristers' average costs&mdash;Members will not be surprised to hear that that is what I am most interested in&mdash;standard and non-standard fees, taken together, have sustained a 1.7 per cent. increase since 2001. That is well below inflation. The increase from &pound;1.5 billion to &pound;2 billion has certainly not been caused by lawyers' rates of pay increasing. The main rung of lawyers are getting paid the same.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.3/5">The increased number of cases that I set out in the estimates from the two professors that I mentioned account for about one third of the increased costs of the criminal legal aid fund. People often maintain that there is a clash between criminal legal aid on the one hand and civil legal aid on the other. It is said that because the criminal legal aid fund becomes larger, civil legal aid suffers. That should not be the way in which things work. There are many ways of setting aside civil cases without having to go to court. Mediation and all sorts of agreements are possible. Crime, by its very nature, must go to court, unless it is at a low level and can be dealt with by penalty notices or mediation. There is not a great deal that be can done to rebalance the criminal legal aid budget with the civil legal aid budget from that point of view.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.3/6">There is a notion at large&mdash;I have seen it in the &quot;A Fairer Deal for Legal Aid&quot; White Paper&mdash;that there has been a wilful increase in or acceleration of cases going to court, and that that has been brought about by criminal defence lawyers. That, of course, is nonsense. Who is charged and investigated, what they are charged with, whether they go to court and whether and how their case is proceeded with is wholly in the hands of the police and the prosecution. It is daft to think that defence lawyers can influence that in any way; they simply respond to what they are given.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.3/7">One third of the increase in the costs of the criminal legal aid fund has come from the increasing volume of cases. It is desirable that more cases should go to court; that is exactly what we all want. The fundamental legal aid review also found a range of reasons why each trial&mdash;each case going to court&mdash;costs more. First, the charging is better; it is now done by the Crown Prosecution Service, so it is more likely to hold and present a real trial. The combination of the ways in which people are charged has changed and that can have an impact on the costs of a trial.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.3/8">Changes in the law and, in particular, in procedure and rules of evidence, make a big impact. Under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, hearsay evidence&mdash;not testimony from a witness who has seen the relevant incident, but from an intermediary&mdash;is now admissible, and is a complicated area in which to argue. The previous bad character of a defendant is now admissible and police officers investigating a crime interview about the crime and the possible bad character of the defendant. There is always an argument about whether the evidence about bad character is admissible.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.3/9">Adverse inferences are drawn about people who choose not to speak when interrogated by the police. There is the thorny question, in respect of which the Government have rightly legislated, of the admissibility of the previous sexual history of a complainant in a rape trial, and that inevitably gives rise to a long argument in court. I am not complaining when I say that since we came to power there have been 700 new criminal offences. All that adds up to why there are not only more cases&mdash;that is good&mdash;but why they can take longer when they get to court.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.3/10">I shall give one specific, strong example. We introduced the excellent Proceeds of Crime Act in 2002. It is used mostly for drugs cases, although I am not sure about where the bulk of its recovery comes from. Historically, it was possible for quite a long time to recover proceeds of crime at the end of a trial, but until the 2002 Act came into force, that was a bit of an afterthought and not pursued with a great deal of vigour; the point was seen to be to get the guilty man down, not so much to recover the money.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.3/11">However, thank goodness, the Government had clear vision: the point is not only to give the guilty man his number of years, but to make sure that he does not just regard those as an overhead of his business because he has plenty of money to come out to when he has finished his time. We must take all his proceeds of crime away as well. That new imperative is excellent, but involves hugely complex proceedings&mdash;tracing money through all sorts of deliberate hiding places, examining evidence from the police, the involvement of the Assets Recovery Agency, complicated mathematics and complicated legal presumptions. All these things do not add to the number of cases coming to court because they are an addition to the cases that are already coming to court. They do not add to the conviction rate either, but are an extra charge of work that follows on, as night follows day, from any serious crime that has had monetary profits.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.3/12">There are unforeseeable consequences, too. If somebody is charged with a serious drugs offence, they are looking at a long sentence, whether they are a suckling mother with a lot of social problems or a really hardened criminal. Sentencing for drug offences is much the same across the board. Perhaps people can be persuaded to plead guilty for a discount on plea if they are almost inevitably going to be convicted; they might get three years knocked off an 18-year sentence. However, one might have to persuade them to plead guilty even though a proceeds of crime action will follow, which will take their money away as well.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.3/13">The presumptions in the 2002 Act are harsh, and rightly so, and they have had this effect: if a person does not have the money any more, and the Assets Recovery Agency says that they have had it, they will serve one, two or three extra years in custody. Someone might plead guilty so that their 18 years gets cut to 15, but if the sentence will go back up again to 18 years because of proceeds of crime findings, they will not plead guilty. They will have gained nothing by doing so. That is one rather extended example of how life in the criminal courts has become much more complex. It is almost always the case that when sentences are increased more people fight cases instead of considering pleading guilty.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.3/14">That point stretches over other examples of our changes. In February 2000, our White Paper, &quot;Criminal Justice: The Way Ahead&quot;, talked about injecting new resources into the criminal justice system&mdash;9,000 more police recruits, 7,000 extra Crown court sitting days and 2,600 extra prison places&mdash;but there was no indication that the implications on the legal aid fund were ever examined.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.3/15">The narrowing-the-justice gap project was launched in 2002. The target is 1.25 million offenders brought to justice by 2008, which represents an increase of 150,000 on 2003 levels. There was no reference to the impact on defence legal aid as a result of that. The point is a pretty simple one: no one seems to cost the implications for defence legal aid of new legislative change. That is silly. To have excellent changes brought in with a fanfare but then to say, &quot;Goodness me, there is a &pound;130 million overspend on the budget&quot; is no way to control a budget.</p>

	<p pid="c.74.0/1">I could not have said better myself what the hon. and learned Lady is now putting before the Chamber. Does she recollect that when the Proceeds of Crime Bill was considered, the implications of the original rules which meant that somebody would be entitled to legal aid to resist a confiscation order because they would not be able to tap into their wealth during that period were pointed out? I regret to say that the Government ignored that and were obliged to change their position subsequently. She might also recollect that.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.0/2">It is not a question of the Government not having had these things pointed out to them. There seems to have been a degree of their blinding themselves to the obvious about how the costs would be ratcheted up.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.74.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" speakername="Vera Baird" colnum="74"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h01.htm#51026h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="c.74.1/1">I recall the hon. Gentleman being in Committee on the Proceeds of Crime Bill Committee with me and making that rather detailed and particular point about how the impact on legal aid would arise from the existence of resources in the hands of a defendant and from his eligibility.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/2">My point is a broader one. If we are to have the criminal justice system to be proud of that we want, it is obviously imperative that there is proper costing. One fears that if there is no proper costing ahead of time and suddenly there is an overspend, the brake will be put on criminal legal aid, exactly as is happening now. It is quite easy politically to say, &quot;Are we going to pay more money to these rich lawyers to defend all of these guilty people?&quot;. Let us consider the politics of the alternative. A Government cannot say that they will cut police costs to bring fewer people to custody or cut CPS costs to bring fewer prosecutions. There are brownie points and Crackerjack pencils for telling the public that cash is being poured into the police.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/3">The costs of the criminal justice system generally, leaving aside legal aid, have increased by 46 per cent. in the same period that we are talking about legal aid having increased. It is hardly surprising that defence costs have increased as well.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/4">I fear that it is too easy to take the option of attacking criminal legal aid and talking about lawyers and guilty people. Something obvious, but which needs saying, is that quite a lot of people who are brought to trial are not guilty; quite a lot of people are, but quite a lot are not. Perhaps they are found not guilty because they have been misidentified, which happens quite a bit. They might have been accused by their enemies, who were fitting them up. They might have been innocent dupes for other criminals. They might have been forced under duress to commit crime; many women are forced into drug crime by violent partners. They might have been pressurised by gangs, as many men are, into committing offences that they did not want to commit.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/5">People who are charged with violent crime might have been defending themselves, and the argument is whether they have gone too far and whether they were entitled to do what they wanted. People who are charged with murder might have been provoked beyond any prospect of human toleration&mdash;for example, some women who finally turn on their violent partners. They are not guilty of murder. The question is: are they guilty only of manslaughter?</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/6">Some people are not guilty because they are mentally ill; there are quite a lot of such people, and some of them end up in our prisons. Some people are not guilty because they are charged incorrectly. Sometimes people are not guilty because scientific evidence is inappropriate; for instance, a paediatrician said that the odds against a repeated number of cot deaths in one family was one in 73 million when in fact it was substantially less, and that brought about incorrect guilty verdicts. Let us talk plainly: people are also fitted up by the police. I am not saying that that happens every day, but it does happen. It is imperative to understand that a lot of people are brought to trial who are not guilty and who are in dire distress because they are falsely accused. They must be represented properly.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/7">I want to add a notion that is, perhaps, unpopular with the public: the guilty must be represented properly too. I found out clearly from my involvement in the Fawcett commission on women and criminal justice that there is a crossover; people who are victims one day are often criminals the next. Half the women currently in prison were previously the victims of serious domestic violence. We have failed them already by allowing that to continue. It is well known that on average there are 35 occasions of sustained violence before a woman makes a complaint to the public authorities, and those authorities do not then do a great deal about it, although we are improving. When someone is under the pressure of that sort of victimisation, and when society fails them once, it is not a big surprise if their lives then become chaotic, and they leave and start to steal to keep their children, or they turn to drugs to try to cope with their suffering, and they end up in prison.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/8">Guilty people are not all black through and through. It is important that they are represented, not only for their sake, but for the public interest, because they must get a sentence that will help them get out of the situation they are in, or else they will just keep going around and around in the criminal justice system. We need good and adequately paid defenders.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/9">Let us consider more closely the Bar's claim that it is being hard hit. I think that solicitors have some concerns as well; I see that some of them are present, and I am sure that they will raise those concerns. However, I have made it clear where my main interest lies. One third of the increase in legal aid is caused by the volume of cases, and one would guess that one third is caused by the increasing complexity and the addition of a range of new offences, but there is no increase in the Bar's rates of pay. There are, however, high-cost criminal cases. That situation must be tackled, and it is being tackled. The top 1 per cent. take half of the entire legal aid budget&mdash;that amounts to 2,000 cases. If we were to change the way in which they operate and make them cheaper, that would be the same as changing the 18,500 other cases that appear before the Crown court.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/10">Apparently, a top 10 barrister earns on average &pound;724,000 in legal aid. They work on fraud, serious drugs, murder, multiple defendant, and long and complex cases. Those cases last too long, so the Government will now have judges manage them. There will probably be too many representatives in multiple cases. Conflicts between defendants are often not as great as they first appear. There are often too many charges. There is often too much disclosure. All of that is being ramped back, and the Government's documents make it clear that they identify as the real issue the need for proceedings to be made shorter. Therefore, there will be no increase in pay rates, and where the increased costs have bitten hard in high-cost cases, the duration of the cases will be cut because they last too long.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/11">Why are the Government cutting pay rates? There has been no real increase in barristers' fees&mdash;only 1.7 per cent. over the past few years. The Bar would say that there has been a decrease of 24 per cent. if everything is added up and inflation is taken into account. I am not prepared to arbitrate in respect of those two figures, but it is clear that the Bar is not getting any more money. Why are the Government seeking to cut Bar fees? They must think that the Bar was earning too much. Was it? That is a question primarily for Lord Carter and his review.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/12">On average, the top 10 Queen's counsels earn &pound;725,000. For most cases, most QCs are paid graduated fees, which have been at a fixed level since 1997. The fees are set at a fixed daily rate according to whether the case is in the A class in respect of a murder or in the B, C or D class in respect of pinching a car. There is an uplift for the length of the trial; it is a proxy for the complexity that is implicit in a longer trial.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/13">Are those rates too high? A Bar Council briefing paper that is intended to rouse sympathy about such matters states that a QC handling a top case&mdash;an A case in respect of a murder or other serious matter&mdash;will have had his pay cut by &pound;6,000 for the average 20-day trial. He will have his pay cut by &pound;8,240 for an average 25-day trial because of the recent cuts brought forward by the Department for Constitutional Affairs. The principal element of the cut is that there used to be a mark up of 25 per cent. between an ordinary barrister and a QC. That has been halved. Thus, 12.5 per cent. of the fee has been reduced.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/14">The Bar Council estimates that for a 20-day case, of the &pound;6,000 less fees that the QC will receive, &pound;3,800 of that sum is due to the halving of the special margin for QCs. Therefore, QCs have lost &pound;3,800 by having 12.5 per cent. taken off their fee. What would they have received in the first place for a 20-day trial? That is pretty simple to work out. We must multiply &pound;3,800 by eight, which is about &pound;30,000 for a 20-day trial. That is an approximate figure; none the less it is telling. The raw point made by the briefing paper is that, overall, a QC will lose &pound;6,000 for a 20-day trial. However, many people would be happy if they earned &pound;6,000 in 20 days or even in a month.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/15">Given what is intended to be a sympathy-evoking declaration by the silk level practitioners of imminent poverty, we need not worry about them too much. Although I am a QC, I come from an unskilled working-class home and the levels of pay at the Bar must be seen through my eyes. They are extremely high, no doubt because the Bar continues primarily to attract people who have a good deal of self-confidence, and that has an obvious resonance with those who attended public school. Although it happens less now, historically the Bar tended to attract confident, well-off public school people. Their expectations might be much higher than mine, but the fees are good.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/16">I should have thought that there is no problem at the top. If it were feared that QCs will flee into the commercial sector, all right. The Bar is pretending that it is having difficulty recruiting and retraining&mdash;and it is a pretence. I am beset by people who are desperate to join my chambers. People are trained, but they have no pupilages and they need to get into chambers. Given the figures that I have outlined, it is not surprising that many people are hammering at the door. Furthermore, it is an exciting life. Life at the Bar is extremely intellectually challenging and rewarding. It is a good job and there will always be people who want to do it.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/17">I wish to digress for a minute. What I am about to say must be a forgivable aside. When I was at the Bar, I led as a junior for 12 years before I became a QC because my face did not fit with various Conservative Lord Chancellors. I was leading in cases with many QCs. I was the ugly duckling at the trial. One day, however, suddenly through the letterbox comes the transformation into the white swan&mdash;the letter. One gets a big thick letter if one fails to get a QC's job, and a thin piece of paper if one has succeeded. One is transformed by its receipt. One must immediately put on a different kind of jacket, walk considerably taller and not be talked down to in quite the same way by the judges at the Old Bailey.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/18">One becomes worth 25 per cent. more in one's fees that day, and they never go backwards again. Now, the increase is only 12.5 per cent., but I wonder why I was worth any more on Tuesday than I was on Monday. We should think a little bit about that when we worry about the level of fees at the top end.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/19">The lower end of the Bar is a different kettle of fish. I know that my hon. Friend the Minister will tell me that the fee for the junior Bar for a one-day trial is about &pound;400. However, the fee that sticks in my mind is her quotation that a three-day trial is worth about &pound;1,300&mdash;a good rate of pay, as she would say. It is important to understand that &quot;the junior Bar&quot; has two different meanings. When my hon. Friend talks about it, she thinks that she is talking about the poor, young and new entrants. That is not the case. Everybody who is not a QC, who has not become a white swan, is a junior barrister. I once led a junior barrister who was 83 years old; it is just the name given to non-QCs.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/20">Members of the junior Bar do not get three-day trials for a long time after they get the job. They are the ones who for &pound;50 appear for a bail application. I know that my hon. Friend thinks also that they can do a dozen of those in a day, and that that is not a bad rate of pay; however, they are lucky to get two, or three at the most. They may have to prepare for an hour, talk to their client for half an hour and travel two hours from one end of London to the other to get their &pound;50 and their wonderful exposure to a solicitor who they hope to goodness will be so impressed by the way they say &quot;My Lord I apply for bail&quot; that he will instruct them thereafter on &pound;1,300 three-day cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/21">They get &pound;50 or thereabouts for a cracked trial or for a guilty plea. Some trials are always going to crack, and no one does a great deal of work on them; however, they often crack at the last minute when the defendant faces the door of the court and changes his mind. One can read a trial for two or three days, delve into the library for a month on one point, organise a conference with one's client and travel across London, and get &pound;50 for it.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/22">That is the life at the junior Bar for a sizeable number of years, and the pay is very poor. One hopes upon hope for the &pound;1,300 three-day trial, but it takes a long time.</p>

	<p pid="c.78.0/1">As a former member of the junior Bar that the hon. and learned Lady describes, and in every sense of the word junior, I recognise a great deal of what she says. Does she accept that from those figures quoted for junior Bar earnings, one must deduct one's clerk's fees, taxes and anything else that one may need, which in another profession might be provided for? The figures that one ends up with are therefore much smaller than those quoted.</p>

	<p pid="c.78.1/1">The hon. Gentleman comes from old-fashioned chambers if he pays clerks' fees these days. We withdrew a long time ago our clerk's power to charge fees. However, there are chambers overheads. I have no idea what the hon. Gentleman's are, but mine are about 20 per cent. One must pay to get across London and to buy nice clothes to look respectable, so overheads certainly come out of that.</p>
	<p pid="c.78.1/2">If the Bar Council is right that graduated fees have been kept the same since 1997 and there has been a 24 per cent. cut, we are visiting an awful lot of penury on our young people. It is a concern for young people that I primarily raise. The Bar has been an exclusive club historically, and I do not know how I managed to sneak in by the back door. However, it is breaking open to more people from ordinary schools with ordinary backgrounds who are keen to come through. It is in everybody's interest that the Bar represents a cross-section of our society. That is good in itself, as those people are entitled to the opportunity of having such a wonderful career, which it truly is. In addition, we want a judiciary that represents a cross-section of society. By and large, it is still chosen from the Bar, and probably will be for a long time.</p>
	<p pid="c.78.1/3">Let us carefully consider the junior Bar. There are two sides to the story about the Government, the Bar and criminal legal aid fees. First, an enormous number of increases were not costed, and those increases have run away with the DCA's budget. Do not blame defence lawyers for that&mdash;it is not their responsibility. Secondly, the leaders of the Bar with whom the Government negotiate are at the overpaid, posher end. Do not neglect the younger, poor people at the bottom. The last time I went to the Old Bailey, the conversations at the senior end of the robing room were about skiing holidays and the nanny's sports car, but at the junior end they were about loans for tube passes and paying student debts.</p>

	<p pid="c.78.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> on securing this timely debate. She gave an expert oversight of the current position. I declare an interest. I am a barrister, and I occasionally practise in the criminal courts and do some criminal legal aid work. For 20 years, I was a solicitor doing such work.</p>
	<p pid="c.78.2/2">I want to discuss the situation pertaining to the Bar and some views put forward by the Law Society. The hon. and learned Lady gave a fair account of the concerns at the junior end of the Bar, but I take slight issue with the impression she gave that those who are leading the charge on behalf of the Bar Council are, perhaps, more concerned about their fees as silks than about the junior end. In fact, every communication that I have had from members of the Bar Council who are concerned about the situation has stressed the effect on the junior Bar, referring en passant to their own position. As she knows, the top end is very well paid&mdash;only a fool would deny that that is true&mdash;but, as she says, the pay can be meagre at the junior end.</p>
	<p pid="c.78.2/3">In a recent pronouncement, the Minister said that it is possible to do between 10 and 20 bail applications a day. That is palpably ridiculous. I am not sure how that could possibly be done, even with the ill-fated night courts, which have been discontinued. Also, the Government paint a picture that everybody at the Bar is rolling in money and that they do not know what to do with it all. That is simply not true.</p>

	<p pid="c.79.0/1">I hope that I do not appear greedy by intervening on the hon. Gentleman straight away.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.0/2">I am worried about the poor representation of the younger Bar by the more senior Bar because of the &quot;strike&quot;, which was, frankly, encouraged by the Criminal Bar Association. Members have been asked to decline to take any brief that comes in after a particular date in October.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.0/3">When I was a silk&mdash;it will be the same for the hon. Gentleman, who is a senior member now&mdash;my case diary was full for months, perhaps even a year ahead. Not taking a case after <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase> would have been no skin off my nose, if I may use a colloquialism. Long before the strike ended, I would have had plenty more cases coming in, and I already had a year's work. The youngsters who get a brief today and have to go to the magistrates court with it tomorrow are the ones who will suffer. That situation was encouraged by the leadership, and I do not like it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.79.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" speakername="Elfyn Llwyd" colnum="79"  time="010:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h01.htm#51026h01_spnew7">
	<p pid="c.79.1/1">The hon. and learned Lady is absolutely correct. Several people in my own chambers in Chester are agonising over the problem. I suppose that, by nature, barristers are not likely to strike, but many junior members of my chambers are very concerned. They do not want to stand out and take work that might have gone to others who have declined to accept it. At the same time, exactly as she said, they are at the lower end and have bills to pay.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/2">Also, everyone in chambers has received a letter from the Crown Prosecution Service. The letter sent to those on the Wales and Chester circuit and the letter sent to those on other circuits have common paragraphs, one of which is rather threatening. I forget the wording now, but in effect it says, &quot;We are watching you. If you decline briefs now, we will see how we get on when this is all over.&quot; That is very worrying for a junior member of the Bar.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/3">There is also the issue of preferment. Many in the judiciary privately believe that the action is right, but that it will inevitably create some difficulty in the courts&mdash;not at the higher end, where the diary is full for 18 months, but at the lower end, where people decline to take briefs for the reasons outlined. There is concern that that might impede appointments. All those things have to be considered, but members of the junior Bar are desperate. That is why they are taking action, as I said. They do not lightly undertake what is tantamount to a strike.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/4">I will truncate what I have to say, because the hon. and learned Lady put the case extremely well, but I shall give a bit of background. The graduated fee scheme was introduced in 1997. It was meant for one to 10-day cases and provided weightings to reflect different elements in cases. The original rates for 1997 were based on 1995 fee levels. They have not been increased since then, and that in itself is a real-terms cut of 24 per cent. In 2001&ndash;02, there were more than 17,000 one to 10-day cases, and the average cost was &pound;1,587. In 2003&ndash;04, there were 19,000 such cases, but the average cost was lower, at &pound;1,541. There is already pretty firm control in that area, and I believe that that is right&mdash;there has to be a control on public spending; that is obvious.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/5">In 2002, the graduated fee scheme was extended to cases of up to 25 days, with a gradient introduced for longer cases. That in itself provided an important weighting to reflect the gravity and complexity of the longer cases, but there was no increase in rates. In fact, the figure delivered proved to be much lower. So there had been another significant cut to what had been paid before.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/6">Finally, in the summer of 2004, the Department for Constitutional Affairs accepted that it had got it wrong. It increased other weightings to make good the shortfall for future 11 to 25-day cases, and extended the fee scheme to 40-day cases. More than two years had passed and the payment was written off, but the DCA promised a vital review of the whole system, to start in May 2005. In the meantime, the total spending on criminal defence rose by little more than half the rate of inflation between 2001&ndash;02 and 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/7">Everybody here, and, I am sure, those outside, will be concerned about very high-cost cases. As the hon. and learned Lady said, up to 50 per cent. of the budget goes on a very small number of cases&mdash;perhaps as small a proportion as 1 per cent. Clearly, that needs to be addressed. However, to put a fair case forward, that probably would not detrimentally affect the junior Bar.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/8">With regard to cracked trials, the Criminal Defence Service (Funding) (Amendment) Order 2005 cut the amounts to be paid when cases &quot;go guilty&quot;&mdash;in other words, for cracked trials. Guilty pleas are often entered on the day when the trial is meant to commence. That order took &pound;15 million out of barristers' Crown court fees. The saving has not been redistributed to the underpaid one to 10-day cases. On <phrase class="date" code="">5 July</phrase> the DCA announced the removal of the gradient for cases of over 10 days. That reduced the fees payable in those cases to hard-pressed members of the junior Bar by an average of 15 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.80.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the approach to cracked trials is particularly bizarre? It is desirable that trials should be resolved as early as possible to escape some of the costs. A cracked trial saves money because it is an indication that the trial itself will not take place, yet a series of penalties seem to visited on the Bar in relation to them. Does he share my view that that is a bizarre way of approaching the problem?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.81.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" speakername="Elfyn Llwyd" colnum="81"  time="010:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h01.htm#51026h01_spnew9">
	<p pid="c.81.0/1">It clearly is. To add to the problem, the preparatory work has all been done. Often, all that remains is to have a final conference with the client. Then, suddenly, the client finds out who the judge is and decides to change his plea, or changes his plea for some other reason. There is a perverse logic in there somewhere, but I am not sure where it is. However, the work has been done and should be paid for. If cracked trials could be foretold, that would be entirely different. With his experience of the Bar, the hon. Gentleman knows that nowadays there are forms to be filled in on everything. If there is even the least suspicion that a case is going to crack, a form might be filled in weeks beforehand. So I agree: it is a strange position.</p>
	<p pid="c.81.0/2">In summary, the DCA proposes, first, to reduce payments to Queen's counsel for every type of case by 12.5 per cent. and, secondly, to remove from all advocates the entire length of trial uplift in fee cases of more than 10 days in length. The effects on Queen's counsel defending in longer terrorism, murder and other grave trials will include a reduction of between 20 and 30 per cent. in the fixed fees agreed in 2001. For junior trial advocates, the reductions will be even more severe. In a five-week serial rape trial, the defence counsel's fees would be reduced by more than 40 per cent. on the 2001 rates. Can anyone imagine having to live with that reduction? That is what will be visited on the middle junior rank&mdash;if I can put it that way&mdash;of the profession. The Bar Council clearly believes that the measures will have an unintended and disproportionate effect on the junior Bar.</p>
	<p pid="c.81.0/3">I also want to say something about the Carter review. The Bar Council has been engaging positively with the process and with the legal aid procurement review that is being conducted. The Government are giving the impression that barristers have said no and that they are selfish people who have walked off and thrown the papers up in the air. That is absolutely untrue. There has been meeting upon meeting about this problem over the past months. The case of the junior Bar has been pleaded on several occasions, although perhaps not as vehemently as it should have been, as the hon. and learned Lady said. The response is still developing as far as the Bar is concerned.</p>
	<p pid="c.81.0/4">What is to be done? Clearly, issues do exist and there must be a brake. It is impossible to have a cap, but there must be some form of adjustment. When I was first elected in 1992 I suggested to the Government that the criminal legal aid budget could be cut by &pound;47 million per annum. I realise that that is not a lot in comparison with the total amount today, but it was quite a substantial sum then. When I first started as a solicitor, I frequented county courts, where a tight appointments system operated. If a person's case was listed at 12 o'clock, they appeared at a quarter to and were not left hanging around. However, in the magistrates courts, I was very often one of a dozen people who were sitting around all day waiting to have their case dealt with. We were all being paid on legal aid rates at the time.</p>
	<p pid="c.81.0/5">I suggested that there should be a proper appointments system and good case management&mdash;that term was not used in those days, although it is very much in vogue now. There should have been some intervention at that stage and, had there been, figures from various university departments showed that a saving of &pound;47 million could have been made without any detriment to the person before the court or to the legal profession. That would have been a more efficient way of doing things. To my knowledge, that has not happened, and I am sorry about that. Hopefully, that might be re-examined because it could produce a substantial saving.</p>
	<p pid="c.81.0/6">It is clear that we need to examine the role of the judiciary in efficient case management and to have better listing, enhanced use of IT and quality control. In most Crown courts, two or three trials are still listed for the same day and someone will not know until they get to court that their case will not be heard that day&mdash;although it might be heard later on if one of the cases cracks. A huge amount of time is wasted and practitioners are paid for that wasted time. That should be examined far more carefully. We could make savings without having an impact on anybody. Practitioners could be elsewhere&mdash;doing work in chambers, for example&mdash;and could come to the court when they know that their trial is about to commence. That is a common-sense approach, which unfortunately has not curried favour with those in power in the Department.</p>
	<p pid="c.81.0/7">The hon. and learned Lady referred to the work of Professors Cape and Moorhead, so I do not propose to go over what was said. However, lots of complicated drivers are involved. It is not a simple case of lawyers being paid more in some way. That is the last thing that has happened. More people are coming before the courts. More people are being sent up for sentencing from the magistrates courts to the Crown courts. In addition, the work being done in the magistrates courts is of a broader range than it was; district judges&mdash;who used to be called stipendiaries&mdash;take some serious cases in the magistrates courts. Things have changed and there has been a speeding up of criminal offences. As she said, more than 700 new criminal offences have been created since Labour came to power.</p>
	<p pid="c.81.0/8">There is something unfortunate about the timing of the Carter review, because cuts were made to the level of fees while it took place. We are now supposed to wait until May 2006 to find out what Lord Carter thinks about that. That is an extraordinary way to do things. We should wait for the review and then introduce whatever measures it suggests. That is a common-sense and business-like way of doing things, but it is not the way in which the Government decided to proceed. Some of us thought that they were going head on into this collision and that they intended to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.81.0/9">We read about the so-called fat cats on their vast fees here, there and everywhere. If I may digress, the current Attorney-General and the Lord Chancellor are not exactly slim Jims themselves. It appears that they have little knowledge of the criminal system, but great knowledge of the civil system. They were adequately paid in their days in the profession. I would not level the term &quot;fat cats&quot; at them, but they were not slim Jims.</p>
	<p pid="c.81.0/10">I agree that some changes need to be made. The very high-cost cases need to be addressed, but in addressing them the Government should not think that the things they do will not affect the junior Bar badly, because they will. It is vital for the process that there is a good independent junior Bar. Both the Law Society and the Bar Council are agreed on that.</p>
	<p pid="c.81.0/11">The idea of price competitive tendering for criminal legal aid in the solicitors' profession will be detrimental. That is not because the solicitors' profession is not prepared to enter into a competitive field. It is already in a competitive field; it now advertises. In my day, that was taboo, but advertising is done in the strangest places every now and then. The problem with PCT is that unrealistically low tenders are made to secure the work. Something is inevitable: unrealistically bad advice might well ensue, and that has an impact on the public. The system is not consumer-led and might well impact badly on the public. That concerns lawyers. They are not always obsessed with themselves. They are concerned about their clients and the system within which they work, and they can see that competitive tendering is a very bad idea indeed.</p>
	<p pid="c.81.0/12">Means-testing in magistrates courts is sensible and it should have come back a while ago. I could not understand why it was done away with and I applaud its return. If a person can pay for part or all of their costs, why should they not do so? I fully endorse that; it should assist matters. However, I hope that the money recovered will not be swallowed up in administration. I recall how easy it was in the 1970s to make a legal aid application in court&mdash;it could be done within minutes of a hearing. If it worked then, it should work now. Let us keep it simple and not have a huge bureaucracy and a means-testing Tsar in every court, and that kind of palaver. Let us ensure that the costs recovered go in the correct direction.</p>
	<p pid="c.81.0/13">I am worried about the effect of competitive tendering on the solicitors' profession, but also about the current proposals for the junior Bar. I hope that the Minister will listen to what has been said and is prepared to enter the final months of the Carter review process with an open mind. That, I am afraid, appears to have been lacking in the past few weeks. She said last week that getting legal advice should be as easy as buying a can of beans. With respect, her Government's proposals do not add up to a row of beans.</p>

	<p pid="c.83.1/1">First, I declare an interest: I practised for 11 years as a criminal solicitor and I am a consultant solicitor-advocate.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.1/2">It should be acknowledged that we criminal legal aid practitioners are due a makeover. It would be interesting to see what Trinny and Susannah would make of us; the public perception of us is dim and, given the Government's approach to legal aid, their perception must be similar. We seem to be fair game for cuts because the public perception is of well paid lawyers ripe for picking.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.1/3">The reality is, however, that criminal legal aid practitioners perform very good services, and I shall concentrate on the solicitors' end of the system. Few professions have to deal with the demands and pressures that are placed on criminal solicitors. There is little appreciation of what our working environment is like: it is often an airless, smelly police cell or, if we are lucky, an interview room. We can be working at any time of the day or night&mdash;indeed, we often have to give advice in the middle of the night and we deal with the most vulnerable in our community. Many of our clients suffer from mental illness and some are dangerous, but all have their liberty at stake and are dependent on quality advice. That is the reality that faces many solicitors day in, day out, but they also face the reality of their pay having effectively been frozen since 1993.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.1/4">It is important not to pigeonhole things, however. The case for criminal legal aid is not so much about how good solicitors and barristers are, but about how good a criminal justice system we want. In many ways, the Government's approach is piecemeal, because they pick off issues. First, they remove means-testing in the lower courts and then try to return it in the Criminal Defence Service Bill. If they had asked us practitioners, we would have told them that costs would rise if they took away means-testing, but they did not listen to us. They then quite properly brought in a case-management approach, but did not test how that would work or deal with the costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.1/5">We have had a plethora of new legislation, and the effect of new criminal offences is seen in the courts. There are profound demands on the lower courts and there are changes in sentencing. Solicitors often have to pick up those pieces and apply them in magistrates courts. In youth courts particularly, one has to perform incredible mental gymnastics, straddling the statutes over many years to provide a proper service to clients and the courts.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.1/6">It is important to realise what are the duties of solicitors in youth courts. They have a statutory duty to prevent reoffending; that is what they are involved in doing. To ensure that they are part of the proper operation of the criminal justice system and that there is quality advice and representation, they must be properly rewarded. Politicians and people in our communities go on about antisocial behaviour as our No. 1 priority, but no campaign leaflets mention a priority to increase the remuneration for lawyers to help ensure that we tackle antisocial behaviour. However, solicitors have a statutory duty to prevent youths reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.1/7">There needs to be a proper appreciation of the role of solicitors, and they need to be properly rewarded. It is important to have good quality lawyers in the system, so that we have a criminal justice system in which the public have confidence and which ensures that we have fair trials, proper sentencing and that people do not re-offend.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.1/8">The Government have rightly looked at high-cost cases, but they were wrong to look at the lower courts. They are dealing with the lower courts by introducing price competitive tendering and by squeezing solicitors' costs, but they should look elsewhere. When they criticise defence solicitors about adjournments, they are aiming at the wrong target. They should be looking at the listing in courts and the delays in coming from the prison van day in and day out, as people wait to represent their clients.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.1/9">On price competitive tendering, the Government are focusing on the lowest common denominator, which, in reality, will be price. That will undermine many of the worthy intentions in the criminal justice system, and it will effectively lead to time being called on local solicitors' firms. Local services will be undermined. Many clients will no longer have access to the representative of their choice. Many individuals employed in law firms and associated occupations will lose their livelihoods. The larger, out-of-area, specialised firms will take over. In London, there will be a particular problem. Black and ethnic minority solicitors and firms will be disproportionately affected by price competitive tendering because of the number of them in the capital.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.1/10">The Minister shakes her head, but we should debate why that is happening. Let us consider the Criminal Defence Service Bill. Do we need savings while the contract regime is in place? There is no evidence that the costs of lower court work are increasing. Indeed, the Minister's Department recently predicted that there will be a decrease in her budget. Therefore, why is she focusing her attack on solicitors with price competitive tendering when there is good control? For the first time in many years, there is control of the criminal defence budget. As there is control in the lower courts, why are the Government pursuing the attack on solicitors?</p>
	<p pid="c.83.1/11">In particular, why are the Government intent on introducing price competitive tendering? Why, when Lord Carter is conducting a review into price procurement, did the Minister two weeks ago go to a legal practitioner action group and clearly suggest that the auction process will begin in April 2006, that the Government's mind is made up, and that they will not even take into account Lord Carter's views on procurement?</p>
	<p pid="c.83.1/12">I want the Minister to take on board what has been said about the criminal Bar and solicitors, and the need to support criminal legal aid. She should do so not so much with regard to the pay packets of solicitors and barristers, but in order to support the criminal justice system.</p>

	<p pid="c.85.0/1">I should also declare an interest: I am a non-practising member of the criminal Bar.</p>
	<p pid="c.85.0/2">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> said, the difficulty with what the Government have in mind in relation to criminal legal aid is that although the junior Bar would probably have no objection to the redistribution of money from the top ranks of the Bar to the lower ranks, that is not what is going to happen. The Government have indicated that cuts will be made at the lower ranks of the Bar to the criminal legal aid budget, but there will be no corresponding transfer to those ranks. That will create a number of significant difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="c.85.0/3">There is no doubt that there is room for reform in the system of payments to the Bar. I accept that the current system is ridiculous. Based on the amount of preparation I do on a Monday night for a Tuesday morning case as a member of the Bar, I could be paid &pound;46.50 or &pound;1,500, depending on factors completely outside my control. Whether the defendant and witnesses for the prosecution turn up determines my fee. I do not suppose that many of my former colleagues at the junior Bar would object if the Government came forward with a sensible proposal for payment of criminal barristers according to the work that they do. The problem is that that is not the proposal and the Government are making cuts without completing the wide-ranging Carter review. The Government promised a review in May but it did not materialise. The criminal Bar has been waiting a long time for the Government to explain their long-term vision.</p>
	<p pid="c.85.0/4">The hon. and learned Lady summed up the issue well. It is not whether we pay high-ranking barristers &pound;200,000 or &pound;300,000 a year; it is whether we can attract the best quality applicants to the junior criminal Bar, and not&mdash;this is where I disagree with her&mdash;because we compare the earnings of the junior Bar with average earnings throughout the country. We need to attract the best quality advocates to do the vital job of defending and prosecuting in our criminal courts because they could instead go into other strands of the legal profession, such as the commercial Bar. They could become commercial solicitors or go into other professions with far higher rates of pay. Barristers spend a lot of time and, now, money to train for the criminal Bar. We need to attract them and to retain them. It is not automatic that those who join the criminal Bar become silks and make the sort of money that has been mentioned. It is the junior Bar that needs the Government's attention. I hope that they will give it that attention and that they recognise the problems.</p>

	<p pid="c.86.0/1">We are all grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> who, as we expected, clearly and, I hope, effectively put the case for an honest appraisal of what the criminal justice system needs in terms of legal aid and the way forward. I have no fundamental difference with her. At the end of the debate, the Minister will have heard a collection of people from both sides of the House putting a collection of compatible views that I hope will be taken into account by her Department when it assesses the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/2">For the record, I am a qualified barrister and a member of chambers, although I have not practised for several years. I do not come from a family of professionals or lawyers who had been to university for generations. Like the hon. and learned Lady, I was the first member of my family to go to university. I made my way with no spare income, living on almost nothing for many years, going not just around London but on the midland and Oxford circuit from Lincoln one day to Gloucester the next, often getting up at 5 am and returning at 11 pm. In the very early days I often went to court to find that what I had prepared to do did not happen, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1791" name="Jeremy Wright">the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright)</phrase> said, through no fault of my own. That has not fundamentally changed.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/3">I shall refer to some of the comments that members of the Bar made in the survey of the criminal Bar that was carried out during the summer.There are some areas of agreement. Everyone agreed that the Government are right to concentrate, as the Lord Chancellor announced, on bringing down the cost of the most expensive criminal cases. Everyone realises that we must not be distracted by, but must deal with, the fact that some people at the top end of the profession have earned&mdash;and been well publicised as having earned&mdash;record sums from criminal legal aid. It is right that that is sorted out. It is also right that we give what attention we can to mediation and pursue non-court-based solutions for dealing with crime. The purpose of an initiative piloted in the Thames valley area where victims confront offenders is to get a more acceptable outcome than going to court and putting away offenders, who re-offend when they are released before going round the circuit again.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/4">I want to reiterate and add to the points made about why we have seen so much increase in that area of spend, and I have a specific question for the Minister. The increase is because more offences are being rightly cleared up. There has been huge pressure to do so. The average figures showed that about only one quarter of recorded offences were cleared up. In London, the figure was 12.5 per cent. The greater the clear-up, the more likely cases are to go through the courts.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/5">Charging is getting better. Many of us supported taking the responsibility for charging away from the police and giving it to the Crown Prosecution Service. However, it means that more work follows. It is true that the law is often complicated and that there are more trials within trials.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/6">My assessment is that the number of new criminal offences is underestimated. I remember asking parliamentary questions some years ago, and then the figure since 1997 was 600 plus. It is now likely to be 1,000 plus, and after this debate I shall table the appropriate parliamentary question to obtain the latest figures.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/7">The reality is that the Government have created offence after offence. They often create offences and legislate, rather than improve administration. The reaction of this Government is always to legislate and to create more offences to deal with the problem, rather than sort out the administration.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/8">Will the Minister consider the idea that when we put in the explanatory notes to a Bill on its financial effects, a section also sets out its financial effects on the criminal justice system? They should be assessed. I do not think that they have been, and I should be grateful if the hon. Lady would confirm that. If that is so, will the idea be considered not only by her Department, but throughout the Government?</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/9">My second question to the Minister is: how many failed prosecutions are there? Prosecutions will fail because many people are innocent. The hon. and learned Lady rightly reminded us that there are two basic principles: first, the human rights principle that everybody is entitled to a fair trial; secondly, if one is charged, one has certain rights under article 6 to be informed promptly, to have time and facilities to prepare and defend oneself on one's own, or with legal assistance of one's own choosing, or, if one does not have the means to pay, to be given it free.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/10">Many people taken to court are not guilty, and they are rightly acquitted, but it would be helpful if the Minister in her winding-up speech were to remind us how many failed prosecutions there have been. A huge amount is spent on the preparation of cases that collapse. In the end, the money is wasted in some ways, but not on the recipient who has to do the work in any event.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/11">There are other smaller causes of waste. I remember going recently to a magistrates court in the part of the world which the Minister and I represent, and just as before cases were listed in which not all papers were ready. That was not the fault of the prosecuting barrister or solicitor, but of the system in which the CPS had not caught up with its obligations. That still happens, and we shall never have a perfect system. The problem is to do with listing, planning and the necessities of courts.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/12">If we are to ensure that costs are reasonable, the review that Lord Carter commissioned, which forms the background against which we are all speaking, must be a proper one. The fair system of legal aid announced by the Lord Chancellor must be complemented by a fair system not only for the taxpayer, but for those who are paid to do the work.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/13">I wish to make two points about the two issues on the agenda. Along with those in the profession who have been consulted, I, too, presume that the tendering process has prospectively huge disadvantages. It means that one will not be able to take on the firm and the people of one's choice; one will have to bid for the lowest price, which may often be a low-quality product. The old, traditional system&mdash;the market&mdash;that determines that one gets the work if one is good and does not if one is bad takes care of that. I should leave that system to continue to work as it has done.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/14">Secondly, I want to reinforce the point that the hon. and learned Lady made about pay scales and the position of younger people in their first 10 years in the junior Bar. I share her view that, at the top end, people may be well paid&mdash;indeed, excessively so. That is a matter that the tax system can deal with&mdash;if we have a Government who believe in progressive taxation&mdash;by making sure that better-off people pay more, and less well-off people do not pay as high a rate of tax.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/15">There are some obvious examples demonstrating the hon. and learned Lady's point in the Bar survey, which I understand the Minister has read. One respondent to the survey said:</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/16" class="indent">&quot;My wife is a speech therapist. I calculated our hourly rates and she works for approximately &pound;20 per hour with maternity leave, holidays and pension all included. The joiner who is repairing my shower at home is charging me &pound;23 per hour plus materials. I have last week represented a man on Drug Importation of 2.5 kg of heroin who was convicted after a three day trial and was sentenced to 12 years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/17">He went on to say that after preparing the case and after chambers' expenses, he</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/18" class="indent">&quot;will be paid &pound;2000. i.e. &pound;33 per hour or incl court &pound;26 per hour for this extremely stressful case.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/19">He then asked:</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/20" class="indent">&quot;Why is the state prepared to pay a market rate of in excess of &pound;400 per hour for silks in High Court cases involving government departments when it pays such a derisory rate for barristers representing individuals who face up to life imprisonment?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/21">As the Minister will know, representation in court is sometimes a life-or-death issue&ndash;&ndash;or certainly an issue of years inside or life outside.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/22">Another respondent to the survey said:</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/23" class="indent">&quot;To discourage early preparation and penalise the conscientious with such small set payments damages the public interest and the service to all stakeholders in the criminal process outcome. How can &pound;55 be justified sometimes for a later-return trial prepared for 6 hours, with 3 hours at court, and 2 hours travel? Utterly unheard of in other professional arenas.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/24">Another person said:</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/25" class="indent">&quot;Could not agree more. It's galling, arbitrary and unfair to prepare fully for trial, only to be stood out because USUALLY of the fault of the State (court or Crown) who then refuse to remunerate you!! Sentence is perhaps the most iniquitous area&mdash;sentence requires sometimes far more prep than a guilty plea . . . or later where the client accepts in his proof his guilt&mdash;&pound;60!!!&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/26">One respondent made a request, and I make it of the Minister, too. If we are to have a legal profession that is representative of all backgrounds in society, made up of women and men, and people of all classes and races&mdash;and we all argue for that&mdash;it must be a profession that has opportunity for all. The respondent said that there is</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/27" class="indent">&quot;a real ignorance of what goes on in court. Please let an MP or civil servant follow around a junior barrister for a week and then say that such a policy is justifiable&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/28">I would be grateful if the Minister told us, in her wind-up speech, how many days she has spent on the road with junior members of the Bar. If she has not followed a junior barrister, will she say whether she and her colleagues in Government are willing to do so before making any decisions?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.89.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" speakername="Dominic Grieve" colnum="89"  time="010:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h01.htm#51026h01_spnew14">
	<p pid="c.89.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> on securing the debate, and on the way in which she presented this difficult issue. She did so faultlessly; I found myself agreeing with virtually everything that she said.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/2">It has been a particularly constructive debate because we have had input from not only barristers, but o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" name="David Burrowes">thers, too. My hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes)</phrase> gave a solicitor's perspective, for example.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/3">It is generally acknowledged that the Government face a considerable problem over criminal legal aid. The amount is large and growing. It is in everyone's interests that it should be controlled, but the question arises of how that can best be done. There is no doubt that the Cape-Moorhead report by the two professors is a very revealing document. For a long time, the message coming from the Department for Constitutional Affairs was that increases in costs were driven by the costs of the professions acting in a representative capacity in court. We have heard that message over and over again in the past five years; yet here at last is a report that clearly shows that not to be the case.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/4">Leaving aside for a moment the problem of the very high rise in costs for certain criminal cases, the evidence appears overwhelmingly to show that the driver of cost increase is the way in which the Government have conducted a number of initiatives&mdash;on reducing crime, streamlining the court service, and introducing procedural changes in criminal justice&mdash;without having any regard for the financial consequences that would flow from those initiatives. That is what the Cape-Moorhead report says. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response to that.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/5">Of course, there are areas where the professions, be it barrister or solicitor, may cost too much. I should have declared an interest: I am a practising barrister, although it is some time since I have done criminal legal aid work, notwithstanding the fact that I recently received a cheque from the Legal Aid Board for 5p for a case that is at least 10 years old.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/6">The hon. and learned Lady discussed silks' pay. Particularly for long cases, criminal silks' pay is disproportionate to and much better than the pay of the junior Bar, where the real crisis is&mdash;I fully acknowledge that. I believe that she quoted a figure of &pound;30,000 for a 20-day trial, but it is worth bearing in mind that, on the basis of 20 working days, the trial would have actually lasted a calendar month and would have required a great deal of preparation if the person were doing their job properly, and that the person was probably bringing at least 20 to 25 years' experience to bear on the case.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/7">The problem is that barristers from all sorts of backgrounds tend to judge themselves and their success by reference to their peers, including those who do not do legal aid work. The hon. and learned Lady may agree with that. It has always been accepted that legal aid work is work that is done at a discount&mdash;there is a long tradition of that&mdash;but if the disparities become too enormous, the profession simply will not attract people who can do the 20-day cases that require silks.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/8">I am standing up for a persecuted minority that attracts little public support, but it is worth bearing in mind the overall amount that they earn relative to other professions. The point was well made about the hourly amount that a barrister in the High Court would be paid by the Government for representing them in civil matters.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/9">I am conscious of the brief time left, so I shall turn to the other aspect: long trials. We await the report on the Jubilee line case, but there is no doubt in my mind that too often public money is wasted and costs are incurred because of poor planning. The point about avoiding very long criminal cases was well made by Lord Woolf. It would be nice to know that the Crown Prosecution Service, admittedly not a service for which the Minister is directly responsible, has taken that on board. My personal experience is that costs are needlessly ratcheted up because the prosecution fails to manage the case properly. Ultimately, the legal aid fund picks up the tab for legal aid cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/10">There is the question of cracked trials. There seems to be an extraordinary notion abroad in the Department for Constitutional Affairs that cracked trials are a conspiracy by the Bar to collect large amounts of money for turning up in court and claiming for preparation time for cases that collapse at the last minute. Cracked trials are a problem and, clearly, are undesirable. It would be much better if defendants would give an early guilty plea so that large amounts of costs could be saved, but, by their nature, defendants in criminal cases are not necessarily the most reliable clients. It is simply a fantasy to think that barristers who have sweated long hours preparing cases for trial go away rejoicing when the trial collapses on day one. They may have expected 25 days in court and may have planned holiday arrangements and a host of other things around the trial. The Government must consider carefully how to provide incentives to prevent cracked trials and how to ensure that barristers are not needlessly penalised when preparation work has been done.</p>

	<p pid="c.91.0/1">Further to my hon. Friend's comments, what often happens is that however hard a barrister may work to resolve a case before it comes to trial and to obtain a guilty plea, if that is the appropriate resolution, he may not be successful because the defendant wants to see whether the witnesses turn up on the day of the trial. In such cases, the cracked trial is not in the barrister's control.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.91.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" speakername="Dominic Grieve" colnum="91"  time="010:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h01.htm#51026h01_spnew16">
	<p pid="c.91.1/1">I agree entirely. My hon. Friend also made compelling points about the extraordinary lottery that can lead to somebody being paid &pound;46 or &pound;1,500 for the same amount of work, depending on what happens on the day that he goes to court.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.1/2">I am sorry that I shall have to discuss the junior Bar far more briefly than I should. There is no doubt that there is a crisis in the junior Bar, particularly at the bottom end of it in relation to the work that it does. I hope that the Government appreciate the magnitude of the problem that has been created. Quite simply, it is not possible for barristers to make ends meet doing criminal work.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.1/3">The demoralisation into which the lower end of the junior Bar has been plunged is such that, while I am not supporting it, the decision to withdraw services was almost inevitable, particularly in the light of the fact that the Government introduced further cuts when the Carter report had not yet come out. I hope that it will be able to shed light and clarity on this difficult area, but the reality is that legal aid criminal work is now so poorly paid for the routine work that eventually the Bar will, I suspect, be driven out of it altogether.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.1/4">If that happens, the Minister will have to answer whether the criminal defence service and paid public defenders will be able to take the work over. The evidence of the Government's pilot scheme is that that is not a cheaper option. My next point again brings me to the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate. It is apparent that competitive tendering for criminal legal aid for solicitors will prove to be similarly disastrous, by driving solicitors out of this type of work as well.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.1/5">The Government face some enormous problems. That said, this has been a constructive debate. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that and respond in that spirit. I am happy to listen to any sensible suggestions that are put forward and fully accept that the kitty is not bottomless.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.1/6">The Government have consistently ignored the warning signs of the crisis in criminal legal aid. They have done some things that were barmy. I gave a perfect example to the hon. and learned Member for Redcar: the vacillations in relation to proceeds of crime and whether those who have huge stashes of money should draw on them for their legal representation or should be entitled to legal aid. The Government have landed themselves in this mess. Some constructive solutions from them would be welcome.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.92.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1682" speakername="Bridget Prentice" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs"  colnum="92"  time="010:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h01.htm#51026h01_spmin0">
	<p pid="c.92.0/1">One hon. Member said that they hoped that I would be listening and that there are two sides to this story. I have listened carefully to everything that has been said. We have heard the side from the legal profession. I rise as the only Member present who is not a legal professional. I am neither a barrister nor a solicitor. It is therefore with some trepidation that I dare to defend the Government's position against so many learned legal professionals.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> on securing this debate, which is an important and a timely one. I listened with great care to her comments, because her views on legal issues generally should be listened to and reflected upon. The response from all sides has been, on the whole, put forward in a reasonable way. However, I fundamentally disagree with many of the points that have been raised, and I will try my best to answer them all.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/3">Let me just set out the Government's position in terms of access to justice. We want it to be at the heart of our social justice agenda. That is why we brought forward measures to protect people's rights in the community through bringing more offenders to justice and clamping down on antisocial behaviour while also ensuring that we safeguard individuals' rights and their access to them through the publicly funded legal aid system. It was a Labour Government who brought in legal aid and advice in 1949 and it is a Labour Government now who want to ensure that legal aid and advice is available, reformed and appropriate for the 21st century. It is one of the ways in which the state reaches out to individuals. I see legal aid as a public service; in the same way as we brought in the national health service in the 1940s, so we brought in legal aid and advice. We have an important and proud tradition. Our criminal and civil legal aid systems are at the centre of how the welfare state works. Just as the NHS exists to guarantee everyone medical care free at the point of use when they need it and the public education system exists to guarantee free education for everyone between the ages of five and 16, so legal aid exists to guarantee everyone the right to a fair trial or to advice on how to pursue redress when they have been wronged.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/4">Legal aid provides that access to justice. For people receiving one of the 116,000 acts of assistance in the higher criminal courts last year, legal aid was crucial in ensuring that they had a voice in that court and that they were able to defend themselves in the eyes of the law. Such people are often the most vulnerable in society and do not have the means to support themselves. For the people who made one of the more than 210,000 calls to the community legal service direct phone line and the people who visited the CLS website, which had 500,000 hits last year, legal aid has made a difference by informing them of their rights under the law.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/5">That is why legal aid is so important to us and why we are taking forward a wide range of work to improve its provision and to ensure that we use our resources effectively. The challenges facing us and the work we must do to meet them are set out in July's &quot;A Fairer Deal for Legal Aid&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/6">I will briefly answer some of the points that have been raised. I assure my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar that I know the difference between the different sections of the junior Bar. We sometimes rather affectionately refer to the very junior Bar as the baby Bar, although we should not be as patronising as that. I understand what happens to those who are new to the profession. I agree with everyone who raised the issue: they are the people who we want to protect and to help. We want to enhance their working experience. That is why we have made some of the changes that we have made.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/7">On the cracks and &quot;guilty&quot; issue, the payment in cracked trials in one to 10-day cases will be for all trial preparation, including the work that would have been done had the trial gone ahead. The only thing that is not paid for is the time that would have been spent at the trial. It is important to make that clear.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/8">A number of people talked about case management. We are working hard to get it. I am just sorry that the Bar wanted to have extra money to take part in the pilots that we put forward. It was a pity that it was not prepared to participate.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/9">A number of hon. Members also mentioned the costs of the extra laws that have come into force and the new offences. As a result of my discussions with the Legal Aid Practitioners Group, we now have, alongside the regulatory impact test, a legal aid impact test. Any Department that puts forward a new law that includes an offence where there is a possible need for legal aid for an individual will now have to have that assessment made before the legislation is introduced. I reassure hon. Members that that was done as a result of discussion with practitioners.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/10">I cannot tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> how many failed prosecutions there are. If we can get that figure, I will write to him and to others.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1791" name="Jeremy Wright">The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright)</phrase> talked about the junior Bar not minding redistribution. I agree with him. We want that redistribution and that is part of what the Carter review will be about. Nothing will be done about compulsory price competitive tendering until Lord Carter has reported. We have put forward a timetable if Lord Carter, who will examine it, decides that it merits continuation. I assure the House that that is all part of the package within Lord Carter's remit. When he reports at the end of January, we will have the time to decide how to take the matter forward.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.94.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" speakername="Phyllis Starkey" colnum="94"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h02.htm#51026h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="c.94.1/1">I thank Mr. Speaker for allocating me this debate on Palestine. I asked for it because I believe that the course of the Israel-Palestine conflict is yet again at a critical stage and that decisive action is required now by the international community if disaster is to be avoided. What I am about to say has been informed by a visit that I made to the region in September. I draw the attention of hon. Members to an entry on the Register of Members' Interests. My flight to the region and stay in Israel were funded by the Anglo-Israel Association and my accommodation and travel in Palestine were funded by various local non-governmental organisations that are linked to the United Kingdom charity, Interpal.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.1/2">I was extremely fortunate that my visit was timed for the few days after the Israeli disengagement from Gaza, but before the rockets were fired from Gaza by Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the renewed assassinations by the Israeli Defence Force and the killings of settlers by Palestinian terrorists. I was there during a week when tension was lower than it had been before or after.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.1/3">The visit was my first since 2001. The situation as I saw it gave me grounds for both optimism and pessimism. I would like to be a Pollyanna and regard the Gaza disengagement as a positive step towards the implementation of the road map and a stable and equitable settlement that would be good for Israelis and Palestinians. However, I fear that it would be much more realistic to be a Cassandra and to warn instead that the Gaza withdrawal is insufficient and that the continued Israeli annexation of Palestinian land on the west bank and Jerusalem is leading to a completely different outcome. It would result in an apartheid state entirely under Israel's control, with the majority of Palestinians corralled into Bantustans in Gaza and the west bank, separated from each other and with no real sovereignty, with the Palestinian Authority reduced to policing the Palestinian areas on behalf of the Israelis.</p>

	<p pid="c.94.3/1">I shall not give way. I have little time. It is not usual in these debates to give way and I do not intend to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/2">That vision was set out clearly by the Israelis. In 1993, the then Prime Minister Rabin said:</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/3" class="indent">&quot;I prefer the Palestinians to cope with the problem of enforcing order in the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians will be better at it than we&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/4">the Israelis&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/5" class="indent">&quot;because they will allow no appeals to the Supreme Court . . . They will rule by their own methods, freeing . . . the Israeli army soldiers from having to do what they will do&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/6">It seems that Prime Minister Sharon is carrying forward the vision that was set out originally by Prime Minister Rabin.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/7">I am warning against the apartheid state solution because not only is it unjust for the Palestinians, but it is ultimately unsustainable and therefore not in the long-term interests of the Israelis. I wish to make it clear that I accept that Israel has the same right as every other state to protect the security of its citizens, even those who are illegally occupying land in the west bank. However, Israel's right, as with every other state, must be exercised within international law and not, as is too often the case, in complete disregard of the rights of others, notably the Palestinians.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/8">During my stay in Israel, I found that many Israelis, even liberal Israelis, seemed unaware of either the reality in the occupied territories&mdash;the huge depth of poverty and the dangerous well of resentment that is building up there&mdash;or the international community's view of the situation.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/9">In Israel, I was given the national parks authority map, which shows Israel including&mdash;without any internal borders whatsoever&mdash;all the Palestinian territory and the Golan heights, which are occupied Syrian territory. Most Israelis appear to think that those are Israel's accepted borders, but they are not accepted by anyone else. Israelis need to understand that.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/10">I shall start by describing the situation as I saw it in Gaza. The Israeli authorities helpfully demonstrated on my arrival at the crossing point at Erez who really controls Gaza; they kept me waiting there from 8 am until past 4 pm, even though I had an invitation from President Abbas, before suddenly deciding to let me through.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/11">When I arrived in Gaza, I found the atmosphere extremely mixed. On the one hand, there was a huge sense of elation and liberation because all the settlers and Israel Defence Force soldiers had gone. To give people here a feel for what that feels like for ordinary people there, I should say that I visited the rehabilitation hospital, which has a lovely, wheelchair-accessible garden. For the first time, patients and visitors were enjoying that garden completely free from the fear that they would be shot at by IDF snipers; on a previous occasion, two nurses at the hospital had been killed by the IDF.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/12">There were huge rallies all over the place. As we were driving through Gaza, we happened upon an enormous rally organised by Hamas in one of the settlements. Thousands of women and children were pouring in, as tourists in their own territory, to see what the abandoned Israeli settlements were like.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/13">A huge crowd was preparing a rally for the next day down at the Rafah border close to Egypt, in the wasteland that the Israelis, having demolished more than 2,000 homes, had created. After that, my hosts drove me back along the length of Gaza, up the Salah al-Din Road from Rafah to Erez. That was the first time in 16 years that my hosts, who were Gazans, had been able to drive up that road from one end to the other without risking being shot at by the IDF. So there was a huge feeling of liberation.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/14">There is also an optimism in the degree of political consensus, notwithstanding the continued internal security problems and the continued conflict between the armed factions. Even Hamas is hinting that it may accept the two-state solution and recognise Israel, as did the Palestinian Authority in the Oslo agreement. There is a consensus between all factions, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, on how the settlement land is to be used for the benefit of the whole population to provide for homes and employment. When I met members of the legislative council, they were absolutely insistent that all factions must be able to participate in the elections due in January so that they can build a pluralist and civil society. However, they also stressed that a true democracy needs economic stability.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/15">That brings me to the other, pessimistic side of Gaza. There was widespread despair at the desperate situation of most people there and the lack of solutions. Seventy per cent. of the people are under the poverty line and there is huge unemployment. Living costs are extremely high and are effectively set by Israel. For example, the gas that people use for cooking costs 10 times more than in Egypt because it has an Israeli price, yet people in Gaza are on poverty wages, if they have any at all.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/16">There was a feeling that the settlements had been left like dead bodies, as they were described, for the Palestinians to clean up. The occupation has left an army of the handicapped and disabled; education and health services are overstretched; and schools have 60 to 70 children in a class and often run two sessions. The refugee camps are unimaginably poor and discharge raw sewage directly into the sea. I do not know how the people in the refugee camps survive, as they seem to have no income at all, but are totally dependent on charity and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/17">The Israelis continue to control Gaza. They control the register of all births, and whom can be given Palestinian citizenship. That means that refugees who returned from Jordan after the Oslo agreement and husbands and wives applying under family reunion rules are left in limbo with no citizenship whatsoever.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/18">The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the World Bank both agree that although the Palestinian economy is soaking up huge levels of aid from the international community, that aid is simply mitigating the effects of the Israeli blockade. Not only is the international community effectively subsidising the costs of the occupation and relieving Israel, as the occupying power, of the need to provide for the Palestinians; the Israeli economy actually benefits from those donor funds because 45 per cent. of every dollar of aid for the Palestinians is spent in Israel. From 2000 to 2004, the aid doubled to almost $1 billion a year, but because of the curfews and closures actual personal incomes in Palestine fell by 40 per cent. The economy can recover only if external borders are opened, internal borders between Gaza and the west bank are relaxed and Palestinian labour is allowed into Israel. However, Israel continues to control completely all the borders of Gaza, including that with Egypt and the sea and the air borders, which are still not open more than a month after the disengagement.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/19">Even the Quartet's middle east envoy, James Wolfensohn, who is hardly a dangerous liberal, was particularly scathing about Israel's delaying tactics and failure even to allow free movement at Rafah between Gaza and Egypt. He said that the occupation continues, despite the disengagement, because the Israelis are still controlling all the borders.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/20">If I found a mix of optimism and pessimism in Gaza, among Palestinians in the west bank and Jerusalem I found unremitting pessimism. The Israeli Government continue to build the so-called security wall on Palestinian territory. It is twice the length of the green line border and has appropriated an additional 10 per cent. of the west bank and imprisoned nearly 50,000 Palestinians between the wall and the green line. These people have to have permits from the Israelis to live in their own homes.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/21">On <phrase class="date" code="">18 October</phrase>, <i>The Guardian</i> set out the scale of the Israeli land grab: 23 square miles of land has been appropriated on the west bank since July, which more than offsets the land evacuated in Gaza, with 14,000 additional settlers in the illegal settlements on the west bank, which is 65 per cent. more than the number that left Gaza. The Israeli Government are pursuing a deliberate policy of squeezing Palestinians out of Jerusalem. The city is being encircled by expanded illegal settlements and cut off from its natural hinterland in the west bank. I was really shocked by the depth of despair of the Jerusalemites I met. They are Palestinians who in the past have been the most liberal and open to engagement with Israel. I found them more depressed than the Palestinians whom I met in Gaza. They are depressed by the expansion of the settlements, which are killing Arab east Jerusalem economically and excluding many people with Jerusalem identity cards from their own city.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/22">The wall has arbitrarily cut through neighbourhoods, including the Ar Ram neighbourhood, and removed people from Jerusalem. Without moving, they are no longer living in Jerusalem. The UN estimates that a quarter of the 230,000 Palestinians who currently have Jerusalem ID cards have been excluded from Jerusalem by the wall and risk having their ID cards confiscated. Many people are caught in the situation where if they do not live in Jerusalem their ID card is confiscated and if they do not have a Jerusalem ID card, even the land they own in Jerusalem is confiscated.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/23">The Israelis continue to demolish houses. One person took me to his huge family house, which he had built with all his savings and which has now been shut up by Israeli order because a demolition order is going through the courts. He and his family of seven are squashed into a two-room flat because they cannot live in their own house. Fourteen of his neighbours' houses have already been demolished and the excuse is that planning permission has been refused because the planning framework has not been finalised, but the framework process was started by the Israelis in 1992. It is clear that they have no intention of ever drawing up a planning framework so that they can always say that buildings are being built without permission.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/24">Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem are being threatened. The al-Quds medical school has had students marooned in Gaza for the past four years with patients unable to reach clinics and medical students unable to access the other main hospitals. I was told of rumours suggesting that the Israelis will introduce a new law to outlaw Jerusalem institutions from employing people with west bank permits. If that were carried through, it would mean that the al-Makassed hospital would lose 50 per cent. of its staff and the Industrial secondary school, which I visited, would lose 41 of its 54 employees, many of whom have worked there for decades. The Israelis are currently trying to bribe that institution out of Jerusalem. They have offered to pay for its relocation to the west bank.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/25">There was an unmistakable feeling among all the people I met in Jerusalem that things were getting so bad&mdash;with no hope of improvement and no attention, they felt, from the international community&mdash;that violence was the only way out. That is a dangerous feeling to be growing within Jerusalem's Palestinian population.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/26">On the west bank, the expansion of settlements and the continuation of checkpoints and road blocks are making people's lives a misery. They interfere with the free movement of Palestinians to school, university, hospitals and work. Even when the checkpoints are open, people do not feel confident that they will not be closed arbitrarily, leaving them trapped on the wrong side. People's movements are heavily controlled as a result. I could go on to describe all the other instances that I came across in the various towns of the west bank. I want to get over to people the dangerous atmosphere that is building up within the Palestinian population because they feel that there is no hope of improvement and that they are being left with only one outlet: violence.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/27">That situation is hugely dangerous, both for the Palestinians and the Israelis. Ordinary Palestinians can see with their own eyes that the current Israeli Government are creating facts on the ground that will completely rule out a viable and contiguous Palestinian state. They can see that they are going to be offered only a series of disconnected Bantustans, totally under the control of Israel and totally dependent on it. They fear, in particular, that the whole of Jerusalem, including the al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock, will be lost to them.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/28">Even in Gaza, the Israelis are failing to offer any semblance of real autonomy or sovereignty. People can see no chance of the poverty of people in Gaza being reduced. The current Israeli strategy is leaving ordinary Palestinians with no hope for any improvement for their future and is undercutting moderates in the Palestinian community who want to find a negotiated solution. People such as President Abbas have almost nothing to show to Palestinians as an example of what has been delivered through the negotiation route. Instead, negotiation seems to have delivered a worse and worse lifestyle for Palestinians. As I say, the temptation is for more and more Palestinians to conclude that violence is the only answer.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/29">The British Government, the European Union and the rest of the Quartet are committed to a two-state solution based on the road map and the relevant UN resolutions. The Minister has recently reiterated in a series of written parliamentary answers the UK position on the illegality of all the settlements and our opposition to any further land grab by the Israelis. The international community and significant parts of Israeli society believe that disengagement from Gaza should be the first step towards that two-state solution, but if that is to have any chance of success, the international community needs to put effective pressure on the Israeli Government now to stop them taking action that makes the two-state solution impossible. It is not credible for the international community to continue to ignore the annexation of Palestinian land, and it is even less credible to suggest that the wall and the settlements will be dismantled at some point in the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/30">Israel constantly claims to be the only democracy in the middle east, but if the current Israeli Government are permitted to continue to expropriate Palestinian land, encircle east Jerusalem and deprive Palestinians of their right to live in and have access to the holy city&mdash;which is the holy city not only of Jews, but of Muslims and Christians&mdash;they will destroy Israel's right to make that claim. An apartheid state where Palestinians are in enclaves that are nominally autonomous but actually under the control of Israel, and where Palestinians are excluded from participation in Israel's democracy, will not be a democracy in any recognisable sense. Furthermore, such a solution will not ensure Israel's security; it will be a recipe for continued violence.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/31">For that reason, if the Government are to continue to be a friend to both Israel and Palestine, they must take action now to ensure that Israel complies with its obligations under the road map. Britain and the European Union must use every bit of leverage that they have, including financial leverage, to pressure the Israelis to stop expropriating Palestinian land; for example, they could suspend the EU-Israel trade association.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.3/32">There must be a speedy agreement by the Israelis&mdash;in line with the obligations that they are asked to fulfil by Mr. Wolfensohn&mdash;to the opening of access to and from Gaza, and there must be freedom of movement across the west bank and into and out of Jerusalem. Palestinians must be readmitted to the road network in the west bank; it is currently reserved for Israel's illegal settlers. In addition, the UK and the EU need to undertake public diplomacy, and explain directly to the Israeli people the cul-de-sac down which the Israeli Government's policies are leading them.</p>

	<p pid="c.99.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> on bringing this important subject to this Chamber. The situation in Israel and the occupied territories&mdash;Gaza and the west bank&mdash;is of deep concern to Members of all parties, and not least to my hon. Friend, whose long-standing and energetic engagement on this issue I salute. She has given us a comprehensive report of her recent visit to the area. I have also been there. In fact, I was there until 11.30 last night, when I got on a plane in Cairo.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.0/2">In the few minutes available to me, let me make it clear that the middle east peace process will remain a priority for the Government. As my hon. Friend rightly points out, the conflict is now at a critical stage. A just and lasting solution is crucial for the Palestinian people and for the Israeli people, as my hon. Friend has made clear, as well as for broader prospects of long-term peace for the whole middle east.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.0/3">My hon. Friend raised a number of important issues. Because of the shortage of time, let me say to her and others in this Chamber that she is right to emphasise the need for urgent action to begin rebuilding the economy of Gaza. It distressed many of us to see how the greenhouses were looted at disengagement, although perhaps we can understand it. That was an act of incredible stupidity, because perhaps as many as 10,000 people were employed in those greenhouses. I was glad to hear over the past couple of weeks that the Saudis and Israelis, among others, have put money into replacing the components of the greenhouses that were looted and sold off, presumably on the streets of Gaza. That employment will start up again in time for the planting season, which is very important as we need all the jobs we can get.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.0/4">As my hon. Friend will know, Abu Mazen and the Palestinian Authority have stated that they want to create 30,000 jobs in Gaza by Christmas. Some of that is wishful thinking&mdash;there is no question about that&mdash;but on where the finance for that scheme will come from, let me say this: I know one oil-producing Arab country that will have a budget surplus this year of no less than $140 billion. One per cent. of that would go an awfully long way to helping the Palestinian Authority and Jim Wolfensohn's team do what is necessary in Gaza and the west bank to start reviving that economy. And it can be revived; there is no question about that.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.0/5">I was in Ramallah three weeks ago. I had not been there for 13 years, and I did not recognise it. It was full of flashy apartments. Where did the money come from? A prominent Palestinian told me, &quot;Well, we've had a decade and a half of chronic, corrosive corruption.&quot; That is where the money has come from. Year after year, the donor countries gave money to the Palestine Liberation Organisation, and what happened to it? It was used to pay off Arafat's cronies, and a lot of it ended up in bank accounts in Zurich and in property. It is a disgrace.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.0/6">One of the most heartening things I discovered as I travelled around the area recently is that there is no more talk of Arafat as some kind of unblemished hero. There is a recognition that that corruption and the form of government that was in place did no good for those Palestinians who want to create a viable future. I agree with my hon. Friend: we are at what the Americans call a tipping point, and a new and important consciousness is abroad in the west bank and Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.0/7">My hon. Friend spoke eloquently of the need for dialogue to include the Israelis in a real way. When I visited the area a few weeks ago, I did not want to talk only to the Israeli Government and their advisers in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. I also went to a kibbutz, because I wanted to talk to the old lefties&mdash;for want of a better term&mdash;who had started that movement. It is important to remember that the movement was created because it was seen as a way of enabling Israelis and Palestinians to live and work together. The kibbutz I visited was on the old Jerusalem road, and during a meal I had with some of the remarkable people there, they reluctantly but clearly stated, &quot;Yes, we are terribly sorry in some ways that we have the barrier.&quot; It is a wall in some places and a fence in others, but it is very effective and has cut to a remarkable extent the number of suicide bombs going off, and it has improved the ability of the Israeli people to defend themselves to the west of the wall.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.0/8">However, my hon. Friend is right to emphasise the effect of the building of that barrier in and around Jerusalem and in other areas. It is ironic that it is the Israeli High Court that has upheld the objections of some of the Palestinians who have had the courage to question and challenge the route of the barrier. They are brave people, and they have shown the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.0/9">Something else is interesting. When I visited the area, I looked at that barrier for some time. It is an awesome thing. It lacks the architectural advantages of the Great Wall of China, but it is about as difficult to cross. I realised that it not only makes life difficult for Palestinians, who are the ones who suffer most from it, but divides a city in a way that inconveniences a lot of Israelis very considerably. It is changing the quality of life in that city. There are parts of Jerusalem where Palestinians and Israelis have clearly got along very well, and it grieves me that there will now be such a great division between those communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.0/10">Even at this late stage, I hope that the Israelis will understand that we are serious when we say to them, &quot;This is an illegal activity.&quot; They should not be cutting off parts of Palestine so that people cannot visit their relatives, travel easily between work and home or travel from the southern part of the occupied territories in the west bank to the northern.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.0/11">We want Israel to have the right to exist and to defend its citizens; we do not want them to walk in fear of terrorists. I believe Abu Mazen wants that as well. He is the only show in town. That is the truth of the situation, and we must all realise that, whether we are Arab donor countries, western donor countries or anyone else who is involved in this process.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.0/12">I congratulate my hon. Friend on bringing this matter to our attention, and I hope we all benefit from the debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.0/13">Sitting suspended until half-past Two o'clock.</p>

	Child Support Agency
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.102.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="102"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h03.htm#51026h03_spnew0">
	<p pid="c.102.1/1">I am pleased to have the opportunity to debate the Child Support Agency and its performance. I must admit that my initial motivation for asking for the debate was a deep and prolonged sense of frustration over my dealings with the CSA as a constituency MP. I am sure that I am not the only Member whose heart sinks when the three little letters &quot;CSA&quot; are spoken at a surgery. Almost invariably, I am faced with parents at the end of their tether, and frequently children are used to get back at an ex-spouse.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/2">Clearly, the agency cannot be held responsible for the individual morality problem that exacerbates whatever else is happening, but it can be held responsible for the inconsistency and delays that are integral to dealing with the CSA. Although the debate is reasonably well attended for one in this Chamber, I am surprised that so few Members are here. Perhaps my experience is unique, but I have been led to believe that other Members share similar experiences to mine.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/3">I shall use a few constituency cases to highlight some problems that I have encountered, but it is first worth picking up on the Work and Pensions Committee report on the CSA. It was written in January 2004 and things have not improved. The Committee described the CSA as</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/4" class="indent">&quot;a failing organisation which is currently in crisis.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/5">Management was criticised, problems with accuracy and the IT system were highlighted, and the Committee concluded that much greater focus should be placed on compliance and enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/6">When more than &pound;1 billion of maintenance is written off in one year, it is clear that the problems are large scale. I wholeheartedly support the Committee's recommendation, because the most frustrating cases for a constituency MP are those where one parent is not receiving money from the other. In those circumstances, the second parents often find a way to buck the system&mdash;or they think they have&mdash;when it is just a matter of the problem not having been investigated.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/7">The Government's response to the report was that compliance had reached 75 per cent. We can argue about those figures all we like&mdash;numerous tables have shown that compliance is probably less than 75 per cent.&mdash;but even if that percentage is correct, it is far from good enough because it means that the system is not working for a quarter of cases. As the CSA provides a service for approximately 1,430,00 cases, that means that each MP deals with about 2,250 cases, so hon. Members will understand why I am surprised that more of us are not present today. More than 500 of those cases will be non-compliant.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/8">Parliamentary questions have revealed that my estimate of non-compliance could be conservative. Some estimates show that more than 400,000 people resist payment, while one alarming analysis showed that only 271 members of staff are designated to deal with the problem of non-compliance. That means that each member of staff has a case load of about 1,550 cases, so it is hardly surprising that so few cases are resolved. It is a small miracle that there are not many more CSA cases at our surgeries.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/9">It came as no great surprise to anyone that at the recent Labour party conference the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions promised root and branch reform&mdash;it has been promised for years, but has not happened&mdash;and admitted that the current operation is a complete shambles.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/10">Some problems have arisen because of a change from the old child support scheme to a new, simpler model. The old scheme was complex, and more than 100 pieces of information were required to make a full assessment. The Child Support Act 1999 established the new scheme, which is designed to work on a simple percentage of the non-resident parent's net income. The non-resident parent pays 15 per cent. for one child, 20 per cent. for two children and 25 per cent. for three or more children. Maintenance is reduced if the non-resident parent has a second family, is on a low income or shares overnight caring responsibilities for the child with the parent with care. The simpler scheme made provision for maintenance arrangements to be established within six weeks, and there was supposed to be greater focus on ensuring compliance.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/11">Unfortunately, the scheme was delayed several times because of IT problems. It was initially planned for the end of 2001, but was finally introduced, for new cases only, from <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-03">3 March 2003</phrase>. The idea was to bring existing cases forward once the system was working well, but there is some evidence that, to try to make the initial figures look good, a large number of supposedly simple and straightforward cases were stockpiled so that they could be processed quickly under the new scheme. Many of them are still waiting somewhere in the system. It would be useful if the Minister elaborated on what is being done to deal with that backlog.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/12">Constituency cases highlight interesting problems. A woman with three children left her husband because of his violent behaviour. She worked hard to pay off the family debts while the father consistently refused to pay maintenance through the CSA. The two older sons are now grown up, and the younger son has decided to live with his father. Hon. Members can probably guess what is coming next. The ex-husband has claimed child maintenance from his ex-wife through the CSA. He is perfectly entitled to do that under existing regulations. However, although the ex-wife is owed &pound;10,000 after approximately eight years of non-payment, &pound;42 a week is deducted at source from her wages now that she is required to make CSA payments. She must pay the money.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/13">The flaw in the system is that the two cases are treated entirely independently and cannot be linked in any way. I was hoping that the CSA would be sympathetic to my constituent's plight, as she has struggled for years to find the money to support her sons, but it said that its main concern was for the child's welfare. Understandably, my constituent took great exception to the implication that she was not considering her child's welfare, as she had taken on that responsibility for eight years.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/14">I urge the Minister to ensure that a compliant parent is not treated with what I can only regard as a complete lack of sympathy by the CSA in cases where there is a huge outstanding debt. In future, there ought to be some way of linking such cases so that the debt can be taken into account. The reality is that the compliant parent would probably spend some of the money on the children anyway. It is almost as if they are being doubly penalised.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/15">The case gets worse. The CSA was considering court action against the ex-husband as long ago as 2000, and it confirmed that it was still considering court action in 2002, but it appears not to have taken any action to recover the money, despite being given a great deal of information by my constituent as to where the ex-husband worked, how he earned his money and even how he was evading notice.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/16">I also have a case of a woman on a low income who was paying a small amount of money in maintenance under the old rules. The father contacted her, ostensibly to say that it would be easier to forget the payment as the amount was so small. This woman understood her ex-husband rather well and realised that that sudden turn of generosity was somewhat out of character. So she was suspicious. She checked with the CSA and was told, &quot;Don't worry about it, he won't be able to claim back. There is a time limit, so there is nothing to worry about.&quot; Unfortunately, she was not given the complete picture. As soon as the 13-week time limit expired, a new claim was submitted and my constituent became liable for greatly increased payments.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/17">The new legislation may have an unintended consequence. As women are traditionally less well paid, when they pay maintenance, as happens in a small number of cases, they will often, under the new rules, become liable for a higher proportion of their low wage&mdash;a large amount of money&mdash;because of the percentages involved. In a couple of my cases, the women have become the victims of circumstances being changed in such a way by the man. It would be interesting if the Minister told us whether he is alert to that problem. Has any work been done to assess the impact on low-paid women who are liable for payments to the CSA?</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/18">The most commonly encountered problem is payment processing being subject to unacceptable delays. A case of mine involves a woman whose partner was, happily, making payments to the CSA. Unfortunately, the computer was unable to process the payments, although in this particular case I am not sure why. Last year, however, I had an interesting case in which the excuse for the inability of the computer to recognise the sort code was that it began with a zero. Perhaps I am being naive, but we are talking about an IT system for large amounts of money. It should not be that difficult to tweak things so that a sort code beginning with zero can be recognised.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/19">Small problems such as that should be surmountable. They are obviously a source of deep frustration. The woman I mentioned was told that a manual payment would have to be set up and that that would take 13 weeks. That originally meant that she would have had to wait until Christmas for the money, but staff at my constituency office were very pleased when they were told that she would be paid by the end of October. I take no credit for that, as they arranged it. However, this very constituent was on the phone only this morning, after I had written this speech, to say she had received a letter informing her that there would be a further five-week delay in processing the money.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/20">I have to ask the Minister how long it takes to generate a letter or process a manual payment. It seems to me that a lot of time is wasted sending out letters to people saying that there is going to be a further delay. It would also be helpful if he said what measures are being taken to increase staff numbers, albeit temporarily, to try to clear the backlog of cases so that we can get on an even keel.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/21">From my reading in preparation for this debate, I understand that for only two months of the past couple of years has the CSA processed a greater number of cases than came in. That imbalance cannot continue and it would help us all, as constituency MPs, if we knew what is to be done to resolve the problem. It may be due to yet another queue for the CSA, or an administrative nightmare, but we are talking about people's lives.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/22">My constituent said, &quot;To top the lot, I now have to go to court for non-payment of council tax because all my money is sitting at the CSA. I have to feed and clothe my children, and something had to give. I could not afford to do it all.&quot; Given the knock-on effects that delays cause, the issue must be resolved sooner rather than later.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/23">In many cases, one-parent families are involved. The One Parent Families organisation has raised a number of concerns. In a briefing to me, it stated that the average clearing time for new cases is now 25 weeks and that 31 per cent. of cases take more than six months. During that time, families often do without money that they can ill afford not to have. It also claimed that 78,000 old-scheme cases were still awaiting reassessment from before 2003, and that a further stockpile of new cases had accumulated in the six months or so before the new scheme began. If the Minister clarified that it would be helpful.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/24">A major part of the organisation's complaint involves the lack of focus on compliance enforcement in 2004&ndash;05. Overdue maintenance apparently more than doubled over the previous year, from &pound;35.16 million to &pound;88.9 million. That figure is rising, and it appears that little is being done to reverse the trend. However, during the same year only &pound;8 million in arrears was collected by enforcement schemes. That gives the signal to those who do not want to pay that it is easy to buck the system and get away with it.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.1/25">There were also problems with a lack of consistency. Even if people are lucky enough to have their telephone call answered&mdash;a recent press report suggested that more than 1 million calls to the CSA did not get through, so callers just gave up&mdash;staff are not accountable and often do not follow up on any actions promised. I have consistently noticed that in my role as a constituency MP.</p>

	<p pid="c.105.0/1">That is an important point. I cannot imagine that many people who have phoned the CSA have not had the experience of being unable to get through. I believe it is now giving out a special telephone number to MPs so that they can get access, but that does not help the great majority of the general public, who have as much constitutional right in this respect as we do. All I can do is echo everything the hon. Lady has just said.</p>

	<p pid="c.106.0/1">I think we have probably all met Fred Chase at some stage. He did a sterling job in trying to hold things together in respect of Members of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.106.0/2">One thing I have noticed about the CSA is that there is a reluctance to put anything in writing to a Member of Parliament. CSA staff would much rather talk and promise something, so that we do not have anything in writing to hold against them. That has changed a little recently, and I have been pressing for answers to my letters, but they rarely arrive within 28 days and frequently have to be chased up. The service to MPs is not good enough, and if an MP gets that kind of service, what chance does a member of the public have of getting good service?</p>
	<p pid="c.106.0/3">If people manage to get hold of a member of staff, it is common for an action not to be followed up. In one press report, CSA staff came clean and said, &quot;The pressure is so great that we sometimes just divert the call to the answer phone of a colleague who is on holiday, because we have then got it off our desk.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.106.0/4">There seems to be an endemic problem that probably stems from management and leadership difficulties. Again, the culture of the CSA needs to be seriously addressed. When information is given to the CSA about the actions or financial status of non-resident parents, that is not acted on frequently enough and people simply give up.</p>
	<p pid="c.106.0/5">Let me highlight how inefficient the UK system is. For every pound we spend on administration, &pound;1.86 is collected. The equivalent agency in Australia collects more than &pound;8 for every pound invested by the taxpayer. It is clear that a lot more can be done to make us perform better. Lots of solutions have been proposed, from scrapping the CSA completely to involving the Revenue in collection.</p>
	<p pid="c.106.0/6">The computers, the management and so forth can be blamed&mdash;indeed, there is much to be blamed for&mdash;but it appears that no solutions are being offered. Sadly, many people are coming to the conclusion that the CSA is the biggest administrative disaster in the history of the welfare state.</p>

	<p pid="c.106.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> on securing the debate, which is of vast importance to all Members. I do not think that any party political points will be made today&mdash;the focus will be on genuine concerns. I believe that there would be more Members present if it were not for the fact that the debate on the Terrorism Bill clashes with this debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.106.1/2">Before I was elected as a Member, I was not really aware of there being any problems with the CSA.&mdash;[<i>Laughter.</i>] As a new Member I can say that. This is one of those issues that does not affect the general public, but deeply affects the people involved. When a family is going through a break-up, the worst thing that can happen is added tension caused by the CSA.</p>
	<p pid="c.106.1/3">I thought that the best thing that I could do today was to bring forward some cases that were brought to my weekly surgery last Friday. It is a somewhat random approach, but I had three relevant cases. I hope that the Minister will take on board the issues that these cases raise and try to address them in some way.</p>
	<p pid="c.106.1/4">I shall start with case A, and will use the words of the lady concerned, because she puts it far better than I could. She says:</p>
	<p pid="c.106.1/5" class="indent">&quot;CSA tell me they are following rules that my ex-partner can reduce his payments because he has moved into a house with another lady who has 2 children. Her children are supported by her ex so why should my child go without, with her Dad being able to reduce payments?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.106.1/6">The payments that she receives have gone down from &pound;218 per month to &pound;167. Clearly, that issue needs to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="c.106.1/7">Case B highlights a different area. The lady concerned and her husband broke up on relatively good terms. They were obviously very concerned for the welfare of their children and set up a court order. Everything was working well; the lady was receiving the money and there was access to the child. Then the CSA overruled the court order, and as a result there are now huge arrears, which the lady appears to have no chance of recovering. On top of that, her income was reduced dramatically by the CSA becoming involved. Her complaint was that a whole year went by between when the court order was overruled by the CSA, and anything being done by the CSA. It was during that year that the arrears built up. She is very concerned about the efficiency of the CSA.</p>
	<p pid="c.106.1/8">However, the most worrying example is case C. Hon. Members should bear in mind that these three people all came along last Friday&mdash;I did not select them. The hon. Member for Romsey mentioned that it was often the lady who does not receive the money to which she is entitled, and I know that that is a big issue. However, there are also issues on the other side.</p>
	<p pid="c.106.1/9">The gentleman in case C split up with his wife and, between 1999 and 2003, he was making payments to the CSA, from an attachment to his earnings. There is no question about that&mdash;there is proof. He can show it from his wage slips, and the CSA has confirmed it. Lo and behold, one day, his mother, who is in her 70s, said, &quot;I have got a bailiff at the door, demanding &pound;8,979.61 for CSA arrears.&quot; Bear in mind that this gentleman had always made his payments to the CSA. He had had no notification through the courts; he had received no letters or anything else relating to the bailiff's visit. He does not live at the house where the bailiffs served the notice. He has moved in with another lady and they are intending to marry. They were nearly in tears: they may have to sell their house to repay some money that they do not owe. To get the bailiffs off their back, they had to make a payment of &pound;5,000, and agree to a weekly payment of &pound;100. That is outrageous, and is clearly due to the incompetence of the CSA. Although I picked that case at random, it is one of the worst cases that I have come across.</p>
	<p pid="c.106.1/10">At every weekly surgery, I will encounter at least three CSA problems. For those people, the problem is desperate. I have had people crying in my surgeries because of the CSA's actions. I make no political points here and I am not sure of the solution.</p>
	<p pid="c.106.1/11">The agency interferes in people's lives, seems to create a great deal of tension and does not provide the money correctly. I wonder whether it is one of those situations where the whole thing has gone too far and we might be better off scrapping it and going back to the previous system of letting the courts be involved. That would have been better for one of the constituents who came to see me. I am not saying that that is necessarily the right approach, but does the Minister think that we have reached that stage? I am sure that he will acknowledge that there are problems with the CSA. Does he think that root-and-branch reform is possible or has the CSA had its time?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.108.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" speakername="Michael Weir" colnum="108"  time="014:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h03.htm#51026h03_spnew4">
	<p pid="c.108.0/1">It is hard to overestimate the anguish that the Child Support Agency is causing throughout the country, both to parents with care and to absent parents. Worst of all, as has been hinted at, the very people whom it is failing most are the children whom it was supposed to help.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/2">Every Member will have filing cabinets full of cases involving the CSA. We have heard from previous speakers details of some of their cases. Such cases are by far and away the largest component of my caseload, although complaints about tax credits are fast coming up on the outside.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/3">It is important to note that the fault lies not with the staff of the agency, who are struggling under unbearable burdens and a caseload with which they simply cannot cope. I appreciate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" name="David Davies">the comments made by the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies)</phrase> about getting through to the agency, but when people from my office and I get through we have found the staff to be unfailingly helpful.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/4">A sense of frustration comes through from the agency staff, however, about what they are having to put up with&mdash;for example, the fact that the computer system does not work. How often have Members sat at the end of a phone when someone has been trying to get information out of a computer, but has been unable to answer a question because they could not get the computer to work?</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/5">That is not helped by the fact that it appears that several different systems are running in tandem within the CSA: the old computer system; the new computer system; a manual payment system; and a hybrid mechanism between a computer and manual payment system. None of them seems to work efficiently.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/6">A lady came to see me at a recent surgery in Brechin. She was being paid manually, but she had to phone every week to chase up the payment and to remind the agency to pay it into her bank account. That is not how the agency should operate and it is not acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/7">The problems of the agency are legion and go back to    its foundation by the previous Conservative Government. I have dealt with the agency from both sides, because I was a solicitor prior to being elected to the House. I used to deal with child support cases prior to the agency. I remember that when it was being set up a meeting was held in my area. We were told by the officials of the fledgling agency that the legal system was too slow, that solicitors took far too long in dealing with cases and that the agency would speed up the process. It was painfully clear, even at that time, that it was woefully understaffed and underfunded, and that it would not be able to do that which was claimed.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/8">The agency seemed to think that everyone who was being asked for money would cheerfully fill in the forms and pay out whatever was assessed. It seemed to have no appreciation of the lengths to which some absent parents would go to avoid payment. Those of us who had dealt with this matter under the old system knew full well what was going to happen when the agency was set up. Indeed, when I inquired as to what it would do with people who did not return the form, it transpired that in the whole of Angus only one lady was to be charged with helping people fill out forms, going out on visits and chasing up unreturned forms. It was completely unrealistic from the outset.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/9">The agency has never got over those initial problems. A good idea in principle was undermined from the outset by the rushed way in which it was introduced. Last year, I asked a series of questions about the agency because I was becoming increasingly concerned about cases that were coming to my constituency surgeries. I recognise what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase> said, because my experience is the same. It is frustrating at surgeries when parents are in tears because they are unable to make progress and are at the end of their tether and depressed by their situation.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/10">When I asked a question about arrears, I was told that in my constituency alone, which is mainly rural and not huge, there were 600 cases of arrears outstanding for more than three months and 26,000 in the whole of Scotland. That is appalling and is not helped by the fact that compliance often just does not take place. I was struck by what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> said about the matter and I find exactly the same: that lack of effective compliance may continue for years. The information is given to the agency but no action seems to be taken. The person who has care of the child has to turn private detective to get together the information to give to the agency, and then finds that nothing seems to be done with that information. That is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/11">The stop-start attitude of the agency when it starts compliance action is even worse. It starts an action against someone who promises to pay some money and then stops the compliance action. If no money is paid, the matter starts all over again. That is completely unacceptable. There seems to be no system within the agency to monitor compliance and to ensure that it continues.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/12">I have one case in which the problem has been compounded by various appeals and assessments continuing for 10 years. A recent letter from the agency said that it is now reassessing all the assessments going back to 1994. Why should it take so long to deal with such cases? The parent concerned is at the end of her tether, and who can blame her?</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/13">The Scottish Affairs Committee, of which I was a member, looked into the operation of the agency in Scotland during the previous Parliament. We were assured then that the collection of arrears was a priority. Frankly, that could have fooled me, because nothing has changed in the intervening period. I am still seeing constituents who are chasing up huge arrears. Worse still, a constituent who recently came to see me had been chasing up the agency for more than two years to obtain substantial arrears from her ex-husband. She suddenly received a letter from the agency saying that it was sorry but it had made a mistake and no arrears were due. That, again, is completely unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/14">The situation is not that much better for absent parents. Not all try to avoid payment; many tell me that they are happy to make payments for their children and recognise their responsibility. However, having two different systems operating within the agency causes great concern, anguish and unfairness. Two people in exactly the same situation, doing the same job and receiving the same pay, may be paying vastly different amounts because of the date on which their assessment was made. That is also unacceptable. I see a steady stream of constituents with that complaint as, I am sure, do other hon. Members, but there is nothing that we can do about it.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/15">I have written to the Minister responsible on numerous occasions and received the formulaic reply that it would be irresponsible to transfer old cases to the new system until the computer system is robust. Of course it would be, but why is the computer system not robust after all this time? Why is it taking so long to get the computer system sorted out? Why can the Government not get to grips with the problem, sort it out and introduce fairness into the system?</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/16">Even with the system as it is, the Minister, in a parliamentary answer to me last year, said that one fifth of cases under the new system contained errors. That is unacceptable of a computer system that cost many millions of pounds. It is important to note that even when cases are transferred, there will be a period of convergence. Many of those cases on the old system will never get down to the levels due under the new system because of the ages of the children and the length of time that payments have been made into the old system. Members should be aware of that when talking to constituents.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/17">It may surprise the Minister, but I do not blame the Government entirely for the problems of the agency. I accept that they inherited the mess. However, they have had eight years, and the mess is getting no better. In many cases, it is getting worse, and urgent action is needed.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/18">When the Government announced the new system, if we can still call it that, it was widely welcomed as providing some sort of fairness and a new way forward for the agency. However, the years of delay and foul-ups have wasted that chance, and deep cynicism has set in among those who use the services.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/19">It is easy to be critical, but what is to be done about the agency? I do not support its abolition, because if we did that we would have to put something in its place. We cannot leave a vacuum for child support, but the agency needs severe surgery.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/20">As I said at the outset, I was a solicitor prior to being elected to the House, and I dealt with many child support cases through the courts. That system worked to some extent, but given the length of time since the courts have dealt with such matters, I doubt whether they could cope with a sudden influx of cases that were no longer being dealt with by the agency. We must be realistic and consider how we can reform the agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/21">The agency's staff are under huge pressure, and they are unable to cope with the demands put upon them. The Government must urgently reconsider their plans for cutting the number of civil servants in the Department for Work and Pensions and its agency. My experience is with the Falkirk centre, which deals with Scottish cases, but there is concern that staff are already under pressure because of understaffing, and if there are cuts to the agency, it will make matters only worse. I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter and to speak to his colleagues about the plans for the agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/22">As a matter of urgency, all cases must be put on the new system to ensure fairness. I appreciate that that is not easy, but something must be done to cut the Gordian knot, otherwise the unfairness will continue for many years.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/23">The hon. Member for Romsey talked about the new system and its simplicity, with maintenance being decided within six weeks. As a start, we must give the agency breathing space. A partial return to the old system by reintroducing ex parte applications for interim maintenance would take the immediate pressure off the agency and ensure that both parties were sure of their position, that there was an enforceable order in place quickly, and that some money changed hands pending a full investigation of the cases. It is not an ideal situation, but it is an interim arrangement.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.0/24">I recognise what the hon. Members for Monmouth and for Romsey said about the reluctance of the agency to provide information in writing. I have instituted a system in my offices in which we note carefully everything that is said over the phone, but insist on a follow-up letter. All too often we have had the problem whereby we are told something over the phone, we tell the constituent and weeks later a letter comes saying something entirely different. That lack of consistency is unacceptable, and I urge all Members to insist on a written response. They should follow it up to ensure that the agency does what it says it will do.</p>

	<p pid="c.111.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">my hon. Friend the Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> on securing a debate on an issue that is of importance to every MP. I also have an enormous postbag on the subject and agree that the CSA is a shambolic institution. I have spoken at length on the subject and want to concentrate on one case: my constituent versus the CSA computer. I concur with all the other points that have been raised and have letters on those in my mailbag.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/2">This particular case and some of the written communications to which it has given rise&mdash;I have some of them here&mdash;create the impression of a body that is completely out of touch with people and the state in which our constituents find themselves once they are in conflict with the CSA.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/3">My constituent's relationship with the CSA dates back to 1997, but I will not start from then because it would involve a long catalogue of events. For the sake of brevity, I begin in March 2005, when my constituent, out of total frustration&mdash;I note how many times that word has been used in this short debate&mdash;with the system, asked for her case to be closed. She just could not cope with the stress arising from the catalogue of errors. Her frustration arose from the uncertainty of whether she would receive any payments, which affected her housing benefit and made her situation worse.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/4">At that stage, she was owed &pound;600, and I understand that enforcement action is being taken. Hon. Members should note the language used in a letter to my constituent which arrived in May. It states:</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/5" class="indent">&quot;I have investigated the issues raised within your correspondence and would like to take this opportunity to apologise for the poor level of customer service you have received from the Agency.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/6">So far, so good. It concludes:</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/7" class="indent">&quot;While the new IT system is working well for most clients, there are some, more complex circumstances where we still have difficulties . . . I can confirm your case has been closed as requested with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-01">1 March 2005</phrase> but due to a technical fault the system is unable to fully progress your case to closure. All written notifications have been inhibited on your case although this is no guarantee you will not receive any notifications in the future owing to the technical fault. Your case has been referred to the Incident Team to resolve the fault.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/8">I ask hon. Members to consider what it would be like to receive such a letter.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/9">That is not the end of the story because, for really good reasons, my constituent decided to ask for her case to be reopened and initiated a new claim in June 2005. The CSA did not respond. She kept telephoning. She was told that her application had not been received and was not on the system. Eventually, she got a one-to-one meeting&mdash;that was quite good really&mdash;and she was promised money within a week.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/10">The money did not come within a week. That took us to the end of August. I heard from my constituent on <phrase class="date" code="">30 August</phrase>. Apparently, her ex-partner had paid &pound;50 to the CSA in June, July and August 2005, but the CSA claimed that it was not possible to pass the money on to her given that her case with them was closed. That is quite a problem, involving a closed case and a newly opened case.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/11">It is often said that the fault does not lie with the CSA, but with people not paying money to it. However, in this case, the CSA has the money. It is appalling that it is trapped in the system. The CSA has confirmed to me that it is owed to my constituent, but has said that there is a problem with the computer system. The case was passed to the live service support unit of the CSA and it has been given MP priority.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/12">It is interesting to note that between the closure of the case and now, there have been no changes in the circumstances of my constituent's former partner. Therefore, all the necessary information was on the computer system. One would have thought that there was no need to use a manual system, but the enforcement action for the &pound;600 meant that the newly opened case had to be dealt with manually. However, in my experience, there is no simple way of manually processing applications with the CSA, even though there is with most other organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/13">The MP priority system brought me a letter on <phrase class="date" code="">20 October</phrase>&mdash;a high-speed response. It stated that there was a</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/14" class="indent">&quot;a problem of a technical nature&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/15">that was preventing my constituent's case from being progressed. It continued:</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/16" class="indent">&quot;Our technical people are currently working on this and we are awaiting authorisation from them for the case to be progressed clerically. Once authorisation has been received the case will be prepared for submission to a specialist clerical team. The average time being taken for a case to be completed is 18 weeks.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/17">So that is my priority case as an MP. It started in June and it is now the end of October, but my constituent has not gotten a penny and the CSA has her money.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/18">What is the impact on our constituents? Mine has to work really long hours to make up the money due to her, and the stress affects her physical and mental well-being. I am angry that the Government are party to a system that shows no understanding of how people on relatively low incomes live. For a mother bringing up two children, and working for a relatively low rate of pay, &pound;150 is a great deal of money. It is the difference between the children having the right shoes for school and them wearing trainers, which are not acceptable to the school.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/19">People on relatively low incomes budget week to week. It is unacceptable that they receive letters saying that a clerical team will deal with their problem in three months' time. Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" name="Michael Weir">the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir)</phrase>, I feel sorry for the front-line staff who have to work under this dreadful system. Someone must be responsible for the chaos. Is it the people who were involved in drawing up the specifications for the computer system? Or is the problem down to some of the more general principles behind the Child Support Agency? We need something that relates to people, because we are all here to help them, but the system actually makes life worse for people who are already in difficult circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/20">My constituent concludes:</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/21" class="indent">&quot;God help my deprived children and others who rely on the CSA&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/22">The CSA in its current form is past praying for, and I look forward to the Minister offering us some hope for the future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.113.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" speakername="David Laws" colnum="113"  time="015:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h03.htm#51026h03_spnew6">
	<p pid="c.113.0/1">It is a pleasure to take part in t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">his debate. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> on choosing the subject. I felt a great deal of sympathy with her on her early comments, not least when she said that her heart sinks when she learns of more Child Support Agency cases. I think that the same is true for those people using the CSA and I suspect her feeling is shared by most Members of Parliament. I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> for giving a shortened version of the trials and tribulations of just one of her constituents. Her case is typical of the way in which such problems run on for a significant time.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Romsey made a comment that resonated with me. She said that in her view it was a miracle that we did not hear of more of these cases in our constituency advice centres. That occurred to me recently when I tried to come to terms with the subject as part of my new responsibilities. I looked at the performance figures for the CSA; they show the extent of the problem. The issue affects hundreds of thousands of people at least&mdash;the figure may even run into the millions across the country. Yet over the past couple of years I have not been hearing about the same numbers of CSA cases that I did two or three years ago. Sadly, they have been replaced by problems with the tax credit system. That has taken over as the No. 1 issue that I come across locally in advice centres.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/3">After looking at the data on the CSA's performance and comparing it with the number of people that I see on the subject, my conclusion is that we do not see more of those cases in our advice centres and constituency surgeries because quite a lot of people have given up on the CSA. They do not believe that it works or that it can work. They do not believe that Members of Parliament can make any difference to its working. Some of the constituency cases that hon. Members have mentioned, and, indeed, MPs' own experiences of trying to get quick decisions, demonstrate that if we cannot unclog the problems with the CSA, goodness knows what it is like for millions of people who try to deal with the system. It is a big problem. The fact that, across the country, some of the momentum on the issue has dissipated as people have become more despairing is no reason for the House not to give the issue the priority it deserves.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/4">Having recently taken over t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">his brief from my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase>, I am aware of how many responsibilities the Department for Work and Pensions will have to deal with over the next few months and years. For instance, there is the massive issue of pensions and pension protection, associated problems with the tax credit system, and incapacity benefit and housing benefit reform. It would be tempting to spend a lot of time on those apparently new policy challenges and shrug our shoulders about the long-running problems of the Child Support Agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/5">I hope that all hon. Members here today, including the Minister, will say that it is not good enough to accept that the system does not work, and that they will find out what the problems are and try to put them right. I welcome the Minister, my old colleague from the Treasury Select Committee. He has an analytical mind, and I hope that he will deal well with the somewhat poisoned chalice of responsibility for the CSA. I hope that his questions to those now running the agency will be demanding. I also hope that he will take advantage of having a new ministerial team and not be afraid of asking tough questions on policy issues that relate to the CSA, so that Ministers can decide whether the problem is merely administrative or whether we are asking the agency staff to do a job that is too complex.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/6">The agency deals with a complexity of individual circumstances. Several hon. Members have recounted cases that demonstrate the complexity of people's lives. When I consider some of the constituency cases that I have had to deal with, I am not surprised that the agency's problems are fantastically complex. They often involve a change in circumstances several times a year.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/7">Set against that are the problems referred to by a number of hon. Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" name="Michael Weir">the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir)</phrase>. A large number of people are determined not to comply with the CSA's findings, and they take every possible measure to evade their responsibilities. We are asking the agency to do a tremendously difficult job.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/8">Notwithstanding the difficulty of implementing the policy, it has had some significant administrative problems. As the hon. Member for Angus said, we must remember the context in which the debate is taking place. The CSA has had problems since it was formed in the early 1990s. They were identified soon after the Labour party came to power in 1997. Indeed, in the forward to the 1998 Green Paper, no less a person than the Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/9" class="indent">&quot;the Child Support Agency has lost the confidence of the public&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/10">He argued that the existing child support scheme was a &quot;mess&quot; and that it needed urgent reform.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/11">The White Paper stated the problems of the CSA in similarly clear terms:</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/12" class="indent">&quot;Parents are left baffled and angry with the system that seems bureaucratic and insensitive to the very real difficulties they face.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/13">It continued:</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/14" class="indent">&quot;This White Paper . . . will allow the CSA to provide a far better and more sensitive service to all parents.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/15">That was exactly the aspiration that Baroness Thatc<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">her expressed to the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> when they bumped into each other at a dinner. The right hon. Gentleman referred to the meeting in one of his pamphlets on the subject. Baroness Thatcher's aspiration was to replace the existing and failing system with a better one, yet even now none of those aspirations has been met.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/16">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> knows all too well, the Select Committee on Work and Pensions Committee published a report before the general election. It concluded:</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/17" class="indent">&quot;Whether measured by official targets or any other criteria, the CSA has failed&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/18">More worryingly, it goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/19" class="indent">&quot;levels of complaint continue to increase, unrecoverable debts rise, the level of staff turnover is going up, the management information to monitor progress is not available and, it is clear that at present the two sectors of the public it is intended to serve treat it either with despair or contempt&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/20">We heard those sentiments from hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/21">Therefore, in spite of all the attempts by the Government to reform the CSA during the past few years, and in spite of correct identification of some of the problems, there has been no progress. Most of the statistics that are available&mdash;there is an issue about the availability of statistics&mdash;indicate that the system is still in crisis. It is still getting worse or no better and is not improving.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/22">The Select Committee came to a striking conclusion in paragraph 30 of its report, when it stated:</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/23" class="indent">&quot;consideration must be given to the option of winding up the Child Support Agency and plans made for an alternative set of policies that work, in order to provide financial support for children in future. We also recommend that our successor Committee considers alternative policies in the event of the CSA being wound up.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/24">That is a significant conclusion for a cross-party Committee to reach. It shows the depth of concern about the agency and about whether it will ever work in its existing form, an issue with which the Government must deal.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/25">To some extent, that significant and critical report gave the Government a period of grace to try to sort out the problems. A new chief executive is trying to grapple with them and a new ministerial team is considering them. Many of us have been distracted by the even greater problems, if it is possible to describe them as that, of the tax credits system and pension reform. We have been diverted from scrutinising the CSA in recent months, but it is again time to give it attention, to find out what the new chief executive has achieved and to hear the views of Ministers. I hope that the Minister will say what progress has been made and what the interim conclusions are about how the CSA should be developed.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/26">I was interested in the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Romsey about some of the CSA's administrative problems. She reminded us that it was initially set up to claw back money that was being spent on the benefits system to support families that were not receiving support from the non-resident parent. It was viewed by the Conservative Government who introduced it as a mechanism for securing the interests of taxpayers as much&mdash;if not more than&mdash;as a mechanism for securing the financial interests of children.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/27">The figures that were cited by my hon. Friend indicate the extent to which the CSA is struggling to deliver on that most fundamental objective. This agency, even with all its problems, costs &pound;326 million a year to run but was capable of collecting only &pound;603 million in the latest year for which we have figures. One does not need much knowledge and understanding about the operation of the social security system to know that a cost-to-collection ratio of 1:1.85 is appalling. It compares badly, as I believe my hon. Friend said, with countries such as Australia, which has a far more plausible cost-to-collection ratio of 1:8.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/28">From the sum collected, the CSA made payments of &pound;472 million to parents with care and transferred &pound;119 million to the Department as a benefit offset. Does the Minister have figures to show whether the CSA is saving any money for the Government, compared with what would have been the case had the previous arrangements continued? It seems that the administration costs are immensely high and the savings on the benefits bill are very low because of the ineffectiveness of the system.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/29">My hon. Friend also referred to the associated issue of staffing. It is quite a criticism of the agency that its administration costs are massive for the amount that it collects, yet there are questions as to whether it has the necessary people to do the jobs that it is asked to do. It is clear that the staff are struggling. I concur with hon. Members who expressed their sympathy for them. The turnover of staff and sickness rates show the pressures that they operate under, the price of which is paid by people who rely on the system. What is the latest situation with regard to staffing at the CSA? To what extent can the Minister continue to protect those staff from the reduction of the work force in his Department and its associated agencies by 30,000 people in the next few years? The agency will struggle if the Government do not maintain the protection of those staff until the problem is sorted out.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/30">My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole spoke about the difficulties that she and some of her constituents are having with the administration of the CSA. There is real concern about the continued IT failures, on which I hope the Minister can update us, the fact that so many cases currently have to be clerically processed, and the growing backlog of cases. The Minister's most recent parliamentary answer to me on the matter and the latest information from the chief executive show that overall agency compliance rates in the latest quarter were lower than for any quarter in the previous five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/31">My hon. Friend's concerns about administration are shared by other Members, who have not given up all hope of solving their constituents' cases. I was contacted recently by someone who is a caseworker for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1617" name="Phil Willis">my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis)</phrase> who told me that his office recently had a large number of CSA cases coming through. In a note, the caseworker said:</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/32" class="indent">&quot;Today I have learned that even with MP priority it is unlikely that a case which needs to be managed clerically can be actioned within 20 weeks. That is just to start the processing&mdash;payments are likely to take much longer . . . to come through. Apparently the official line is that waiting time is 6&ndash;8 weeks, but that, I am told, is simply not realistic. More and more cases are having to be managed clerically as the computer system seems to throw up increasing numbers of errors.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/33">All the administrative problems that there were six months, or even six years, ago, are still there, instead of reducing as the new CSA system comes in. I hope that the Minister will pick up that point.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/34">I shall be cautious in my general comments on the CSA as I have only just inherited this portfolio and set of responsibilities and do not have as much experience of it as other hon. Members, such as the hon. Member for Wycombe, who served on the Select Committee. There is huge tension in the CSA on issues of fairness and complexity. Many complaints about the CSA, certainly in many of the cases that I have seen in my advice centre over the years, involve people who feel that individual maintenance settlements are unfair to them and do not take their circumstances into account. My party's previous position was to say that we shared those concerns and that we wanted to return to the old magistrates court system, in which all circumstances could be taken into account and every special element of a family's circumstances could be considered, but our policy has rightly moved on from that. The complexity of the system and of the cases being dealt with is so great that any agency operating the system would be challenged. The right hon. Member for Birkenhead was right to suggest that we need a more straightforward, simple system and that we need to set maintenance contributions at a level at which we can expect people to contribute.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/35">However, if there is to be fundamental reform of the CSA, the Government must consider, as the right hon. Gentleman also said, whether the agency sits in the right place. It is bizarre that tax credits are handled not by the Department that has expertise in paying money to people on low incomes&mdash;the Department for Work and Pensions&mdash; but by the Inland Revenue. It is also bizarre that the Department that has competence in collecting revenue and that has information about other individuals who are not compliant&mdash;who may be self-employed and who may in some cases try to evade their CSA responsibilities&mdash;is not the agency with responsibility for the CSA. One of the biggest issues for the Minister to tackle is not whether the administration is working, and how to resolve that, but whether the existing CSA system is workable or should be transferred to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. Perhaps that is the necessary solution.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.118.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" speakername="Paul Goodman" colnum="118"  time="015:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h03.htm#51026h03_spnew7">
	<p pid="c.118.0/1">I must take my attention from the interesting and thoughtful speech that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" name="David Laws">the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase> has just made and congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> on securing the debate. She set the tone at the start when she said that she and her constituents feel&mdash;as, she feels sure, do CSA staff&mdash;a deep and prolonged sense of frustration. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> also mentioned frustration. We all share that frustration and the debate has been a good one. Everyone who spoke, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase>, set out the frustrations clearly.</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/2">We all get the sense from our constituents who see us in surgeries that they consider us powerless, at times, to make the system work satisfactorily for them. That view was also taken in the previous Parliament by a forceful and perceptive Back Bencher, who asked the then Minister about the matter and said on receiving the answer that it was</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/3" class="indent">&quot;broadly the same as the one that his Department has been giving since July 2003, when migration was supposed to start.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/4">He pointed this out:</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/5" class="indent">&quot;It was supposed to be completed by April 2005&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/6">He added:</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/7" class="indent">&quot;As more new cases come on stream and are assessed under the new formula, we are fast approaching a point at which we shall be running two CSAs in parallel. That is not sustainable. Whose fault is it, and when will it be put right?&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, </i><phrase class="date" code="2004-11-08">8 November 2004</phrase>; Vol. 426, c. 553.]</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/8">That was, of course, this Minister. He now has responsibility for the system of which he was rightly so critical in the previous Parliament. I do not think that we expect instant answers from him today, and we acknowledge that the problems are deep seated, but I hope he will explain the Department's route map for getting us out of here to a more satisfactory situation.</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/9">The hon. Member for Yeovil quoted the Select Committee report, and the former Secretary of State, who is now Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, raised in his response to it last year the so-called nuclear option of sacking EDS, the computer supplier. He said that that had not been ruled out. Last week, in response to a debate initiated by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1495" name="Cheryl Gillan">my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)</phrase>, the Minister confirmed that the new chief executive of the CSA would report his findings to the ministerial team. When does the Minister expect those findings to be on his desk and to be published for Parliament? What position has been reached as to the nuclear option of sacking EDS? Has it been ruled out? As he asked his predecessor so forcefully, when will the transfer from the old system to the new take place?</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/10">I have given the Minister prior notice of another matter that I want to raise&mdash;the Department's policy in relation to the CSA and paternity testing contracts, with specific reference to a firm called DNA Bioscience and the role of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State has today written to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1575" name="Chris Grayling">my hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)</phrase>, the shadow Leader of the House, about the matter. The Secretary of State confirmed that his sons have a 3 per cent. shareholding in DNA Bioscience, a firm whose business involves DNA testing. He added:</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/11" class="indent">&quot;Just to be absolutely clear I purchased this shareholding for them&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/12">It would seem to be a significant shareholding.</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/13">The Department has separately confirmed that DNA Bioscience has had discussions with the CSA and has not denied that those were about possible contracts. In the letter, the Secretary of State does not deny discussing, since his appointment, DNA Bioscience and possible CSA contracts with a gentleman called Tariq Siddiqi, a businessman whose family members own DNA Bioscience.</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/14">The ministerial code of conduct sets out clear guidelines on Ministers' private interests. Paragraph 5.11 says:</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/15" class="indent">&quot;Ministers must scrupulously avoid any danger of an actual or apparent&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/16">&mdash;I shall stress &quot;apparent&quot; for the moment&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/17" class="indent">&quot;conflict of interest between their Ministerial position and their private financial interests.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/18">The code continues:</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/19" class="indent">&quot;In order to avoid such a danger, they should be guided by the general principle that they should either dispose of any financial interest giving rise to the actual or apparent conflict or take alternative steps to prevent it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/20">I have a few questions for the Minister about the contracts. If he cannot answer them all today because of time constraints, I would be grateful if he confirmed that either he or the Secretary of State will answer them in writing.</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/21">Secondly, precisely what appropriate action will the Secretary of State and the Department take&mdash;they refer to &quot;appropriate action&quot; in the letter&mdash;in the event of</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/22" class="indent">&quot;a change in the contractual relationship between DNA Bioscience and the Department or the Child Support Agency&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/23">Thirdly, the Secretary of State writes that he is satisfied that he has</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/24" class="indent">&quot;acted in accordance with the ministerial code.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/25">Given that the Secretary of State purchased a significant stakeholding for his family members in a firm that appears to be bidding for contracts with the CSA, are the Department and the Government satisfied that no apparent or actual conflict of interest exists? If they are, do they seriously maintain that the purchase of that stakeholding is not a breach of the spirit of the code? It is at least arguable&mdash;I shall put it no more strongly than that&mdash;that it is.</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/26">Finally, paragraph 5.2 of the code says:</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/27" class="indent">&quot;In cases of serious difficulty or doubt the matter may be referred to the Prime Minister for a view.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/28">Has either the Secretary of State or the Department referred the matter to the Prime Minister for a view? If so, what view has the Prime Minister taken? In the light of the fact that it is possible that DNA Bioscience has been applying for contracts with the CSA, and in the light of the fact that the Secretary of State has written to my hon. Friend the shadow Leader of the House, I felt compelled to raise those questions this afternoon. I shall now allow the Minister to respond.</p>

	<p pid="c.120.0/1">Everyone who contributed to the debate had the same motivation to do so: as constituency MPs&mdash;I include myself in this&mdash;we have all wrestled with difficult constituency cases over the years. Constituents have become embroiled in the CSA, and the agency has let them down in one way or another. Hon. Members have spoken of distress, tears and anguish, and we have probably all seen those things in our surgeries. That is why many of us have long-held concerns about the state of the agency and want to see the problems addressed.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/2">I felt that we were having a constructive discussion. Hon. Members have brought their genuine experiences to the table and, quite rightly, they want me to answer questions about the agency. They are concerned about the parents who are enmeshed in these matters. More essentially, they are concerned about the children.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/3">We were having a debate of that type until we reached the previous contribution, which unfortunately indulged in raising other issues. That suggests that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> is perhaps not as interested in the agency as he is in other matters.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/4">Turning to the meat of the debate, I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> on securing this opportunity and on giving several Members another opportunity to express their views on the issue and to put perfectly reasonable questions and challenges to the Government regarding what we will do to address the agency's problems. I shall not conceal for one moment the scale of the issues that we were wrestling with at the CSA; it is clear that I am not talking about a success story, and there is no point pretending that I am doing anything other.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/5">However, it is important to keep a certain perspective on what is going on at the agency. In our surgeries, we all&mdash;me included&mdash;come across the cases that have gone wrong in one way or another. Almost by definition, we do not come across the cases that are working. Before rushing to judgment, therefore, we need to be a little careful to determine whether the thing has completely failed and whether we have the whole picture in front of us.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/6">We must bear it in mind that since the agency was established, it has collected &pound;4.5 billion of child maintenance payments and that 527,000 children are being supported by maintenance payments because of the CSA. We do not hear about the cases that get processed and set up in six weeks, although I assure hon. Members that there are some.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/7">Nor are we paying attention to the quite sharp recent increase in action by the agency to chase non-compliant non-resident parents. Let me share with hon. Members the figures on the issuing of liability orders, which is the necessary preliminary step to taking action to recover debts and non-payments. In 2002&ndash;03, the agency issued 2,383 such orders; in 2003&ndash;04, it issued 3,885; and in just the first six months of the current financial year, it issued 4,539. The impression that is sometimes created is that the agency is falling down on the job and doing nothing to chase non-compliant non-resident parents, but that does not quite match the entirety of the picture.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/8">We all know, however, that alongside those elements of the agency that work&mdash;I am pleading for perspective here&mdash;there are far too many elements that do not. I shall not pretend for one moment that the agency's performance is in any way acceptable; it has let far too many people down and the issues need to be addressed. The hon. Member for Wycombe is perfectly right to quote back at me things that I said in the House of Commons as a constituency MP. I said that these issues had to be tackled and I consider myself quite fortunate because I am now in a position, perhaps, to ensure that we do something about them. Indeed, we are doing something about them.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/9">The new chief executive went in nearly six months ago, and he and his team are doing a root-and-branch analysis of the agency, with nothing being left unexamined. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" name="David Laws">The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase> wants to know whether my ministerial colleagues and I are asking all the tough questions to get to the bottom of the agency's problems. I am happy to reassure him that that is exactly what we are doing. The questions are very tough, and the task that the chief executive has been given is extremely challenging.</p>

</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.121.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1909" speakername="James Plaskitt" colnum="121"  time="015:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h03.htm#51026h03_spnew9">
	<p pid="c.121.1/1">I have limited time and I have yet to turn to many of the pertinent questions that hon. Members asked, so if the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I shall not let him intervene at the moment. I should reassure him, however, that we are carrying out the deepest analysis that anyone has ever done of the agency and its issues. We are looking at every single aspect of how it works. All the tough questions are being asked, including whether the situation is recoverable. Of course, we had to ask that question before deciding what route to take.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.1/2">In just one sense, this debate is slightly premature: as hon. Members know, although the exercise I have described is under way, it has not been concluded. However, that is not far off and we have undertaken to come back to Parliament before the end of the year to present our views on what can be done to assist the agency towards recovery and in overcoming its problems. That work is very much in hand and is coming to a conclusion. It will not be long before we are in a position to present our proposals to Members of Parliament. I am aware, as I think we all are, that we have about 650 experts on the CSA in the House of Commons, so I look forward to putting our proposals to hon. Members in due course.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.1/3">To turn to the specific issues raised by the hon. Member for Romsey, I first want to say that she and other hon. Members should be congratulated on their assiduous efforts on behalf of their constituents. She is right: many of our constituents find themselves in acute difficulties in handling the agency. They come to their local MP in an effort to seek remedy and we take their cases on. I know how assiduous the hon. Lady is in dealing with those cases, because I see the correspondence and sign it off. Her constituents are well served by an MP who takes on cases with as much earnestness as she does.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.1/4">I understand exactly when the hon. Lady talks of her constituents' deep frustration, the inconsistency and the delays. Those are common to the tough cases that we all deal with as constituency MPs. She is right to draw our attention to the Select Committee report, which is helpful. The Committee's analysis is welcome. I have studied all the recommendations and I think I can say without giving too much away that pretty well all the issues and proposals that came out of the report have been considered in one way or another within the analysis that the chief executive, his colleagues and we Ministers are now undertaking. No stone has been left unturned and no issue overlooked, including those raised, quite rightly, by the Select Committee.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.1/5">I am pleased that the hon. Lady mentioned the agency staff, as did several other hon. Members. I am acutely aware that the staff are often as let down by the system problems as the clients. I can assure hon. Members that the staff share the frustration of many of the agency's clients. In the end, they are trying to make a system work. I have described them sometimes as being asked to work with one hand tied behind their back. They are dealing with an overcomplicated system and IT that lets them down. All those problems have to be solved, and progress will be as much welcomed by the staff who struggle with the system as by those of us and our constituents who are caught up in it.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.1/6">Several hon. Members asked about staffing levels. We have undertaken that there will be no reduction in front-line staff working in the agency until we are absolutely sure that the system is robust and working. I can give that reassurance to all hon. Members who raised that point.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.1/7">The hon. Member for Romsey talked of the delay in introducing the new formula and the hon. Member for Wycombe referred back to my comments made in the House during the last Parliament about the advent of two systems running in parallel, which is pretty much what we have. Hon. Members may know that I was involved with the then Minister in devising the new formula. Like hon. Members in this Chamber this afternoon, I had stood up in the House and railed against the inadequacies of the old system, so I got myself involved in devising the new formula.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.1/8">I am just as frustrated as other hon. Members by the fact that although we worked hard to devise a simpler formula that is fairer and that will bring more justice to the system, as of today, there is no complete conversion of existing cases, despite deadlines that have been passed and overlooked many times. About 500,000 cases are on the new formula, but they are the new cases that came in after the 2003 launch.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.1/9">One of the big challenges faced by the agency is completing the migration of the old cases to the new formula and then doing the conversion to it. That is the centre of the efforts that we, together with the chief executive, are making to figure out how we will do that and on what time scale. It is in our minds because it is a pressing need that we have to address. Due to the time constraints, I must move on to the other contributions. I know that the hon. Member for Romsey raised some issues that I have not covered, but I am happy to write to her about those that I have unfortunately been forced to omit.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.1/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">The hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase> raised an interesting case from his surgery last Friday about a bailiff intervention. I am slightly puzzled by it. The agency should not have got to bailiff intervention unless a liability order was in place. That is a necessary precondition. Furthermore, I believe I am right in saying that there would have to have been non-compliance on the part of the non-resident parent for the bailiff action to be triggered. If I have said anything that he thinks is not correct in relation to that case, and if he wants to write to me, I will be happy to pursue the matter further.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.1/11">The hon. Gentleman also suggested that the agency interferes in people's lives. That phrase is interesting. The agency does not seek to do that, and nor do the Government. The agency's involvement arises because of a failure after the break-up of a relationship to make provision for the children. People can do that by private arrangement, and many do. As the previous Government found when they decided to set up the agency, children were being let down, but they must be supported. That is what drives this whole process. The court system was not doing it, hence the birth of this agency. The agency has a history of problems&mdash;we know that&mdash;but we are trying to sort them out.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.1/12">The hon. Gentleman asked finally whether we have reached the stage of scrapping the agency or sorting it out. We are trying to sort it out. That is the bottom-line answer. If hon. Members are considering the option of scrapping it, what should replace it? We cannot leave a vacuum in which children are unsupported and the maintenance is not flowing. That would simply not be acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.1/13">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" name="Michael Weir">the hon. Member for Angus (Mr.   Weir)</phrase> for his measured and constructive contribution. He, too, referred to the two systems running in tandem&mdash;that situation is not acceptable&mdash;and also mentioned staffing. I have tried to cover the other points in answers to earlier contributions, but I agree with him that parents will go to extraordinary lengths not to comply. That presents a host of challenges to the agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.1/14"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> referred to confusing letters. There is no justification for those: I, too, have seen some of them, and I have sat and reread them two or three times. We need to deal with that issue when we try to sort out the agency and how it deals with its customers. She concluded by asking who is to blame. We could play the blame game for quite a long time, but it is less constructive than trying to find long-term solutions. What will stabilise the agency? What will get it back on track? What will improve its performance? What will enable it to endure and to do the job it was set up to do in the first place? That is where our focus is now. Those are the analytical questions we are asking and we are close to getting answers. I hope that she, too, is looking forward to hearing our conclusions, which we hope to announce before the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.1/15">The hon. Member for Yeovil asked whether we are shrugging our shoulders over the CSA. No, certainly not. As I have suggested, we are working hard on trying to solve the problems. He wants to transfer the agency to the Revenue&mdash;his latest wheeze&mdash;but I am far from sure that it is right. Taking his points about complexity, he will see that the transfer of ownership of the agency would not of itself deal with the deep problems that arise when one is dealing with these complex cases. A simple transfer of where it lives within the Whitehall network would not address the core issues that have given rise to the agency's current problems.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.1/16">I am grateful to all hon. Members for the specific points they have raised, and I will respond by letter to any issues that I have overlooked. We fully take on board the extent and the scale of the problems with the agency. We do not minimise them in any way, and now is not the time to gloss or paper over them. That is not what we are doing. The deepest analysis is taking place, and has been since the new chief executive went in. We are examining every issue and every option. We look forward to coming back to Parliament before long with proposals on how we can stabilise and rescue the agency, and bring it to a position in which it does the job it was set up to do.</p>

	Magazine Distribution Arrangements

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.125.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1640" speakername="James Brokenshire" colnum="125"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h04.htm#51026h04_spnew0">
	<p pid="c.125.1/1">I am grateful for this opportunity to discuss an important sector of the British economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.125.1/2">The debate has been given the somewhat dry and sterile title of the Office of Fair Trading review of magazine distribution arrangements. That does not necessarily indicate the issues that I seek to address, as it suggests that it is about the maintenance of a vibrant, independent retail market, in which small and large stores can compete on an even footing. In fact, it is about the simple ability to pop round the corner to buy publications on a wide range of pastimes that matter to individuals, from angling to aviation, fashion to finance and pig breeding to news reading; the sheer breath of the range of titles that exists; and the simple pleasure of waking on a lazy Sunday morning and finding a copy of one's favourite newspaper waiting on the doormat and browsing through it with a hot cup of tea and a piece of toast. All of that could be under threat as a consequence of a desire to interfere in a well-established market on the mistaken premise of a drive to promote competition and modernisation, which already exist.</p>
	<p pid="c.125.1/3">Earlier this year, the competition rules that regulated distribution arrangements for newspapers and magazines were changed. Until May, the Competition Act 1998 and the (Land and Vertical Agreements Exclusion) Order 2000 excluded wholesale agreements from the ambit of that Act. However, in order to give effect to a review of EU competition rules, the exclusion order was repealed, leaving great uncertainty as to whether the longstanding agreements that awarded wholesaling rights to a single company in a specific area were lawful. I know that the Minister, because of his background, the Minister is well aware of the industry and understands how it is constructed.</p>
	<p pid="c.125.1/4">That prompted calls for the Office of Fair Trading either to recommend exemption of the agreements from the 1998 Act or to give guidance as to their status and likely validity. It took the latter course, and came up with the draft opinion that has prompted so much concern in the industry. In essence, it said that there was a fundamental difference between the newspaper distribution market and the magazine market. As a consequence, the OFT indicated that the newspaper agreements were likely to be compliant with competition law whereas the magazine agreements were not, unless the wholesalers' absolute territorial protection under the magazine agreements was removed. There was a debate about what is known as passive sales, and whether somebody could approach another wholesaler outside that territory.</p>
	<p pid="c.125.1/5">The distinction between newspapers and magazines was made on the ground of apparent special features attaching to newspapers, stated as being their highly perishable nature, their very narrow production time frame and the presence of an industry code of practice governing the relationship between newspaper wholesalers and retailers, underpinned by statutory undertakings given by those wholesalers. That approach prompted stringent criticism at all levels of the industry. It was suggested that the OFT had failed properly to understand the supply arrangements, and that magazines and newspapers were two sides of the same market segment, each competing for the same advertising space, for the same editorial talent and for the same readership and circulation.</p>
	<p pid="c.125.1/6">A more detailed analysis suggests that the three differentiating issues highlighted by the OFT do not appear to be as clear cut as might be suggested. Several magazines, particularly trade magazines and magazines that focus on current affairs, are very perishable and go out of date extremely quickly because the news that they contain is very current. <i>The Economist</i>, for example, describes itself as a newspaper but can be perceived on many levels as a magazine in which timing is critical.</p>
	<p pid="c.125.1/7">Only last week, a newspaper retailer told me that if the first day's sales of a magazine are lost, that week's sales can be expected to be down by about 40 per cent.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.126.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1640" speakername="James Brokenshire" colnum="126"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h04.htm#51026h04_spnew1">
	<p pid="c.126.1/1">I am pleased to say that that issue will be dealt with quite quickly, and we look forward to moving forward very positively with a new leader.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/2">Some newspapers, particularly local or regional ones, are also weekly, so do the same issues apply to them? More fundamentally, I struggle to see where a newspaper ends and a magazine begins, particularly when increasingly most weekend newspapers can generate continuing sales only by creating a strong magazine feature. The T2 section of <i>The Times</i>, which I read today on the District line tube to Westminster, is almost a magazine that is set up as a newspaper. It is therefore difficult to understand the fundamental distinction that the OFT was seeking to draw. The fundamentals of building the circulation of a magazine or newspaper, on a sale-or-return basis, incur high intrinsic costs on both sides of the market, so again I do not see how the fundamental distinction was drawn.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/3">The maintenance of the newspaper code, which the OFT gave as another reason for trying to differentiate between the two sides of the market, was a quirk of fate in many ways. In 1993, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission produced a report on the supply of national newspapers following a reference by the OFT. Following that report, the code was introduced to address certain practices which the MMC concluded were not in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/4">As the Minister knows, the code in effect obliges wholesalers to supply to all retailers within their geographical area who can commit to a minimum number of sales. It is somewhat perverse of the OFT to argue that it recommended 10 years ago that the MMC investigate the newspaper market, which resulted in the establishment of this code of practice, so that somehow justifies treating the market as different. It is particularly perverse, given that wholesalers largely adhere to the newspaper code when dealing with magazines and that the industry is willing to establish a formal code of practice to provide substantially the same protections on that side of the market.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/5">Even if one accepts the OFT's argument that there is a distinction between newspaper and magazine distribution, the impact of changing the system, as the OFT suggests, could be dramatic. A report by Professor Paul Dobson of Loughborough university business school suggested that wholesaling costs might increase significantly for the industry if the current exclusive territory system were replaced with more retail-led open competition. Larger retailers could use their clout to obtain more favourable terms and treatment at a time of greater overall cost because of a duplication of effort.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/6">Those costs would need to be met somewhere, and the fear is that they would be loaded on to the smaller retailers, causing a significant number of them to exit the market. In particular, the professor suggested that as many as 9,000 to 12,000 smaller newsagents could be forced to close. To be fair to the OFT, it seems to recognise that when it says in paragraph 3.29 of its draft opinion on the overall concept of the market that</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/7" class="indent">&quot;it is likely that they&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/8">&mdash;that is, magazines and newspapers&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/9" class="indent">&quot;would naturally continue to be distributed together . . . at least to independent (non-multiple) retailers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/10">That suggests that the OFT understands that the big multiples will use their position and their buying strength to renegotiate with the wholesalers. When one considers that the wholesale market is in the region of &pound;80 million, an amount that Tesco could probably make in a fortnight, it shows the disparity in the bargaining position. It is almost a David-and-Goliath situation that underpins the concern about the consequences of a change, which would also have hidden consequences. Fewer retailers would mean less circulation for publications. Given that the large retailers are focused on a smaller range of publications, much more so than the independent retailers, which stock a broader range&mdash;that is part of the differentiation of the market&mdash;it would deny certain publications access to a broad market. It is worth noting that the smaller independent newsagents are the ones that underpin the home delivery service&mdash;the paperboys and papergirls who serve homes throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/11">Circulation is a key aspect of the industry. The unintended consequences of a change envisaged by the OFT could be that newspaper sales will fall, hitting advertising revenue and possibly the viability of certain titles. That would be an ironic result, given that the OFT wants to protect the distribution mechanism on the newspaper side of the market.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/12">It is therefore hardly surprising that an extremely diverse group of people have voiced their strong criticism of the OFT's view: they include the National Federation of Retail Newsagents, the Periodical Publishers Association, the Newspaper Publishers Association, <i>Which?</i>, the Consumers Association, the Federation of Small Businesses, the Rural Shops Alliance and even the Mayor of London.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/13">It is not intuitively obvious that a competition regulator should feel comfortable in its judgment when it is seemingly opposed by virtually every interest group in the sector. Last week, even the Minister's colleague, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, said that she is extremely worried by the OFT approach.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/14">There is the question of how the matter has been dealt with by some of the case officers in the investigation. The OFT has never specified what it believes to be inadequate about the economic analysis provided by the industry other than to suggest in the press that it is scaremongering or excitable sloganeering. However, in such a complex and important case that raises the question why the OFT has not carried out its own independent analysis of the workings of the industry and the supply chain. Effectively, it has hypothesised that matters may simply not turn out as the industry expects. The arguments being advanced need more depth and robustness.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/15">In that context, it is worth examining other countries. For all the talk of European competition requirements, the issue does not seem to be one of the regulations that has appeared on the radar screens of many European regulators. In Europe, no other competition regulator has come up with an approach that resembles that of the OFT. In Germany, publishers have concluded exclusive distribution agreements with wholesalers that have a territorial monopoly in their territory for the duration of the contract. There is an exclusive territory system in France at wholesale and retail levels. In Italy, the distribution of newspapers and magazines is undertaken by national publisher-controlled distributors and regional wholesalers operating in exclusive distribution territories. Unfortunately, the impression is given that that attitude is another case of over-interpretation and enforcement of European regulation, that it is gold-plating but with knobs on this time.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/16">In some respects, the more worrying aspect is the experience in the United States in 1995, when there was a lot of deregulation. In the 10 years since then wholesalers in the market have gone down from about 180 to only four, which control 90 per cent. of the market. The risk is that that could happen here. The newspaper and magazine sector is a valuable part of the British economy, making about &pound;12 billion. The sector is diverse: larger retailers focus their newsstands on monthly publications; smaller retailers provide a greater breadth of coverage and titles, and they build on that with a home delivery network.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/17">It seems strange that the regulator seeks to intervene in a competitive market. Some four out of five new magazines entering the magazine market fail. It is extremely competitive, and a consensus seems to be building from the magazine side around establishing a code of practice. That would in some ways address the rightful concerns of small retailers who say that they do not benefit from the arrangements and that they need greater protection. That could be provided by a code of practice backed up by an independent ombudsman.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/18">In order to provide clarity to an industry in desperate need of greater certainty, I have three closing questions for the Minister. First, does he share the increasing concern of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport at the approach of the OFT, and, if so, what representations will he make to ensure that the views of the industry are properly considered by the regulator?</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/19">Secondly, if the OFT's final opinion confirms the view in its preliminary advice, will the Minister consider intervening in the public interest to ensure that the &pound;80 million magazine and newspaper industry is not damaged?</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/20">Thirdly, if the Minister is prepared to intervene, is he willing to give appropriate consideration to the establishment of a code of practice to offer protection to retailers in a similar way to the newspaper code?</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/21">I am conscious of the change in senior management of the OFT, and I hope that it will allow the OFT a period of reflection on and consideration of the work that has been undertaken to date, giving it some scope to listen to the industry and to the significant concerns that have been raised. I fear that if the approach that has been taken up to now is followed, the livelihoods of many small businesses will be damaged, and consumers will perversely end up with less choice rather than more.</p>

	<p pid="c.129.0/1">I welcome you to the chair for this afternoon's proceedings, Mr. Marshall. I am mindful of the ruling that you gave me about wearing&mdash;or not wearing&mdash;a jacket, unlike my colleague before me.</p>
	<p pid="c.129.0/2">I am delighted that we are having a debate on this important issue. Many hon. Members from both sides of the House have either asked me questions or written to me about it. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1640" name="James Brokenshire">the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire)</phrase>. said, I have some knowledge of the industry from my previous incarnation as a full-time trade union officer in the printing industry, at that time in the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades, which became the Graphical, Paper and Media Union, and is now part of Amicus.</p>
	<p pid="c.129.0/3">I am well aware of the issues that the hon. Gentleman raises, and I congratulate him on securing the debate. I am sure that more parliamentary colleagues would have been present were it not for the major debate taking place on the Floor of the House. I am delighted to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" name="Charles Hendry">the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry)</phrase> present as we rekindle our work together and progress through the many issues before us.</p>
	<p pid="c.129.0/4">This issue concerns the implications of the OFT's preliminary opinion for the magazine market, as the hon. Member for Hornchurch said. It is important to remember that the OFT has not yet issued a final opinion on the matter and is not likely to do so for some weeks. Accordingly, this debate and any comments on the issues raised will relate only to the draft opinion of the OFT published for consultation in May.</p>
	<p pid="c.129.0/5">It is also important to note that the OFT's preliminary opinion is just that&mdash;an opinion. It was issued in response to a request from a group of publishers and wholesalers. The OFT is not changing the law, but advising on what it believes the law means for agreements between publishers and wholesalers; nor, if confirmed, would the preliminary opinion mean that magazines could no longer be distributed with newspapers. Such arrangements could continue, and probably would do so if relevant industry parties considered that that was the most efficient method of delivering magazines.</p>

	<p pid="c.129.1/1">I hear what the Minister says about this just being opinion, but I hope that he appreciates that if an industry receives such guidance, it will have an impact. People will think that it is a clear determination and will act accordingly, as a consequence of the advice or guidance given by the OFT.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.130.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" speakername="Gerry Sutcliffe" colnum="130"  time="016:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h04.htm#51026h04_spnew3">
	<p pid="c.130.0/1">I recognise what the hon. Gentleman says, and he will know why I am trying to outline the position that the Government are taking on competition law. I will help him with that as we continue. He knows that attempts have been made to have discussions outside the formalised structures that we operate, in order to bring together the industry and the various bodies&mdash;protagonists is too strong a word&mdash;so that they can try to find a way through.</p>
	<p pid="c.130.0/2">It is worth recapping why the OFT has been considering the matter. The legislation to modernise UK competition law to make it in line with modernised European Union law was passed on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>. As part of that package of legislation, the Government repealed the domestic exclusion for vertical agreements&mdash;the Competition Act 1998 (Land and Vertical Agreements Exclusion) Order 2000. However, the repeal did not come into effect until a year later, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-01">1 May 2005</phrase>. That delay was provided to give the industry time to adjust, and to take advice, if necessary, on the implications&mdash;and, I would say, to give it an opportunity to try to reach a solution. Industry parties did seek advice on the matter from the OFT, and in May the OFT published its preliminary opinion for consideration.</p>
	<p pid="c.130.0/3">It is also worth recalling why the Government decided, following consultation, to repeal the UK exclusion from competition law for vertical agreements. In summary, we did so because after modernisation we considered there would be limited purpose in retaining a separate domestic exclusion. Modernisation meant UK competition authorities and courts must apply EC law as well as UK law in any case that affects trade between member states.</p>
	<p pid="c.130.0/4">The UK domestic inclusion for vertical agreements was introduced in 2000 to provide block cover to all vertical agreements provided they met the necessary criteria. At that time, no equivalent exclusion for vertical agreements was provided under EU law. Such an equivalent under EU law was subsequently introduced, so that there is now a block exemption for vertical agreements which applies to all EU member states. Any different features a separate domestic exclusion might have could only have an effect on agreements that had no effect on interstate trade. Relying on the protection for vertical agreements provided by the EC block exemption ensures clarity and consistency in the way that the same types of vertical agreements are treated&mdash;irrespective of whether they affect interstate trade&mdash;and there is no need for argument about which legal base should apply in a given case.</p>
	<p pid="c.130.0/5">On what the OFT's preliminary opinion might mean if confirmed, the present arrangements for the distribution of newspapers and magazines mean that wholesalers are contractually barred from selling newspapers and magazines to retailers located outside their appointed exclusive territory. The hon. Gentleman is right: that came about as a result of a long, historical evolution to do with the changing nature of how newspapers and magazines were produced. Retailers have no choice over which wholesaler they deal with. That significantly restricts competition, and many retailers expressed strong views that it placed them at a commercial disadvantage. Agreements that restrict competition may nevertheless be acceptable under the law, if they meet the exemption criteria set out in the Competition Act 1998. The exemption criteria include the need for wider benefits to arise from the relevant agreement and for the restriction of competition involved to be indispensable to achieving those benefits.</p>
	<p pid="c.130.0/6">The OFT has concluded that agreements granting such exclusive distribution territories for newspapers are likely to meet the exemption criteria in the 1998 Act and, therefore, to be compatible with the law. In the case of magazines, as the hon. Gentleman said, the OFT preliminary opinion is that exclusive territories are not indispensable, and therefore such distribution agreements are not likely to be compatible with competition law, and accordingly retailers could not be precluded from looking elsewhere to obtain supplies of magazines. That is the heart of the problem and where we continue to hope that agreement can be reached.</p>
	<p pid="c.130.0/7">The OFT has sought to explain to interested parties why it considers agreements for newspapers are likely to meet the exemption criteria while agreements for magazines are not. Further representations have been made about that and the OFT will be considering them carefully before reaching its final position. The hon. Gentleman made a good point about the change in leadership of the OFT. The work undertaken by Sir John Vickers, its outgoing chairman, has been exemplary. It has been a credit to him and his organisation.</p>
	<p pid="c.130.0/8">There is now a change in the structure of the OFT in that there is a chairman and a chief executive&mdash; Mr. Philip Collins and Mr. John Fingleton respectively. I know from preliminary discussions that they are keenly aware of the range of issues that excite Members of Parliament, not least myself. I believe that their final declaration will reflect the worries that have been raised.</p>
	<p pid="c.130.0/9">The hon. Gentleman referred to the letter from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. I see no problem with Members of Parliament, in whatever capacity, voicing concerns about genuine issues that affect our communities. He spoke briefly about the role of major retailers as opposed to that of small retailers and the impact that that has on our communities, something that is creating much discussion. That is a legitimate discussion that can take place in a non-party political way, as has happened in the past with matters such as the Consumer Credit Bill&mdash;indeed, the hon. Gentleman was a member of the Standing Committee that considered it. Mr. Fingleton and Mr. Collins are aware of the major weighty issues to be considered in addition to the matter of distribution and designation. Clearly, representations can still be made about them.</p>
	<p pid="c.130.0/10">This is about the application of competition law and, as such, it is for the OFT and the companies concerned, which need to make arrangements for the distribution of their products. They are responsible for ensuring that those arrangements comply with competition law. The OFT is an independent competition regulator and has sought to help in that regard by providing an opinion on the compatibility of the law of agreements granting exclusive distribution territories.</p>
	<p pid="c.130.0/11">The Government's long-established policy is to remove themselves from making substantive decisions about competition issues and to leave them to the independent competition authorities. I think that Conservative Members supported the Enterprise Act 2002 and the Competition Act 1998. They had some reservations about them, but I think that they agreed with the broad principle of taking decision making away from Ministers so that they were not involved in matters about which they might not have the appropriate expertise or knowledge. However, I have some knowledge about the issue under discussion, as I said earlier.</p>
	<p pid="c.130.0/12">We want to develop a well founded principle. The United Kingdom has one of the best competition regimes in the world and the development of the OFT will be dealt with by the incoming team. It is right and proper that we use the Competition Commission as the route through that and do not have Ministers becoming involved in matters about which they do not have the full information, although I am not saying that they should not have a view or an opportunity to express the concern of their colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="c.130.0/13">There is not enough time to go into detail about each of the three points made by the hon. Gentleman, so I shall write to him. There is a clear procedural route for the OFT in respect of competition rules.</p>

	<p pid="c.132.0/1">The Minister says that he does not have time to deal with my three points, but he has dealt with one of them. The other two relate to a willingness to intervene in some way. He said that he might be prepared to write to me, but can he go further than that to give reassurance to the industry?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.132.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" speakername="Gerry Sutcliffe" colnum="132"  time="016:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h04.htm#51026h04_spnew5">
	<p pid="c.132.1/1">The industry is well aware of my concerns and those of all hon. Members. I shall encourage discussion to continue. The formal route must be through the OFT, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall do everything in my power to make sure that a decision is made sooner rather than later and that maximum discussion will take place among people on both sides of the argument. Given what I said earlier, he will understand why I need to stay within the parameters of the 2002 and 1998 Acts.</p>
	<p pid="c.132.1/2">It would be folly for me to go much further in the time that remains. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising such matters and I am sure that he will have helped the discussion to go further.</p>

	LOCAL ENTERPRISE GROWTH INITIATIVE
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.133.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1842" speakername="Joan Walley" colnum="133"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h05.htm#51026h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="c.133.1/1">It is always a genuine pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Marshall.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.1/2">I start by saying how pleased I am to have the opportunity to raise the case for Stoke-on-Trent to be granted funding under the local enterprise growth initiative, which is commonly known as LEGI. I am pleased that the Minister is here today because if ever an area needed a leg up and a helping hand, ours does. I intend to flag up the importance of Stoke-on-Trent's proposed bid, which will be made by the local strategic partnership and the city council by <phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.1/3">I appreciate only too well that the funding is competitive and that the Minister will not be able to tell me at the end of the debate that our bid will succeed. However, I know equally well that if it is to be successful, it needs the support of the Government office for the west midlands and of the regional development agency, which is Advantage West Midlands.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.1/4">I make no apology whatever for my twofold purpose in raising this matter. First, I want to prepare the ground for the hurdles that we must overcome regionally and, secondly, assuming that we are successful, I want to ensure that the Government understand fully the scale of the problem facing us in Stoke-on-Trent and the need for a joined-up government approach&mdash;that is sometimes elusive&mdash;from the Treasury, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. I hope that that provides a good background for the decision and that we are successful.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.1/5">I was pleased to hear in the 2005 Budget introduced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor that there would be an extra &pound;50 million of this funding for 2006&ndash;07, which I understand is set to rise to &pound;150 million for 2008&ndash;09, for the country as a whole. On hearing that, I immediately contacted the relevant bodies in Stoke-on-Trent to ensure that they would be well prepared to make a bid. I have read through the literature, and it is clear that in the first phase funds will stretch to perhaps only one successful bid per region.</p>

	<p pid="c.133.3/1">I see the Minister nodding. If the money is to be targeted on encouraging enterprise in the most deprived areas, as it will be because of its links with neighbourhood renewal, the case for Stoke-on-Trent is overwhelming. I want to set out the case for that.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.3/2">First, we have excellent partnership arrangements and widespread support for the bid from delivery partners. I have already received a letter&mdash;I am happy to leave it for the Minister to peruse later&mdash;from the elected mayor of Stoke-on-Trent, setting out our delivery team and the importance of the bid. It is clear from the extent of the work that has been done so far and how the proposal has been drawn up that, subject to Stoke-on-Trent being successful, the money will be immediately put to good use on capital and revenue projects.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.3/3">That will build on our success in managing enterprise units, business incubation units and enterprise events in schools&mdash;I am patron of the primary enterprise club in Stoke-on-Trent&mdash;and on our work with business mentors and with promoting inward investment and skills and training initiatives. A &pound;5 million construction skills college has recently been built in my constituency and we need to build a culture of enterprise throughout that work. I make no bones about that. We have the experience and the determination to make the bid work if we are successful.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.3/4">Business Link, Business Initiative and Business Brokers are backing this bid, as is the local education authority, which is contributing to it, as are the local universities, the north Staffordshire regeneration zone, the chamber of commerce and the Learning and Skills Council. We have partnership working.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.3/5">It is important to bring to the Minister's attention his Department's housing market renewal programme that operates across north Staffordshire. I am sure he knows that Middleport in my constituency is one of two areas of major intervention that are to get under way quickly. The plans there are closely linked with the co-ordinated regeneration that is under way in Burslem through the work of the Burslem regeneration company, which I am very involved with.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.3/6">Straight away, if the bid were approved, we would have the opportunity to connect with the housing renewal work that is proceeding. I am mindful of a seminar that I chaired in the House of Commons recently due to my work as a member of the all-party group on regeneration. We examined housing market renewal and concluded that it must link up with economic renewal if it is to succeed.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.3/7">By ensuring that we connected the proposed LEGI bid with other work being done by the ODPM, we would avoid any proliferation of schemes or initiatives. We would not be reinventing efforts that were already under way. We could ensure that there was a perfect fit with the work the Department has already undertaken across north Staffordshire.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.134.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="134"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h05.htm#51026h05_spnew2">
	<p pid="c.134.0/1">My hon. Friend is gracious in giving way because she has only a short time in which to speak. May I declare an interest? Hartlepool is also bidding for part of the LEGI money, so I suppose that she and I are in competition. Does she agree that one of the true barriers to lifting deprived areas into prosperity relates to easy access to capital markets and finance? I know that in Hartlepool and the wider region of the north-east, the banking structure and access to capital markets are not as strong as they should be. The City of London is symbolically and physically a long way from Hartlepool and Stoke-on-Trent. Does she agree that that is a key part of what LEGI could achieve?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.134.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1842" speakername="Joan Walley" colnum="134"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h05.htm#51026h05_spnew3">
	<p pid="c.134.1/1">Indeed I do. I hope that my hon. Friend and I will both be on the winning side when the Government announce which bids are successful. I cannot graciously offer the same hope in terms of a forthcoming football match: his team plays Port Vale on Saturday.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.1/2">I agree with my hon. Friend about access to finance and capital, and about financial awareness, particularly in areas where there is massive structural economic change. The way that bankers and investors see areas is not always linked to the industrial heritage and the value of the land. Correspondingly, that has an effect in terms of access to banking finance. We have to be innovative if we are to ensure that we get the investment in enterprise that will be salvation for areas that have been so devastated by the decline in traditional manufacturing. I want to discuss some of them later.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.1/3">On the point that I was making about housing market renewal, if we fit this programme with that, we can focus on consolidation and growth, which complement existing efforts as part of a broader coherent strategy that picks up all the investment that is under way in my area&mdash;I am sure that that is also the case in Hartlepool&mdash;in health, schools and the housing pathfinder. Also, as would be the case with our proposal, that will be consistent with the sub-regional plans that are under way in respect of economic planning, housing and health.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.1/4">We would be certain to ensure that local people and local firms benefit from the initiative. I have seen too many so-called enterprise initiatives where there was new investment but it meant only that people from 300 or 400 miles away benefited from jobs. There was not the spin-off for local people whose jobs had been lost as a result of structural changes. It is important that we fit this to housing market renewal.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.1/5">It is difficult to touch on the scale of the challenge in Stoke-on-Trent, because this is still a painful subject. The scale of the challenge is one of the overwhelming reasons why we must ensure that Stoke-on-Trent's bid is successful. Even if they make uncomfortable reading, I want to give some background figures to the Minister, so that he can see the challenge. He might not know the scale of the job losses across north Staffordshire, and the resolve that we have to tackle that. Sometimes, Government policy has not been helpful. The Department for Work and Pensions intends to close down a jobcentre in one of the areas of greatest deprivation, without any proper consultation, which is a matter of great concern. There have also been redundancy announcements from large firms. In the past 20 years, 60,000 jobs have been lost in mining, steel and ceramics.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.1/6">That should give the Minister an indication of what we are up against. I make that point because in Stoke-on-Trent not only have we lost more manufacturing jobs than most other industrial areas, but we have lost them more recently. To date, we have had less capacity to create new jobs to replace the traditional jobs that have been outsourced to the far east than areas with more basic skills and professional expertise in producing proposals that would turn the local economy round.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.1/7">We cannot ignore the global restructuring that is taking place, and we must make good the loss of manufacturing jobs. However, in Stoke-on-Trent that task is challenging. Some 22.9 per cent. of the work force are still employed in manufacturing jobs. In my constituency, the figure is 35.4 per cent. I am sure that the Minister will not need reminding that the national average is 12.6 per cent. The consultants, Arup, estimated that, nationally, 20,000 manufacturing jobs are still at risk. It stands to reason that areas where there is already a heavy reliance on manufacturing jobs will be more vulnerable to globalisation than most other areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.1/8">As unpalatable as that is, we must look ahead and plan now. Make no mistake about it, we are doing just that with the investment that is already coming in across the sub-region with the Government's help. However, our fundamental approach must be to make that investment relevant to local people, and we must change the enterprise culture. If we look at our record to date on that, it is simply not good enough, but that is through no fault of our own.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.1/9">Nationally, 9 per cent. of people are self-employed; in Stoke-on-Trent, the figure is 6.7 per cent. I think that speaks volumes. We will not catch up unless we make even more headway in improving basic skills in the city. Maths and English are essential for small businesses, and I can report that we have made great progress in that area already. This year, in Stoke-on-Trent schools, 47 per cent. of pupils achieved grades A to C at GCSE, compared with 31 per cent. in 1997. Credit must go to Nigel Rigby and to the teaching staff for those outstanding results, which show that we can do great things when we are determined to improve educational standards. We want to repeat across the spectrum what we have achieved with GCSE results. That success must be matched by corresponding success in those basic skills across the age range, so that my constituents are equipped with the skills they need to set up in business.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.1/10">The most up-to-date figures from Barclays for business start-ups, for quarter 4 in 2004, show that Stoke-on-Trent had eight business start-ups per 10,000 of the working population. Those were the second lowest figures, after Middlesbrough. The UK average was 14. In quarter 3, Stoke-on-Trent's record was seven business start-ups, and we were placed equal lowest. From those figures, we can see that with a working population of 147,400 people, every year we have 100 business start-ups fewer than other comparable parts of the country. If we look at that year on year, the gap is growing. That is why we are determined to do something about it.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.1/11">We will never catch up if things stay as they are. Economic development is falling behind in precisely the areas where it is needed most by local people. My message to the Minister is clear: however painful the facts, in Stoke-on-Trent we are actively engaged in turning the situation around. We have to make the strongest possible push to get approval for the local enterprise growth initiative.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.1/12">I can report that our bid is nearing completion. My colleagues in north Staffordshire and I want to ensure that it hits all the right buttons and fits with the work already under way at the council, in children's services and in our primary schools. I want to ensure that, where possible, we consider green enterprise and that that will also be a component of our bid.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.1/13">So much more is needed. In my research for this debate, my attention was drawn to the work of the Scottish Institute for Enterprise, which has shown what can be achieved when the Government engage with local people to push the enterprise agenda. I want to see a can-do culture develop across my constituency and to send out a strong message to the Minister, the Government office for the west midlands and the regional development agency that this bid has to be supported. I look forward to hearing from the Minister how he could be equally enterprising and ensure that we can provide funding and tackle the enterprise gap.</p>

	<p pid="c.137.0/1">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the local enterprise growth initiative with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1842" name="Joan Walley">my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Joan Walley)</phrase>, who has made a powerful case for Stoke, and to set out the Government's aims and objectives in encouraging enterprise in our most deprived communities. I am pleased that Stoke-on-Trent has taken a keen interest in the local enterprise growth initiative&mdash;LEGI&mdash;as have so many of the 91 eligible local authorities across the country. Stoke is typical of the communities that the initiative will assist; it has a relatively low business start-up rate and pockets of deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="c.137.0/2">All the authorities preparing bids are keen to get the attention of the Government, so by securing the debate, my hon. Friend is already ahead of the game. Much work and significant funding has been put into places such as Stoke-on-Trent, which, as my hon. Friend described, is part of the north Staffordshire housing market renewal pathfinder, a scheme designed to rejuvenate the area's housing market. The pathfinder was awarded &pound;30 million in June 2004 and a recent housing market assessment reported that there had been a significant improvement in the local housing market.</p>
	<p pid="c.137.0/3">I acknowledge that my hon. Friend has taken a strong lead on regeneration issues in her constituency through her work with the Burslem Regeneration Company, whose master plan for the town has been officially adopted by Stoke-on-Trent council. I applaud her determination to improve the Stoke area. I am sure that she agrees that there is a pressing need for economic regeneration in conjunction with those physical regeneration efforts. In his Budget in March, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor launched LEGI and spoke of the Government's commitment to creating</p>
	<p pid="c.137.0/4" class="indent">&quot;a country where enterprise is open to all&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.137.0/5">LEGI is designed to foster aspiration and ambition, and encourage innovation and enterprise; it is also about recognising the significance of enterprise to the economy as a whole and the great untapped potential of our most deprived communities in particular.</p>
	<p pid="c.137.0/6">The importance of enterprise should not be underestimated. Enterprise&mdash;a term that covers the formation of new businesses, the expansion of existing businesses and attracting businesses to an area&mdash;is one of the key drivers of our economy. In the UK, small and medium-sized enterprises employ more than 50 per cent. of our private sector work force and account for more than &pound;1 trillion of private sector turnover each year.</p>
	<p pid="c.137.0/7">Enterprise also shakes up the economy: innovation and competition are increased, boosting productivity as new and more efficient ways of doing things are developed. Enterprise benefits us all. There is no doubt that the UK has great potential in enterprise. A recent study by the World Bank reported that we had the best business conditions in Europe, and ranked us fifth among the world's top 20 economies in terms of the cost of starting a business.</p>
	<p pid="c.137.0/8">However, in spite of our potential, entrepreneurial activity in the UK remains lower than in some of our G7 competitors, and we have nearly 50 per cent. less entrepreneurial activity as a proportion of the population than the United States. Increasing the level of enterprise in the UK will increase our economic competitiveness in relation to those nations. So there is a significant challenge in closing that enterprise gap between us and our competitors, and the impact of enterprise on our economy is clear.</p>
	<p pid="c.137.0/9">There is also an enterprise gap in our own country, between the most affluent and the most deprived communities. That is the gap that LEGI aims to bridge. By addressing the disparity between our poorest communities and their more affluent neighbours, we can also bridge the enterprise gap between the UK and our competitors. We can use the potential in deprived areas to bridge the gap and expand GDP. There is evidence that shows that our most deprived communities have the greatest potential and can offer the greatest rewards for business. In a country where enterprise is open to all, ambitions will not be dulled by someone's place of birth or where they happen to live. By helping the most disadvantaged communities, we will all benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.137.0/10">The simple fact is that fewer businesses start up in deprived areas and more of them fail, as was outlined. Why is that? What are the barriers that constrict enterprise growth in those areas? Access to finance is a major obstacle. People may have great ideas for a business, but without access to finance it is impossible to turn those ideas into reality. People in deprived areas are also less likely to access business support services and the advice of experts who can help future entrepreneurs to start their first business and help young businesses to survive. There are other problems that must be overcome in the poorest areas, which suffer from a lack of relevant skills and experience and in which there is limited access to training.</p>
	<p pid="c.137.0/11">Each of those barriers has contributed to another endemic problem: a weak enterprise culture. A key task of LEGI will be to change the culture in those areas so that enterprise is seen as a valid choice for local people. That is not just about encouraging people to take risks; it is also about providing the means to enable risks to be taken. Not all enterprises will be successful, but successful entrepreneurs learn from past failures and use those experiences in future ventures. Promoting enterprise is not just about the successes; it is also about the failures. It is about offering support to people who have been prepared to take a risk and helping them to use their experiences positively.</p>
	<p pid="c.137.0/12">How will LEGI bring about that culture change and combat the barriers that deprived communities face? The size of the financial commitment demonstrates the Government's determination to address those issues and to release the economic potential of the most deprived areas. A total of &pound;150 million per annum of flexible, devolved investment will go directly to the local authorities that are successful at the bidding stage. Furthermore, LEGI has long-term objectives and provides long-term funding to create sustainable change in the communities that it targets. The Government also recognise that there will be more than one successful method of promoting enterprise and LEGI is founded on a flexible approach that is unique to the initiative. By giving local authorities the opportunity to work with partners to shape LEGI to their area and to create the most appropriate programme for their community, the initiative will address the problems of low-enterprise growth in the most direct fashion.</p>
	<p pid="c.137.0/13">LEGI will focus on outcomes rather than targets. It is about partnerships. Local authorities will have to demonstrate that they have worked with local and regional partners and with the local business community when drawing up their proposals, as well as being able to demonstrate that LEGI will integrate with existing economic and redevelopment strategies in the area. LEGI is not about building new structures; it is about building on existing structures, where they have proved effective, to secure effective outcomes in deprived areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.137.0/14">LEGI offers not only significant levels of funding, but funding over a substantial period of time: between five and 10 years. There is, therefore, much at stake in the bidding process and local authorities such as Stoke are putting in a tremendous effort to secure it.</p>

	<p pid="c.139.0/1">I am encouraged by what the Minister is saying. Will he give me an idea of the kind of money that would be available to the successful applicants in each of the financial years under the LEGI programme?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26c.139.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" colnum="139"  time="016:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051026/halltext/51026h05.htm#51026h05_spnew5">
	<p pid="c.139.1/1">I will try to come to that point before I conclude. I was just moving on to some issues that are relevant to Stoke.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/2">We recognise that we have asked a lot of local authorities that wish to bid for the first round of LEGI funding, the deadline for which, as was mentioned, is <phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase>. We have made some &pound;10 million of pump-priming money available to all eligible local authorities to cover the costs of the bidding process. Although it is a difficult task, there is also a beneficial element to the process, as it forces local authorities and their local and regional partners to think hard about increasing enterprise in their communities. Local authorities will      have to demonstrate in their proposals an understanding of the nature of the market failure in the locality and that they have the right solutions to reverse it.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/3">We should not get too hung up on the <phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase> deadline. LEGI is not about quick fixes. Local authorities will be able to bid for LEGI funding in two further rounds. Many authorities will choose to take the extra time to hone their proposals and develop their research, and authorities that are unsuccessful in the first round are free to use the experience to prepare improved bids in the later rounds.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/4">I understand that Stoke has adopted an innovative approach to their proposals so far, inviting a broad range of local partners to submit projects for consideration to build a LEGI bid from the ground. Such innovative thinking is welcome. It will be difficult to turn around the economies of deprived areas without doing new things. We want to learn from innovation, capture it and apply it to other areas. The key to LEGI success will be the quality of the proposal. We want bids that demonstrate the real difference that LEGI funding can bring to an area.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/5">The process of choosing the successful proposals will have two stages. First, regions will rank bids in order of their quality, set against the national criteria soon to be published. That will involve discussions between Government offices and regional development agencies. As my hon. Friend said, Stoke will need to maintain the close relationships that it has already established with the Government office for the west midlands and Advantage West Midlands. The regions will then make recommendations to Ministers who will make the final national decisions. I stress again how competitive the process will be. We expect to fund only 10 bids in the first year, 10 more the next year and 10 more the year after, but, from what my hon. Friend said and from the discussions that are taking place in Stoke and the west midlands, it seems that Stoke is giving itself every chance of success.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/6">My hon. Friend asked whether there would be one bid per region. Given that 10 bids will be successful each year, it is clear that there will be more than one in at least one region. However, bids will be judged on the success criteria, so there may be more in some regions. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">My hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase> will be reassured to know that officials have noted the strong bid that Hartlepool is putting together. I am sure that he will continue to watch matters closely. On the amount of money that will be available, my advice is that &pound;2 million to &pound;10 million will be available for successful bids each year for five to 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/7">So where are we now? A great deal of progress has been made on LEGI in a short time. The extensive consultation process not only demonstrated the breadth of support for the initiative but gave us an opportunity to refine some elements of the programme. In July, we signalled through the next steps document that my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government presented to the House that we were going ahead with LEGI and setting a broad timetable for local authorities and others. We look forward to reviewing high quality bids in December and to funding them from April 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/8">There is a great deal of work still to do. LEGI has ambitious aims, and we hope that the impact will be far reaching, boosting the economies not only of the most deprived communities but of the regions and the nation. We must learn from successful programmes so that other local areas can adapt LEGI to their local economies. We have never attempted to tackle this problem in such a sustained way, but by working with partners in neighbourhoods, local areas and regions we will try to make a big difference to local economies. I wish my hon. Friends and their local authorities every success in the process.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/9" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/10" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at two minutes to Five o'clock.</p>
