	<p pid="b.181.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this morning, Dr McCrea. This is the latest in a long series of debates on the coastguard service and I look forward to debating it again with the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.2/2">With the coastguard station, police officers, community support officers and second fire engine under threat in Crosby, it struck me as odd that the Government had not carried out a risk assessment of the impact of such cuts on public safety. I want to look at the co-ordination between the emergency services and see how police, fire and ambulance services will carry out their duties without coastguard staff, who have immense local knowledge and years of experience. There will also be an impact on the RAF mountain rescue service, the British Transport police and the many volunteers who carry out vital rescue services up and down the country. I plan to look at the ability of other emergency services to support the remaining coastguards to carry out their duties following the cuts to their budgets.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.2/3">In the spirit of &#8220;Have I Got News For You&#8221;, I have brought along two guest publications. The Royal Yachting Association&#8217;s members&#8217; magazine stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.181.2/4">&#8220;It is clear that changes to the current system are needed to improve the safety of boaters.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.181.2/5">Will the Minister tell us how organisations such as the RYA were involved in drawing up the original plans?</p>
	<p pid="b.181.2/6">The second guest publication, <i>Firefighter,</i> is probably well known to the Minister because he has a distinguished record in the fire service.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-06-14b.181.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40522" speakername="Bill Esterson" colnum="181"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110614/halltext/110614h0001.htm#11061446000404">
	<p pid="b.181.4/1">Well, he has served in the fire service.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/2"><i>Firefighter </i>states:</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/3">&#8220;Voluntarism, good neighbourliness and a desire to perform &#8216;public service&#8217; have a limited place in the fire and rescue service on safety grounds.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/4">I raise that comment because cuts in budgets and staffing have led to the expectation that some of the work of the emergency services will have to be delivered by volunteers. The question is whether that is a safe or acceptable risk for the public. It would be helpful to see how the emergency services and public safety will be affected by the planned cuts. Coastguard staff at Crosby work closely with the police, fire, ambulance and search and rescue services.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/5">I have a number of questions for the Minister, some of which he will be able to answer and some of which he may have to refer to his colleagues in other Departments. The proposed changes to the UK-wide service will have a huge knock-on effect and this debate aims to tease out some of the wider issues, many of which have been briefly addressed in our previous debates.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/6">There is a disagreement between the Minister and many coastguard staff and stakeholders about whether an adequate risk assessment was carried out as part of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency plans. It would be interesting to hear what assessment was carried out of the impact on other emergency services and on their ability to continue to support the coastguard. I include in that assessment the impact of funding cuts on voluntary organisations, including the Royal National Lifeboat Institution&#8212;an organisation&#8217;s ability to raise funds may suffer as a result of the economic climate&#8212;and local volunteer services such as the Southport rescue service.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/7">I attended a consultation meeting at which more than 200 people were present, including representatives from the Southport rescue service. Concerns were raised by the shipping industry, the oil and gas sector, search and rescue volunteers and pleasure craft users. Will the Minister tell us how far those sectors were involved in the drawing up of the original plans? It is said that staff were not asked for their views, and that has been repeated right the way through this process and by many hon. Members here today. Could the Minister confirm whether the plans were drawn up by former front-line staff with no recent operational experience? Will he tell us whether the police, fire service, ambulance service and volunteer search and rescue teams were asked for their views before the plans were drawn up?</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/8">The lack of front-line involvement in drawing up the proposals is a key flaw and a matter of grave concern for hon. Members here today and the staff and public who rely on the coastguard and other emergency services. It is at the heart of the difficulty that the Government face during this process.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/9">The way in which Ministers pushed ahead with the proposals is similar to the way in which so many other policies are pushed through Government&#8212;too fast and too soon. They failed to engage with stakeholders and staff and they failed to involve the other emergency services when they drew up the plans. That led to many of the flaws that have been so graphically illustrated during the consultation. It would have been far better to get the proposals right in the first place and not to have the plans systematically dismantled by staff, volunteers, maritime experts, commercial and leisure users and the general public.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/10">Like many other places in the country, the Merseyside fire and rescue service is set to lose its marine service as a result of Government cuts. I would be interested to hear what discussions have taken place between the MCA and the fire service about the work done jointly between coastguards and river and coastal fire and rescue boats, and what the impact of the cuts will be. Has the Minister spoken to his colleagues in the Department for Communities and Local Government about the cuts in the fire service and has he raised concerns about the impact of the cuts on Merseyside and elsewhere in the country?</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/11">Did the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government ask the Minister or the Secretary of State for Transport whether the cuts in the fire service would have any effect on the coastguards and what the impact would be on public safety? These questions would have been addressed if the fire service had been asked to help draw up the plans for the coastguard.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/12">Co-ordination between rescue services would have helped to deliver changes without compromising safety. This story appeared in the <i>Liverpool Echo </i>on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-05">5 March</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/13">&#8220;Four people had to be rescued from a pilot boat that caught fire on the River Mersey today. The alarm was raised at around 3.10 am that the crew of the Dunlin were drifting in the river after the fire knocked out the engine. The New Brighton RNLI boat was launched to save the people onboard, who were transferred to another pilot boat, the Petrel. Firefighters tackled the blaze on the water before the stricken Dunlin was towed back to the landing stage at the Pierhead. The fire crews finished dampening the smouldering boat down at around 6 am. No-one on the Dunlin was hurt.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/14">There is praise there for the RNLI and the fire service, but after the cuts, will the RNLI have the contacts to respond? Will the coastguard be able to direct the RNLI or another rescue team to the scene in time?</p>

	<p pid="b.185.0/1">I will declare an interest&#8212;I am a member of the council of the RNLI. So I know that there really are concerns about charitable giving. Obviously, that issue is separate from the issue of the Government plans. However, the evidence given to the Transport Committee inquiry&#8212;this was said very clearly&#8212;was that in the consultation about these cuts only about four or five of the hundreds of RNLI stations across the country gave evidence. Privately, many RNLI members are concerned about the level of cuts and the disappearance of local knowledge. That is a fact. If anyone talks to RNLI members, volunteers and full-time crew members, they will find that they are concerned about the impact that these cuts will have on local knowledge and on their operations.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-06-14b.186.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40522" speakername="Bill Esterson" colnum="186"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110614/halltext/110614h0001.htm#11061446000420">
	<p pid="b.186.3/1">The hon. Lady speaks from tremendous personal experience, and I know that all Members recognise her involvement in the matter and the sadness around the loss of her husband. I pay tribute to her involvement in putting the case for the coastguard. She has made a very good point about the RNLI, and I am pleased to hear the evidence about fundraising&#8212;that is very important. The reason for my question is to tease out that sort of information and to look at the wider impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.3/2">I have raised the issue of the impact on the fire service, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40484" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase> has submitted a series of written questions about cuts to the maritime incident response group by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. Does the Minister have any further information on that?</p>
	<p pid="b.186.3/3">Many Members have expressed concerns about how the plans were drawn up. The maritime industry was asked for its views about pleasure craft users and the fishing industry, but was it asked about the impact of the cuts in fire, police and ambulance services and about the loss of the ability to co-ordinate services?</p>
	<p pid="b.186.3/4">On the police, Merseyside police authority says that it is not recruiting new officers. It expects to lose 480 officers over two years, and its budget for community support officers ends in two years&#8217; time. The <i>Liverpool Echo</i> estimates that up to 800 front-line officers will go over four years, and across England and Wales the figure is 12,000 over two years. Has the Minister discussed with the Home Secretary the impact of such job cuts in the police service? How will police officers replace the relationships they have built up with coastguards, and will police officers be available to cover some of the work done by coastguards and search and rescue volunteers who tell us that they will call it a day because of fears for their own safety without the co-ordination of trusted, local coastguards with years of experience? If the Government perform the U-turn that they should, what will happen to the joint working with police and fire services anyway?</p>
	<p pid="b.186.3/5">I have asked many questions about co-ordination, about the impact of the MCA plans on police, fire and voluntary emergency services connected to the coastguard, and about the effect of the cuts on the ability of emergency services to support the coastguard, whether or not the Government close most of the coastguard stations. The more I investigate the matter, the clearer it is that this is yet another issue governed by pound signs rather than by efficiency, putting saving money before saving lives. A recent <i>Crosby Herald</i> article stated that the original review had excluded Crosby coastguard station in my constituency. Crosby was hastily reinserted, however, when Ministers were reminded that the work force there were well organised and would almost certainly put up a fight. That is the view of staff and of local people. The suggestion is that the consultation was a sham and that Crosby was going to be closed whatever the outcome. We will clearly see before very much longer whether that is true.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.3/6">I am sure that the Minister will remind me of his visit to Crosby. He told staff there that the coastguard was like the fire service and that he, as a firefighter, did not need to be told where the fire was. It was pointed out to him that along the coast of north-west England there are many mud and sand banks, but no roads, and creeks and gullies with similar names, and it could easily take someone who did not know the area many minutes to identify the correct location to which to send search and rescue. A delay of a few minutes could well cost lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.3/7">My questions today suggest that if a coastguard station closes, the lack of local knowledge could become even more critical because of the cuts to other emergency services. The coastguard, the other emergency services and the public all need assurances that the Government&#8217;s plans for the coastguard are not one of their many political cuts, and that they will reconsider the proposals. The reality is that the coastguard cuts, along with the cuts to the other emergency services, go too far and too fast. They have not been planned or thought through, and they should be reversed.</p>

	<p pid="b.187.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40522" name="Bill Esterson">the hon. Member for Sefton Central (Bill Esterson)</phrase> on securing the debate. I am pleased that we are looking at the co-ordination role of the coastguard</p>
	<p pid="b.187.0/2">co-ordination stations, which has not always been focused on in other debates, and at their role in overseeing incidents at sea. It is the local coastguards who pull together the emergency services during an incident and who, over many years, have built up relationships with those services. We remove that local relationship at our peril.</p>
	<p pid="b.187.0/3">I firmly believe, as did my late husband, that there should be modernisation of coastguard equipment to allow, for example, the position of vessels transmitting with the voluntary class B automatic indicator system to be identified easily, but that there should be no cull of marine rescue co-ordination centres. Because of my personal position, I have received representations from concerned sea users all over the country, but it is appropriate for me to concentrate on my own area.</p>
	<p pid="b.187.0/4">The marine rescue co-ordination centre in Brixham covers my constituency of South East Cornwall, and has built up unique experience from so many incidents over many years. The search and rescue area covered by Brixham stretches from Dodman Point halfway along the south coast of Cornwall to Exmouth in Devon, and it is essential to emphasise something I am sure the Minister will recognise and agree with&#8212; that local knowledge of topography saves lives. The care that I was afforded on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-25">25 March</phrase> by Looe RNLI crew and Brixham and Looe coastguards was beyond anything I could have expected, and I thank all those involved in the emergency services, and indeed the south-west fishing industry, for their kindness.</p>
	<p pid="b.187.0/5">This past Saturday I spent time with my local RNLI personnel and my local volunteer coastguards, who are all concerned about the Minister&#8217;s proposals. They feel that he has not had the opportunity to speak to people who operate at the sharp end, and I would like to invite the Minister to visit Looe&#8212;if his busy schedule allows it&#8212;to hear for himself their concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.187.0/6">Some examples of co-ordinated sea rescues undertaken by Brixham are the Santa Anna, the MV Willy, the MV Kodima, the Ice Prince, the Kukawa and the Bothnia Stone.</p>

	<p pid="b.188.1/1">I completely agree with my hon. Friend. I was coming on to the number of incidents. As far as technology goes, it was only last Wednesday that the London ambulance service system failed, and they were recording emergency calls with pen and paper.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/2">The incidents involving MV Willy and MV Kodima both happened off the coast of my own county division, when I sat on Cornwall county council. I witnessed at first hand the superb co-ordination provided by the Brixham marine rescue co-ordination centre, with the marine emergency rescue organisations and the Cornwall fire service and its emergency planning department. I doubt that the Minister has experienced that unique</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/3">way of working within a coastal fire and rescue service, but I appreciate that he has absolute expertise as far as an inland fire and rescue service is concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/4">I would like to highlight in more detail three incidents in which Brixham MRCC has been involved in co-ordination with other emergency services. The first occurred just before midnight&#8212;that is, outside daylight hours&#8212;on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-13">13 January 2008</phrase> and involved the Torbay and Salcombe RNLI lifeboats, coastguard rescue helicopter India Juliet, HMS Cumberland and several merchant vessels. They proceeded to merchant vessel Ice Prince, with 20 persons on board, 27 miles south-east of Start point after its cargo shifted in heavy weather and it began to list to port. The vessel was abandoned by 12 crewmen, one with a suspected broken leg, and they were airlifted to Portland by helicopter. The remaining eight were rescued by Torbay lifeboat and conveyed to Brixham. A French tug attended the scene, and damage was assessed in daylight.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/5">The second incident occurred on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-11">11 October</phrase> at 8.38 am and involved a missing person. Brixham took broadcast action and tasked the warship Westminster and coastguard helicopter R106 to assist the French coastguard at Cross Corsen in a mid-channel search for an 80-year-old male reported missing from passenger vessel Balmoral.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/6">Finally, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-10">10 February</phrase> this year at 6.43 pm&#8212;again, outside daylight hours&#8212;Brixham coastguard received a mayday distress call from fishing vessel Amber J reporting that fishing vessel Admiral Blake had collided with MV Boxford approximately 30 miles south of Start point. The Amber J reported that two crewmen from the Admiral Blake had entered the water and only one had been recovered. Salcombe RNLI&#8217;s all-weather lifeboat, coastguard rescue helicopter 106 from Portland and Royal Navy helicopter 193 were tasked to search for the missing crewman. After a mayday relay, numerous vessels assisted in the search, along with a rapid rescue craft from the Boxford. After a brief search, the missing crewman was located by the Boxford&#8217;s rapid rescue craft, winched aboard the coastguard rescue helicopter and taken to hospital. Rescue helicopter 193 stood by while the Salcombe lifeboat assessed the damage to the Admiral Blake. After the damage was assessed and controlled, the Admiral Blake was towed back to Plymouth, where the Plymouth lifeboat met the vessel and took her into port. That shows essential local partnership working among our local coastguard stations at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/7">Complicated incidents at Brixham have increased year on year since 1998, when 767 incidents were recorded. In 2002, there were 903 incidents, in 2003 there were 1,025, in 2009 there were 1,324 and last year there were 1,355. Of greater concern is the fact that this year, there have already been 546 incidents, an increase of 90 from the same period last year. I acknowledge that, taken at face value, the number of incidents at Falmouth appears higher, at 971. However, that can be broken down into 233 incidents similar to those that I have just described and another 738 that occurred under the international global maritime distress safety system. Some of those incidents might have been search and rescue, but others would have been passed to the relevant MRC centre to deal with.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/8">I am afraid that I must take issue with the Minister&#8217;s comments about Falmouth&#8217;s international role during a debate on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-02">2 February</phrase> this year. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/9">&#8220;Falmouth is internationally renowned for its international rescue capabilities. If we have a problem in Falmouth, where does that get picked up? Nowhere.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2011-02-02.320"><i>Official Report, </i>2 February 2011; Vol. 522, c. 320WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/10">He is clearly unaware that Brixham takes over GMDSS when Falmouth suffers an outage, and has taken over the system every Thursday for the past 12 months. Perhaps he will take the opportunity when he speaks to correct the statement that he made in February. It would also be interesting to hear from him whether there have been any incidents in which both stations in a pair have gone down at the same time.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/11">As I am sure the Minister knows, Falmouth was allocated GMDSS due to its proximity to Goonhilly Downs satellite earth station, which has closed. Many incidents are subsequently passed on to other coastal co-ordination stations, and it is unfair of him to include them in the number of incidents dealt with by Falmouth alone.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/12">I am disappointed that the Minister chose to describe Brixham and Falmouth as &#8220;ridiculously close&#8221; during the Adjournment debate last week. In fact, Brixham and Portland, Milford and Swansea, Thames and Yarmouth, Portland and Solent, and Forth and Aberdeen have fewer road miles between them, and if we measure as the crow flies, we can also include Holyhead and Liverpool on the list. Does he consider those stations to be ridiculously close?</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/13">Brixham MRCC is bought and paid for. We now need to cover only the station&#8217;s running costs. It contains an operations co-ordination room, an emergency planning room, a coastal safety manager&#8217;s office, a sector manager&#8217;s office, coastguard rescue equipment for the Berry Head rescue team, a coastguard rescue emergency vehicle, a marine surveyor&#8217;s office, a coastguard training office for the region and an aerial site, and it still has space to expand. Brixham has been approached to lease a whole floor to another emergency service for its offices and operation area. If the property is sold, new premises will need to be found and bought for all of the above.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-06-14b.191.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40544" speakername="Margaret Ritchie" colnum="191"  time="010:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110614/halltext/110614h0001.htm#11061446000427">
	<p pid="b.191.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40522" name="Bill Esterson">the Member for Sefton Central (Bill Esterson)</phrase> on securing this debate on such an important topic. My constituency of South Down in Northern Ireland has two fishing ports, so I know just how important the Bangor coastguard station is. I know of the necessity of maintaining a service that has developed a comprehensive knowledge of our seas. It is important that we keep the coastguard station in Bangor to protect those who use the seas around the island of Ireland, and those who use our coastal and inland waterways, including, in the case of Northern Ireland, those who use inland locations and are subject to search and rescue. Many of the people involved and those in other emergency services risk their lives to protect not only those in the fishing industry, but people involved in recreation and tourism.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.1/2">The Government will announce their decision by <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-19">19 July</phrase> and it is fair to say that the process has been marked by uncertainty for many people throughout Northern Ireland. Such uncertainty must give cause for concern regarding the outcome. The Government now seem to be re-evaluating and rowing back on their initial proposals. It is clear that they underestimated the value of the local knowledge developed over time by our vastly experienced coastguard personnel, and that they were prepared to risk losing this vital asset. I ask the Minister: was that really the purpose of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency&#8217;s proposals, or did it have better thoughts at heart about protecting the service?</p>
	<p pid="b.191.1/3">It is vital that the Minister and the Government listen to those experts who have spoken up during the consultation and arrive at a decision that safeguards those who use our waters. I and other hon. Members from Northern Ireland believe that there is a duty to protect our coastguard station in Northern Ireland and to ensure that it can operate at full-time capacity. I recently attended a meeting hosted by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40433" name="Lady Hermon">the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon)</phrase> in Bangor, which the Minister, along with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, also kindly attended. It was made clear to the Minister, via a range of robustly made proposals by staff, that it was possible to retain the coastguard station in Northern Ireland on a full-time basis by using other measures and means. I and other hon. Members from Northern Ireland would like to hear the Minister&#8217;s response to those proposals in advance of the final outcome, because it is particularly important.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.1/4">The other key point is that the Bangor coastguard station co-ordinates closely with the Irish coastguard. We would, therefore, lose out on that vital resource for protecting all of Ireland&#8217;s waterways. I recently had the opportunity to raise the issue with the Taoiseach&#8212;the Irish Prime Minister&#8212;and it is clear that closing or downgrading the Bangor station would be a great loss not only to the people of Northern Ireland, but to the people of the Irish Republic. Indeed, it is our coastguard that is nominated by the Irish Government to respond in the case of an emergency off the Donegal coast. It cannot be overlooked or ignored that our service operates on a cross-border, north-south basis on the island of Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.1/5">Another difficulty in shutting the service and depending on a coastguard station in Liverpool&#8212;I use these words with caution, considering the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Sefton Central&#8212;is that the island of Ireland operates with the Ordnance Survey at the point of origin, which is totally incompatible with the English mapping system. That is another reason why we need a full-time coastguard station in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.1/6">All those concerns have been reflected during the consultation process. Indeed, I am reminded of the words of the chairman of the North West mountain rescue team in Northern Ireland, who expressed concern that the closure of the station would adversely affect the relationship between the Northern Ireland coastguard and the Irish Republic.</p>

	<p pid="b.199.0/1">It is a pleasure to see you presiding over the debate this morning, Dr McCrea.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40522" name="Bill Esterson">the Member for Sefton Central (Bill Esterson)</phrase> on providing us with the opportunity to discuss this important matter again.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/3">It is good to see the Minister in his place, back under pressure, which is where Ministers should be&#8212;keeps him honest. I know that he is well regarded by most Members in the House and by the shipping community, and we are also confident that he is doing everything he can to protect the service, given the coalition&#8217;s deficit plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/4">As I have said before, the Opposition are not here to oppose all the coastguard reforms, nor am I a deficit denier. It is important to say straight away that the global financial crisis happened in every country&#8212;it was not a recession made in Britain, but was caused by the banks, and Labour accepts that we should have been tougher on them. Like every other country, though, we need to get the deficit down, which means cuts. We recognise the Government&#8217;s position.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/5">However, the Tory-led coalition is creating a vicious circle in our economy because it is cutting too far and too fast. That is our fear about the coastguard proposals: they are too deep and too fast. We certainly disagree with the presentation of options, such as either Stornoway</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/6">or Shetland, and we are uncomfortable with having to choose between Belfast or Liverpool&#8212;to name just two of the main locations. We therefore seek and hope to hear assurances about the future from the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/7">We have heard from several Members. My hon. Friend the Member for Sefton Central asked the central question about the role of the other emergency services and their relationship with the coastguard service. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40546" name="Sheryll Murray">The hon. Member for South East Cornwall (Sheryll Murray)</phrase> has more reason to be listened to on this issue than any of us&#8212;I am sure that the Minister is listening to her and her constituents. She made the point about local input. There has been huge interest in the consultation exercise, as we have heard from hon. Members. Despite the miles clocked up by the Minister, about which I am sure he will tell us in due course, areas such as Cumbria or the constituency represented by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40058" name="John Woodcock">the Member for Barrow and Furness (John Woodcock)</phrase>, would have been pleased to have the opportunity to meet the Minister as well, to express their real concerns about the possible closure of the Liverpool station. The hon. Member for South East Cornwall made her points on local knowledge and the case for Brixham strongly&#8212;as ever.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40544" name="Margaret Ritchie">The hon. Member for South Down (Ms Ritchie)</phrase> made a powerful case for the station at Bangor and the international implications given its cross-border arrangements. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40046" name="Alan Reid">The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr Reid)</phrase> mentioned Greenock and, generously, that our departed and much missed friend, David Cairns, championed this matter when in the House representing his town. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned language issues. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40681" name="Albert Owen">the Member for Ynys M&#244;n (Albert Owen)</phrase>, who has spoken knowledgeably on the question on several occasions, again raised the issue of Holyhead. His role in the RNLI council gives him greater insight. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40483" name="Robert Syms">The hon. Member for Poole (Mr Syms)</phrase>, who was generous with his time, and gracious as ever, rightly applauded the RNLI and paid tribute to everyone involved. Given that he is the MP for RNLI headquarters, which I had the pleasure of visiting during my time as shipping Minister, he is the right person to make such comments. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40068" name="Naomi Long">The hon. Member for Belfast East (Naomi Long)</phrase> repeated the concern of her constituents&#8212;and more widely&#8212;about the future of their station.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/9">I wish to ask about the maritime incident response group, mentioned by my hon. Friends the Members for Sefton Central and for Ynys M&#244;n, and about the future of the emergency towing vessel contract in association with the reform of the coastguard services. I submitted some questions to the Minister, but can he furnish more information on top of his answers of <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-26">26 April</phrase>? First, he addressed the maritime incident response group, which was set up to help fight fires on board vessels around Britain&#8217;s coast, given the gap in our armoury:</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/10">&#8220;We are finalising a risk assessment on the review of Maritime Incident Response Group which we hope to publish shortly.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/11">I wondered if that was likely to be soon. He also said a consultation exercise was going on with the fire and rescue services, and:</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/12">&#8220;Final decisions on future arrangements will be taken once this consultation is complete.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2011-04-26.91"><i>Official Report</i>, 26 April 2011; Vol. 527, c. 91W</phrase> and 92W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/13">Has the consultation been completed? Finally on the response group, are discussions with the Department for Communities and Local Government complete, given that it has responsibility for Britain&#8217;s fire services? What was the outcome of those discussions?</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/14">The question of the emergency towing vessel contract still causes concern, which was expressed most powerfully by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40413" name="Angus MacNeil">the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr MacNeil)</phrase> in the February debate because of the Donaldson inquiry and its recommendation about the contract and the &#163;100 million cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.201.1/1">The hon. Gentleman speaks knowledgeably on the issue, which I am grateful that he raised, and which the Minister has been considering, so an update on whether the work on the replacement service or arrangements has been finalised would be helpful. Can he say anything further, given the suggestion of some movement in the area?</p>
	<p pid="b.201.1/2">I am sure that the Minister has seen the Oxford Economics report on &#8220;The economic impact of the UK&#8217;s Maritime Services Sector&#8221;. I was generously supplied with a copy by Mr Doug Barrow of Maritime UK, who is well known and highly regarded in shipping circles. The summary of this authoritative report reminds us that the UK maritime services sector directly creates 227,000 jobs, contributes more than &#163;13 billion to the UK economy and generates &#163;3 billion plus for the UK Exchequer. It also supports considerable activity in other sectors, including direct, indirect and induced impacts supporting more than 0.5 million jobs and generating more than &#163;7 billion for the UK Exchequer. Given, in addition, the millions of recreational users of our seas and coasts, we must get the conclusions of the consultation right.</p>
	<p pid="b.201.1/3">As colleagues have articulated this morning and previously, here in Westminster Hall and in the main Chamber, there is much disquiet about the initial Government proposals. The Minister has given us some encouragement in previous appearances here and at the Dispatch Box that the proposals are not set in stone. The coalition&#8217;s policy adjustments in recent months&#8212;on forests, NHS reforms, sentencing guidelines, school sport partnerships, housing benefit rules, not to mention something we might be hearing today on bins&#8212;give some encouragement that the Government will listen to the various contributions from Members and from those outside the House and not proceed with the original proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.201.1/4">I congratulate all Members on their efforts. We know that there will be reforms to the coastguard service&#8212;of that, there is no doubt&#8212;but we will strive to ensure that they are neither too deep nor too fast. I look forward to the Minister&#8217;s comments.</p>

	<p pid="b.202.0/1">It is a pleasure, Dr McCrea, to serve under your chairmanship for the first time. I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40522" name="Bill Esterson">the hon. Member for Sefton Central (Bill Esterson)</phrase> for securing the debate, although most hon. Members linked it to matters wider than the link between the emergency services and the coastguard service. I pay tribute to their ingenuity in doing so, and I pay particular tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40546" name="Sheryll Murray">the Member for South East Cornwall (Sheryll Murray)</phrase> for bringing her knowledge to the debate. I know how difficult that must have been, and she did so courageously. We may not agree on everything, but I promise that we will remain friends.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.0/2">The Government set out the consultation process, we extended it, and we are reopening it so that the report of the Select Committee on Transport could be included in our thoughts. We will almost certainly have another consultation process because, as I have said since day one, as has the Secretary of State, what comes out of the process will not be the same as what we went in with, because we are listening. We have said that from day one, and I have said that as I have gone around the country. How that can be deemed a U-turn is strange. We did not say at the start that we would not come out with something different. Perhaps Her Majesty&#8217;s Opposition would prefer me to ignore everything that is said in the debates, be rigid, ignore public opinion, and have sham consultation, which is what happened under the previous Administration.</p>

	<p pid="b.205.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Dr McCrea. I am reminded of Fidel Castro&#8217;s old maxim that any speech of less than three or four hours cannot be any good, and when I reviewed the material available for this debate, I felt that it might be difficult to put everything I want to say into a shorter time. I appreciate, however, that this debate lasts only 90 minutes and that the Front-Bench speakers will be called fairly soon. I am not planning to take many interventions during my remarks, so that I can get through everything I wish to say as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/2">The importance of information technology to good health care cannot be overstated. As leading health informatics expert, Dr Anthony Nowlan, put it:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/3">&#8220;Redesigning the ways care is organised and conducted and supporting those new ways with information science is more important to people&#8217;s health overall than any new drug we could develop in the next decade.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/4">He also stated that</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/5">&#8220;the engagement of clinicians and managers is not just about telling them what is going to happen.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/6">Sadly, those words accurately summed up a significant part of the problem that we faced.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/7">The national programme for IT in the health service is the largest civilian computer project in the world. It was spawned in late 2001 and early 2002, after the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, met Bill Gates and was bowled over by a vision of what IT could do to transform the economy and health service. The idea was for information to be captured once and used many times, transforming working processes and speeding up communications. A far-reaching vision set out a programme that would supposedly lead to a transformation in people&#8217;s experiences of health care. Hospital admissions and appointments would be booked online&#8212;the choose and book system; pharmacists would no longer struggle with the indecipherable handwriting of GPs; and drug prescriptions would be handled electronically. There was to be a new broadband network for the NHS, a new e-mail system, better IT support for GPs and digital X-rays. Most important of all, medical records would be computerised, thus transforming the speed and accuracy of patient treatment through what became known as the NHS care records service.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/8">The NHS care records service comprised two elements: first, a detailed care record that contained full details of a patient&#8217;s medical history and treatment. That was to be accessible to a patient&#8217;s GP and to local community and hospital care settings, so that if treatment were required, all the information would be available. Secondly, there would be a so-called summary care record that contained medical information about things such as allergies and would be more widely available.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/9">It became clear that Tony Blair was in no mood to wait when he asked Sir John Pattison, who attended the Downing street seminar in February 2002 where these matters were discussed, how long the IT programme would take. Sir John Pattison later stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/10">&#8220;I swallowed hard because I knew I had to get the answer right&#8230; and I said three years.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/11">Tony Blair replied, &#8220;How about two years?&#8221; and they settled on two years and nine months from April 2003&#8212;in other words, until December 2005. Given the extent of the proposals, that was a ludicrous timetable. Nevertheless, the decision had been made, and everything had to be done at breakneck speed.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/12">Sir John Pattison and his team set to work and produced a blueprint entitled &#8220;Delivering 21st century IT support for the NHS: national strategic programme&#8221;, which was published in June 2002. The aim was to connect the delivery of the NHS plan with the capabilities of modern information technology. There was, however, an odd discrepancy at the outset. At the back of the original document were four appendices, one of which contained the project profile model and stated that the project&#8217;s estimated whole-life costs were &#163;5 billion. It provided a total risk score of 53 out of a maximum of 72. In other words, the project was very high risk. When the document was published, however, that project profile model had been removed and there were only three appendices&#8212;the likely costs of the project and the true risks were concealed right from the start. After the publication of the document, the Department of Health established a unit that later became the Connecting for Health agency. In September 2002, Richard Granger was appointed as director general of the NHS IT programme on a salary of about &#163;250,000. His job was to turn the national strategic programme&#8212;which soon became the national programme for IT in the health service&#8212;into reality.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/13">Richard Granger was a former Deloitte consultant who had successfully overseen the introduction of the London congestion charge. Speaking at a conference in Harrogate some months after his appointment, he announced that the cost of the IT programme would be &#163;2.3 billion. That figure contrasted with the unedited version of Sir John Pattison&#8217;s &#8220;Delivering 21st century IT support for the NHS&#8221;, which a few months earlier had come up with the larger estimate of &#163;5 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/14">Mr Granger commissioned a study by McKinsey into the health care IT market in the UK, which was then dominated by medium-sized firms that sold systems to hospitals and GP surgeries. The study concluded that no single player was capable of becoming a prime contractor in a multi-billion pound programme, and Mr Granger soon announced that the procurement process for the programme would be structured to attract global IT players. He had little respect for the skills of most public sector buyers of computing systems&#8212;perhaps with good reason if one looks at the track record&#8212;and knew that IT contractors routinely run rings around their customers in government.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/15">Mr Granger made it clear that things would be different on his watch. Contractors would not get paid until they delivered, and those not up to the mark would be replaced. He even compared contractors to huskies pulling a sled on a polar expedition:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/16">&#8220;When one of the dogs goes lame, and begins to slow the others down, they are shot. They are then chopped up and fed to the other dogs. The survivors work harder, not only because they&#8217;ve had a meal, but also because they have seen what will happen should they themselves go lame.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/17">Mr Granger started as he meant to go on, and potential contractors were left in no doubt that the procurement process was to happen quickly. In May 2003, potential</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/18">bidders were given a 500-page document called a draft output-based specification, and told to respond within five weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/19">One of the classic failures in many IT projects is the failure to consult adequately with those who will use the systems once they are delivered. The national programme followed that pattern in many respects, but in this case that did not happen by accident. Mr Granger had no patience with what he saw as special pleading by medical staff, whom he believed were unwilling to accept the ruthless standardisation that was necessary to deliver the advantages offered by the IT system. He effectively believed that he knew what the clinicians needed better than they did themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/20">Some clinicians were keen to ensure that they had proper input into what was happening. Sir John Pattison asked Dr Anthony Nowlan, the health informatics expert who at the time was the executive director of the NHS Information Authority, to secure the involvement of health professionals in the programme. The aim was to obtain a professionally agreed consensus about what was the most valuable information to store, and what was achievable in practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/21">After several months the group had hammered out a consensus, but although that work was fed in when the contracts began to be specified, it formed only a relatively small part of the overall specification. The large majority of the so-called output-based specifications, and the crucial major hospital systems at the heart of the programme, were developed without involvement and scrutiny by the leadership of the health profession. That happened despite the fact that involvement by users is essential if one wants software that works and that people will use.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/22">The great speed at which contracting was completed meant that all complex issues had to be faced after the contracts had been let. Anthony Nowlan began to realise that his efforts were not welcome, and he told the Public Accounts Committee that</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/23">&#8220;it became increasingly clear to me that efforts to communicate with health professionals and bring them more into the leadership of the programme were effectively obstructed.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/24">Worse still, Nowlan was subsequently asked to provide a list of the names of hundreds of people who had been involved in specification work, so as to provide evidence to reviewers that the work was valid. In fact, all that had happened was that an e-mail had been sent out. Quite understandably, Dr Nowlan thought that saying that people had been consulted because they had been sent an e-mail was not consultation in any proper sense, any more than compiling a list of people who had been sent an e-mail was proper validation. He regarded the claims as a sham, and refused to co-operate.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/25">It turned out that serious clinical input into the programme was not really wanted. As Professor Peter Hutton later told the PAC,</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/26">&#8220;it was like being in a juggernaut lorry going up the M1 and it did not really matter where you went as long as you arrived somewhere on time. Then, when you had arrived somewhere, you would go out and buy a product, but you were not quite sure what you wanted to buy. To be honest, I do not think the people selling it knew what we needed.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/27">The result was a set of contracts that were signed before the Government had understood what they wanted to buy and the suppliers had understood what they were expected to supply.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/28">When the then Health Secretary John Reid&#8212;now Lord Reid&#8212;announced the contract winners in December 2003, the value of the contracts had already shot up to &#163;6.2 billion from the original &#163;2.3 billion mentioned by Mr Granger in Harrogate. The time scale had tripled in length, and instead of the two years and nine months from April 2003 originally promised&#8212;to which Sir John Pattison had been obliged to commit at the Downing street seminar&#8212;the contracts were now to run for 10 years. Later, one of the most senior officials in the national programme, Gordon Hextall, even claimed that it was always envisaged that the programme would run for 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/29">Four winning bidders were appointed: Accenture; Computer Sciences Corporation, or CSC; Fujitsu and BT. They were known as local service providers, or LSPs. BT and Fujitsu picked a US software firm, IDX, to work with, while Accenture and CSC both picked a British software company called iSoft. iSoft was a stock market darling that had been spun out of the consulting firm KPMG in the late 1990s. The company&#8217;s flagship was a software system called Lorenzo, which was portrayed enthusiastically in iSoft&#8217;s 2005 annual report and accounts. The chairman, Patrick Cryne, told shareholders that Lorenzo had made &#8220;impressive progress&#8221;, while chief executive Tim Whiston stated that Lorenzo would be &#8220;available from early 2004&#8221; and that it had</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/30">&#8220;achieved significant acclaim from healthcare providers&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/31">With such promising statements from the company&#8217;s directors, the stock market was delighted, and it was no surprise that iSoft&#8217;s share price rose sharply. Mr Cryne, Mr Whiston and their fellow directors then sold large tranches of their personal shareholdings in iSoft, making around &#163;90 million in cash. In 2004, Patrick Cryne bought Barnsley football club.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/32">There was a slight problem. The flagship product, Lorenzo, which was described in such encouraging terms by the directors, was not finished. That caused a big headache for Accenture, the biggest LSP, with two contracts worth around &#163;1 billion each. It was in partnership with iSoft and was trying to implement software that was basically not implementable. CSC faced a similar problem in the north-west. Under the Granger rules of engagement, no one was supposed to get paid until something was delivered. As iSoft had not produced a working version of Lorenzo, the brutal reality was that neither Accenture nor CSC had any software to deploy.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/33">There were still big concerns about the programme&#8217;s indifference to securing clinical buy-in from users&#8212;clinicians in hospitals&#8212;even though numerous studies had pointed to such buy-in as the key ingredient for success in any IT project. Professor Peter Hutton wrote to the then chief executive of the NHS, Sir Nigel Crisp, to express his continuing disquiet:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/34">&#8220;I remain concerned that the current arrangements within the programme are unsafe from a variety of angles and, in particular, that the constraints of the contracting process, with its absence of clinical input in the last stages, may have resulted in the purchase of a product that will potentially not fulfil our goals.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/35">Soon after pointing out politely that the emperor had no clothes, Professor Hutton was asked to consider his position, and he tended his resignation. The IT people</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/36">were simply not interested in what the doctors were telling them. To give them belated credit, however, the Department of Health began to realise that securing the support and buy-in of clinicians who would have to use the systems might be a good idea.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/37">In March 2004, the deputy chief medical officer, Professor Aidan Halligan, was appointed alongside Richard Granger as joint director general of NHS IT, and joint senior responsible owner of the programme, with specific responsibility for benefits realisation. That was welcomed by clinicians. One delegate at the Healthcare Computing conference in Harrogate said that Halligan&#8217;s appointment was &#8220;really, really good&#8221; because</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/38">&#8220;he has the trust of clinicians and can stand up to Granger&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/39">although a general practitioner delegate at the same conference said that it &#8220;spoke volumes&#8221; that nobody like him had been in the post earlier. Halligan acknowledged that not enough had been done to win the support of clinicians, whose buy-in, he said, was critical to the success of the project. Listening to clinicians was now the flavour of the month. However, there was one insuperable difficulty&#8212;the contracts had already been signed. As Professor Hutton later explained to the PAC,</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/40">&#8220;it became clear from discussions with suppliers in early 2004 that what they had been contracted for would not deliver the NHS Care Record&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/41">Accenture and CSC struggled on with the unusable Lorenzo. Eventually they commissioned a study that produced a confidential report in February 2006, which confirmed their worst fears. The report stated that the Lorenzo had</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/42">&#8220;no mapping of features to release, nor detailed plans. In other words, there is no well-defined scope and therefore no believable plan for releases.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/43">That was over five years ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/44">In March 2006, Accenture announced to its shareholders that it would use $450 million to cover expected losses on the programme. It made repeated offers to the programme that it would meet its contractual obligations by using other software. However, that might have bankrupted iSoft, and Richard Granger was having none of it. He responded with a threat when Accenture talked about walking away. Referring to tough penalty clauses contained in the contracts, he said that</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/45">&#8220;if they would like to walk away, it&#8217;s starting at 50% of the total contract value&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/46">Accenture had two of the &#163;1 billion-a-piece prime contracts, so it appeared to be facing a cool &#163;1 billion in penalty payments to the Government if it abandoned the programme. Strangely, it did not work out that way. Accenture engaged in swift negotiations with the health service and in September 2006, after making a penalty payment of just &#163;63 million, it duly exited the programme. Mr Granger&#8217;s threat, that if Accenture left the programme it would face gigantic penalty payments, proved to be of little account. There were rumours that if Mr Granger had demanded any more money, he would have faced serious and embarrassing counter-claims from Accenture for failures by the national programme to stick to its own contractual obligations.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/47">CSC, with its own &#163;1-billion contract for the north-west and west midlands regions, was in no better a position than Accenture to implement the unfinished Lorenzo software. It was also struggling to mop up after having caused the largest computer crash in NHS history,</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/48">when its Maidstone data centre was hit by a power failure, followed by restarting problems. The back-up systems did not work, and data held in the centre could not be accessed. That meant that, for four days, 80 NHS trusts could not use their patient administration systems and had to operate as best they could with paper systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/49">Another worry for CSC was its shareholders. Accenture had set aside hundreds of millions of pounds against expected losses and told the stock market accordingly, but CSC had done no such thing. In addition to its problems with losses in the UK, the company had troubles back home in the United States, where it faced allegations of corruption. The US Department of Justice had alleged that CSC was part of an alliance, which included virtually all the major sellers of hardware and software in the United States, that had swapped unlawful kick-backs in Government agency technology contracts. CSC finally agreed to a $1.37 million payment to resolve those allegations. That was reported on the news blog of Cnet.com on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-13">13 May 2008</phrase>, under the heading:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/50">&#8220;CSC settles with feds over kickback allegations&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/51">In such circumstances, having extra contracts from the NHS might look reassuring to the US stock market. Despite the fact that there was no implementable software&#8212;Lorenzo still was not finished&#8212;CSC quickly took on both Accenture contracts, tripling its involvement in the programme. However, there were continuing problems at iSoft, which was supposedly writing the Lorenzo software. One of the problems related to the publication of iSoft&#8217;s financial results, which had been repeatedly delayed, up to the point where one of iSoft&#8217;s own advisers, Morgan Stanley, a brokerage, declined to publish a profit forecast, stating:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/52">&#8220;We don&#8217;t feel we have enough visibility to offer a recommendation&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/53">With friends like that in the stock market, who needs enemies? Finally, iSoft was forced to declare a loss of &#163;344 million, which wiped out all the company&#8217;s past profits. The Financial Services Authority launched an investigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/54">Now, three fifths of the programme was dependent on one troubled local service provider, CSC, which was using a software supplier, iSoft, that was itself under investigation by the FSA. One regional contractor, Accenture, had been replaced by another, CSC, which had less experience. The central problem remained: the software that they had been trying to deploy, iSoft&#8217;s Lorenzo system, was still not finished.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/55">In those circumstances, iSoft started to deploy software products that predated the programme, which Connecting for Health duly paid for. Those older products did not meet the specifications for the national programme. It is important to remember that fact, because that is what many acute hospitals have now been given&#8212;old and outdated software that was deemed inadequate nine years ago to meet the programme&#8217;s specifications.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/56">Meanwhile, the other two providers, BT and Fujitsu, were having their own problems. They were trying to implement American software, which is not such an easy thing to do in a British hospital, because American hospitals rely on billing for each and every activity and do not, conversely, expect to have to handle waiting lists. An American software system cannot be just uploaded to an acute hospital main frame and be switched on&#8212;it is not that simple.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/57">In June 2005, IDX was dropped by Fujitsu with Richard Granger&#8217;s consent and replaced by another American firm, Cerner, which had a software package for large acute hospitals called Millennium. BT, some 18 months after winning its LSP contract, was still struggling with IDX. By July 2005, BT was facing serious threats from Richard Granger that it could be axed if it did not start to perform. In an interview with <i>Computing</i>magazine, Mr Granger said:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/58">&#8220;BT had better get me some substantial IDX functionality by the end of summer or some predictable events will occur.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/59">However, it was not that simple. As the leading health care IT website, <i>e-H</i> <i>ealth Insider</i>, pointed out, replacing BT as the local service provider</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/60">&#8220;would represent a major failure for the programme, and raise questions over the whole IT-enabled NHS modernisation&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/61">and lead to even more delays. The website added:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/62">&#8220;Such a move would also potentially raise serious questions about whether the adversarial management style of Connecting for Health is the most likely to deliver new systems that provide clinical benefits to patients in a timely and cost-effective fashion.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/63">BT was allowed to continue as the local service provider and eventually, with Granger&#8217;s consent, it was allowed to follow Fujitsu&#8217;s lead and replace IDX with Cerner Millennium.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/64">At a London conference in July 2005, Mr Granger gave a stern warning to suppliers who were lagging behind on delivery:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/65">&#8220;We will get very soon to a point where they will either come good with what they&#8217;ve got, or they will get a bullet in the head.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/66">Mr Granger was also showing signs of defensiveness about the programme, stating:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/67">&#8220;It might be a policy disaster, but it isn&#8217;t an IT disaster. The system was delivered to spec&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/68">and he gave the example of the electronic staff record. He added:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/69">&#8220;If some of my colleagues do not think sufficiently through as to what was wanted then it&#8217;s a specification error.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/70">Such statements by Mr Granger led to howls of rage from some industry observers, including one who, after Granger&#8217;s speech, posted a comment on the <i>e-</i> <i>health Insider</i> website, saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/71">&#8220;Now and then I check myself from hatred of what Richard Granger stands for and has done to NHS IT, and then the sheer arrogance and ignorance of his public statements brings me back. He set the ridiculously short timescales for decision-making, procured before there was a clear idea of the scope, handed all the &#8216;choice&#8217; from NHS clinicians to private contractors. CfH&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/72">Connecting for Health&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/73">&#8220;hasn&#8217;t solved the funding crisis for computerising the NHS, rather landed us with a massively expensive way to do what some of us were achieving already&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/74">Meanwhile, the National Audit Office had embarked on a study of the national programme, which was due to be published in summer 2005, but there were considerable delays. As Members may know, NAO reports involve a clearance process, during which a report&#8217;s factual content is cleared with the Government before publication, and that has benefits for both sides. However, something different happened with the national programme report. It was as if Connecting for Health wanted to use the clearance process to expunge the slightest criticism of</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/75">its activities. It undertook a war of attrition with the auditors, in a process that the NAO later described as fighting</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/76">&#8220;street by street, block by block&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/77">The final report was delayed again and again, and it finally appeared in June 2006. It was much weaker than seasoned health IT observers had expected. The Minister of State, Department for Communities and Local Government, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40617" name="Greg Clark">the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark)</phrase>, who was then a member of the PAC, described it as &#8220;easily the most gushing&#8221; he had read, while a BBC correspondent described it as a &#8220;whitewash&#8221;. Most of the key criticisms were eventually excised, as Granger and his team ground down their opponents. It later emerged through freedom of information requests that earlier drafts had been much tougher.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/78">Tom Brooks, a management consultant with years of worldwide experience in health care, wrote a devastating submission to the PAC, in which he questioned the whole rationale for central procurement in the programme. He said that</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/79">&#8220;the poor quality of the negotiation of the NPfIT contracts by Mr Granger&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/80">was a subject of criticism. He described the view that central procurement would produce systems that met local requirements as &#8220;a fundamental error&#8221;. He told the Committee:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/81">&#8220;MPs are mis-informed if they view the central infrastructure as making reasonable progress&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/82">Dr Anthony Nowlan, whom I mentioned earlier, described the programme as &#8220;back to front&#8221;, given that the contract stating what would be produced had already been let. He pointed out the sheer absurdity of a consensus document produced by the programme stating:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/83">&#8220;Now that the architecture for England has been commissioned, designed and is being built, there is a need for clarity concerning how it will be used&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/84">A group of health IT experts sent the PAC a detailed paper offering a devastating critique of the entire programme. The group provided evidence that it was likely to deliver neither the most important areas of clinical functionality nor the benefits required to justify the business case. The group simply stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/85">&#8220;The conclusion here is that the NHS would most likely have been better off without the National Programme in terms of what is likely to be delivered and when. The National Programme has not advanced the NHS IT implementation trajectory at all; in fact, it has set it back from where it was going&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/86">In view of the frequent misunderstandings about the national programme among so many journalists, broadcasters, politicians and commentators, it is worth quoting the expert group&#8217;s document at some length. It starts by saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/87">&#8220;It is useful to begin with the question: What is the central point of NPfIT&#8212;its chief raison d&#8217;etre? Is it a shared medical record (otherwise known as the &#8216;Central Spine&#8217; or &#8216;Central Summary Care Record Service&#8217;) across England?</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/88">The answer to this important question is simply: no&#8230;the central point of NPfIT is to provide the local Care Record Service...Compared with the local CRS, the Central Spine is a much lower priority because it is totally speculative and even if delivered is likely to result in very little clinical benefit&#8230;This is a subtle but critical point. The Local CRS systems&#8230;are a proven technology&#8230;These local CRS systems have always been costly investments (several million pounds per hospital over several years) but have been proven in the NHS and elsewhere to deliver real clinical benefits&#8230;This picture is entirely different for the</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/89">so-called Central Spine record, or Central Shared Summary record, which NPfIT (and the government ministers) would like the public to believe is the central point of NPfIT. It is not. The Central Spine record is just a concept&#8230;The problem is that clinicians have told us medicine does not work like this. Clinicians do not just use a summary record to deliver care. They build and depend upon detailed and specific medical data that are relevant for each patient.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/90">They do not rely on some other clinicians&#8217; definition of what will be most relevant to put in a summary record. What is relevant clinically will inevitably vary from patient to patient.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/91">The concept of a summary Central Spine record has no scientific basis and no significant clinical support to back it up&#8212;just an overly simplistic and na&#239;ve storyline about a Birmingham patient falling ill in Blackpool. In fact, no one has ever provided any figures on how often this situation is likely to arise to show whether or not the investment in the Central Spine record is worthwhile.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/92">The point here is that the Local Care Record Service&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/93">I emphasise the word &#8220;local&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/94">&#8220;is the essential building block for clinically useful health IT to support clinical care in progressive, modern and proven ways. Yes, it is difficult to implement and can take 2-3 years to roll-out across the whole hospital (or organisation), and yet it is always worthwhile&#8230;These Local Care Record Service systems are the building blocks and are the point of NPfIT, and what NHS Trust Chief Executives want, need and expect. They are not waiting for a Central Spine record to run their hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/95">However, the Local Care Record Service systems (or the Local Service Providers&#8217; newest versions of them) are not likely to be fully deployed now (only the rudimentary patient administration elements of them will be) because NPfIT is putting in old &#8216;legacy&#8217; products in place of new modern Local Care Record Service products in its panic to show deployment and because the systems have been so late in being delivered by the LSPs&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/96">the local service providers. The document continues:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/97">&#8220;The key point of the National Programme for IT is to provide both depth of clinical systems functionality and breadth of integration in terms of delivering the contracted Local CRS functions across organisations and care-settings (acute, primary, mental health, social services).</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/98">This is the true vision of health IT promised by the National Programme which is embodied in the Local Service Provider contracts and it is what their price reflects.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/99">The trouble is, with all the delays, the LSP schedules are being down-scoped behind the NHS&#8217;s back and without any accountability to the local NHS Trust chief executives to whom the original vision was promised.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/100">In September 2006, with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40566" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (John Pugh)</phrase>, I published a paper called &#8220;Information technology in the NHS: What Next?&#8221; In it, we identified four fallacies and offered a way forward. The fallacies were that</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/101">&#8220;Patient data needs to be accessible all over the country&#8230;Local trusts can&#8217;t procure systems properly so the centre has to do this for them&#8230;Large areas of the NHS need to work on a single massive system&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/102">and that the</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/103">&#8220;National Programme saves money.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/104">The suggested way forward was to allow hospital chief executives to buy the systems they actually wanted, subject only to common standards, and to fund such purchases partially from the centre, while making local chief executives contractually responsible for delivery.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/105">Shortly after we published that paper, the NHS chief executive, David Nicholson, introduced the NPfIT local ownership plan, but it did not follow our suggestion of giving local chief executives autonomy in what they bought. Under the NLOP, hospital chief executives</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/106">would still be required to buy the software that the local service provider was contracted to provide&#8212;the difficult-to-install American system, Cerner Millennium, or the non-existent Lorenzo.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/107">Furthermore, instead of there being one senior responsible owner for the programme, which is a central tenet of good project management practice, there would be many dozens of senior responsible owners dispersed among the different primary care trusts, strategic health authorities and hospitals across the country. Those bodies were given responsibility for implementing and delivering software that was not available or which did work properly, without a free choice to buy something else that did work. The NLOP looked more like an attempt to decentralise impending blame than a serious attempt at reform. That is why Tony Collins, one of the country&#8217;s leading computer journalists, playfully said that NLOP actually stands for &#8220;No Longer Our Problem&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/108">In February 2007, Andrew Rollerson, a senior Fujitsu manager who had assembled and then led the winning Fujitsu team in the original bid process, mentioned more or less en passant at an IT conference that his view of the national programme was that</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/109">&#8220;it isn&#8217;t working and it isn&#8217;t going to work&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/110">To many informed observers, it was just a statement of the obvious. The PAC called him to give evidence, and when asked if he felt that he had been the</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/111">&#8220;one who let the finger out of the dam&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/112">and allowed</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/113">&#8220;a whole collective sigh of relief&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/114">to go round the health IT sector, he replied:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/115">&#8220;I think that is absolutely spot on.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/116">Fujitsu then wrote to the Committee stating that Rollerson was not a senior executive of the company and had not been involved for a long time, but neglecting to mention that he had led the winning bid team.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/117">By 2007, another accounting probe had been launched into iSoft by an accounting standards body, and in the following month, April, the PAC published its report, which concluded that</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/118">&#8220;at the present rate of progress, it is unlikely that significant clinical benefits will be delivered by the end of the contract period&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/119">By June 2007, Richard Granger had announced that he would quit at some point and shortly afterwards stated that he was &#8220;ashamed&#8221; of some of the systems put in by Connecting for Health suppliers, singling out Cerner for criticism. David Nicholson, the NHS boss, appointed several new senior executives to join Granger at the top table, while continuing to reject calls for a full review. Tony Collins wrote in <i>Computer Weekly</i> that the future of the national programme for IT in the NHS was &#8220;hazy&#8221; and that it was becoming</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/120">&#8220;difficult to delineate success from failure&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/121">Derek Wanless, whose major review for Tony Blair into the future of the health service had first identified investment in IT as an area for improvement, publicly questioned whether the NHS IT programme should continue without a full audit. He said that</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/122">&#8220;there is as yet no convincing evidence that the benefits will outweigh the costs of this substantial investment&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/123">In October 2007, the Department of Health rejected rumours that Matthew Swindells had been appointed interim chief executive of Connecting for Health, but in</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/124">an industry survey he was named the 12th most influential person in the NHS&#8212;10 positions above Richard Granger. It appeared that Richard Granger&#8217;s influence was on the wane and that he was being eased out. Tony Collins mused on his blog that the programme might be even worse without Richard Granger&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/125">&#8220;the thought of this juggernaut being without a driver is even more scary that when it had a driver but no controls&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/126">Mr Granger&#8217;s last day as an employee of the NHS was <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-31">31 January 2008</phrase>, though, curiously, it was a week, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-06">6 February</phrase>, before the interim director of NPfIT and systems delivery, Gordon Hextall, sent a letter to Connecting for Health staff to tell them that Granger had gone and that two appointments would replace him: a top-level chief information officer and a director of IT programmes and systems delivery. Meanwhile, the interim chief information officer would be none other than Matthew Swindells, whose involvement the Department had denied earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/127">In February 2008, the Commons Health Committee published a report on the electronic patient record, which stated that it was &#8220;dismayed&#8221; by the lack of clarity about what information would be included in the summary care record and for what the record would be used. It also said that there was &#8220;a stark contrast&#8221; between the &#8220;specific and detailed&#8221; vision set out for the integrated care records service in 2003 and the &#8220;vague and shifting&#8221; vision set out in 2007. The Committee concluded that there was now a</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/128">&#8220;perplexing lack of clarity about exactly what NPfIT will now deliver.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/129">In May 2008, the NAO published a progress update, which was much more robust than its earlier report. It concluded that the programme has</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/130">&#8220;largely failed to deliver on its central objective of detailed care record systems for acute hospital trusts&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/131">Not a lot was happening at that point because there was no software to deploy, so many people were employed but they were not necessarily doing very much. In October 2008, Nick Timmins of the<i>Financial Times</i> wrote about the national programme in a front-page story:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/132">&#8220;Progress has virtually ground to a halt, raising questions about whether the world&#8217;s biggest civil information technology project will ever be finished&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/133">He quoted Jon Hoeksma from <i>e</i> <i>-</i> <i>Health Insider</i> who said that</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/134">&#8220;the key part is stuck&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/135">and added that hospital chief executives did not want to take the system</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/136">&#8220;until they had seen it put in flawlessly elsewhere&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/137">The second PAC report, published in January 2009, concluded that the programme&#8217;s failures raised questions about the feasibility of the whole project and that the central contracts&#8212;the enormous local service provider contracts&#8212;were an encumbrance. Only nine months into his job, Matthew Bellamy quit as the chief information officer&#8217;s right-hand man. Just before Christmas 2009, the then latest Health Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40361" name="Andy Burnham">the right hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase>, gave an interview in which he sang the praises of the national programme and said that</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/138">&#8220;parts of the NHS cannot operate without it&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/139">Unfortunately for him, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40241" name="Alistair Darling">the right hon. Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling)</phrase>, took a different view&#8212;and said so in a television interview a couple of days later. He said that the national programme was</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/140">&#8220;not essential for the front line&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/141">and announced that he was imposing a &#163;600 million spending cut that took its budget down from &#163;12.7 billion to a mere &#163;12.1 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/142">Meanwhile, new year 2010 was not a happy one for the iSoft directors. The Financial Services Authority&#8212;the chief City regulator&#8212;announced that it had laid criminal charges against four former directors of iSoft: Patrick Cryne, the founder and former chairman; Timothy Whiston, the former chief executive; and former directors Stephen Graham and John Whelan. They were accused of conspiracy to make misleading statements. The four denied the charges.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/143">Where are we now? We have yet another NAO report, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-18">18 May</phrase> this year, which states in even more bald terms that</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/144">&#8220;the aim of creating an electronic record for every NHS patient will not be achieved under the Programme.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/145">The central aim of the programme will not be achieved under the contract. Several conclusions regrettably emerge about Connecting for Health. The first is about overpaying. It massively overpays: acute trusts are costing &#163;23 million, when they should be about &#163;8 million; the system for mental health and community trusts&#8212;RiO&#8212;is costing &#163;8.9 million per deployment, when it should be about &#163;1.5 million; and the other systems, such as the picture archiving and communications systems for digital X-rays&#8212;PACS&#8212;and N3 broadband, which everyone says is not particularly good anyway, are also massively overpriced. I should say in parenthesis that the digital X-rays are very good, but Connecting for Health should not have paid so much for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/146">The second conclusion is on de-scoping. Connecting for Health has dealt with the problems it has faced by drastically reducing the scope of what is being delivered, but without corresponding reductions in cost. The third conclusion is the hiding of increased costs. The late deliveries meant there have been no running costs for systems that have not been delivered, and the surplus cash is being used to hide the increasing cost per deployment.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/147">Fourthly, there are serious doubts about the commercial judgment and skill of Connecting for Health. It seems that every contract revision makes things worse. Very little of the originally expected system has been delivered, but despite that, the NHS seems to have little or no commercial cover. The Fujitsu termination, when it was fired from the programme, was farcical and generated massive potential costs and liabilities. The local service providers appear to be running rings around Connecting for Health commercially. As the <i>Financial Times</i> noted on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-25">25 May</phrase> this year, CSC is offering a one-third reduction in the cost of its contract in return for doing two-thirds less work. As the Cabinet Office observed, that would roughly double the cost compared with the original agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/148">The fifth conclusion is the danger of future high costs. When the contracts finish, there is inadequate provision to manage the systems in future. It takes a special skill to leave trusts stuck with systems that are</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/149">functionally very poor and out-of-date, which were not deemed adequate nine years ago, and still manage to expose them to enormous future costs over which they will have very little control. That is precisely what Connecting for Health is managing to do. Finally, there is a serious danger that Connecting for Health will put CSC in particular in a monopoly position. The proposed revised agreement may be open to legal challenge from other suppliers who have not had the chance to bid.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.1/150">What should happen now? It is plain that the NHS IT programme has not worked and there is no evidence that it will work. Rather than squandering another &#163;4 billion to &#163;5 billion, which is still unspent, the NHS should recognise reality. Connecting for Health has failed to achieve its central purpose and should be closed down. I am afraid that it will not help and is now more interested in the preservation of its own position than in protecting the interests of taxpayers. NHS trusts must be set free to choose the systems that meet the needs of patients and medical professionals. They should have the power to source products locally that suit their needs, subject only to common standards.</p>

	<p pid="b.219.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40549" name="Richard Bacon">the Member for South Norfolk (Mr Bacon)</phrase> on securing this debate. I pay tribute to his tenacity in pursuing the subject. I know that he has a long-standing interest in it, and rightly so given the amount of money being spent on the project. I cannot compete with the way in which he articulated his case, or with his forensic and almost anorak-like knowledge of the subject, but I associate myself with the conclusions that he draws.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.2/2">The project has always been over-ambitious. We would all agree that it has been poorly led and ineffectively delivered. As with many procurement projects in the public sector, the cost has escalated considerably. We have seen it happen too many times, and it is always entirely predictable. Indeed, senior leaders in the NHS were warned about that from the start.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.2/3">The intention to ensure that health data should be made available at any time and anywhere was laudable, but delivering it has to be offset against the cost and whether it offers good value for money. Clinicians, practitioners and IT specialists throughout the NHS said that it would not work. Ultimately, clinicians will</p>
	<p pid="b.219.2/4">find their own way of doing things, and a top-down system will not work unless it is executed from the bottom up. As my hon. Friend explained, the decision to involve clinicians in the design of the system was not taken until late in the day and probably beyond the point when they could have had a useful input to ensure that the programme was fit for purpose.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.2/5">Let me underline what my hon. Friend said. If we look at the initial programme of delivery and what we have achieved so far, we can see that we have not progressed far. Of the 4,500 sites that were contracted to receive the system, some two thirds have yet to receive anything. If we examine the progress made by Computer Sciences Corporation&#8212;my hon. Friend has outlined the history of its involvement with this case&#8212;we will see that it is contracted to deliver its systems to 97 hospitals, but so far it has delivered only four and none has been able to confirm that the system has been installed satisfactorily. Put simply, CSC has not delivered the goods against its obligations on the contract.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.2/6">Once the contract is in place, everyone signs up even though it is quite clear that the company is not delivering what it promised. To be fair, in this case, the NHS started to renegotiate the contract in December 2009. None the less, more than 18 months later, no new contract or renegotiated contract is in place. CSC is still working on the same terms that it initially agreed to and we still do not have adequate delivery.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.2/7">The NHS was quite clear when it said that it would not sign a new contract until it could see that Lorenzo was working. It is clear that we have to take some tough decisions because it simply is not working. As it is taking so long, we have to decide whether we are managing the project efficiently. Just how poorly does a contractor have to perform before a serious charge is made as to whether that contract should be maintained?</p>
	<p pid="b.219.2/8">The NHS is an extremely powerful client. I know that suppliers have duties and obligations to their shareholders, but surely maintaining a good relationship with a customer that is as big as the national health service or even as the Government is important. We would expect suppliers to be slightly more conscious about what they are obliged to deliver.</p>

	<p pid="b.230.1/1">It is a pleasure to speak under your chairmanship, Mrs Brooke. I am grateful for the opportunity to initiate this debate on the effect of property regulation on holiday lettings. This debate will be of interest to colleagues representing constituencies with beautiful countryside, coastline or other features that lend themselves to tourism. I am glad to say that Pendle is one such constituency, with rolling countryside and picturesque villages. Only last week, plans for a new 76-berth marina were approved.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/2">Properties that are made available to let for holidaymakers are a vital part of tourism in the UK. Typically, these are attractive, domestic properties, owned by a couple or a family, and some are managed by an agency. They are the smallest of small businesses and in great need of protection from fruitless and costly regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/3">I have called this debate because I am concerned that holiday lettings are not getting the protection that they need. I wish to start with a quote from a &#8220;Dear colleague&#8221; letter that I received only last week from the Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40313" name="Mark Prisk">the Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr Prisk)</phrase>. The letter mentions the &#8220;one in, one out&#8221; system of regulatory control introduced by the Government. Apparently, planned regulations have been cut from 157 to just 46, with only 11 of those adding to the regulatory cost on businesses. I welcome that, and emphasise that it is my intention to help the Government by identifying where they can clearly go further. I believe that we all want small companies to be relieved of pointless, costly and dubious regulations, and I applaud the Government&#8217;s record on that so far.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/4">The letter finishes by saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/5">&#8220;We are continuing to work hard to cap the cost of new regulations. In addition, we are tackling the stock of existing regulations, ending the &#8216;gold plating&#8217; of EU regulations and have scrapped measures that would have cost SMEs &#163;350 million each.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/6">However, holiday lettings face two costly challenges in upcoming regulations, one of which is being defended as a European Union requirement when it is not being adopted by any other European country. I refer to the change due to happen at the end of this month, whereby holiday lettings will be required to provide an energy performance certificate, and to the review of the controlled waste regulations that are due to be introduced later this year. Both will force an unnecessary, costly, pointless and, I believe, legally questionable burden on holiday lettings, doing damage to British tourism in my constituency and many others. I hope to present a case that the Government can and should reconsider both regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/7">Let me start by addressing the controlled waste regulations. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-14">14 January</phrase>, the consultation closed on proposals to replace or amend the Controlled Waste Regulations 1992. It was a joint consultation carried out by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Welsh Assembly Government. Will the Government look again at these proposals, which would place an unfair cost on the shoulders of small business owners?</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/8">Hoseasons, an agency representing those wanting to let their properties for self- catering holidays, which employs about 500 people in my constituency, produced</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/9">a submission highlighting its concerns about the proposed changes, stating that they could damage the viability of letting self-catering holiday cottages. Having first been scheduled to come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-06">6 April</phrase>, the document has been postponed by DEFRA and will come into force sometime in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/10">The publication tells us that waste from domestic properties used in the course of a business for the provision of self-catering accommodation will now be classed as commercial waste. This causes a discrepancy between properties that are let for long-term domestic residence and properties that are let for self-catering holidays. The person letting their property for the full calendar year has their tenants&#8217; waste classed as domestic waste, whereas the person letting their property as a holiday cottage for more than 140 days of the year will be charged commercial rates, even though the property may be empty for the majority of the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/11">That seems wrong, because the use of both properties is fundamentally the same: both are used for living in as a place of residence, and the owner of the property makes a profit in both cases. The injustice is that the owner of a holiday cottage incurs extra expense without necessarily receiving more income. That may lead owners to decide to let their property full time, to lessen their outgoings and increase their income. This in turn could impact the strength of the rural tourism industry, because the properties may no longer be viable as holiday lets. More than 67 million domestic holiday trips were made in 2009. I am sure that everyone will agree that the regulations are impacting the future not only of agencies such as Hoseasons in my constituency, but of every individual who lets their property to holidaymakers for more than 140 days of the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/12">If we look at the proposals of the controlled waste regulations, we will see that the amount and type of waste in question is the same. Do we really need to charge different rates for the same collection, based on whether a property is being rented for a week or a year? Section 75 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 defines household waste as from a domestic property that is solely for the purposes of living accommodation. Defining this waste as commercial would presumably require a separate collection service. Would this mean heavy-duty refuse trucks pounding down rural roads just to get to what are often small cottages, or are holiday lettings being asked to pay more for the same service, in which case, why increase the cost of waste collection?</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/13">My final point in relation to the regulations is on recycling, an issue important to us all. Most local authorities offer a free collection service of recyclable materials from all domestic properties. Classing waste from holiday properties as commercial would make them ineligible for this free service, thus providing a disincentive to recycle. The last time I stayed in a holiday let was a few years ago, when I decided to spend the new year with a group of friends. Needless to say, while, naturally, we are all very responsible drinkers, our stay resulted in several empty wine and beer bottles, which were dutifully placed in a recycling box for disposal when we left. I fail to see how making such properties ineligible for domestic recycling services&#8212;meaning that I would have had to put those bottles in a commercial</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/14">waste bin&#8212;will do anything to help the environment. Will the Government look at the regulations, so that owners and guests alike are encouraged to recycle and can assist local authorities in meeting recycling targets?</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/15">I now turn to energy performance certificates, which were first introduced in England and Wales on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-01">1 August 2007</phrase>. They are required only for newly purchased or rented accommodation. The question is whether a holiday letting should fall into that category. I would like to run through a few of the reasons given for why they should, and why those reasons are not persuasive.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-06-14b.232.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40475" speakername="Andrew Stephenson" colnum="232"  time="012:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110614/halltext/110614h0002.htm#11061448000178">
	<p pid="b.232.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that point. I know that this is an issue close to her heart. The certificate will be hard to enforce, because it applies only to holiday cottages that are being let for more than 140 days a year. How an owner of a holiday let will decide whether it will be let for more than 140 days over the coming year is up in the air. How can anyone predict how good, bad or indifferent the coming season will be? My hon. Friend has made a good point about how the provision will be enforced. I was not going to address that issue, but it is critical.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/2">EPCs would not serve holidaymakers, because those who stay in a holiday letting do not pay the energy bills. They have no need to see an EPC, unlike a prospective buyer or tenant, who needs to see one when looking at the energy performance of a property. When someone rents a property long term, they become liable for the energy bills, which is something that a holidaymaker in a holiday let never becomes.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/3">The argument could be made that a holidaymaker would prefer to stay in an energy-efficient property, purely for environmental reasons. If so, we already have ways for customers to identify not just environmentally friendly holiday lettings, but those that have gone the extra mile through schemes such as the green tourism awards. Malkin Tower Farm in Blacko in my constituency is an example of an excellent holiday letting that has been awarded a green tourism award and was the 2008 winner of the Pendle environmental business award.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/4">One could argue that all properties ought to have an EPC, since all properties consume energy and we need to tackle climate change. Therefore, according to that argument, holiday lettings should have an EPC. I think that the fact that that is not Government policy&#8212;as I found out when I asked my hon. Friend the Minister, in a written question, what the policy was&#8212;means that it cannot be the reason why the Government want to push ahead with introducing EPCs for holiday lettings. The only reason that can be given for this additional cost and red tape on small business is the idea that this change will bring us in line with Europe, specifically the energy performance of buildings directive. That is the justification the Minister gave me on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-07">7 June</phrase> in response</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/5">to a written question on the subject asking how the new rules could be brought in, given the moratorium on new regulations from April 2011 for businesses with fewer than 10 people.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/6">It will therefore surprise hon. Members to learn that England and Wales are the only EU countries currently choosing to force EPCs on holiday lets. We should remember that that change is due to come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-30">30 June</phrase> this year, which is a matter of days&#8217; time. To be fair, France previously required EPCs for holiday lets but, after consideration and consultation, it revoked the law requiring them. I believe that, since <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-12">12 July 2010</phrase>, no other EU country has forced EPCs on to holiday lettings and that England and Wales will be the only countries doing so.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/7">I know that because I have, again, consulted Hoseasons, which has sister companies operating in the holiday letting market in more than 20 countries around Europe. It tells me that none of those companies reports any requirement for EPCs for holiday lets and it is therefore confused that the Government believe we are being brought into line with Europe. This is a classic case of the UK gold-plating an EU regulation&#8212;something that Ministers had promised to stop.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/8">For the avoidance of any confusion, I understand that the EPBD states that all buildings are subject to the regulations unless specifically excluded. As holiday lets are not specifically excluded, it has been construed that the regulations must apply to them. However, the regulations also state that EPCs should apply only where a building is to be sold or rented. The question comes back to whether, when a customer makes a booking for a holiday let, that creates a tenancy, with the legal ramifications that go with it. I have received a copy of a document from Local Government Regulation that clearly suggests that it does not. I know that it has been in contact with the Department for Communities and Local Government to express its views on the matter and to make similar points to those I am raising today; for example, the fact that the holidaymaker simply has no benefit from having access to an EPC for the property where they are staying. It is fair to say that I agree with Local Government Regulation in its considered and sensible opinion:</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/9">&#8220;To apply &#8216;rent&#8217; in the usual sense to holiday accommodation is absurd and inconsistent with the generally accepted understanding of the term &#8216;to rent&#8217;&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/10">Given that no country in Europe takes such a view, why does the DCLG, even when it has received advice to the contrary from Local Government Regulation? I hope that the DCLG will reconsider its position as a result of today&#8217;s debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/11">I come back to what I said at the beginning: it is my intention today to help the Government here. There is a real need to cut regulation, to free up small business and to kick-start growth. Overall, the Government have done exceptionally well so far on that score. The Government&#8217;s red tape challenge aims to reduce the amount of unnecessary regulation on business, but introducing unnecessary EPCs and waste regulations on holiday lettings is surely going in the wrong direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/12">With an estimated 62,500 holiday lettings in Britain, the introduction of EPCs will create a bill of around &#163;10.4 million. That is a serious burden to impose on genuinely small businesses. By abandoning these proposals, the Government would be acting in support of domestic tourism and helping to keep the cost of a holiday in the</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/13">UK within the reach of those on lower incomes. The Government would be acting in support of small businesses and in support of reducing red tape and pointless regulations. The Government have done a lot right, but they are in danger of getting it wrong on holiday lettings. By introducing EPCs and treating the waste from a holiday let as commercial, the Government would be upping the costs on an important but vulnerable sector of the British tourism industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/14">I would like to leave hon. Members thinking about a holiday let in my constituency&#8212;Bobbin cottage in Earby. Bobbin cottage is a small, beautiful cottage with only two bedrooms which is ideally situated for the nearby walking trails. What will the impact of these changes be on Bobbin cottage? What benefit will there be from additional refuse trucks pounding their way through the rural roads of Earby to dispose of the latest holidaymakers&#8217; week&#8217;s worth of banana skins and used teabags? Will the holidaymakers read the EPC for Bobbin cottage and think, &#8220;Well, it would be a nice place to stay, but will the landlord be paying too much for the steamy hot bath that I&#8217;ll need to take after walking across Kelbrook moor?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/15">The reality is that these changes will not have a positive impact. They will make Bobbin cottage more expensive to run, which will be reflected in the cost of staying there and will make it harder for Britons to experience one of the most scenic parts of my constituency. For Bobbin cottage, domestic tourism and the tens of thousands of small business owners out there affected by these new regulations, I urge the Minister to reconsider.</p>

	<p pid="b.235.1/1">My hon. Friend asks a worthwhile question. I imagine that it would be quite difficult to achieve a burden of proof to prosecute somebody for underestimating their intentions. I understand that the Department is not aware of any prosecutions under the regulations. Compliance is self-driven, rather than driven by prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.1/2">My hon. Friend raised the issue of cost. Undeniably, there is a cost to having an EPC&#8212;probably in the range of &#163;50 to &#163;80, depending on the provider. My hon. Friend quoted the figure of &#163;10 million. That figure is for the total cost over a 30-year period, so we need to keep the scale of the problem in perspective. If the EPCs led to owners improving the energy performance of the cottages and homes that they let, they would receive a payback of &#163;15 million in that 30-year period. There is, therefore, a net benefit in the provision of EPCs and the implementation of the energy-saving results that they will reveal&#8212;as there is for EPCs for the 6 million-plus that have been issued to ordinary homes. I want to ensure that we have it clearly on the record that there is a first cost, but that there is a potential for saving, too. As my hon. Friend recognised, that also makes a contribution to reducing the United Kingdom&#8217;s carbon output.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.1/3">I would like to correct one of my hon. Friend&#8217;s facts, and to explore one of the propositions that he brought forward. He said that England and Wales would be the only countries enforcing this. They are already required in Scotland and Northern Ireland, so, depending on what we define as a nation, other places in the UK require EPCs. I asked my officials whether there was evidence of non-conformity by other European countries. I have been told that, having made inquiries to the European Commission, they are not aware of any country that is not implementing the EU directive in the manner that we now propose should be the case in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.1/4">My hon. Friend produced some information about what France had done, and referred to the fact that a provider of holiday lets in his constituency had evidence from a much wider field around Europe. I hope that he will accept, as a glimmer of light, that the very first thing I shall do after the debate is seek whatever validation we can for those two pieces of evidence. We do not want providers in England to be at a disadvantage to other European countries simply because we have taken too robust a view of how the directive should be interpreted.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.1/5">My hon. Friend referred to the Local Government Regulation document. I think that he has slightly over-egged his case. It has produced advice that says that an EPC is not required. The Department has attempted to get in touch with Local Government Regulation, which is a subset of the Local Government Association, to challenge or examine how it came to that view. Unfortunately, the member of its staff who prepared that advice is no longer with the organisation and we are having difficulty establishing how its view was arrived at. It may, quite reasonably, have been based on the advice, issued by the Department in 2008, to the effect that all holiday homes were exempt, but that was clearly not correct and clearly contradicted by the reality that no derogation was entered into by the UK in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.1/6">My hon. Friend has raised these matters at the highest levels in Government, and has made it clear that he believes that there are unnecessary burdens that could be lifted by the Government. As he acknowledged, the Government have a very good record on this. Indeed, an important part of what my Department attempts to do is to bust barriers. Barrier busting is something on which we wax eloquent. If my hon. Friend has, as he believes, found two barriers that we can bust, I give him an assurance that we will see what we can do to achieve that. However, the UK Government must correctly</p>
	<p pid="b.235.1/7">interpret and comply with EU legislation. It is also extremely important to reduce the carbon output of the UK. Half of the carbon output in the UK comes from buildings, and a quarter comes from homes. Tackling this sector is important. EPCs are an important part of what we need to do to set the climate, atmosphere and culture that will lead owners and occupiers to use their buildings in an energy-efficient way. I hope that he will accept my assurance that we are listening to the points that he has made. However, we have a duty to ensure that we not only comply with European legislation, but live up to our target to be the greenest Government ever and ensure that all kinds of householders play a full and active part in helping us to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.1/1">That is my whole point. High fuel prices have become part of the poverty trap, and are a disincentive for people to get back into work, despite the Government&#8217;s excellent programmes, including the Work programme. I thank my hon. Friend for raising the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/2">Long-term stats from the Department of Energy and Climate Change show that in 1970 we used 25 million tonnes of petroleum in the transport sector. That has risen year-on-year, and doubled to 50 million tonnes today. But despite the UK being a net exporter of petroleum products, and despite the fall in the international oil price, our petrol prices are still sky-high. In January this year, members of the Federation of Small Businesses said that if petrol prices continue to rise, 62% will be forced to increase their prices, risking inflation; one in 10 may have to lay off staff; 26% will be forced to freeze wages; 36% will have to reduce investment in new products and services; and 78% will see</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/3">&#8220;their overall profitability in jeopardy&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/4">Taxation is only part of the problem, and another major concern is transparency. As the AA, RAC, and FairFuelUK have said, if the 2p drop in the market cost of petrol had been passed on to motorists earlier this year by energy companies, it would have wiped out most of the impact of the 2.5p VAT rise. In May, I wrote to the chief executives of Shell, BP, Total, and ExxonMobil asking for price transparency so that we can see why prices are not falling. So far, only Total and BP have replied, but their replies essentially said, &#8220;Nothing to see here.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/5">In 2009, before the disaster in the gulf of Mexico, BP boasted profits of &#163;8.7 billion. This year, Shell has reported first quarter profits up 40%, making its global profits nearly &#163;2 million every hour.</p>

	<p pid="b.244.0/1">Does the Minister, or her Department have any suspicion that high oil prices are the revenge of oil companies for the &#163;2 billion that the Chancellor raised in the Budget through the North sea tax, which also threatens perhaps 15,000 jobs? Oil companies are losing money to the Government in one way, and are penalising consumers and people up and down the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.244.1/1">The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point, but the price of oil is a spot price driven by commodity markets. We are talking about a part of the industry that is different from the area in which we chose to raise tax. We are working with industry to ensure that we mitigate any risk of a lessening of investment in the North sea as a result of that tax. As my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow pointed out, we needed to strike a balance to take into account the overall effect of high oil prices as they fed through into the broader economy in petrol prices and energy prices more generally.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/2">The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the report from the Office for Budget Responsibility. It showed clearly that, although the Exchequer has some growing tax receipts, the dampening effect of the rest of the economy is also significant. We felt that although there was an overall impact on the economy, one sector&#8212;the oil companies&#8212;was doing much better from a high oil price. It seemed fair and sensible to look at how we could balance some of the value that was being generated by the high oil price, and to create a fairer split between oil companies and those motorists and businesses that bear the brunt of the prices at the pump. We are working hard with industry to mitigate the impact of our policy on investment&#8212;the impact was analysed as being small by industry observers such as Wood Mackenzie. This is an important debate, and the Government recognise that motoring is an essential part of life for households and businesses. Fuel costs affect us all, and as the price of petrol continues to rise, those costs have become an evermore significant part of everyday life for people and companies. We were keen to look at what could be done.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/3">The previous Government left us facing the introduction of a fuel escalator from the 2009 Budget that would have involved seven fuel duty increases. I realise that in this half-hour debate, only a Government Minister gets the chance to respond to the Member who secured it, but I am disappointed that a shadow Minister was not present to listen to some of the concerns raised. One of our biggest challenges concerned how to deal with the proposed above-inflation increase in fuel duty. That increase could have resulted in average prices at the</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/4">pump being 6p per litre higher than they are currently. We would have seen above-inflation rises in 2012, 2013 and 2014. When we took office, no plan was in place to support motorists, and within the huge financial constraints in which we found ourselves, and with little room for manoeuvre, we had to see what we could do to address such an important issue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-06-14b.251.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40548" speakername="Andrew Robathan" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence"  colnum="251"  time="013:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110614/halltext/110614h0002.htm#11061448000226">
	<p pid="b.251.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40577" name="Anne McGuire">the right hon. Member for Stirling (Mrs McGuire)</phrase> on securing this short debate to highlight the work of Queen Victoria school in Dunblane. She takes a close interest in the school and has presented prizes there&#8212;perhaps she will do so on grand day on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-24">24 June</phrase>. I congratulate her on her obvious passion and support for the school.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/2">The school has a long and proud history, which the right hon. Lady detailed. Its work chimes well with the Government&#8217;s commitment to our armed forces and their families, which is part of the armed forces covenant. The right hon. Lady&#8217;s first question was whether the Government recognise the value of QVS and, anachronistic or not&#8212;the school is rather unusual&#8212;we certainly value its work. I will discuss that further later in my speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/3">The history of QVS is unique, although there are similar, but different schools in England. As the right hon. Lady said, the school was founded in 1905 by royal warrant. I was not going to mention the &#8220;in perpetuity&#8221; bit, but, unfortunately, she has already mentioned it. The school was originally founded by public description, but the Secretary of State for War undertook to maintain it for the sons of Scottish sailors and soldiers. Those responsibilities are now vested in my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Defence. Responsibility for its day-to-day governance rests with the board of commissioners, and the right hon. Lady has told us who they are. I was glad that she did not want to attack the senior and distinguished commissioners from 1974. The commissioners report to the Adjutant-General on behalf of the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/4">Since 1908, the opportunity has been taken to widen and modernise the remit of the school, while staying in the spirit of its founding constitution. In 1919, just after the Royal Air Force was formed, the school was opened to children of RAF personnel. It became co-educational in 1996, when entry was extended to daughters of service personnel, and, as the right hon. Lady said, it accepted the children of officers in 1999. Its basic purpose remains consistent with the aims of those who contributed so generously to its establishment: to provide secondary boarding education for the children of Scottish personnel and personnel who have served in Scotland</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/5">or are part of a Scottish regiment. Although parents are not charged fees, they make a modest contribution to ancillary costs, which is slightly more than &#163;1,000 a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/6">The two elements of the school&#8212;the fact that it is Scottish and for the services&#8212;have combined to give it the very special ethos and nature that makes it unique in the UK. As well as providing a sound academic education, the school offers its pupils the opportunity to participate in various Scottish activities, including Scottish dance and performing in a pipe band. I was in an English regiment in the Army, but the one thing that would have persuaded me to join a Scottish regiment was not so much the kilts&#8212;my legs notwithstanding&#8212;but the fact that I love marching to a pipe band. I am glad to know that that activity continues in Dunblane.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/7">It is in understanding and meeting the specific needs of service children that QVS is most special. The recent Ofsted report on children in service families, which covered England and Wales but contains lessons equally applicable to all our service families, found that some service children&#8217;s learning slowed or receded with the frequent moves that service life requires. It should be pointed out though that that does not feed through to attainment and there is no evidence of underachievement. Indeed, in the paper, &#8220;The Armed Forces Covenant, Today and Tomorrow&#8221;, the Department for Education states that in England attainment in exams for service children is not below average. It also demonstrates that at some stages of their education, service children have better attainment than their non-service counterparts.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/8">QVS offers full continuity of secondary education for the children who attend and most importantly it offers it in a secure and safe environment that recognises and understands the special pressures on children that their parents&#8217; life in the services can bring. The disruption caused by service life can be worsened when parents are deployed on active service, and the operational tempo has remained high for over a decade. The Ofsted report to which I referred found that some service children were susceptible to social and emotional disturbance when a parent or family member was on active deployment. Those pressures are especially well understood and catered for in a school where the staff are alert for their signs and where pupils can understand and share one another&#8217;s concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/9">Over the years, Her Majesty&#8217;s inspectorate of education and the Care Commission, which inspect Scottish schools, have commented favourably on the supportive environment that QVS offers to service children. The school plays a valuable part in supporting elements of the armed forces covenant in Scotland, which provides an answer to another of the right hon. Lady&#8217;s questions. Against that background, the Ministry of Defence has continued to provide for the needs of the school. As well as financing its running directly, much support is provided by the local military. Headquarters 2 division, based in Edinburgh, offers practical help in a number of ways, such as security and transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/10">The school has concerns about the state of its buildings, and it is not unique in that. The pressure on the estate, which has to support the wide range of activities for which the MOD is responsible, is unrelenting, and when distributing limited resources, the needs of the school, however worthy, must be balanced against other operational and welfare priorities for our people and the wider</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/11">needs of defence. The fact that some of its rather beautiful buildings are listed adds to the attractiveness of the school, but also to the costs of maintaining it. Within that difficult environment, I am pleased to say that QVS has seen some &#163;2 million-worth of refurbishment, improvement and maintenance works over the past couple of years, including the replacement of a significant number of windows within the grade II listed main school building.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/12">I am aware however that not all the perceived needs and aspirations of the school have necessarily been addressed. Therefore MOD officials, some of whom serve as commissioners, are working closely with the school and the whole board of commissioners to develop a strategic plan, not just to preserve the achievements of the school, but to improve on them. That will include identifying the investment required in the infrastructure, but it is by no means confined to that. For example, with Her Majesty&#8217;s commissioners we are exploring closer integration with Service Children&#8217;s Education, which provides education for service children overseas. I am not suggesting that Scotland is overseas, because I know that doing so would get the right hon. Lady going, but there is a certain synergy in the provision of education. The school is unique, and it might be better dealt with by the SCE because it deals specifically with the education of service children.</p>
