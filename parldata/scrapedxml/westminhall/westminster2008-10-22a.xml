	<p pid="a.70.2/1">I congratulate the hon. Lady on securing an important debate on a matter that will affect the quality of life of all constituents in the south-east. She has made some excellent points.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/2">Is the hon. Lady not heartened by the assurances the Government have given to me, including on the Floor of the House, that the Environment Agency will prevent any further building on the floodplain&mdash;certainly in my constituency&mdash;and that the Government are against building on the green belt? They have set their face to building on brownfield land. There is plenty of that to achieve the housing targets that they have set.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.1/1">It is a pleasure to sit under your chairmanship, Mr. Amess. I am grateful to have the opportunity to debate this important subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/2">State-sponsored terrorism has been and remains one of the most alarming trends in international terrorism. It is not a new phenomenon. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-11">11 September</phrase>, the western world experienced the nightmare of international terrorism on a scale that had never been seen before. Unfortunately, such action was not a new phenomenon. For many decades, Ulster has suffered from the appalling consequences of IRA terrorism, which has been heavily funded and sponsored by rogue states, such as Libya. Fuelled by a hatred of all things British, Colonel Gaddafi supplied the Provisional IRA with weapons and cash for many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/3">One of the most lethal weapons in the IRA arsenal was the deadly Semtex explosive, which made one of its first appearances in Enniskillen in that deadly and tragic bombing in November 1987. For decades, it has been used to bomb towns and cities throughout Northern Ireland. It was used to tear out the heart of the City of London and it left a trail of death and destruction in Omagh in 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/4">As a result of Libya's prolonged and persistent support for the IRA, many innocent men, women and children are dead, and their relatives physically and psychologically scarred. While we are living in more peaceful times in Northern Ireland today&mdash;and we are all grateful for that&mdash;the scars of the victims will never heal, and the victims must never be forgotten. We are faced with the threat from Islamic terrorism. The western powers have worked towards the restoration of diplomatic relations with Libya and towards bringing Colonel Gaddafi and his regime in from the cold.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-22a.106.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" speakername="Ian McCartney" colnum="106"  time="014:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081022/halltext/81022h0006.htm#08102245000599">
	<p pid="a.106.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1823" name="Lorely Burt">the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt)</phrase> on securing this debate in such a timely manner. I know that she has a strong interest in consumer affairs. When I was the Minister with responsibility for trading and consumer affairs, she represented the Liberal Democrats with distinction, although she caused me uncomfortable moments at times, particularly during the passage of the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act 2007. During the passage of that Act, she spent a great deal of time talking about vulnerable consumers and the impact of indebtedness on them, individually and as families. The points that she made in today's debate are among a family of measures that she is prepared to set before the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/2">I declare an interest: since leaving the Government, I have become president of the Money Advice Trust, which was founded in 1991, following the Conservative Government's report on indebtedness and the lack of free face-to-face advice&mdash;or free advice of any kind&mdash;to help people to get out of debt and to manage their resources effectively so as to prevent them from going further into debt, or back into debt once they had come out of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/3">Since 1991, the president of the trust has been Lord Borrie, so I have large shoes to fill. I am enjoying the role, and I hope to give a flavour of the trust's work to all hon. Members, because it is not a partisan political organisation. Indeed, during the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, the Leader of the Opposition visited the service and was made extremely welcome. He had a private discussion and debate not just with those who run the national debt advice centre in Birmingham, but with the staff who have daily contact with people to work on their indebtedness and to help them through it to reach the other side and keep them and their families together.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/4">The Money Advice Trust is there to increase the quality, availability and efficiency of money advice. It receives resources from Departments and from the banking and other sectors, with two thirds of its funding coming from outside Government and one third from Government. The trust's job is to co-ordinate money advice, provide direct service provision free to all who contact it, provide information, and influence the training and research of the money advice sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/5">The trust is chaired by Martin Hall, former director general of the Finance and Leasing Association, who has a great reputation in the City and in the voluntary sector, where he is involved in work in this area. The chief executive is Joanna Elson, a former executive director at the British Bankers Association, who is one of the most effective chief executives working in this area, in this country and in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/6">The Money Advice Trust opened up Business Debtline and has now received pledges from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, for which I wish to thank the Minister, for an ongoing budget through to 2010. Since September this year, demand for the Business Debtline service has risen by a staggering 60 per cent., putting stress and strain on its resources and ability to give good-quality advice to those who need it, and need it quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/7">The co-ordination of the free-to-client money advice sector, which includes Citizens Advice, is done by the trust. As a consequence, through Government funding, we now have the largest number of debt advisers of any country in Europe. That is down solely to the funding provided by the Government and the significant role played by the former Treasury Minister, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" name="Edward Balls">the Member for Normanton (Ed Balls)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/8">The National Debtline and Business Debtline have helped 135,000 people so far this year. They have trained more than 90 per cent. of the country's free-to-client debt advisers, including those funded by the Treasury's financial inclusion fund. The trust is training a further round of debt advisers, who will work not just for the trust, but for other parts of the sector. It will be training the advisers to deliver the Government's mortgage rescue system, and it looks forward to taking up that task as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/9">Since becoming president of the trust, I have held meetings with the Treasury, the Ministry of Justice, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to keep them abreast of developments, and they are all investing in one form or another in the trust and its services.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/10">Business Debtline is becoming a much valued asset and resource, and the trust hopes to be able to keep the House and the Government abreast of what the debt line finds. It is a unique national service, offering free, confidential and independent advice by telephone on how to deal to with debt or the cash-flow problems that trading businesses encounter, and which lead to financial difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/11">Business Debtline was the first crisis intervention hotline for small businesses created in western Europe. The positive impact that it is having is such that the European Commission and other partners have asked it to assist in the launch of three similar pilots in France, Spain and the Netherlands. The problem of small business indebtedness is not peculiar to this country; it affects small businesses across the globe.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/12">This current credit crunch takes vulnerable businesses to the brink. It adds to our burden and problems with the market, cash flow and relationships with suppliers, in getting back from them the income that they owe. That all adds up to a difficult situation for small businesses, as has been reflected time and again in calls to Business Debtline.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/13">About 15,000 small businesses based in the UK will have contacted Business Debtline by the end of the quarter. The Business Debtline website was launched a year ago and is receiving 100,000 hits per month. It is designed to give practical help and advice to small businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/14">From my point of view, there is no point in my representing the Money Advice Trust and not letting hon. Members know just how much effective intervention is needed at an early stage, and how many businesses require such help. The Government are already using that type of information, which has been reflected in ministerial financial statements, in the Secretary of State's statement yesterday and by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury in the House this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/15">During September, Business Debtline received more than 5,500 calls from businesses seeking help and advice. As I said, that is an increase of 60 per cent., compared with an increase of 30 per cent. in calls to the debt line for consumer customers, who are not business owners. The pressures on the business community, particularly the small and micro-business community, are intense at this time. It is important that the free advice that is provided allows businesses to survive and to utilise the other services being made available to them, whether through the Government or other agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/16">I met with Which? on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-14">14 October</phrase> on behalf of the Money Advice Trust, and during that meeting explained the newly established National Economic Council, which is a welcome initiative by the Government. I wrote to the Chancellor on behalf of the trust to indicate the importance of working with the trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/17">However, one aspect of the council needs strengthening at some stage, and that is that it does not have any direct consumer representation. Which? has now put that in the public domain, and I welcome its support, but it was the trust that wrote to the Chancellor first, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-14">14 October</phrase>, and asked him to consider establishing at least one place on the council for an independent consumer representative. For that, I do not mean a politician such as me. There are many skilled, knowledgeable people whose job it is to represent consumer interests, and they could play an effective part.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/18">The whole point of the council is to deal with the practical nuts and bolts of how this country takes on the challenges, one of which must be to ensure that the problems faced by individual consumers and small businesses are reflected through the council. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to ask the Chancellor to look at that request sympathetically.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/19">I also wrote to the Chancellor to tell him that on Monday I will be bringing together all the partners that provide money advice across the United Kingdom: citizens advice bureaux, AdviceUK, the Consumer Credit Counselling Service, the Institute of Money Advisers, Citizens Advice Scotland, Citizens Advice Northern Ireland, Money Advice Scotland and Advice Northern Ireland. We will discuss how we can respond more effectively to the current crisis, the demand for advice services, our current capacity and what capacity we forecast will be required next year. We need to co-ordinate across the whole sector and work not just as individual groups but collectively to maximise the service to the benefit of consumers who are in debt or may get into debt if they do not get proper free advice. We are looking for better ways to work together and to improve access to the capacity that we already have.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/20">We are looking at how the recent steps that the Government have taken in the banking system will affect funding for the free advice sector. Much of our work is done with the banking sector, and of course changes to the structure of the banking system have already taken place. We are looking at how the changes will impact on the job that we do for the Government in terms of the resources that they provide and what more we can do to assist. We are looking at how we can help the Government to help consumers with actual or potential debt problems. I shall write to the Minister following the meeting on Monday, and I hope that we can discuss as soon as possible the outcomes of the meeting, because the whole purpose of the groups, in helping the consumer, is to help the Minister to understand the issues that consumers face and what we can do as a sector to assist consumers and secure support for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/21">One thing that is always forgotten when people get into debt is the fact that the vast majority of them did not get into that situation because of wilful failure on their part. An overwhelming majority of people who get in debt want support and help to get out of debt. More than 80 per cent. of the people who are helped by our service repay their debt and go on to repair the damage done to their life and their family.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/22">The damage done by debt can be severe. Debt can cause severe problems to people's health, and to relationships in the family and in the workplace. Ultimately, for small businesses, it can lead to their demise and, with that, a demise of the financial structure that underpins the stability of the family, including the potential loss of other assets such as the home.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/23">Debt is not something that someone willingly takes on. It has a serious impact on individuals and families. The debt advice sector is important in helping the Government when people are in debt and in securing resources to do that. It also feeds back to the Government and to the House what is happening on the ground in a fast-moving situation. Even where there is total sympathy, as well as the structures in Government to assist and support people and the community, the fact is that it is only through the debt services that such problems are quickly discovered.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/24">It was through debt counselling, for example, that we became aware of and advised the Government about problems in the court system. Too many people were being automatically put up for repossession when other measures could have been followed first. That information came through the phone lines of the Money Advice Trust and others who give advice. Therefore, the debt advice sector is critical to helping to find solutions to problems that are arising.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/25">I offer the Minister and her colleagues in the Treasury an opportunity after next Monday to get feedback, and I hope that out of that feedback we will be able to provide an even more effective advice service on behalf of her and her colleagues, and co-ordinate effort across the whole sector&mdash;not just the Money Advice Trust, but all the other organisations that I named. All of them, in one part or another, receive resources from the public and the private sector, and it is our job to ensure that we provide support services not just to those who are in debt, but to the Government, who want to provide the best possible services to prevent people from getting into debt, or, if they are in debt, to help them to get out of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/26">I again thank the hon. Member for Solihull for this opportunity. I hope that the information that I have provided to Members has been of interest. I would be happy to make arrangements for any Member who wished to do so over the coming months to visit our services in Birmingham. On the ground, meeting the staff, Members would get a better understanding of the services that we provide, the quality of the advice that the staff give and the knowledge, sympathy and empathy that they bring to the discussion. We are the first point of contact for many people. Their whole life is crumbling before them, and what they need is someone who has not just knowledge but sympathy and empathy to take them through reconstructing their life and to help them through the business of getting rid of their debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/27">I have a final point to make about the banking system and our discussions on reforming it. When I was a Minister, we established services in places such as Birmingham&mdash;they have now been rolled out across the country&mdash;to prevent people from getting into the hands of illegal money lenders. In the evidence about how illegal money lenders operate, it came out that, in the first instance, banks had removed themselves from giving quality, legitimate, transparent assistance to communities, small businesses and citizens, particularly in poor, inner-city and urban areas. When the banking system withdrew its services, it opened up opportunities for illegal banking services and all the social and criminal problems that come in their wake.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/28">Therefore, when we consider the future of the banking system, we must ensure that the institutions that come out of the rescue package go back into and invest in those communities and, alongside the voluntary sector, offer banking services to ensure that people are not forced into the hands of illegal money lenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/29">It is nonsensical that in large parts of the United Kingdom in the past 20 years or so banks have consistently withdrawn their services to communities and that, as a consequence, millions of pounds of legitimate business has been forced through the hands of illegal money lenders rather than through the legitimate facilities of banks and building societies. There is an obligation on the industry to work with the Government, who are putting in huge resources to rid the country of the scourge of illegal money lenders. We can put them in jail, but others will come in if legitimate banking services are not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/30">The lesson that we should all learn is that the only way to keep illegal money lending out of the system and stop people getting into debt to money lenders is to reintroduce legitimate lending services through the banks, building societies and other institutions. The Government have done a great deal of work on that, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take it forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1823" name="Lorely Burt">the Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt)</phrase> on having secured this debate at this time. She has clearly caught the mood of the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/2">Before I respond to her remarks, may I briefly congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" name="Ian McCartney">the right hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase> on his contribution? It was not so much about small business&mdash;more about individual people&mdash;but it was important. I recall that when the Minister and I sat on the Treasury Committee together, we looked in some detail at the matter that he discussed. There was a great deal in what he said, and I am sure that the Minister will be sympathetic to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/3">One point that I would make briefly is about the importance of credit unions. I happened to have the opportunity late last week to be in a pleasant part of Scotland called Glenrothes. I visited the credit union there and was impressed by the work that that small credit union in the kingdom of Fife was doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/4">My hon. Friend has clearly caught the moment. We are at the point where what was, a year ago, a credit crunch that appeared to be almost entirely confined to the City has now well and truly spread out into the high street. Small businesses are vital for commerce. They are major employers and, when taken together, they form the majority of the local economy, particularly in many rural areas such as the one that I represent. Those employers are exactly who hon. Members would expect: hoteliers, restaurateurs, shopkeepers and small farmers, who run important businesses. Interestingly, they are also often small start-up companies in the knowledge economy, which are being nursed through and are growing. All these companies find themselves suddenly vulnerable. For all of them the problem is the same: cash flow. We are back to that moment when cash is king.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/5">I was running a business in the last recession and was responsible for one in the recession before that. I know precisely what owners and managers are thinking at the moment; they are worrying about where the money is coming from to meet the payroll. That is everybody's worry. Next after that they are worrying about how on earth they will deal with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs on tax and VAT. They are trying to squeeze their debtors to pay quickly and stretching their creditors as much as they can, they are cancelling orders where they can and are not going ahead with capital expenditure. On top of all that, the real worry is whether they can hold on to their banking facility and whether their bank will stand by them through this situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/6">We heard evidence earlier&mdash;we heard evidence in the debate in the main Chamber yesterday and during the statement this afternoon&mdash;of banks removing facilities. One problem is that overdraft facilities may be agreed for a year, but the fine print says that those are repayable on demand. Another problem is that, suddenly, as my hon. Friend mentioned, interest rates are going from around 2 per cent. to 2.5 per cent. up to 5 per cent. and 7 per cent.&mdash;and I have heard that they are going higher&mdash;and facility fees, which used to be &pound;100, are suddenly &pound;500 or &pound;1,000 or whatever it may be. It is vital that we get to grips with that problem with the banking sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/7">Since the Conservative spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1582" name="Mark Hoban">the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban)</phrase>, raised the point, I should say there is nothing either particularly good or bad about debt. What is bad is badly constructed debt&mdash;the toxic debt that I mentioned in my intervention&mdash;and irresponsible lending to people who, frankly, should never have had the money in the first place. I am thinking particularly about young people who have been encouraged to take credit cards at exorbitant rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/8">I was told a story six or eight months ago about a young lady who had amassed twice as much debt on credit cards as her annual salary. That is unacceptable. I would like to see such levels of debt reduced. I would not want to get back to such a level of irresponsible lending. Banks lending to companies that are solvent but need liquidity and the Government borrowing to advance projects to stimulate the economy are both examples of acceptable debt. We should encourage that, provided that we do so appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/9">My hon. Friend set out the problems: one's facility being taken away quickly and the cost involved. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">the Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase> raised the problem of companies that have never had to acquire debt but find themselves with a working capital deficit and need to ask for some credit. At the moment, if people do not have a credit history they are unlikely to get a facility. The Government statement made this afternoon contained a fine sentiment, which was the promise that debt would be available at 2007 levels. In the statement that I received, &quot;availability&quot; was underlined. So it is the availability that is there.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/10">I am delighted that a Treasury Minister is responding to this debate, because there is a real opportunity tomorrow, when members of the Government and Treasury officials meet with the banks as part of their negotiations, to ask for a formal memorandum of understanding or protocol to deal with these issues in principle before we get into the terrible situation of Government officials having to arbitrate on individual loans, which would be unacceptable. I suggest, as my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull said, that under such a protocol banks would agree not to exercise their right to cancel facilities overnight, but would give a minimum of 28 days' notice. They would also agree to honour previously agreed facility fees and interest rates. The Government might like to consider asking the banks to allow businesses with term loans over five, seven or 10 years, for example, which are mostly made up of capital repayment with an interest slug on top, a holiday without penalty from the capital repayment, which would save them a lot of money, because it would be an interest-only loan and the capital sum could be added to the end of the term loan with interest on it.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way so early in his speech. I completely understand where he is coming from, particularly in the light of the collapse of some huge organisations. When a bank collapses, one realises the precariousness of businesses at both ends of the spectrum.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.1/2">My point, on behalf of small businesses, is that a larger business generally has a little more fat, but small businesses often live hand to mouth. Larger businesses can often absorb problems and cash flow difficulties, but they may be the end for small businesses if they are living hand to mouth, I am concerned for all businesses, but particularly small businesses.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.2/1">The hon. Lady makes a fair point, but such problems are not limited to small businesses, and businesses across a wide spectrum will suffer. In my constituency, a private business with more than 50 employees is classified as big. Fareham has a huge number of small businesses, and I know that they are going through some of those problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" name="Ian McCartney">The right hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase> mentioned Joanna Elson, and I am seeing her next week to discuss the Money Advice Trust's work. I welcome the fact that it has moved into providing advice to businesses. He and I, and other hon. Members have come across constituents who receive tremendous advice from the Money Advice Trust, citizens advice bureaux, and consumer credit counselling services. Their advice is often not to take on more debt, and how to manage finance better. That constructive advice is needed by small and medium-sized businesses and is a practical way in which to help them through the crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/3">I am aware that small businesses are facing high arrangement fees, that overdraft rates are rising from 10 per cent. to 15 per cent., and that facilities are being reduced and withdrawn, often at short notice. That is happening because of the credit crunch, because banks are hoarding their capital and rationing lending. Consumers have faced that problem during the past year, and more and more businesses are now facing it. Different banks act in different ways, depending on their strength. Some will be able to continue to lend, and I have heard examples of small businesses being refused facilities at one bank, and being granted them at better rates by another. There is an onus on businesses to shop around, but we see the impact of the credit crunch on the wider economy. In his speech in Leeds last night, the Governor of the Bank of England was very clear about that when he said that we are heading towards recession.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/4">It is important that the Government consider ways to help small businesses and to ease their cash flow problems. We welcome the Government's measure to speed up payment to suppliers, and the NHS and other Government bodies are also being asked to do so. We have argued that companies should be allowed to defer their VAT bills. They would pay interest on that, but interest at 7.5 per cent. is a lot better than interest on an overdraft of 15 per cent. That would help.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.6/1">I knew in my bones that it was a bad idea to take an intervention from the right hon. Gentleman, whose remarks had been non-partisan, but he is now interested in roubles. I am sure that Lord Mandelson will be equally familiar with the cost of policies in roubles.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.6/2">Another way in which to help small businesses is to reduce employers' national insurance contributions by 1 per cent. for six months, which could be financed by the abolition of allowances elsewhere. Such measures would help to ease cash flow problems for small businesses, and that is what we want to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.6/3">We have made other proposals to help small businesses. We know that some will need time to find refinancing. Their bank may have withdrawn a facility, but they may want to shop around, which is why we proposed some reforms to insolvency law to give a short breathing space to businesses, before they are put into administration, to help them to find that facility, and to provide greater protection for creditors who provide them with finance during that interim period. We do not want businesses to disappear or jobs to be lost unnecessarily, and it is important to provide a reasonable breathing space for businesses to find alternative facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.6/4">We must also consider the macro-picture. One challenge in the development of the crisis is that some of the rules governing the amounts that banks lend have encouraged excessive lending in the good times, and a contraction of facilities in the bad times. The Basel 2 arrangements reinforce either end of the business cycle, and we want those arrangements to be reformed to make the availability of finance much more stable. We are pleased that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> agrees with us in that policy. It is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.6/5">At home, we must give the Bank of England greater power to monitor the debt level in the economy, and to ensure that the FSA takes action to tackle excessive lending. Although debt makes an important contribution to business growth, too much debt in the economy creates a bubble that hurts families and businesses when it bursts. We need to get it right. The Governor of the Bank of England has previously talked about a goldilocks economy&mdash;not too hot and not too cold. I suspect that in recent years, we have had an economy that is too hot and we are now paying the price for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.6/6">I shall turn to the package that the Government announced to refinance three of Britain's leading banks: Royal Bank of Scotland, Halifax Bank of Scotland and Lloyds TSB. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-13">13 October</phrase>, the Chancellor said that the</p>
	<p pid="a.115.6/7" class="indent">&quot;availability of lending to homeowners and small business will be maintained at at least 2007 levels&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-10-13.540"><i>Official Report</i>, 13 October 2008; Vol. 480, c. 540</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.115.6/8">However yesterday, Eric Daniels, who is the chief executive of Lloyds TSB, said to his staff:</p>
	<p pid="a.115.6/9" class="indent">&quot;What we have given government is an assurance that we will make our products available in the SME markets...and mortgages, so we will have good availability and we will market just as hard as we did in 2007&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.6/10">There is a gap between the banks and the Government. The Government seem to be suggesting that lending will be at 2007 levels and the banks are saying that they will market at 2007 levels and make sure that there is good availability. Businesses will want some clarity about what commitment banks have given to the Government in return for the public finance they have received.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.6/11">I would also like the Minister to comment on the effect that the Government's package will have on the cost of capital to banks, because that will have an impact on the rates at which banks will lend to homeowners and businesses. The preference shares that the Government have proposed are priced at 12 per cent., compared with 5 per cent. in the US. An extra 7 per cent. will therefore be paid by way of dividends, which will force up the cost of capital. The guarantees are about 50 basis points above the average for a bank's credit default swaps. That, again, could increase the cost of capital and will flow through to small businesses. Has the Minister looked at the impact that might have on the cost of borrowing for small businesses?</p>

	<p pid="a.117.0/1">It is a great pleasure to respond to this extremely timely debate. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1823" name="Lorely Burt">the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt)</phrase> on her timing and on her success in the ballot. Her observations have given us some things to think about, and she gave prescient examples of what has been going on in her constituency. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" name="Ian McCartney">the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase> also did that in his contribution. Those consequences have been brought home to many right hon. and hon. Members from all parties, which is why this subject has taken centre stage this week. We are all being made aware of how behaviour has changed and the effect that that is having on our small business sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/2">Obviously, support for small business is a crucial subject at the best of times, but it is even more important during what we recognise to be much more challenging times. Like the hon. Lady, I recognise the vital role that small and medium-sized enterprises play in our economy. There are 4.7 million small businesses, which provide 13.5 million jobs. That is, I think, an increase of nearly 1 million in number since 1997 and 1.5 million more jobs since 1997. Those businesses contribute as much as large businesses to UK output and turnover.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/3">Obviously, this tough economic climate creates challenges for us all. The effects of the global economic crisis have filtered down from major financial institutions to families across the country and to the country's 4.7 million small and medium-sized enterprises, as we have heard. I recognise that some of the commercial sectors worst affected by the financial crisis are those dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises&mdash;for example, the construction industry. Some 60 per cent. of employment in that sector is in micro-businesses, which is double the national average.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/4">I am proud of the Government's track record in supporting small and medium- sized enterprises and we are determined to help businesses affected by the global economic difficulties by doing what we can to support those who need it most. Although the origins of the crisis are global, the response has included firm action in the UK that has, obviously, been taken by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and the Chancellor. Action has also involved working to restore stability, which has included working with our counterparts around the world to achieve the same end. As hon. Members will know, one part of the Government's recent initiatives to support the UK financial system will use public money to buy shares in UK banks to improve their capital positions&mdash;the recapitalisation programme. So far, HBOS, Lloyds TSB and the Royal Bank of Scotland have signed up to a combined Government investment of &pound;37 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/5">As has been said, banks participating in that scheme have made an explicit commitment as part of their agreement with the Government that, during the next three years, they will maintain the availability and active marketing of competitively priced lending to small businesses at 2007 levels.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.1/1">I thank my right hon. Friend for those observations. He is right, but energy costs for businesses can be improved the more energy efficient they are. There is a great deal of leeway for businesses to improve their energy efficiency and there are quite short payback times&mdash;but that clearly needs investment, which brings us back to the beginning. Many things can be done, and the Government are considering them. I promise to pass my right hon. Friend's observations to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State of the new Ministry.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1582" name="Mark Hoban">The hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban)</phrase> observed that there have been no debates on small business, and then, just like the buses, three come at once. I suspect that we have many debates on small business, but it is right that hon. Members had the chance, today and yesterday, to reflect on the real worries that people have. I welcome the opportunity to respond to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/3">I was astonished to discover that the hon. Gentleman could not enlighten us on the cost of the eye-catching Opposition suggestion that VAT payments should be deferred for six months for small and medium-sized enterprises. It is hard to work out what the cost would be. Last year, &pound;80 billion was paid in VAT, and 50 per cent. of business activity can be attributed to SMEs. A six-month holiday could cause the Government cash-flow problems worth billions of pounds, and it could cause some practical problems too. Likewise, I was puzzled that the Conservative party website did not have those costings proudly displayed for all to see. The figures have obviously slipped out of the hon. Gentleman's brief.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/4">It is by no means clear that VAT holidays would apply only to small businesses, and if we had to give them to all businesses, it would put everyone six months in arrears in their VAT payments. Once that period came to an end, how would companies deal with the cash-flow problems that suddenly hit them? There seemed to be some hint about interest payments, but that too could represent a large cost. The Government may have to borrow more&mdash;we have been criticised for borrowing by the Conservative party&mdash;to make up the cash flow for the six months while no VAT was coming in.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/5">The Opposition have not properly explored a range of issues, which makes me think that that was a PR suggestion rather than a properly worked out policy. I wait with interest to what the costings are. My right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield suggested that the Opposition could circulate a letter outlining the cost. I would certainly be interested to see the contents of such a letter, but I shall not hold my breath.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/6">Again, I congratulate the hon. Member for Solihull on securing this timely debate. I hope that she agrees that it has been interesting, focused and worth while. We have focused on the practicalities of how to assist small businesses to get through in the best possible way.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.1/1">I am most grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter in Westminster Hall. I shall begin gently to allow the Minister to take his place.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/2">This has become an extremely important issue in my constituency, which is small, rather overcrowded and close to London. We are protective of our green belt and of the ancient woodlands in Epping Forest, which are important socially and environmentally. I am glad that the Minister has now found his seat.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/3">Let me explain. There have always been Gypsies and Travellers temporarily accommodated in and around Epping Forest&mdash;that is part of life and no one objects to it. Sometimes, they have stopped for a while before passing on peacefully to their next place of residence, and sometimes, especially in recent years, some have unfortunately caused trouble by leaving an enormous mess behind. Many hon. Members will be familiar with such a situation in their own parts of the country. Once the Gypsies and Travellers have moved on, they sometimes cause health and safety problems and leave taxpayers an enormous financial cost for clearing up the mess that they have left behind. However, that is an occasional problem that every local authority and every community has to deal with at times. It is not the problem that I wish to address today.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/4">The problem that I want to discuss is entirely of the Government's making&mdash;that is the main point of my debate. With regard to this problem, which is entirely avoidable, I have received countless letters, e-mails and phone calls, and I have held numerous meetings and been visited today at the House of Commons by some of my constituents. The Government are riding roughshod over local democracy and opinion. They are not only insisting, but directing in law, that Epping Forest district council provide 96 additional pitches for Gypsies and Travellers over the next few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/5">I appreciate that there must be somewhere for Gypsies and Travellers to go to, but I completely disagree and take issue with the Minister who said in Westminster Hall on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-22">22 May 2008</phrase> that this is</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/6" class="indent">&quot;a relatively solvable problem of providing 4,000 additional pitches, spread throughout the length and breadth of this country, covering about 1 square mile&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2008-05-22.171"><i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 22 May 2008; Vol. 476, c. 171WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/7">He continued, &quot;We can sort this.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/8">Let me tell the Minister that 1 square mile in one part of the country is not the same as in another. Our little corner of Essex in Epping Forest sits on the London border and is dependent on the green belt, the surrounding countryside and the ancient forest. A little bit of land is very precious. I mean that it is precious not in terms of its monetary value, but rather in how it is used for our environment and communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/9">In terms of the whole country, 1 square mile might not seem much. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1966" name="John Thurso">The hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)</phrase>, who was sitting in front of me a moment ago, represents part of Caithness where there are hundreds of square miles with nothing in them. That is not the case in Epping Forest, where 96 pitches would take up a large amount of space.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/10">The issue is not only about the amount of space taken up; it is about precisely where that space might be. I do not understand how the Minister can justify the Government's plans to create 388 new pitches throughout Essex over the next two years. Perhaps he can defend those pitches for Gypsies and Travellers throughout Essex, but I do not see why the Government are saying that we need so many.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/11">To make matters worse, the strict criteria that the Government have laid down for finding what are described as &quot;suitable pitches&quot; make it difficult in an area such as Epping Forest to find such a pitch. My constituents are rightly concerned about the effect that the development of those 96 pitches would have on our local communities, landscape and the green belt. The effect on individual people who live next to the pitches would be almost indescribable.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/12">Can any of us imagine part of our own garden, or a small field adjacent to our house, being compulsorily purchased and used for Gypsies and Travellers, when for centuries it had been used only by horses or sheep? That would cause indescribable anguish among my constituents and I have every sympathy with them. More than anything, they are rightly indignant about how local democracy is being utterly ignored and disregarded. Local people are not properly consulted, and decisions are forced on our communities by regional and national bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/13">Epping Forest district council is a well-run local authority, regardless of political control. It is under Conservative control, but that has not been the case for most of the last 15 or 20 years. During that time, it has been a responsible, well-run district council that takes its duties seriously. This is not about party politics; it is about protecting our local community and planning for the best use of our scarce land resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/14">Because of the way that the Government behave, Epping Forest district council, which is taking the blame for producing a development document on where the 96 pitches might go, simply had no choice in the matter. I find that difficult to explain. There is no democracy and no choice. Epping Forest district council has been directed by the Government office for the east of England to amend the local development scheme. I quote from a letter from that Government office dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-17">17 September 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/15" class="indent">&quot;In exercise of the powers conferred on her by section 15(4) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act, the Secretary of State for Communities and local government directs that your council make the following amendments to the local development scheme...and to specify that (a) it includes a Gypsy and Traveller site Development Plan Document&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/16">Of course, Epping Forest district council behaves responsibly, and once directed by the Government office for the east of England to produce such a document and local development scheme, it went ahead and did so. However, that was not done urgently enough for the Government's liking, and the workings of responsible local democracy have been cast aside and utterly ignored by this over-powerful, dictatorial Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/17">Epping Forest district council having done as it was told by the Government office for the east of England, we found that the Minister&mdash;I am delighted that he is here&mdash;had written to the council on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-23">23 April 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/18" class="indent">&quot;I consider it crucial for the Council to make demonstrable progress with this important document in a clear and urgent manner in accordance with the terms of the Direction in order we can get to a position, sooner rather than later, where Gypsies and Travellers will have appropriate authorised provision of sites&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/19">The responsible, properly-acting and democratically elected Epping Forest district council has gone ahead to try to solve the problem of finding places for the Gypsies and Travellers, but it is not allowed to do so in a reasonable and considered way, because the Minister says, &quot;You can't take time or look at the criteria and try to find places. You must do it now.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/20">The council has entered into a consultation to produce a development plan document. Consultation is the right way to take the local community along when an exercise of this kind has to be undertaken, but it is meaningless if it is directed by the Government. We now find that edicts are dictated by that unelected, totally undemocratic and unaccountable body, the East of England regional assembly.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/21">All that, because of how it has been undertaken at the Government's command, is leading to the compulsory purchase of privately-owned land. I am not exaggerating when I say that the proposed compulsory purchase of those pieces of land for this purpose smacks of the worst excesses of communist dictatorship. My constituents and I, as well as Epping Forest district council, which I totally, support see it that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/22">My constituents have written to me about an enormous variety of problems that result for them both personally and as members of our local community from the Government's overbearing and dictatorial attitude. Compulsory purchase simply is not fair. I have received some heartbreaking letters from people who have spent a lifetime building up the resources to buy a house. That house and the little bit of land beside it are all they have for their retirement. If the land beside the house is compulsorily purchased, and if Gypsies and Travellers are put on it by the Government, those people will lose everything that they have worked all their lives for. I have every sympathy with them, and the Minister is wrong to ignore them. I am talking not about one family or one person, but an enormous problem, if 96 pitches are to be found in my small constituency and throughout the Epping Forest area.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/23">The impact on our precious green belt, conservation areas and sites of special scientific interest would be enormous, and ancient woodland and indigenous wildlife would be badly affected. When we then consider the increase in traffic flows on unsuitable roads, road safety, listed buildings and their surroundings, the impact on local facilities&mdash;particularly the lack of provision in primary schools, GP surgeries, utilities and other transport matters&mdash;we realise that local infrastructure is unable to sustain the enforced increase in our local population in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/24">Added to that, there is the problem of building on flood plains. We have a lot of flooding problems in Epping Forest, which was not taken into consideration in the Government's criteria and how they issued their orders.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/25">Most of all, I am concerned about how the planning laws will be distorted. Local people feel that there is one planning law for them and another for Gypsies and Travellers. People who want to build a small extension to their houses in the Epping Forest area have to go through an enormous number of hoops in the planning procedure&mdash;quite rightly.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.3/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Amess. Perhaps I should say your over-powerful and forceful chairmanship, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1574" name="Eleanor Laing">the hon.

	<p pid="a.128.3/2">I also congratulate the hon. Lady on securing the debate and the manner in which she advanced the case on behalf of some of her constituents. Again, I thought that her arguments were extremely forceful and somewhat over-powerful.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1396" name="Patrick Hall">the Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall)</phrase>, whom I visited earlier this year to talk about the provision of Gypsy and Traveller accommodation in his borough.

	<p pid="a.128.3/4">If I may, Mr. Amess, I would like to be incredibly unprofessional and wish my son, William, a very happy fourth birthday. I am grateful to the Chamber for allowing me to make such comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.3/5">In many respects, the debate is extremely timely. The hon. Member for Epping Forest will be aware of the examination in public of planning for Gypsy and Traveller accommodation in the east of England. She may be aware that the EiP started yesterday in Letchworth and will run until Friday. Using the results of that public consultation, the panel will provide recommendations on any changes to the proposals. The Government will consult on further changes before publishing the final policy in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.3/6">I do not want to say a lot about the details of that examination because I am limited in what I can say on the ground of matters being quasi judicial. All I will say is that all interested parties will have the opportunity this week to debate the number of pitches that have to be provided. The process does not mean that provision should necessarily await the outcome of the EiP. Until the regional spatial strategy review is adopted, local authorities should continue to base provision on the latest available information on need within the region and local area in the context of the urgent need for improved provision across the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.3/7">The hon. Lady specifically mentioned green belt and I want to address that directly in the time that I have. I want to be as clear as I possibly can be on this extremely important matter. It is right and proper that we support, maintain and enhance the green belt as much as possible. She will agree that it is very much valued and an extremely efficient planning tool to prevent urban sprawl.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.3/8">Circular 01/06 makes it clear that Gypsy and Traveller sites are inappropriate in the green belt. Therefore, it is the responsibility of local authorities to manage land provision to meet housing needs, and in an area such as Epping Forest, that principally means managing the supply of land within the urban areas available for redevelopment or with potential for alternative uses.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.3/9">We may quibble about the figures. The hon. Lady mentioned 96 additional pitches. My understanding was that the district's proposed Gypsy and Traveller pitch target was 49 to 2011, and potentially 92 to 2021. I must forcefully argue that that is a tiny proportion&mdash;just 4 per cent. of the RSS target of at least 2,290 additional dwellings needed in the region between 2006 and 2021.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.3/10">The hon. Lady spoke very powerfully about the communist nature of this Government. She said that we are over-powerful and dictatorial. I disagree vehemently. The whole point of the process is that local authorities step up to the plate to ensure that they have the evidence in place in relation to accommodation&mdash;I mean not just Gypsy and Traveller accommodation, but additional housing for the wider need, as and when it is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.3/11">In preparing for the debate, I was struck by some of the comments made by Councillor Anne Grigg, who is planning and economic development portfolio holder. In what I consider the quote of the debate, she said:</p>
	<p pid="a.128.3/12" class="indent">&quot;Mistrust and misunderstanding between the travelling and settled communities can lead to friction. This process, which includes comprehensive public consultation, should help to identify a balanced solution. Hopefully if our District plans for good sites, we will run less risk of unauthorised encampments and problems these create.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.128.3/13">Councillor Grigg is a Conservative. I do not want to make a narrow political point here; on the contrary, I am pleased to see those comments and an example of mature local leadership on an issue that can raise huge tensions. However, it appears that there is strong leadership on the matter within the local authority, which is a welcome and positive step change in attitude from what there has been in recent months.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.1/1">I am not suggesting that there should be no penalty for a failure to complete a return on time. The Tax Credit Act 2002 provides for the ability to fine or impose penalties for late returns. Indeed, under income tax legislation, late returns result in a penalty&mdash;&pound;100 or &pound;200, I think&mdash;which is absolutely right. However, late income tax returns, for example, do not result in the draconian measures such as those arising from late tax credits forms. Late income tax returns do not deny the opportunity for a tax rebate, which stills follows when the application is submitted, however late&mdash;up to six years, I believe, which is very generous. Those applications are dealt with according to the facts and on merit.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/2">I can think of no other part of the tax system that imposes penalties as draconian as the loss of one's entire benefit, as does the tax credit system. Given its purpose, the ombudsman is quite right when she said that to deny reinstatement causes</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/3" class="indent">&quot;far too harsh a penalty for the delay, works entirely against the policy objectives of the scheme and unnecessarily causes customers avoidable distress and hardship&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/4">I would like the whole system to be simplified and, indeed&mdash;this perhaps is not quite possible&mdash;credits to be paid retrospectively. The number of families who do not make a claim through fear of overpayments is becoming more and more significant and certainly does not aid our common cause of reducing child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/5">My proposal is simple: where a tax credit claim is terminated following a failure to finalise an award, there should be an independent appeals system whereby, if the claimant can prove their entitlement for that year at a later date, that which constitutes a genuine overpayment should be recovered, although perhaps with some penalty akin to the income tax arrangements. I am not suggesting that there should not be a penalty, but that the current one is disproportionate. We expect more of sometimes vulnerable families than of any other group in the tax system. We do not exercise that sort of draconian power against income or company tax payers or against those who fail to make their VAT returns on time. It is wholly disproportionate, and I want the Government to deal with it now. They have had long enough. There is no excuse or moral or legal reason it should not happen immediately.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-22a.135.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1563" speakername="Stephen Timms" colnum="135"  time="016:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081022/halltext/81022h0011.htm#08102245000652">
	<p pid="a.135.0/1">I agree with my hon. Friend on the popularity of winter fuel payments, although tax credits are pretty popular too: take-up is very high. I understand the concern that some may have about not applying for tax credits because of the worry about overpayments, but actually, in 2005-06, take-up of the child tax credit was 82 per cent., with more than 90 per cent. of the money available being claimed. Take-up among those with incomes of less than &pound;10,000 a year is now 96 per cent., up from 93 per cent. in the first year of tax credits. Those figures are encouraging and partly reflect the fact that the service has become considerably better since the initial problems, which undoubtedly there were&mdash;I readily acknowledge that there were serious problems in the early days, but there have been considerable improvements since. In many respects, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs is now providing a good service, although I entirely accept that there is room for further improvement. I am determined to ensure that we do improve it further, as I have made clear during my couple of weeks in my current role so far. We are certainly seeing fewer overpayments caused by IT or administrative error, and accuracy in processing and calculating awards has risen substantially. I very much hope that through the tax credits transformation programme, which started in 2006, we will see substantial further improvements still.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/2">My hon. Friend made a number of very important points about overpayments. End-year adjustments leading to an overpayment fell significantly in 2006-07 to &pound;1 billion, as a result of the successful implementation of a package of measures to improve tax credits administration announced at the 2005 pre-Budget report. They are now less than half the level of the first year of the system and constitute just 5 per cent. of gross spending on tax credits, which is better than we projected in the 2005 pre-Budget report when we anticipated that overpayments would fall by about a third&mdash;in fact the fall has been about 40 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/3">The number of families affected by overpayments is down significantly from 1.9 million to 1.3 million, and the average overpayment is down. But I agree that that is no grounds for complacency, so in May we published &quot;Tax Credits: improving delivery and choice&quot;, which was a discussion paper showing the Government's commitment to ensuring that the system is working for families. It explored proposals to improve choice and certainty for tax credits customers, as part of a strategy of encouraging customers to take more control of their tax credits awards. My hon. Friend argued for simplicity. One of the themes of the document, particularly on support for child care, was about how the system could be simplified while still meeting its objectives. We received very good input to that exercise from advice organisations, and this debate gives me the chance to put on the record my thanks to those organisations for the effort that they put into responding to that consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/4">HMRC's policy on recovering overpayments is set out in its code of practice 26&mdash;&quot;What happens if we have paid you too much tax credit?&quot;&mdash;which was significantly amended at the start of this year. Previously the policy was that an overpayment was written off if there was an official error and it was reasonable for the customer to believe that their award was correct. The reasonable belief test caused a good deal of concern particularly because people's perception of what is &quot;reasonable&quot; can vary widely. My hon. Friend has raised a number of issues about that since the introduction of the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/5">At the end of January, we replaced the belief test in code of practice 26 with a clearer test setting out the responsibilities of HMRC and customers to check factual information. In effect, that is a contract of responsibility. It builds on the existing practice of giving people responsibility for checking the factual information. HMRC plays back to them in the award notice information such as how many children they have and what their income is. People are expected to check that that information is correct and that the amount that goes into their bank account matches the award notice. There is no expectation that people will know the formula and I sympathise with the points that my hon. Friend made about that. As before, they will not be expected to check the calculation. However, if there is an official error and customers meet their responsibilities, the overpayment should be written off.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/6">The new code of practice goes further. HMRC now has a time limit of 30 days to process reported changes of circumstances. In addition, where HMRC makes an error any overpayment will be remitted if the customer reports the error within 30 days of receiving the award notice. HMRC will also remit all overpayments arising following a report from a customer of an error by HMRC. The changes will create a fairer balance of responsibilities between individuals and HMRC. I hope that that will allow us to make significant progress in bearing down on the scale of the problems caused by overpayments.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/7">The early-day motion put down by my hon. Friend aimed to question the way in which HMRC recovers overpayments when a customer has not renewed their application. I will give some background on this issue. Tax credits are claimed annually. The renewals process serves two purposes. First, it finalises the award for the previous year. Secondly, as he said, it acts as a claim for the current year. While the claim is being renewed, HMRC will pay provisional payments based on the previous year. In the absence of a claim, the award is ended and provisional payments become repayable.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/8">My hon. Friend believes that overpayments should not be recovered when the person has failed to make a claim in time but would have been eligible had they done so. There is a problem with that, which was the reason for my intervention. There are deadlines for good reasons and I do not think that anyone, including my hon. Friend, can say that those do not matter. The longer that families are on provisional payments the more likely they are to have their current award based on out-of-date information. We have shortened the deadline by two months. As a result, just after the end of July this year around 2 million fewer people were on provisional payments than three years ago. That has helped.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/9">HMRC must put out a strong message that deadlines are important and that people must get the information in on time. HMRC makes every effort to get people to renew on time, including an extensive campaign of radio and television advertising. As part of the tax credits transformation programme that I mentioned, HMRC has proactively contacted 85,000 of the most vulnerable customers either early on in the renewal process or if they had not renewed by the deadline. HMRC offered help by renewing awards immediately over the phone where possible or, if they had already been renewed, checking that the renewal had been processed to encourage timely renewal in the following year. As a result of that exercise, more than 10,000 claims were renewed immediately over the phone and more than 20,000 claimants agreed to call back on a special number. More than 20,000 claims had already been renewed by the time HMRC had spoken to the claimants. Those figures indicate that that was a worthwhile exercise in ensuring that people got the information in.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/10">If someone misses the end of July deadline, their payments will be stopped shortly afterwards. After that, HMRC allows customers 30 days to restore their award without any quibble. They can be allowed longer if they can demonstrate a good cause for their not renewing by the deadline. My hon. Friend asked how often that discretion has been exercised. Unfortunately I am not able to give that figure, although I understand the point that he has made. I can tell him that for this year's renewals round overall, HMRC has restored nearly 200,000 awards to date. I am not able to say how many of those were on the good cause basis, but nevertheless, a lot of rewards have been restored.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/11">It was interesting to hear the two examples that my hon. Friend referred to in his speech. I have not seen the details of those cases before. If he passes the details to me, it would be interesting to look at whether the good cause basis should have applied in either case. I would be happy to check that.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/12">If someone has not restored their award and they make a new claim, that can be made that can be backdated by up to three months. HMRC has no interest in forcing people into hardship. We want to strike the right balance between a payment plan that can be met without undue hardship and the recovery of overpayments. There are well established processes in place to do that, including for those whose awards have been terminated, using 12-month instalment plans with longer repayment periods where necessary. The code of practice on recovering overpayments makes it clear that exceptional circumstances will be taken into account.</p>
