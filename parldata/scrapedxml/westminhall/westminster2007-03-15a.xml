<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-15a.150.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" speakername="Roger Gale" colnum="150"  time="015:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070315/halltext/70315h0002.htm#07031549000360">
	<p pid="a.150.0/1">I am grateful to the Select Committee for having done a difficult job very well. I am delighted to see the Paymaster General in her seat&mdash;the correct seat&mdash;this afternoon. This time, she certainly does have responsibility for the matters before us, although by the time I have finished, she may wish that she did not. Much of the Treasury Committee report deals with the recovery of overpaid tax credits and what is risibly entitled &quot;Improving HMRC's service to claimants&quot;, and I should like to concentrate on those two issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/2">I am currently dealing with 28 cases involving claims for the repayment of tax credits. Although that is an improvement on the 46 cases with which I was dealing, there is still a long way to go. Of those 28 cases, seven are with the adjudicator and six, which have been rejected by the adjudicator&mdash;I shall return to that later&mdash;are with the ombudsman. Every one of those cases represents a demand for money from a family with children that is, by implication, on a low domestic income. In every case, that demand is for money that the family has spent and does not have, and it is causing misery. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">The hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> referred to families struggling to keep themselves afloat, and that is exactly what these people are doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/3">In almost all those cases&mdash;HMRC acknowledges this&mdash;my constituents have provided correct income details in a timely fashion. They therefore have a right to expect that HMRC has done its job properly and that the money that they received is theirs by right to dispose of as they see fit in the interests of their families. Instead, they are being penalised for the incompetence of a failing management and a failing system.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/4">I do not want to hear any more tales from the Paymaster General or any other Treasury Minister about the enormous success of the tax credit system or the millions who are receiving help. The 28 cases that I mentioned, and more than 300,000 others like them, involve real people suffering real distress as a result of the failure of the chairman of the Revenue and Customs and the civil servants working under him to manage the system properly and deliver an efficient service.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/5">Following a scathing report from the adjudicator, Dame Barbara Mills, the Prime Minister told me on the Floor of the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-22">22 June 2005</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/6" class="indent">&quot;we will not seek to get the money back if the error is on the part of the Inland Revenue.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-22">22 June 2005</phrase>; Vol. 435, c. 798.]</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/7">A week later, on <phrase class="date" code="">29 June</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" name="David Laws">the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase>, referring back to my question, pressed the case again. The Prime Minister told him:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/8" class="indent">&quot;my understanding is that the code of practice makes it clear that if the error is on the part of the Government rather than the recipient, there is not a recovery.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-29">29 June 2005</phrase>; Vol. 435, c. 1292.]</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/9">Would that it were so.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/10">The weasel words that HMRC now uses as a shield lie in the second half of the Prime Minister's answer to me. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/11" class="indent">&quot;In the interests of the general taxpayer...we obviously cannot say that overpayments resulting from a claimant's change of circumstances should stand.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-22">22 June 2005</phrase>; Vol. 435, c. 798-9.]</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/12">Those words have been interpreted to mean that even where a claimant has provided full and correct information in a timely fashion, as most have, but HMRC fails properly to process and take account of that information and to make the necessary adjustments, the overpaid money resulting from that failure will be recovered, notwithstanding the Prime Minister's very clear undertakings, which he gave on not one, but two occasions.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/13">The device&mdash;that is precisely what it is&mdash;that is used to justify the unjustifiable is HMRC code of practice 26. COP 26 is not a law, but a code of practice, which was introduced without parliamentary consultation or approval. It was introduced by Revenue and Customs to regulate its own business and nobody need answer for it&mdash;not even, as I shall demonstrate, to the adjudicator or the ombudsman.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/14">COP 26 was concocted by the Treasury in October 2003 and was first published in December 2003. It was May 2004&mdash;a full eight months later&mdash;before even a flyer was produced for civil service public information. The full implication of COP 26 has been realised only since the Prime Minister's undertakings and the resulting welter of claims concerning Revenue errors that were upheld. That cost the Treasury a lot of money.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/15">In her report &quot;Tax Credits: Putting Things Right&quot;, the parliamentary ombudsman said:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/16" class="indent">&quot;There are two main problems with the current system of recovery of both types of overpayment. The first is that it is instigated without any prior consideration by the Revenue of whether or not the sum in question is recoverable in accordance with COP 26. The second&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/17">which hon. Members may consider still more important&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/18" class="indent">&quot;is that, in the case of recovery of excess payments in-year, it is done automatically without regard to customers' financial circumstances and whether they can afford the recovery rate imposed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/19">The conclusion of a stinging catalogue of criticism was the ombudsman's comment:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/20" class="indent">&quot;I recommend that consideration is given to the adoption of a statutory test for recovery of excess payments and overpayments of tax credits, consistent with the test that is currently applied to social security benefits, with a right of appeal to an independent tribunal&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/21">That is precisely what the hon. Member for Leeds, East was driving towards.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/22">However, it was not done. The Chancellor of the Exchequer&mdash;the only Prime Minister in history to have failed even before taking on the job&mdash;who was responsible for the introduction and administration of tax credits, has chosen to ignore the parliamentary ombudsman. There is no right of appeal to an independent tribunal, no statutory test and no compatibility with the social benefits system. I do not want to reduce the Paymaster General to tears, but she heard that from me a couple of weeks ago. Indeed, in giving evidence to the Select Committee the deputy chairman of Revenue and Customs, who is apparently in denial, asserted:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/23" class="indent">&quot;There is not a statutory right of appeal in relation to overpayments generated by official error&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/24">He has clearly not read section 12 of the Social Security Act 1998 which states:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/25" class="indent">&quot;Where the Secretary of State has determined that any amount is recoverable any person from whom he has determined that it is recoverable shall have the right of appeal to an appeal tribunal&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/26">We shall, no doubt, be told that claimants have a right of appeal to the adjudicator, to the ombudsman and ultimately to judicial review. The latter is, of course, for the families that we are discussing, simply not a realistic or practical proposition. The adjudicator and the ombudsman have, I regret to say, been disgracefully compromised to the point where their findings no longer bear relevance to reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/27">Instead of revising its systems to reflect natural justice and the spirit of the undertakings given by the Prime Minister, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs has chosen to re-interpret its own creation, COP 26, to which the hon. Member for Leeds, East also referred. Its key words are:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/28" class="indent">&quot;For us to write off an overpayment you must be able to show that an overpayment happened because:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/29" class="indent">we made a mistake, and</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/30" class="indent">it was reasonable for you to think your payments were right.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/31">A reasonable person might think that it was reasonable for a claimant who had provided the correct information at the correct time to believe that, given the battery of information technology and the veritable army of civil servants available to the Treasury, the calculations made by Revenue and Customs and, therefore, the payments based on those calculations, should be right. However, that is not the way that the Chancellor, the Paymaster General or the chairman of HMRC think. They have chosen to interpret COP 26 as saying, &quot;We were wrong but you should have known we were wrong, so we are right and you are wrong and we demand our money back.&quot; They have taken it as far as saying, in effect&mdash;I shall not bore you with it, Mr. Marshall, but I have a relevant case before me&mdash;&quot;Our computer systems cannot handle your payment so we are going to make a manual payment; but our computer may make a duplicate payment, but we cannot tell you when that may happen, and if it does you will need to notice it and we will demand repayment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/32">This is the world of Alice in Wonderland, and it would be amusing if it were not so tragic and if it had not compromised, hopelessly, the positions of the adjudicator, Barbara Mills, and the ombudsman, Ann Abraham. Correspondence from both of them, responding to challenges to HMRC decisions, now supinely reflects the HMRC position on COP 26. Dame Barbara says, for instance:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/33" class="indent">&quot;When I consider complaints about the recovery of overpaid tax credits I do so in the light of Code of Practice 26&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/34">and she usually continues to uphold the view of HMRC, which is:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/35" class="indent">&quot;The conditions of COP 26 have not been met&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/36">In other words, the adjudicator bases her adjudication on the rules set down, interpreted and enforced by the body that is the subject of the complaint. When a matter is referred to the ombudsman, that august person says:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/37" class="indent">&quot;I do not see the Revenue's approach, as set out in COP 26, as being unreasonable&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/38">That is in spite of the &quot;Tax Credits: Putting Things Right&quot; report, which indicated that that approach was unreasonable and that there should be an appeal to an independent tribunal. The ombudsman and adjudicator appear for some reason to have allowed themselves to become the creatures of a self-created Revenue and Customs system that is unjust and is failing some of the most disadvantaged people in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/39">I want the Treasury to take certain immediate actions. The Paymaster General and I have discussed the matter and she has treated me most courteously at our meetings, but as the hon. Member for Leeds, East said, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase> would have demanded action, not trying&mdash;or even very trying. The Treasury must instruct HMRC to write off all overpayments to date except those arising directly and obviously from fraud&mdash;from the submission of deliberately false information&mdash;or from unacceptably late submission of the information needed to make calculations. The Treasury must accept the original recommendation of the parliamentary ombudsman and replace the office of adjudicator with an independent tribunal system comparable to that used to adjudicate social security benefits. The Treasury must accept the spirit of the undertakings given by the First Lord of the Treasury, the Prime Minister, renounce its future dependence on COP 26 and take full responsibility for future errors leading to overpayment. Finally, the Treasury should acknowledge that its chosen system has failed and abandon it in favour of either a flat-rate payment or a payment based on historical and actual rather than theoretical income.</p>
