<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-20a.188.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" speakername="Stephen Crabb" colnum="188"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070320/halltext/70320h0001.htm#07032048000478">
	<p pid="a.188.1/1">That is an extremely valuable point, and my hon. Friend speaks with considerable experience of the subject. Replacing school visits with a beefed-up online recruitment effort for young people will not seriously improve recruitment rates in the target group. I support as much interaction as possible between service personnel and schools. Last year, I spent half a day at a local secondary school, where a team from the MOD that specialises in citizenship education looked at a disaster scenario with a year group and involved teams of young people in designing hypothetical responses to an international disaster. The group operated extremely effectively in the school and, although it was not there specifically for recruitment purposes, it was, no doubt, an excellent advert for a career in the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/2">One area of recruitment where the Government have taken steps to improve performance, but where much more needs to be done, is the recruitment of soldiers of Muslim faith. Last November, I attended the memorial service held in St. Davids cathedral in my constituency for Corporal Peter Thorpe and Lance Corporal Jabron Hashmi, who were killed earlier in the year in an attack by Taliban fighters in Helmand, Afghanistan. Both men had been serving with the 3rd Para battle group, but were either part of or attached to the 14th Signal Regiment, to which I referred earlier. It was a privilege to meet members of their families and the Army imam who participated in the memorial service. One of Lance Corporal Hashmi's officers told me that they desperately need more men and women like him in the regiment, because of the value and commitment that he brought and the skill set that he possessed&mdash; specifically his expertise in Arabic. Having grown up in Pakistan, Lance Corporal Hashmi had a knowledge of the culture, religion and language of the region, which made him an extremely important and valued member of the team.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/3">A written answer to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> revealed that the number of Muslims recruited to the forces is statistically insignificant and, for each month last year, barely reached double digits. I would be interested to hear what further steps the Minister thinks that his Department can and should take to improve recruitment among such an increasingly important demographic group.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/4">On the problems and challenges of retention, if one of the challenges is improving the inflow of new recruits, the other side of the equation involves hanging on to good, experienced personnel who have benefited from expensive and extensive training and who occupy vital roles. Some degree of churn is welcome in any organisation, as it enables younger guys to come through, have a chance and make steady progress in their careers as well as fostering the spread of new skills and experiences within the organisation&mdash;we are perhaps learning some of that in the Conservative party. In certain sections of the armed forces, however, the rates of exit are too high and represent a net loss to the services. The Royal Marines other ranks exit rate is more than 7 per cent.; the average exit rate for Army general practitioners is 10 per cent.; and the figure for Army nurses is more than 8 per cent. Those figures are above the guidelines set by the Department and surely represent a challenge to ongoing efforts to hang on to valued and good personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/5">At the heart of the retention issue is the importance of making service personnel feel valued in their roles. For each individual and service family, a different mix of factors will make them feel valued in the career and lives that they have chosen. For many, the issue of accommodation is extremely important, and thanks to the comments of some senior officers it has recently received a lot of attention in the press. Clearly, accommodation issues present a major challenge that needs to be addressed. In its recent report, the Armed Forces Pay Review Body stated</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/6" class="indent">&quot;where personnel have access to new and upgraded accommodation they are generally positive&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/7">However, it also noted that</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/8" class="indent">&quot;personnel moving from such accommodation to that of a lower standard...can contribute to retention problems.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/9">The Armed Forces Pay Review Body reiterated its disappointment with the cuts made by the Department to accommodation budgets over successive years. Urgent action is required regarding the issue of accommodation. It is not enough for the Minister to simply refer to the amounts of money being pumped into service accommodation; he needs to demonstrate that he and his team genuinely understand the grievances expressed and are committed to seeing the problems addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/10">On accommodation, when I visited Cawdor barracks to meet the 14th Signal Regiment, personnel generally expressed satisfaction with the quality of their accommodation, but the issue of broadband access was raised again and again. Despite those men and women being experts in electronic warfare, they do not have broadband access&mdash;access to the internet&mdash;in their barracks, which would really improve their quality of life. I have previously corresponded with the Department about that issue and did not receive an entirely satisfactory response. I ask the Minister to look at that issue again and find some way of connecting up Cawdor barracks to broadband internet access, because it would make a significant improvement to the quality of life of many excellent soldiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/11">I have received numerous e-mails and letters from the spouses of some of the soldiers in my constituency about the quality of health care services locally. They have informed me that they enjoy the quality of life on offer in Pembrokeshire for service families, but are totally exasperated by the fact that they cannot access a dentist. As many hon. Members are aware, Pembrokeshire is a rural, peripheral area of the country where NHS dentistry has been all but decimated over recent years. Some service families moved from areas where there was good NHS dental provision only to find that the service barely exists in Pembrokeshire, which affects their outlook on the military lifestyle.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/12">For some servicemen and women, what counts is access to training and the opportunity to acquire and develop new skills and improve their education, which will help them to get ahead in their military careers or when they return to civilian life. What are we seeing currently in that area? Well, more than 60 training exercises were cancelled last year out of a planned total of 548 separate exercises, which means that one in nine training exercises were suspended as a result of general issues associated with overstretch in the armed forces. Those cancelled exercises and courses represent lost opportunities for service personnel to develop vital skills and, for some, it will shape their perception of life in the armed forces, again, in a negative way.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/13">Our armed forces have a superb track record in getting on with the job no matter what circumstances they face; they do not moan, whinge, or down their tools&mdash;there is no British Leyland tendency in the armed forces. More than anything, they want to be valued and properly resourced to do the job that they are asked to do. Recruiting and retaining high quality personnel in our armed forces is a serious and growing problem, and a significantly under-strength Army is being asked to operate over and above the level for which it was designed. That situation can only be maintained for so long before real pressures emerge that will cause lasting damage to the institution, and we are getting dangerously close to that point. I look forward to hearing the Minister explain how such problems can be effectively addressed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-20a.190.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" speakername="Tony Baldry" colnum="190"  time="009:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070320/halltext/70320h0001.htm#07032048000479">
	<p pid="a.190.0/1">I want to make four points. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" name="Stephen Crabb">the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb)</phrase> has made an excellent speech and I do not wish to repeat anything that he has said. However, as a starting point, I must state that it is true that the Ministry of Defence is having to recruit in a tight labour market. I joined the Territorial Army back in 1970&mdash;35-plus years ago. At that time, the armed forces were &quot;benefiting&quot; from structural unemployment around the country. Heavy industry was changing, coal mines in south Wales were closing, manufacturing industry in the west midlands was being lost, and men saw opportunities and better long-term careers in the armed forces. Today, even with the pay increase, a new recruit&mdash;a private, a gunner or a sapper&mdash;will earn not much more than &pound;11,000 a year, or just short of &pound;12,000. That is not a lot of money. The Minister looks at me quizzically, but I visited a Pioneer regiment in my patch the other day and was told that recruits earn about &pound;11,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/2">Out there in the labour market, one can earn more than that. In my constituency, where there is practically zero unemployment, one wonders what attracts people to the armed forces. Everyone must recognise that the MOD will be competing in an increasingly tight labour market.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/3">Following on from that, many of those whom one would recruit as private soldiers at 18 will have left school at 16. It seems to me that there are two years that go gash there. One hears commanding officers having to explain that many of those recruited need to work to improve their educational standards, and our armed forces are obviously becoming increasingly technical, so why do we not recruit at 17? I appreciate that recruits cannot fight at that age, but we used to have a good junior leader scheme from which half of those recruited became lance-corporals and corporals.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/4">Why does the MOD not recruit younger people, and use that first year on education and training, and getting guys up to standard, so that when they reach their 18th birthday they already have a head start? Otherwise the danger for the MOD is that those who might want to join the armed forces will have left school at 16, taken up other employment and become involved in other jobs and will be lost to the armed forces. That is particularly so if they have taken up employment that pays them as much as if not more than they are likely to earn in the Army.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/5">I know of a good place where the Army could set up a new education school, and I hope that the Minister will agree. I know that the MOD is thinking about having super-garrisons. Bicester in my constituency&mdash;as the name suggests, it was a Roman garrison&mdash;became a garrison for the British Army at the time of the first world war. It had a huge footprint because it was built to resist Zeppelin attacks. It was thought that if the Zeppelins managed to hit one part of the depot they would not hit the others. It covers a huge area.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/6">It has some enormous hangers and storage sheds, which must be among the wonders of the world. In one of them&mdash;it is an incredible sight, and I am sure that the Minister will have seen it&mdash;is the Bowman conversion for the new radio system. The set-up includes classrooms, and it is like going into a university. When the Bowman training at Bicester is over, I hope that the Army will find another good purpose for it. I believe that it would be an ideal place for a super-garrison, where apprentices and young soldiers, both men and women, could be trained. It would ensure that they found their trades at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/7">The point is that we should be recruiting earlier. We should use the time to enhance people's education and training in trades and skills, particularly if, as my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire says, they have less time for training or to acquire skills because they are being deployed so frequently.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/8">My next point is about housing. My hon. Friend made the point that families will be pretty disillusioned if the quality of housing is not good. Ambrosden in my constituency is a large village just outside Bicester that once had within its borders almost a village of MOD housing. A road that goes through Ambrosden once had MOD housing on both sides. Some time ago, the Ministry sold off the housing on one side of the road to Annersley Housing, which then sold it on to the private sector. In other words, it is now owner-occupied; people have done up their houses, refurbished them and remodelled them. On the other side of the road, the housing is traditional; I do not say this in a pejorative sense, but it is bog-standard MOD married quarters, in which little has been invested. It is pretty depressing.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/9">I speak for the Army because I do not have so much experience of the Navy or the Air Force. It needs to recognise that if it wishes to retain soldiers it must also retain their wives and families. And the wives and families will stay only if married quarters are of a good standard; they do not want to think that they are being prejudiced by having to live in sub-standard accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/10">There is a further issue. I have seen the problem in my constituency, but I do not pretend to have the answer. Twenty or 30 years ago, a staff sergeant or warrant officer leaving the Army with a gratuity could probably put a deposit on a home. It is now difficult for people leaving the armed forces to get on to the housing ladder. I do not know the answer, but it behoves us to ensure that the quality of housing while in the armed forces is good and that when people leave the services they have access to social housing should it be needed. I hope that the Minister can give us an undertaking that whichever defence estate is involved, it is giving active consideration to upgrading married accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/11">The third point that I wish to raise was not mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire. It is something that I genuinely do not understand. Anyone who has had any involvement or connection with the Army or the armed forces knows that the regimental system works to look after those in the regiment. It has always done so because most regiments rightly see themselves as a family so I genuinely do not understand why barely a week goes by without a surfeit of articles in the press about soldiers being neglected.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/12">Last week's edition of <i>The Week</i> magazine included the headline &quot;Wounded soldiers: a shameful neglect&quot;. <i>The Mail on Sunday</i> of <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-18">18 March</phrase> carried an article headlined &quot;Soldiers wait years for MOD payouts&quot;. Sub-headlines in that article included &quot;Government admits 7,000 wounded soldiers have not received their war pensions&mdash;many more are not even told of their entitlement&quot;; &quot;I may never have kids, but I've had no money&quot;; and &quot;I thought I'd die. Now I can't afford hot water&quot;. <i>The Sunday Times</i> of the same date had the headline &quot;MoD 'deserts' teen soldiers scarred by Iraq&quot;. It is a litany of neglect. It must have a corrosive effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/13">As my hon. Friend said, parents are loath to support their children if they express a wish to join the armed forces. I genuinely do not understand why that is. If there is a system in place or if unit welfare officers are available, I do not understand how people can get lost in the system. One of the lessons that we should have learned from the first Gulf war is that it cannot be beyond the wit of man and officialdom to ensure that every wounded, injured or discharged soldier leaving our armed forces has some dedicated support, even if it comes through the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association or other organisations, to ensure that people are not left alone. What is coming through many of these stories is that people being discharged from the Army feel that they have been left on their own. I cannot believe that our uniformed institutions should get so much bad press. It must have a corrosive effect on recruitment. That is apart from the fact that each story is a matter of concern in itself&mdash;I am sure that the hon. Members who represent the individual soldiers affected will seek to raise those concerns in Adjournment debates if they feel it appropriate. The situation reflects badly on the Army and on its duty of care.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/14">My final point is on access to military personnel. The armed forces are in a changing world, and each and every member of them is an elector. Serving soldiers are our electors. Yet, curiously, it is easier for me to get through to a closed convent than to serving personnel. If I want to go and see serving soldiers&mdash;my electors&mdash;in their garrison, including in Bicester garrison, I have to write to the Minister of State to ask permission.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/15">I do not wish to tease anyone, but that situation might well go back to the days when half the Labour party were rabid members of CND, and Lord Heseltine was concerned that if they were allowed into barracks and garrisons they would cause mayhem by demonstrating and chaining themselves up. However, time has moved on. We should ensure that all soldiers are on the electoral roll where they live. I understand that the position has now been changed so that, if they register, their registration counts for three years rather than one. Nevertheless, there is a difference between Members of Parliament visiting installations&mdash;regiments per se&mdash;to talk about operational issues, deployment and so forth, and Members of Parliament visiting soldiers' quarters and married quarters, and having contact with soldiers as electors. The latter type of visit gives us confidence that we as MPs have first-hand information about what is causing concern in the military and about what is good.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/16">As my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire said, what soldiers tell us is often good. When I went to Afghanistan last year with the armed forces parliamentary scheme&mdash;along with a detachment of Labour MPs whom the Chief Whip had clearly wished to lose for the purposes of a key vote&mdash;we took time out to ask soldiers what they thought of their kit. Every one of them said, &quot;We like our kit. We no longer have to buy any other kit.&quot; Coming from Bicester, where the Defence Clothing and Textiles Agency is located, I was genuinely glad to hear that. Soldiers are candid&mdash;they are up front in saying what is good and bad. At the beginning of the 21st century we should have new protocols for Members to have access to and contact with those of their electors who are members of the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/17">Allow me to summarise my four points. First, we should be recruiting earlier and training younger. Bicester should be a super-garrison because it would be an ideal location for an army education centre&mdash;not least when Bowman training goes. My second point was about housing. Thirdly, I just do not understand why so many soldiers who leave the armed forces, or who are wounded or injured, feel neglected. Finally, MPs should have much better access to soldiers who are their electors.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.1/1">I note your comments, Mr. Williams. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" name="Stephen Crabb">the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb)</phrase> on securing the debate. I also congratulate those hon. Members who have taken part on the way in which it has been conducted. I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/2">Retention and recruitment are two sides of the same coin and include issues such as the conditions and care of personnel, the standard and quality of equipment, the provisions available in conflict zones, levels of training and preparedness and the needs of soldiers' families.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/3">To follow up the point about ethnic minorities, it is interesting to note that 10 per cent. of the British Army is not British, with one in 10 soldiers belonging to one of 57 other nationalities. That must be because there has been a decline in the number of young British men and women who wish to join Her Majesty's armed forces, although I welcome the increase in the percentage of young ladies who join the Army, in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/4">Fiji leads the way on this issue, providing 2,000 of the 6,700 soldiers who come from the Commonwealth countries. In one sense, we should rejoice that so many people from other countries wish to join our armed forces, but what percentage does the Minister think that the British Army can go to given that the figure is already 10 per cent.? What is being done to encourage young men and women from this country to join Her Majesty's armed forces?</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/5">As I said, Fiji leads the way with about 2,000 soldiers, but the A to Z roll-call of countries with citizens in the British Army goes from Australia, with 75, to Zimbabwe, with 565. There are also 660 soldiers from Ghana, 975 from Jamaica and 720 from South Africa. Even tiny countries such as St. Lucia and St. Vincent have provided 225 and 280 recruits respectively. Two weeks ago, I visited Bassingbourn as a member of the armed forces parliamentary scheme and had lunch with three young men&mdash;one from India, one from Ghana and one from Nigeria&mdash;and the members of their cohort were predominantly Ghanaians.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/6">What incentives are there for joining the armed forces? Although the higher ranks seem to be doing quite well, there appear to be limited incentives otherwise, and the basic rate of pay for privates and recruits is not in line with that for other professions. I do not usually quote Williams Rees-Mogg, but he recently reported in The Times that the average Army recruit is paid &pound;10,000 less than a Metropolitan police recruit.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/7">It could be said that the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have proved more challenging and often more hostile than anticipated. It is also fair to say that the impact of the Iraq war and our intervention in Afghanistan is taking its toll on the retention and recruitment of troops. It is therefore important that our troops feel valued and supported in their missions; after all, they are the backbone of our fighting forces. The Government therefore need to prioritise their welfare, fair treatment and conditions of service. Regiments and individual soldiers are being asked to do too much too often without proper regard to their welfare needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/8">If we send our troops overseas, they will obviously need to be well prepared and protected. At home, however, the situation may be little better, with nearly half of armed forces accommodation considered substandard and the quality of medical care at times questionable, as recent reports have indicated. Those are just prominent examples, but there are others.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/9">We also need to focus on the needs of armed forces families and the issues facing them to ensure that they get a good deal and are looked after while their loved ones are away, and I shall return to that in a minute. There is also a link to issues such as education for armed forces children.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/10">Another issue is tax. It is ludicrous that men who are deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan have to pay council tax back home.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/11">Married quarters often leave a lot to be desired. There is also the issue of the time that families do not spend together because of increasing deployments. Overstretch means that troops are spending longer away, and anybody who says that overstretch is a myth is not living in the real world.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/12">I pay tribute to all those who provide Her Majesty's armed forces with welfare and medical services. However, they are in short supply, and we have already heard about dentists. I had an Adjournment debate on education for armed forces children a few years ago, and I invite the Minister and his officials to look at what was said and at what the then Minister promised in response to see whether it has been delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/13">Welfare is important for the well-being of families back home, particularly when troops are serving overseas, but also when they are on training schedules elsewhere. We pay tribute not only to the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association, but others including the Royal British Legion.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/14">On schools, I have the great privilege of representing one of the super-garrison towns, and we have several garrison schools. However, the turbulence factor is not taken into account in the funding of those schools. Indeed, it has got worse in recent years because the hot-school-meals service that those schools used to receive has been withdrawn by Essex county council. It is fair to say that in many parts of the country things have improved dramatically for single men, not least in Merville barracks in Colchester, where the accommodation is superb. However, that is not the case everywhere, and certainly not the case with family housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/15">As an aside, the number of MOD police has been cut by 40 per cent. in my garrison, and I believe that there have been cuts in other parts of the country as well. That is related to welfare and the feel-good factor. If there was a 40 per cent. cut in the police service in a neighbourhood, it would be noticed. That is exactly what has happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/16">I said that I would concentrate on the housing side of the matter. I appreciate what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> said about housing, but let us go back to 1996, when the previous Government sold the entire MOD housing stock&mdash;57,428 houses&mdash;for &pound;1.66 billion. Interestingly, they have ended up in the ownership of Annington Homes, which has made quite a financial killing. I shall come to that in a minute.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/17">I have tabled parliamentary questions about the decent homes standard and, in reply, I was told that the MOD has even higher standards&mdash;the standard for condition, bands 1 to 4. That is the good news. However, then we discover that all is not well. Indeed, I raised that matter previously and received a letter from the chief executive of Annington Homes in which he informed me that the MOD</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/18" class="indent">&quot;directly benefits from our sales due to a profit share arrangement which formed part of the original transaction to buy the MoD homes in 1996. To date the Treasury has received over &pound;145 million from Annington.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/19">My question to the Minister is: why has that &pound;145 million not been ploughed back into increasing the housing stock? A very illuminating passage in that letter informed me:</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/20" class="indent">&quot;You are perfectly entitled to call for the standard of accommodation for all Service personnel to be improved, a sentiment shared by many, but you know that Annington is not involved in how and when the MoD do this. The MoD chose to retain its responsibility for the management and maintenance of the properties it leases from us and, naturally, makes its own decisions about its priorities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/21">Annington is saying that the ball is very firmly in the MOD's court. I ask the Minister to dwell on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/22">I shall quote from an article in the current edition of Private Eye&mdash;a magazine that we all read fondly&mdash;under the headline: &quot;All MoD cons&quot;. That is one of the best headlines that I have seen in relation to this story&mdash;the words &quot;MoD&quot; and &quot;cons&quot; slip nicely off the tongue. It reads:</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/23" class="indent">&quot;Meanwhile the company that bought the housing in 1996, Annington, continues to do very nicely. When the forces no longer want to rent houses from Annington the company sells them, with the MoD recouping a share of any profit on the property it paid for in the first place. But the taxpayer only gets 22 percent of the gains, and since 1996 has recouped just &pound;140 million.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/24">Now, there is a bit of a variation there, but the general picture is the same and virtually confirms what Annington said. It continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/25" class="indent">That means that in the same period Annington, controlled by Japanese investment bank Nomura, has bagged &pound;500m&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/26">Let us bear in mind that the 57,428 houses were sold for &pound;1.66 billion. One does not have to be a mathematician to work out that Annington has made a fantastic financial killing already.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/27">The article continues by stating that that &pound;500 million</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/28" class="indent">&quot;would have come in very handy in the defence budget, not least for the dirty work of maintaining and upgrading the housing that remains the public sector's responsibility). And there's plenty more bunce to come: the MoD's share of future gains, expected to be large, soon drops to 10 per cent. and disappears completely in 2011.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/29">I invite the Minister, his colleagues and the Government in general, to look again at what went on and what can be done to retrieve the biggest rip-off, I believe, of all the privatisations under the previous Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/30">Much more needs to be said, but I appreciate that the clock is moving on. I hope that the Minister will take very seriously the housing issue because it is very important to retention, along with welfare, education and MOD policing. I hope that he will also look at what is not working in recruitment because quite clearly it is not right that 10 per cent. of people serving in the British Army are not British. However much we welcome members of the Commonwealth serving in the British Army and, to a certain extent, Air Force and Navy, the simple fact is that something is not right if we cannot encourage a sufficient number of our own young men and women to join Her Majesty's armed forces.</p>

	<p pid="a.201.0/1">Thank you very much, Mr. Williams. It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" name="Stephen Crabb">the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb)</phrase> on securing this debate and for the excellent opportunity it has given us. We have heard contributions from my hon. Friends the Members for Banbury (Tony Baldry) and for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster) and from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1895" name="John Smith">the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (John Smith)</phrase> which touched on a number of important issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/2">The root problem, which a number of hon. Members have identified, with the difficulties in recruitment and retention and the general overstretch of the armed forces comes down to a central question. In 1998, the Government did a good piece of work on the strategic defence review, out of which came the defence planning assumptions, which underlie the size and shape of the armed forces. Those assumptions were that we could undertake a certain level of operational activity, but, as the NAO has noted, we have exceeded that level in each of the past five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/3">As far as I can tell, there is no sign that that is going to change in the near future. I know that we only signed up to a three-year Afghanistan operation, but it is clear from talking to NATO planners and from the state of that country that realistically we will be there for a decade or so. It is also clear from recent announcements on the Iraq deployment that although we have been able to reduce troop levels, we are going to retain several thousand troops, again, probably for the medium term. We will continue, therefore, to run our armed forces &quot;very hot&quot; to quote the phrase of the Chief of the General Staff, which will bring with it a continuation of the problems with retention and recruitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/4">I have raised that matter because, as we all know, this summer, or possibly, autumn, the Chancellor will announce the comprehensive spending review settlement for the MOD, which will set out the spending plans for the next three years. It would have been sensible for the MOD to review its defence planning assumptions ahead of the comprehensive spending review in order to make the case to the Chancellor for the appropriate budget settlement. It is disappointing that that review will not be concluded until next year. If those defence planning assumptions are that we will be running at the current level and that we will have to recruit and retain more members of the armed forces, it is going to be a bit late if the funds are not in place to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/5">That can be seen clearly from looking at our current manning levels. The Government's own requirement for the armed forces is 183,950 personnel, and the latest figures are that we have only 178,610. On the Government's own figures&mdash;a requirement based on defence planning assumptions that themselves are too low&mdash;and based on the level of commitment, we have a shortage in the armed forces of more than 5,000 personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/6">The situation is getting worse, because the level of exits from the armed forces is exceeding the number of those recruited, which will increase the problems with recruitment, retention and the level of deployments in both the regular forces and the Territorial Army, which we have heard about. Indeed, the Chief of the Defence Staff recently told the Select Committee on Defence that the most important thing for the armed forces was to achieve full manning&mdash;to get to the required level set by the MOD. Given the figures and trends and what hon. Members have said, that does not strike me as being at all likely. Will the Minister confirm that the Government intend to get back to that manning requirement level? And how does he plan to do that?</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/7">As my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire has said, the most worrying thing with recruitment is that although there has been some increase&mdash;last year was the second-worst year in the past five for recruitment, rather than the worst, so there has been some progress off a very low base&mdash;there has been an increase in what the MOD spends on recruitment. Army recruitment costs have increased by 34 per cent. and now run at &pound;89 million. The cost per recruit has also gone up: in 2001-02, we were spending just under &pound;4,500 per recruit, but we are now spending about &pound;7,000 per recruit, because recruitment has not risen in line with the budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/8">The MOD has a central defence schools presentation team that does excellent presentations in schools across the country. The Minister himself has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/9" class="indent">&quot;These presentations are extremely well received and do allow us to get our messages over about the importance of defence. Almost all schools ask for a repeat visit the following year which has lead to a yearly increase in presentations. Civilian and military staff are seen as excellent role models and there are consequently significant benefits for future recruiting.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-02-07.922"><i>Official Report</i>, 7 February 2007; Vol. 456, c. 922W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/10">That shows that there are benefits both in recruiting and in communicating to the wider world. It also relates to a point made by the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan about presenting the armed forces as an attractive career prospect to ethnic minority populations, thus bringing a double benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/11">Unfortunately, having said all of those fine words, the Minister has also announced that the defence schools presentation team is being wound up. Those presentations will no longer take place, but will, I am afraid, be replaced by an on-the-web solution. However good the penetration of the internet is, particularly with younger people, it is no replacement for having men and women from our armed forces physically going into our schools and doing all those excellent things that the Minister has acknowledged.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/12">I want to pick up the points made by the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan about recruiting from our ethnic minority populations. When I pressed him in an intervention, I was genuinely trying to understand what some of the barriers are. I know that the MOD has taken steps in the past few years to try to recruit more widely from ethnic minority populations. My hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire has mentioned recent efforts to recruit from our Muslim population. It is clear that we have not been as successful in recruiting from those groups as we had hoped, but at the end of the hon. Gentleman's speech, I was not much wiser. I do not find the phrase &quot;institutionally racist&quot; at all helpful, and I am still completely unclear about what he believes we need to change in our armed forces. He has simply cast a slur on them. I know that he said that individuals in the armed forces are not racist, but simply branding the whole organisation as racist is not very helpful&mdash;it is an insult and it does not take us any further forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.0/1">This is a short debate, and perhaps I did not make myself clear. The hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes has suggested some possible solutions. We have to positively discriminate to get rid of this unacceptable anomaly, which we have not done up to now. That is what I propose.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-20a.206.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1609" speakername="Derek Twigg" colnum="206"  time="010:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070320/halltext/70320h0004.htm#07032048000497">
	<p pid="a.206.5/1">I give the hon. Gentleman an assurance that I shall personally look into the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.5/2">The NAO's report acknowledged that we needed to focus on encouraging people to stay longer in some particularly important areas. That point was raised by Conservative Members. We are focusing on the infantry, the Royal Marines and air crew, where we are using financial retention incentives to encourage people to stay. The cost will be about &pound;17 million, securing a valuable return of service that will contribute directly to operational effectiveness. Of course, we also use a range of other measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.5/3">Recruiting targets have been discussed this morning, and, in general, recruiting has increased. Although the armed forces offer a wealth of opportunities, not least in terms of training and education, the reality is that our recruiters operate in a very competitive environment, as has also been acknowledged. We need about 20,000 new entrants each year across all three services. Young people have more opportunities than ever before, given the strong economy and the Government's encouragement to stay in education.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.5/4">The hon. Member for Banbury mentioned recruiting younger people. We have been highly successful in recruiting 16 and 17-year-olds, and he may be aware of the Army foundation college in Harrogate. Places are available to school leavers aged 16 to 17 years and one month. He alluded to the fact, of which account is not often taken in the complaints that are made and the issues that we hear about, that the armed forces do a lot to improve young people's education and skills. That leads me on to the specific point that being in the armed forces is a good thing for one's future because it gives the leadership, skills, communications and teamwork that can be taken on when one leaves the armed forces. That is why so many people who leave the armed forces&mdash;they receive an excellent resettlement package when they do so&mdash;go on to gain a higher level of employment than those elsewhere and contribute greatly to their community.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.5/5">The issue of the recruitment of ethnic minorities has rightly been mentioned; although recruitment goals were not reached in 2005-06, the services continue to commit significant effort and resources to engaging and raising awareness among all of the UK's minority groups to encourage their members to consider a career in the armed forces. It is important to say that ethnic minorities are beginning to progress through the ranks structure and reach more senior levels. Recently, an ethnic minority officer in the Royal Navy was promoted to rear admiral, becoming the highest ranking ethnic minority officer in the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.5/6">The armed forces regularly review their recruitment strategies and policies, with a view to engaging ethnic minority groups, raising awareness and promoting careers in the services. We have heard about the sums that are being put into recruitment. Recent results have shown an increase in the level of interest in armed forces careers among minority communities. The challenge now is to convert interest into recruitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.5/7">I must tell my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1895" name="John Smith">the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (John Smith)</phrase> that I do not accept that the armed forces are institutionally racist. I have talked to the chiefs of staff&mdash;the people at the very top. They are very committed to improving the recruitment from ethnic minorities, and much time and effort goes into doing that. I shall not go into the comments made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1726" name="Patrick Mercer">the hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer)</phrase>. We must ensure that the armed forces are moving on, that there is a clear strategy for recruitment and that there is encouragement of promotion and of the advancement of people's careers.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.5/8">By <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January</phrase>, we had recruited 96 per cent. of our requirement for the financial year. While recruiting is generally up on the previous year, there is still more to do, particularly for elements of the Army. That is why we have introduced recruiting incentives in shortage areas, such as the infantry and Royal Artillery. So far, the signs have been positive; there has been a 30 per cent. increase in potential recruits to the infantry and a 44 per cent. increase in respect of the Royal Artillery when compared with last year. The Army has launched &quot;one Army recruiting&quot; to bring together regular and reserve soldiers. I pay tribute to the hard work, determination and imagination of recruiters in reaching the young people we need. Young people will benefit from service.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.5/9">I return to the question of retention. A healthy and thriving organisation has people joining and leaving it at various stages of their lives. The armed forces are essentially young organisations. Some people retire at the end of a full career, while others leave early voluntarily. The services well understand voluntary outflow and plan accordingly. Voluntary outflow from the armed forces has varied little over the past decade, and compares favourably with the outflow from the rest of the public sector and from the private sector. We cannot purely rely on transactional measures to secure retention. We also use a range of social and community measures that are aimed at maintaining the morale not only of our serving people but of their families. For the Royal Navy and the Army, the latest attitude surveys show significant improvement in the self-assessment of morale compared with previous surveys, although the Royal Air Force showing was slightly lower.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.5/10">We have continuously improved the operational welfare package for those serving on operations. The package directly upholds our obligations to our people by providing extra support for their physical and emotional well-being when they are employed on operations. It was clear from the seven-day visit that I made to Afghanistan and Iraq a few weeks ago that morale was high; it was even higher among those involved in the front-line operations. While some issues to do with the welfare package were raised, the welfare package was broadly welcomed by most people. I spoke to hundreds of members of the armed forces during my visit.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.5/11">The recent improvements made include an increase in the free weekly telephone calls from 20 to 30 minutes, and better internet access. Other benefits include: the free e-bluey, which is particularly popular; free forces airmail; free packages from families to personnel of up to 2 kg over the Christmas period; and up to 14 days' rest and recuperation leave during a six-month tour. That, combined with the new operational allowance, means that there has been improvement. We continue to examine how we can improve the package.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.5/12">The issue of accommodation was rightly raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase> and others. I had the pleasure of visiting Colchester a few months ago, where I met the Paras and saw the new accommodation that has been built. I readily acknowledge that we need to do more in this area. There is a legacy of underfunding, but we must ensure that the right and proper accommodation is in place for our service people. It will take some time to deal with this issue. As I have seen on my recent visits, new accommodation for both families and single personnel is coming on stream all the time. In this financial year, we spent more than &pound;700 million on accommodation and have upgraded many service houses. We plan to spend about &pound;5 billion over the next 10 years, but there are no quick fixes because we need to address a legacy that goes back many years. We must continue our improvement in this area. Opening up the opportunities for home ownership is a part of our strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.5/13">I have gone on the record many times in recent weeks and months about the health service issue. Our people are getting the best world-class care possible. When people come back wounded from operations they receive first-class care in the Selly Oak facility and in the national health service; I have spoken to many service personnel and their families, and they all praise the care and treatment that they are receiving. There is also an excellent rehabilitation centre at Headley Court. We can always do more. One area in which we need to do more is mental health, and we are examining that as part of a partnership with the NHS and Combat Stress.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-20a.215.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" speakername="Mark Field" colnum="215"  time="011:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070320/halltext/70320h0006.htm#07032048000507">
	<p pid="a.215.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> on initiating this important debate. As the Member for the Cities of London and Westminster, it is a pleasure to take this opportunity to highlight the importance of London's contribution to the nation and to make some points that are important to its continued success.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/2">The hon. Gentleman understandably&mdash;and quite rightly&mdash;did not focus just on London's economic success, but I hope that he will forgive me if my speech is geared towards the importance of the economy. Not only do I have 70,000 constituents, but almost 1 million people come to work in my constituency every day. He made some important points about certain aspects of poverty and the high rate of unemployment in London, which I hope that the Economic Secretary has taken on board. However, I shall focus on the financial services industry and other industries that are so important to the wealth of London and, therefore, to this country's continued economic success.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/3">London now has the highest unemployment of any region in the UK. We also have the largest number of migrants to this country, an issue which it is often difficult to debate in parliamentary terms, who understandably come to the vibrant area of central London. One of the reasons why it is perhaps so difficult to get back into work is that we have quite a large black economy&mdash;its size is unknown. A lot of people are paid cash in hand, which is a strong disincentive to employ and train up many people in the indigenous population, who therefore remain unemployed. Also, a lot of people who perhaps lack the skills and aptitude to hold down a job live in social housing. They find it difficult to improve their lives for the reasons that the hon. Member for Hendon has set out and find it easier to remain unemployed if they thereby qualify for the scarce social housing to which he also referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/4">There are some major problems in London. I endorse what the hon. Gentleman has said about the need for serious thought about a problem that was thought to be specific to the capital, but which, I fear, now extends beyond its borders. I suspect that many hon. Members with seats in the home counties&mdash;for instance, Essex, Kent or Hertfordshire&mdash;would recognise precisely the same problem of increasing polarisation. In order to live in many bits of London and the south-east, people need to have inherited property, to work in financial services or a related industry or be so poor that they qualify for social housing. The group in the middle is for ever being squeezed. That polarisation has been an element of life in central London for many decades, but I suspect that it is now every bit as evident in Hendon, St. Albans and Stevenage. That raises major issues&mdash;of social cohesion, apart from anything else&mdash;that we shall all have to address going forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/5">Hon. Members may be aware of a report commissioned by the City of London corporation entitled &quot;London's Place in the UK Economy, 2006-07&quot;. It highlighted the increased importance of London's wealth and its potential to generate tax revenue at a time when the overall UK budget balance continues to deteriorate, a point to which I suspect that I shall return not only today, but at some point in the next few days, as we debate the Budget in the main Chamber. London is widely regarded as a world city; indeed, many see it as &quot;the&quot; world city&mdash;the big global capital&mdash;and rightly so. However, the capital's current standing across the globe reflects the fact that at its heart is a highly concentrated cluster of international business, whose beneficial effects are felt in many parts of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/6">However, it would be mistaken to forget the important contribution that our capital city makes rather closer to home. To paraphrase the hon. Gentleman, London made a net contribution of &pound;13.1 billion to UK public finances in 2004-05, which is a figure that I believe has increased fairly steadily over recent years. Data published by the City of London corporation suggest that GDP growth in London stood at 3.9 per cent. in 2006 compared with 2.6 per cent. in the UK as a whole. Further data suggest that London as a whole contributes between 17 and 19 per cent. of UK Government revenues, depending on whether residence-based or workplace-based calculations are used, despite London's population making up only one eighth of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/7">Financial and related business services have played a key role in the acceleration of the capital's growth, since London is dependent on financial services to a far greater extent than any other region of the UK. The importance of financial services to London is underscored by the fact that more than 40 per cent. of the country's financial services firms are based in London. Indeed, financial services now account for more than 9 per cent. of the UK's GDP, compared with just 7 per cent. a decade ago and with as little as 5 per cent. in 1980. It therefore appears that the success of London's City cluster goes hand in hand with the performance of the economy as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/8">The UK fiscal position as a whole, relative to London, has deteriorated sharply since the turn of the millennium. In the fiscal year 2004-05, for instance, the capital's net positive contribution to the UK current account was calculated to lie between &pound;6 billion and &pound;20 billion, so a mid-point estimate implies a net contribution of &pound;13.1 billion, the figure to which I have referred. A strong case can be made that London's tax export to the rest of the UK has helped to mitigate the impact of the increasing UK deficit, which reached &pound;39.7 billion in 2004-05. Without the benefit of that substantial contribution to the Exchequer, the public borrowing requirement would be considerably greater, with stark consequences for public spending as a whole throughout the UK. Furthermore, London imported &pound;110 billion of goods and services from elsewhere in the country in 2005, amply demonstrating that London's success provides essential support to the rest of the UK economy. As the hon. Gentleman has said, if London does not succeed, the rest of the UK will suffer.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/9">London occupies a uniquely competitive position in the UK economy. Its high costs are more than offset by other factors, making it an attractive location for internationally-traded services. London's high-value-added economy depends upon providing benefits for its highly skilled work force. London has a strong track record in attracting skilled professional and managerial workers from overseas as well as lower-skilled workers, who have filled potential labour shortages in the retail, catering, transport and other sectors and have consequently helped the UK to maintain a relatively liquid employment market. However, all the caveats that I mentioned earlier must be taken into account. It is a great worry that an increasing number of Londoners are being left behind, notwithstanding the efforts of central Government, London government as a whole and the City of London corporation, which plays an important role in Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Islington, in trying to attract from further afield not only the brightest and the best, but others to make their full contribution to the financial services sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/10">In 2005 alone, 32 per cent. of London's work force possessed degrees or higher education qualifications, compared with just over one quarter in the rest of the UK. That picture reflects the fact that London is competing internationally. London is truly a global capital and does not sees its competitors as&mdash;dare I say it, given the earlier intervention&mdash;Birmingham, Glasgow or Edinburgh, but New York and Tokyo and, in the decades to come if not already, Shanghai, Beijing, New Delhi and Hong Kong. London is one of an elite group of cities. New research commissioned by the City of London corporation has for the first time established an index of competitiveness, which tracks 46 of the world's financial centres. That index&mdash;the global financial centres index&mdash;shows London and New York as the two global powerhouses, ranking well ahead of Hong Kong and Singapore. At present London is ranked ahead of New York in all five areas of competitiveness&mdash;people, business environment, market access, infrastructure and general competitiveness. However, the report highlights widespread concerns about the UK tax regime relative to its competitors.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/11">It is also important that we take this opportunity to highlight some of the issues of broader infrastructure. We cannot be complacent about the skills infrastructure, and there are issues of physical infrastructure&mdash;in particular the transport infrastructure, to which the hon. Member for Hendon has referred. I should like to make a bid for serious consideration of Crossrail and other aspects of the transport infrastructure, without which London's great dominance, which has been jealously guarded and created strongly in the past two decades, will begin to be undermined. That would be little short of disaster not only for our capital city, but on a broader basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/12">Central to London's ability to retain its competitive edge will be its cultivation of the knowledge economy. The capital is well served by its 43 higher education institutions, but more than ever the best universities compete globally for teaching, students and finance. This debate is not simply about higher education, but we must all face that important issue. Some of our very best universities are suffering as a result of global competition&mdash;not least for places, given the numbers of graduates from China and India coming through across the country. There is also a significant brain drain of some of the best academics, who are now going to US universities simply because pay and conditions are so much better. I hope that we shall give great consideration to setting free our best universities. Now a fee structure is in place, I should like there to be a much more flexible structure.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.1/3">Housing is key. Two-thirds of the UK's households in temporary accommodation are in London. More than 150,000 London households are overcrowded, including 8,000 in the borough of Hackney. I see Hackney as the Ellis island of London, and possibly of the UK. People arrive from all corners of the globe and the UK and we need to keep those people in Hackney and in London if we are to see our city stabilise.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-20a.234.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" speakername="Evan Harris" colnum="234"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070320/halltext/70320h0008.htm#07032048000533">
	<p pid="a.234.1/1">I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise this important issue, which I have already raised briefly in oral Education questions with the Minister whom I am pleased to see will respond to this debate. It is my contention that there are more and more attacks on and, in addition, threats to academic freedom in our universities, including the freedom to research topics of one's choice, the freedom to lecture and give academic treatises on subjects of one's choosing within one's academic field, and the freedom of expression in and of itself on university campuses.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/2">We have seen recently the incident at Leeds university, in which an academic's speech was cancelled by the university. We have seen the personalised attacks on a professor at Oxford university, in my constituency, on the basis of his political views, and the calls for his tenure to be somehow affected by them. We read in <i>The</i><i>Times Higher Education Supplement </i>that some tax-funded institutions of higher education that one would think were subject to the rules about academic freedom qualified their provisions on academic freedom by reference to religious ethos. Then there is the question, which I raised with the Minister in oral Education questions, of no-platform policies on university campuses.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/3">What I want from the debate is an acknowledgement by the Minister that he recognises the importance of academic freedom and freedom of expression and that he supports the existing legislation, which was introduced by a previous Government and which I believe was steered through the House in part by previous political opponents of mine, but which has stood the test of time. I want the Minister to say that the Government's clear position is to respect freedom of expression and academic freedom, and I want him to say whether he will take action to make it absolutely clear that Parliament, the Government and the institutions that govern the way in which universities receive taxpayers' money&mdash;that is why we have a particular interest in this issue&mdash;are interested and keen to ensure that there is no restriction on freedom of expression within the law in universities.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/4">I do not argue that freedom of expression should be absolute. Clearly, we have, except in this place, libel laws. We have rules about matters that are sub judice. We have rules about incitement to violence and incitement to criminal offences. I support those rules. We also have rules about incitement to racial hatred even if those involved do not themselves incite criminal offences. So clearly there are limits, but beyond those limits, which I think should be limited and clear, we need to ensure that we protect freedom of expression, especially in the area of religious discourse. In fact, I would argue that it is incumbent on us to challenge religious views, whether that be in academia, in politics or in general speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/5">It is also vital that we recognise the importance of academic freedom in the sense of freedom to research and publish without constraint from the funder of the research. I shall not go down that road, but I wanted to acknowledge those issues, and I am grateful to the University and College Union, a trade union, and to Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, for the briefings that they have given me for the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/6">The issues that I want to raise in detail include the campaign against David Coleman of Oxford university in my constituency. That has stemmed from a petition to the university of Oxford, although the university told me that it had not actually received any petitions. The petition is from Oxford Student Action for Refugees&mdash;STAR&mdash;which is a national organisation with which I have worked closely. It notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/7" class="indent">&quot;David Coleman has been Professor of Demography at the University of Oxford since October 2002.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/8">It claims that he is also</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/9" class="indent">&quot;a consultant and spokesperson for Migration Watch.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/10">It says that he</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/11" class="indent">&quot;is a member of the Eugenics Society, now called the Galton Institute&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/12">and that he</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/13" class="indent">&quot;is acquiring a public image in the ongoing...debate about immigration, and...is using his status as a university professor to legitimise the views and reports produced by Migration Watch.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/14">The petitioners believe that Migration Watch</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/15" class="indent">&quot;masquerades as an independent non-partisan organisation, but in fact has a strong anti-immigration bias.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/16">The petition continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/17" class="indent">&quot;Through his many media appearances Professor Coleman is bringing the university into disrepute by associating it with the views of Migration Watch...We the undersigned call on the University to: Ask Professor Coleman to refrain from using his academic title when appearing on behalf of Migration Watch in the media&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/18">and to</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/19" class="indent">&quot;Consider the suitability of Coleman's continued tenure as a Professor of the University, in light of his well-known opinions and affiliations relating to immigration and eugenics.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/20">That would be laughable were it not so outrageous in what it is seeking to do. The organisation has the right to free speech to make those ridiculous claims, but it ill befits members of Oxford university to attack other members of Oxford university and, indeed, their tenure, income and position simply because they disagree with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/21">I have spent 20 years in politics as a subscriber to &quot;Searchlight&quot; and campaigning against anti-immigration views and I yield to very few people in the strength with which I have taken issue with some of the claims made by Migration Watch. However, to argue that someone who is a professor cannot describe themselves as a professor when giving their views is preposterous. David Coleman had never claimed, as far as I can tell, to represent the university but in fact spoke on behalf of Migration Watch, and none of his personal views has any direct impact on his ability to do his job in respect of research or teaching. If students object to being taught by him, that is their lookout. It is unacceptable to seek to hound a man, through a boycott or through the sort of criticism and petitioning that I have described, out of academic life.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/22">I am very disappointed at what has happened. My view is that such a petition and such an approach are counter-productive, because they create a victim&mdash;David Coleman is a victim in this respect&mdash;out of someone who, when it comes to the arguments on immigration, should be debated with or ignored, not given credibility and victim status. However aberrant David Coleman's views&mdash;they are debatable&mdash;as long as they are legal and delivered lawfully, he has, in my view, every right to express them without fear of retribution from his employer. As long as he does not claim to speak on behalf of the university, he is at liberty to set out his academic background.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/23">The price of all of us enjoying academic freedom and free expression is that we provide those freedoms to people with whom we disagree. The campaign against Professor Coleman is illiberal and counter-productive. The reference to &quot;eugenics&quot; in the petition, based on the history of the Galton institute, is plain silly. We cannot stop debate about genetics and population just because someone says, &quot;Ooh, boo hiss, eugenics.&quot; It is an ill-founded campaign and I hope that it has no further impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/24">Something that clearly has had an impact is what happened at Leeds recently. A talk by Matthias Kuentzel at Leeds university was cancelled by the university at short notice. The university claims that that was not done on the basis of complaints from, perhaps, Muslim students or other members of the university or the wider Leeds population about Matthias Kuentzel's talk, which was initially titled &quot;Hitler's Legacy: Islamic Anti-Semitism in the Middle East&quot;, but was changed to &quot;The Nazi Legacy: the export of anti-Semitism to the Middle East&quot;. The university claims that it did not cancel the meeting due to complaints. Again, that would be censorship. It is peculiar, though, that I am told through the Community Security Trust that the academics called to a meeting with the university were told that there were complaints and that was why they had been called to the meeting, but the university later claimed that the talk was cancelled for administrative reasons because of a lack of notice, even though posters had been up.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/25">We have a choice. One scenario is that there were complaints that the talk was offensive, in which case it is not for the university to censor the speech as long as it is lawful. Indeed, some of the most important dialogues relating to religion, particularly extremist religion, are bound to be offensive. People on both sides of the matter who are propagating their strongly felt beliefs are easily offended, it seems to me. That does not mean that we should be restricted in what we say.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/26">The alternative is that there were threats to people's safety. If there were, it is the job of the university authorities and the police in a free society to provide safety and to police events, rather than censor them. If they do censor events, there is a good chance, whenever anyone makes a threat, that meetings will be cancelled on safety grounds or because the risk assessment is not up to date. That just feeds the idea that events and speeches will be cancelled if threats are made, and a stand must be taken on that. I thought that we had a police force to protect our liberties, not to make concessions on the spurious basis of administrative grounds. It is extremely unfortunate that they have done so, because more complaints and threats may well be made, which would add to the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/27">A further example of the increasing trend towards attacking academic freedom was highlighted last week in <i>The</i><i>Times Higher Educational Supplement</i>. The paper has been running a series of articles exploring threats to academic freedom, and I commend it on doing so. The article mentions Canterbury Christ Church university's article of governance, which refers to academics' &quot;freedom to question&quot;&mdash;that wording is taken from section 202 of the Education Reform Act 1988 which states that academics</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/28" class="indent">&quot;have freedom within the law to question and test received wisdom, and to put forward...unpopular or controversial opinions&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/29">without fear of sanction. According to the newspaper, the university's article of governance says:</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/30" class="indent">&quot;academics' freedom to question received wisdom is subject to a qualification: that they do not undermine the institution's ethos as a Church of England college or its code of conduct.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/31">Apparently, the University of Chester</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/32" class="indent">&quot;also asks its academic staff not to undermine the institution's ethos and social values based on that ethos.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/33">One either has academic freedom and the ability to question received wisdom in one's academic work or one does not&mdash;it is not a question of saying, &quot;Yes, there is academic freedom, mainly.&quot; The bodies that I mentioned receive funding organised by the Minister through the Higher Education Funding Council, and I should be interested to hear whether he thinks that such restrictions on academic freedom are acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/34">I turn now to no-platform policies. It is worrying that such policies have been allowed to proliferate through student unions and the National Union of Students and that, until I recently raised the issue with the Minister, the Government had made no comment as to the fact that they are unlawful. It is interesting that the report by the all-party group on anti-Semitism, which contained several otherwise very good recommendations and comments and which a large number of hon. Members published in November 2006, stated without criticism:</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/35" class="indent">&quot;Individual student unions are responsible for passing No Platform policies. A student from University College London...submitted that the university has not done this and it has resulted in an inability to deal with extremist elements on campus.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/36">I put it to the Minister that extremist elements on campus who break the law need to be dealt with by the police, not by self-appointed kangaroo courts and no-platform policies that determine, by means of prior restraint, what is unlawful.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/37">The report goes on to say that the student referred to in the report commented in 2005 that</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/38" class="indent">&quot;spokespeople for Hizb ut-Tahrir were invited to the campus to give presentations. Although UCL has an equal opportunities policy, without a No Platform policy the University was unable to prevent them from speaking.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/39">The report made no mention of whether that was appropriate. However, such provisions are not lawful. If the Government, having looked into the matter, have decided that Hizb ut-Tahrir is not outside the law, it is not for individual universities to ban its speeches.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/40">Paragraph 199 of the report goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/41" class="indent">&quot;Although they are banned from most campuses under the NUS No Platform policy, Hizb ut-Tahrir have reappeared under a number of aliases.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/42">The group is not banned from universities under the NUS no-platform policy&mdash;an unlawful attempt may have been made to seek to ban it under that policy. I am disappointed that the report's authors did not make that clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/43">The Minister will be aware that section 43 of the Education Act 1986 states that higher education institutions must take reasonable steps</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/44" class="indent">&quot;to ensure that freedom of speech within the law is secured for members, students...employees&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/45">and visiting speakers. That duty includes taking reasonable steps to ensure that the use of the institution's premises is not denied to an individual or group on the grounds of the views or beliefs of the individual or group or the policy or objectives of the group. That requirement should also apply to the Government, who should tell student unions that it is inappropriate to have no-platform policies because they would be unlawful if they were successful. Universities should also make that clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/46">If we do not make the position clear now, there will be increasing extremism on both sides of the argument. In that respect, I have had supportive representations from both the Council for Arab-British Understanding and Jewish organisations about the need to secure freedom of speech on the one hand and to avoid a boycott of Jewish academics on the other. That boycott was also discussed by the parliamentary report on anti-Semitism, but this time it argued against censorship and boycotts, which was inconsistent. With increasing extremism on both sides, however, we are in danger of stifling debate, and it is far better that we have lawful debate than a restriction on freedom of speech. I urge the Minister to send a signal today that he will do something to secure academic freedom, which I hope he and the Government also believe in.</p>

	<p pid="a.238.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" name="Evan Harris">the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase> on raising these important and timely issues, which I know from discussions on the Floor of the House he takes extremely seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/2">Let me start by making it abundantly clear that the Government believe in the concept of academic freedom. We certainly support previous legislation on academic freedom on campus, and we respect freedom of speech and academic freedom within the law. As I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware, higher education institutions are autonomous, and university autonomy is one of the key features that has made UK higher education such a success. The autonomy of our institutions is one of our greatest strengths, and I welcome diversity in the sector, be it in the student and staff population or the range of provision on offer. I would not seek directly to intervene in the individual governance arrangements, ethos or mission statements of higher education institutions, which are rightly responsible for determining their own academic and administrative affairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/3">I am therefore limited in what I can say in detail about the specific cases that the hon. Gentleman has raised. He has mentioned the case of Professor Coleman at Oxford, which can be said to highlight the fact that academic freedom is a matter of constant debate and concern in the higher education world. However, I am sure that he understands that it would be inappropriate for me to discuss individual cases relating to specific higher education employees, particularly when I am not familiar with all the background and circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/4">From reading and informing myself about these cases, however, I am aware that Professor Coleman's university, as his employer, has acted in accordance with its own policies and procedures on academic freedom and staff behaviour, and that it has backed the academic in question. From the evidence that I have seen, that is in accordance with the institution's governance arrangements. In those circumstances, its actions were absolutely the right.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/5">On the Leeds case, the decision was taken in accordance with the institution's governance arrangements. Without being privy to the individual factors concerned, it is difficult to say more, but if the hon. Gentleman raises specific concerns with the vice-chancellor, I am sure that there will be a response.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/6">I also note the hon. Gentleman's reference to the governance documents of two institutions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-20a.239.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" speakername="Bill Rammell" colnum="239"  time="012:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070320/halltext/70320h0009.htm#07032048000536">
	<p pid="a.239.1/1">That is an important point. I shall not comment on what happened at Leeds, because I am not aware of the detail, but, in general, if someone is advocating a lawful view, the university authorities have a responsibility to do whatever is possible to facilitate the discussion or meeting. There is one important caveat: university authorities must be responsible for the safety and security of people within their environments. That might be one countervailing factor, but as a general principle, I agree with the broad thrust of the hon. Gentleman's remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/2">The hon. Gentleman has referred to the governance arrangements of two institutions, Canterbury Christ Church university and the university of Chester, where it has been asserted that academic freedom is qualified with the expectation that staff and students respect the ethos of those institutions and adopt a code of conduct based on that ethos. I am aware of his concerns about those institutions' articles of governance. Those documents must, rightly, be read and applied within the context of the overarching legal framework. I hope to make it clear in the short time available to me that academic freedom is clearly enshrined in law and that that overarching legal framework upholds freedom of speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/3">I am sure that we all agree that higher education, by its very nature, is concerned with free debate, challenging established principles and pushing the boundaries of conventional thought. Higher education institutions have always been places where people come together from different backgrounds to explore ideas and exchange experiences. I think that the freedom to engage in robust but civilised argument and the willingness of people to have their ideas challenged and changed are at the heart of the educational experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/4">I believe that it is vital to both our economy and society that higher education continues to be at the forefront of intellectual inquiry and discovery. It helps us to progress as a forward-thinking and outward-looking nation and as individuals. Academic freedom is a fundamental principle of our higher education system. It goes wider than freedom of speech, because it includes freedom to pursue research and to publish&mdash;actions that play a significant part in academic endeavour.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/5">Academic staff must have freedom within the law to question and test received wisdom, to put forward new ideas and to voice controversial and some times unpopular opinions without placing themselves in jeopardy. That protection is articulated in higher education institutions' instruments of governance, post-92 staff contracts and key pieces of legislation. The definition of academic freedom setting out this principle is included&mdash;rightly, in my view&mdash;in the model instruments of governance for both pre-92 and post-92 higher education institutions, and it was initially set out in the Education Reform Act 1988 in relation to pre-92 institutions. It is the Government's expectation that all institutions should include a provision protecting academic freedom in their governance documents.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/6">Section 43 of the Education (No. 2) Act 1986 requires governing bodies of higher education institutions to</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/7" class="indent">&quot;take such steps as are reasonably practicable&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/8">to ensure that freedom of speech within the law is secured for members, students and employees of the institution and for visiting speakers. The duty requires institutions to have a code of practice setting out the procedures to be followed in connection with the organisation of meetings and other activities that take place on their premises, and to take steps to ensure that the code is complied with. Higher education institutions are protected from Government interference in academic matters under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/9">It is therefore clear that a definite framework for supporting academic freedom exists within our universities. I am a firm believer in the principle of academic freedom. However, it is important to say, as the hon. Gentleman has acknowledged, that that is not an absolute. Indeed, section 43 of the 1986 Act states that academic freedom within the law is what is important. The freedom to speak openly must be balanced with the rights of others and the need to take responsibility for one's words and, indeed, their consequences, such as actions to which they might lead.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/10">That does not override the bar on incitement to racial hatred or unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, religious belief, or sexual orientation. Governments have, of course, made it clear in domestic legislation that it is unacceptable to discriminate against people on those grounds. Article 10 of the European convention on human rights also makes it clear that freedom of expression may be qualified by the need for the protection of the rights of others. The higher education sector's own guidance on intolerance and hate crimes is helping institutions to deal with those issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/11">I shall briefly say a few words about the relevant guidance that my Department issued some months ago for tackling violent extremism in the name of Islam. Freedom of expression is a cornerstone of our democracy. A valued aspect of the right to freedom of expression in the UK is that individuals have the right to criticise, disagree with and campaign against the Government on any issue of foreign or domestic policy. It can be entirely legitimate to hold a view that is radical or extreme on the political spectrum. However, it becomes unacceptable when individuals develop extremist views that lead them to espouse, advocate or even undertake or facilitate violent acts that deliberately undermine good campus and community relations, using their extremist viewpoint as a justification for their actions. Our guidance targeted that dividing line.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/12">The hon. Gentleman also raised some important points about so-called no-platform policies, which have been pursued from time to time by student unions. It is true that a blanket no-platform policy is not consistent with the principles in the 1986 Act, which support freedom of speech on campus within the law, and it is right and important that we uphold those principles. Nevertheless, reasons relating to security or supporting equality might mean that a university, on a case-by-case basis, could act to ensure that a platform is not offered to certain groups or individuals through the use of its premises of resources. We have to be clear, however, that those judgments must be made in the context of the overall legal framework and the circumstances of the event and that they must be taken on a case-by-case basis. For example, we could not condone a university hosting a proscribed organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/13">The key point, however&mdash;I hope that this will reassure the hon. Gentleman&mdash;is that it is for the university authority, through the office of the vice-chancellor and the governance arrangements, to make that decision, not student unions. Universities should consider the nature of speeches or groups and the risk of an offence being committed under the Terrorism Act 2000 or other legal provisions, and make decisions on such matters.</p>

	<p pid="a.246.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1534" name="Natascha Engel">the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase> on securing her first Adjournment debate in Westminster Hall. I know that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1373" name="Judy Mallaber">the Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber)</phrase>, who has made an intervention, also follows these issues closely.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/2">Regrettably, a lot of myths exist about what goes on in tax offices in Chesterfield and elsewhere, and I should like to deal with those. One big myth is that the work of everyone in them is relevant to the local area and/or that they have local contacts and are a resource, which is rarely the case. I am pleased to have the opportunity to explain exactly what the Government are undertaking.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/3">I have a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu: as a Minister, I am being criticised for having decided to consult fully, but had I not consulted and simply taken decisions, I would also have been criticised, which demonstrates the difficulty of what needs to be done in this case.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/4">The first point that I should like to emphasise is that the senior management team in Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs have not announced a decision to close the Chesterfield offices&mdash;there has been no such announcement. What has been announced is a proposal to rationalise work and office space in the Sheffield urban centre, of which Chesterfield is a part. Consultation on that proposal has been completed in the past few days. I am grateful to those who have contributed to the process, including my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire, who has made submissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/5">Neither the Government nor the management of HMRC approached the issue on the basis of arbitrarily drawing a 25 km radius around an urban centre and then saying that all the small offices within it are up for closure. The point about 25 km is that it is, and has always been, in the contracts of all civil servants working for the department in respect of what is considered to be a reasonable distance to travel to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/6">I should emphasise a point that needs repeating: a decision has not been made on the future of HMRC's Chesterfield offices or on the future of any of its other offices in the east midlands, Yorkshire or Humberside. I will see all the recommendations before they are announced. All the information that has been provided, alongside the remarks made by my hon. Friend today, will be considered before any announcements are made. The consultation process will be published, which will include who said what and why, and the department's view.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/7">I understand the concerns of local people working in the Chesterfield office and elsewhere and the concerns of wider stakeholders, particularly in relation to the following&mdash;the extra travel time involved; the availability of transport links from people's homes; the environmental consequence of more journeys by road; and the impact on the local community if the jobs are relocated. As my hon. Friend has rightly identified, all those circumstances need to be taken into account, and I can tell her that they will be along with the care responsibilities and the likely impact on the local labour market.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/8">For those reasons, and others, I asked the senior management team at HMRC to undertake the process of consultation in each office and to assess the impact of proposals on customers, staff, local communities and diversity. Throughout the process, the senior management at HMRC are committed to being open with staff, to explaining the options available to individuals and to exploring how their expectations can be matched with the need to make HMRC's operations more efficient.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/9">I should make it clear that this is not an easy decision. Such decisions can be taken only once all the facts are known. We are talking about not only the management view on the most efficient way of running the business, but what the local communities, the staff and the local stakeholders are saying. We must also consider why this needs to be done. Members of Parliament cannot implore the Government to ensure that departments are using resources efficiently in order to eliminate unnecessary expenditure so that it can be transferred to health, education or other front-line services, but then say, &quot;Do it somewhere else.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/10">The fact is that the department has more accommodation than it needs. The position varies across the regions, but, generally, it has 40 per cent. more office accommodation than the staff need, which represents a substantial drain. Through the consultation, I am honestly trying to get the department to say, &quot;This is the number of staff that will work in an urban centre. This is the number of staff that the department will employ in 2008. We can distribute those staff according to business needs in a particular way.&quot; I shall come on to discuss how the department runs itself. What we want to do in each area is to consult people, taking on board precisely the points that my hon. Friend rightly makes about assessing which concerns are legitimate in deciding where staff are located.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/11">We must also recognise that significant changes have taken place in the way in which taxpayers choose to communicate with the department. Such communication is increasingly done by telephone or by the internet, and e-filing is becoming more and more common. The amount of letter processing and manual processing is inevitably decreasing, so it is right to consider how operations can be run efficiently. Some work is best done in concentrated areas and larger units where the processes can be more streamlined; in other areas, smaller units or a more mobile work force is seen as the best solution. The final outcome must balance staff, the local area, efficiency and the best service for taxpayers, which is what I am trying to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/12">HMRC's efficiency savings are ahead of the projections, and the department has already reduced by 9,000 posts through a combination of natural wastage and voluntary early retirement. I am trying to balance all the issues that my hon. Friend has rightly raised, but I want to be clear about an extremely important point that she has referred to. I must emphasise that when there is face-to-face contact with taxpayers through inquiry centres, those centres will stay. They are protected, so public inquiry facilities will stay, regardless of other considerations. I shall give an example, which is not the case in Chesterfield, of a recent inquiry centre in a building on which the lease came to an end and from which the landlord required us to leave. The department then found another location in the same town to replace the service like for like. There is absolutely no question of taxpayers losing the access that they now have to contact with the department.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/13">The decisions are difficult, and the work that my hon. Friend has undertaken, and the assiduous way in which she put the case and gave the pros and cons of the debate, is an example to other MPs of how actively she has pursued it. She is offering a solution, but I cannot comment on whether that solution is necessary. I certainly cannot reply to her today, because I am sure that she would expect me properly to reflect on all the points that have been made in all the contributions to the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/14">I feel a little torn. My hon. Friend has made a powerful case, but it may not need to be made. We shall see, but I want to make it absolutely clear that I have not made a decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.251.1/1">My hon. Friend is spot on. Roger Tym and Partners conducted an independent study that put the cost of new infrastructure and public services in Aylesbury alone at &pound;768 million. Although I welcome the Government's contributions, such as &pound;6 million to help fund the new Aston Clinton business park, such relatively small contributions must be seen in the context of that much greater bill. Of course we should look for developer contributions, too, but I fear that the Government are expecting too much out of that pot. Is it realistic to assume, as the Government sometimes appear to, that developers will subsidise roads, railways, GP's surgeries, schools and parks, as well as pay for the cost of social housing into the bargain? I see no evidence that the sums of money needed will be forthcoming from that source, whether under section 106 agreements or the proposed planning gain supplement.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/2">It is not just in transport that we have infrastructure problems. There are difficulties, too, with electricity and water. I should like to make a plea for the Minister's Department to talk to other parts of the Government about a more joined-up approach. Demand for electricity is projected to start outstripping existing capacity by about 2012. The problem can be solved. However, as the electricity supplier to Aylesbury, EDF Energy, said in a paper presented to the South East England regional assembly in September last year:</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/3" class="indent">&quot;the regulatory framework discourages or precludes the utility from investing speculatively in anticipation of future growth. The inability of utilities to carry out advance provision of services is...a barrier to delivery of planned levels of growth.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/4">Thames Water has made a similar complaint, saying that the capacity in the existing sewer network in Aylesbury is extremely limited. Indeed, current growth of water consumption and the impact of infill development has already led to some controversial proposals for the upgrading of the sewerage system in the Bedgrove area. However, looking to the future and the Government's housing plans, Thames Water has said that the expansion of Aylesbury sewage treatment works is critical to accommodating the growth at Aylesbury and that the &quot;costs will be significant&quot;. There is no provision in the current quinquennial round approved by Ofwat for investment in water. If the Government want the new houses built, it is essential to ensure that those new homes and businesses are provided with a proper electricity supply and proper water and sewerage services. I have yet to see any clear evidence that that joined-up thinking is taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/5">Finally, I should like to touch briefly on public services. I shall confine myself to the NHS, largely because we have some evidence on which to assess what is now happening. Just over two years ago, the NHS trusts and PCTs in the Milton Keynes and south midlands area commissioned a study from Hedra consultants about the impact of planned growth on the demand for health and social services provision. That report was published in March 2005. Hedra predicted on current trends that Aylesbury vale as a whole would need 489 acute hospital beds by 2031 or 142 additional beds, provided that there were major changes in the configuration of services in order to provide extra community care beds, more day surgery and more domiciliary support for patients discharged to be looked after and supported in their own homes. The same study predicted on the basis of the Government's housing targets that Aylesbury vale would need 84 more community beds and 56 more community day places, and the capacity to make 100,000 more accident and emergency visits, 3,000 more 999 calls to the ambulance service, 1,100 more first contacts with a district nurse and more than 200,000 more GP consultations by the end of the growth period.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/6">However, the reality is that the NHS in Buckinghamshire is not planning for growth. The Buckinghamshire PCT is in a desperate struggle to contain its deficit. The very community services that the expert study said had to be developed and improved are now being squeezed and cut, largely because they are not subject to a Department of Health target. There is an issue for the Department for Communities and Local Government to take up with the Department of Health, which does not seem to share the Minister's priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/7">There is a further problem. As new residents move in, NHS capitation payments to the Buckinghamshire PCT will inevitably increase. However, as the Hedra report said, it is essential to ensure that services can be provided in parallel to population growth, rather than lagging behind it. That means early agreement on land, capital and revenue requirements, but at the moment that is simply not happening. If anything, the reverse is true. My local GPs tells me that even when local residents move into an area, under the Department of Health's so-called normalisation procedure, it can take as long as 18 months before the extra money finds its way to the primary care trust and through to the GP practice. That is a year and a half during which there is additional demand for health care, yet the capitation payment that is supposed to fund it is not made. I hope that the Minister will take that up. Indeed, I have read speculation in the press over the past few days about the Minister being the next Secretary of State for Health, so&mdash;who knows?&mdash;perhaps the advice that I am giving her will be especially constructive and helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/8">I conclude with this comment. It is in the interests of all my constituents that, if the Government's policy of growth is to be implemented, it should be implemented in a way that makes present and future residents of Aylesbury confident that they live in a community that is both dynamic and sustainable. To do that, we need greater evidence of Government strategic planning and more co-ordination between different agencies and Departments in Whitehall than I believe is yet happening.</p>
