<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-16a.251.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1962" speakername="Brian H Donohoe" colnum="251"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091216/halltext/91216h0001.htm#09121668000520">
	<p pid="a.251.1/1">No, the independent case examiner obviously will not be overruled on the conditions that are put to them, but it is possible that after the event situations will change so that we are back to square one. I have had such cases, and that is a problem. One would think that, once the independent case examiner had made what they thought was a ruling, that would stay for ever more; but the case can be revisited and altered, which does not seem particularly fair.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/2">The fourth case is that of Tom Tait, who has worked diligently all his life. His company went into administration, and during the course of his employment his wages were arrested. He was paying and has proof of the fact-the wage slips are there for all to see. Money was taken from him, the company went into administration and the CSA told him that the employer had never written a cheque to it. He is being held responsible and has to pay the arrears, so we are told.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/3">There is something absolutely, ridiculously wrong with the system if that is the case. The man is paying for one of his sons, who is 19 years old. He has shown his pay slips to the CSA. The son is an apprentice in a local factory, yet because he serves some of his apprenticeship in full-time education, the father has been told that he still has to pay for him. That individual's case must be looked at much more closely. He feels aggrieved about his position, as he has every entitlement to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/4">We move to the fifth case, that of Paul McKendrick. He is not in the highest-paid job. He has been paying &#163;30 a week, but arrears have accumulated, which means that the calculation has been worked out at &#163;33. However, he cannot afford to pay any more, so his arrears are running up and nobody seems to want to do anything. He has all kinds of pay slips to show what his salary is, but nobody is taking into account his real circumstances. He states:</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/5" class="indent">&quot;They constantly come back to us saying there is nothing more they can do because they ARE applying the rules set by the Government!&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/6">The CSA is blaming the Government as an escape route. That means that when I am sitting with Mr. McKendrick, he is blaming me. If the Government cannot look at these cases as they should, set better parameters and apply a bit of common sense, the position will continue to be difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/7">The final case I have this morning is that of Steven Mallinson, who is also a policeman. The latest letter that I received from him is dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-11">11 November</phrase> and is worth reading to give a flavour of his problem:</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/8" class="indent">&quot;To get straight to the point, yes I still remain unhappy and I would like you to continue with your efforts to contact somebody within the CSA who is in a position to do something about my problem. I believe this may be Janis Crook, Client Services Director? Failing that I believe there is still an option to involve an independent party to look at my case.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/9" class="indent">Unfortunately the people I have dealt with so far seem content to hide behind unfathomable formulae and appear to be using &quot;new&quot; legislation to justify incompetency in instances when &quot;old&quot; legislation applies. My main example of this would be that my travel to work costs were not considered when a re-assessment was carried out in February using the old legislation however when I queried this I was palmed off and told that under the new legislation (which my case is now on) travelling to work costs are not considered. This is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/10" class="indent">Once again I find I am repeating myself and nobody appears to be listening. The main issue is the re-assessment carried out in February using the old legislation. There does not seem to be alarm bells ringing anywhere that up until this date I was paying &#163;52 per month on the old legislation and from June 2009 it was calculated I should pay &#163;150 per month on the new legislation, yet in a short space in between, in February 2009 it has been calculated that I should have been paying &#163;650 per month (effective from April 2009, so in reality only for two months) and the knock on effect this calculation has had is that I am now paying &#163;500 per month in a &quot;phasing period&quot; for the next year at least. There needs to be some common sense applied here and I need somebody who is in a position to apply common sense, and not hide behind an obviously flawed calculation system, to look at my case.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/11" class="indent">Again I raise the point that this phasing period exists so as there is not a financial impact on the resident parent when changing from the old legislation to the new legislation. Again I highlight that I was paying &#163;52 per month from May 2005 until March 2009. I paid &#163;105 per month from April 2009 until June 2009. I paid &#163;152 at the start of July 2009. Again I raise the question, how could&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/12">let us call her Miss X-</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/13" class="indent">&quot;possibly experience any financial impact given the trend of the aforementioned amounts that would result in her requiring &#163;500 per month? There was no negative financial impact on her. There has, however, been a huge financial impact on myself going from the stated monthly sums to the now ridiculous &#163;500 per month. When I raise this point nobody at the CSA seems to be able to apply common sense and realise how valid a point I have here and instead reply as they always do by spouting confusing figures and formulae in the hope I will just disappear and accept this nonsense. I am not an idiot and I will not accept this. If you contact the CSA they will confirm the above stated reason for the &quot;phasing period&quot; and they will also confirm the payments I have made up until July 2009. I would ask that you do that and I would ask that you question how they can justify taking &#163;500 per month from me.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/14" class="indent">The agency is named the CHILD support agency.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/15">Again, let us call her Miss X,</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/16" class="indent">&quot;is now splashing out on pedigree pets, luxury holidays and full Sky television packages. I can no longer afford to take my children to the cinema or the zoo or ten pin bowling without having to rely on hand outs from my parents. How is that in the best interest of either of my children?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/17">Mr. Mallinson then asks how he is supposed to support his children in such circumstances. That is a typical letter from a parent who is at their wits' end.</p>

	<p pid="a.255.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1962" name="Brian H Donohoe">the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Donohoe)</phrase> on securing the debate and I thank him.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/2">I should briefly like to outline for the Minister an issue involving a constituent of mine who has been shown to be infertile, but is still being chased by the CSA even though it has now dropped the main case against him. I cannot name the man because in the community I am from, which he is also from, he is probably known by about 80 to 90 per cent. of the people. Also, the grown-up child and the grandmother in question do not know about the non-paternity. Mentioning his name would effectively shatter lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/3">I have been in correspondence with the Minister on the main point, and the outline is as follows. In 2001 the Child Support Agency started requesting maintenance from my constituent. In early 2002 he denied paternity, but because he had signed the birth certificate the CSA decided that he was the father. Despite his denying his paternity the CSA started to charge him some &#163;73 a week as well as a penalty. In 2006 his maintenance charges were adjusted and levelled out to about &#163;127.60 a week. He did not pay maintenance to the CSA and it then placed a bill of inhibition on him and attempted to freeze his bank accounts. Over the period 2006-09, maintenance charges were at about &#163;27,000 and the CSA attempted to have him incarcerated. However, he produced a doctor's letter in court stating that he was infertile. Two leading figures in the British Medical Association in Scotland have been supporting and helping him, and the letter they produced put the arrest warrant on hold.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/4">In February, the mother of the child was asked to produce DNA samples from herself and the child to prove paternity. She refused. My constituent then began a process of declaration of non-parentage in court. In August, the mother declared that she did not want payment of arrears, and the CSA dropped the case, but it is still pursuing my constituent for &#163;2,400 in fees. The bill of inhibition still stands against him, so he cannot sell any property to pay off the debt. I met him in October, having met him many times previously. His house was under threat of repossession, and in November he was denied legal aid for declaration of non-parentage. The process has been long and difficult for him, and I shall give an idea of how long it has been. The former Prime Minister was in power, the Afghan war had not started, and Saddam Hussein was in charge of Iraq. That is a long period in someone's life, and a number of questions arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/5">Why did the CSA not go after the mother who made the claim against my constituent? Why is he being made to repay some funds? Where is the apology after 10 years of persecution? Where is the compensation from the CSA? His house was nearly foreclosed, his social life was destroyed because it is difficult in his community to lead a normal life with the stigma hanging over his head, and his career has been severely hampered. The CSA has effectively walked away from the case, but not without trying to charge him &#163;2,400. Why is it charging him when it was found that he could not possibly have been the father? The fundamental point is that he is infertile, and has been declared so by eminent doctors, but his life has been turned upside down by the CSA. i have seen him in harrowing circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/6">i have been in correspondence with the Minister, her predecessors, and a number of people at the csa. i plead with her to get the case sorted as best she can, so that someone who has lost a decade of his life because of the difficulties in the CSA can get it back on track.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-16a.261.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" speakername="Andrew Selous" colnum="261"  time="010:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091216/halltext/91216h0003.htm#09121668000531">
	<p pid="a.261.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is correct. Now that there are voluntary arrangements and we have repealed section 6 of the 1991 Act, people do not have to come within the CSA's net. I was trying to make a slightly broader point and saying that if we look across society as a whole-not just at the CSA cases and the voluntary arrangement cases, but at those cases in which neither applies-we see that there is unfortunately a clear majority of cases in which parents split up and no money is moving. That worries me and we need to bear it in mind. Polly Toynbee was right to draw attention to it earlier this year. Indeed, when Sir David Henshaw produced his excellent report in 2006, he said that in only 30 per cent. of cases was some maintenance paid. I think that the figure has improved slightly, but we need to be aware of the broader picture.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/2">I want better co-operation between Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs-the Inland Revenue, as we used to know it-and the CSA. I agree with the comment that many parents feel that they are forced to act as private detectives to establish the non-resident parent's income. Will the Minister tell us what further co-operation is in the pipeline between HMRC and the CSA? That was one of the best things that we put in the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008. It should have happened long ago, but I am not convinced that we are yet reaping the full benefit in data transfer and tracking all income available to non-resident parents to make the CSA as effective as it could be.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/3">I shall refer briefly to the case of one of my constituents, who is also calling for greater co-operation between HMRC and the CSA. Her ex-partner signed on as unemployed. She says that when Mr. X signed on earlier this year,</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/4" class="indent">&quot;it should have been quite simple to take the measly &#163;5 a week from his benefit but still all I have received since April is... &#163;10 or &#163;15... this system is quite simply failing children. My children go without because of this terrible situation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/5">She says that all she wants is</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/6" class="indent">&quot;justice for my children who have... holes in their... shoes... until I can afford to get some more!&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/7">She goes on to say that she is convinced that her ex-partner is working, even though he is signing on. She has pretty good evidence of that and is extremely frustrated that that information does not seem to have been captured and taken forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/8">This is just a practical point. I would like to know from the Minister why e-mail communication with the CSA is not now an option. That point was raised with me by Families Need Fathers, whose representatives I met on Monday. As they put it to me, e-mail communication would save considerable time, money and anger, not least when assessments are sent to old addresses, resulting sometimes in huge child maintenance liabilities arising without the non-resident parent's knowledge. May we please move into the 21st century and ensure that e-mail communication can happen between the agency and parents with care and non-resident parents? That would be practical and helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/9">We need strong and robust enforcement powers in the CSA. For many years during the previous Parliament, I used to question DWP Ministers about the number of driving licences that had been taken away. I think that, although the agency had the powers, only two licences had been taken away. However, the effect of threatening to take such action can be beneficial. I understand from the helpful House of Commons Library debate briefing pack that, in the state of Maine in the USA, $89 million was collected through threatening to remove driving licences and that, in Australia, an extra 11 million Australian dollars was raised through threatening to stop non-payers travelling abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/10">I do not want anyone's driving licence or passport to be taken away, but if the threat of that is effective when all other options have failed, those are tools that, sadly, the CSA needs in its armoury-there must be consequences. Child support matters. Children's lives and futures are at stake, and we will not meet our child poverty targets unless we have a CSA that works.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/11">The system needs to be fair, however. Fairness to non-resident parents-fairness to, in the main, fathers-is critical to a well functioning CSA that has broad public support. A couple of practical issues worry me in that regard. One is the fact that liability orders are not stayed if the application is appealed. We need a quick and fair appeal system so that cases are not held up indefinitely, but it seems to go against natural justice that the liability order keeps on going if there is an appeal. That should be looked into quickly and fairly, and an adjudication made fast.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/12">It also seems odd that non-resident parents should have to pay the costs of challenging the use of administrative powers even if they have been wrongly used. There was provision in the 2008 Act; I remember debating that point when it went through the House. I have a great deal of sympathy for the case raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2004" name="Angus MacNeil">the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr. MacNeil)</phrase>, in respect of the &#163;2,400 that his constituent has been asked for when he never could have been a father. It is worrying that in such cases the mother has the right to refuse a DNA test. What if his constituent had not been proved to be infertile? Would those liability assessments have gone on piling up if the mother could refuse a DNA test? We have the technology to decide these things decisively now. That issue worries me as well and possibly needs to be examined.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/13">I am concerned about the 25 per cent. variation of income figure that was mentioned when we were putting the 2008 Act on the statute book. Will the Minister confirm whether the Department still has that figure in mind?</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/14">I think that cases will soon be hitting the press of people who have lost their jobs and who are now on benefit, but whose maintenance liability has not been reduced, because the fall in their income was just below the CSA's 25 per cent. variation figure. I appreciate that the CSA went for such a high figure because it was so scarred by the amount of work caused by very minor variations. However, as it gains in confidence and its systems become more robust, the 25 per cent. figure will need to change. If someone's income drops by 24 per cent., should they really go on paying maintenance at the level at which they were first assessed? That seems to go against natural justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/15">I want briefly to mention the one-year rule, which I thought the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire would bring up. It is a concern that parties who have happily and voluntarily gone to court to produce flexible arrangements that suit them to deal with their assets and income can see those arrangements unwound within a year, to the detriment of either the parent with care or the non-resident parent. All parties raised that issue when the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill went through the House, and it is a bit of unfinished business, so I leave it on the Minister's radar screen.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/16">Child maintenance arrears, or the debt as they are commonly known, have recently come down slightly, which is excellent-let us give credit where it is due. They are now just under &#163;3.8 billion, although that is a slightly fictitious figure because a lot of the assessments were not really accurate. Furthermore, about half that sum is owed to the Secretary of State, rather than to parents with care. However, it matters that we collect those arrears.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/17">It also matters that we collect arrears where the children are over 18, and I am a bit concerned that the focus seems to have been on collecting debt only where the children are under 18. If someone has been deprived throughout their childhood, the fact that they can get a lump sum when they are 19 or 20-perhaps to help them to go through college or university or to get a small deposit on a house-is important, and we must not forget that.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/18">I recently visited a CSA office and talked to some of the staff, who work extremely hard in difficult circumstances, as was said earlier. I heard of the joy that someone who has got nothing for years feels when a cheque for &#163;15,000 or &#163;20,000 comes through. The difference that that can make to a young person's life is phenomenal. These things matter. Ideally, we want the income to be there as people go through their childhood, but if they have not had that income, we must not give up on the collectable debt. If the non-resident parent has assets, I would support the CSA in going after those assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/19">On the debt, I am worried that up-to-date information has not been published. Gingerbread has pressed for the publication of client fund accounts throughout October, November and December. It worries me that there is no official published deadline. Many Government figures come out at set times of the year; indeed, the unemployment figures came out at 9.30 this morning. The DWP cannot say, &quot;Sorry, we don't feel like doing them this month. We'll do them next month.&quot; That is simply not good enough. We need the figures to come out regularly, because lobby groups such as Gingerbread study them carefully. Maintenance arrears matter, and we must make sure that we do not lose sight of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/20">As the CSA grows in confidence, I hope that it will take a leaf out of the Australian CSA's book by trying to ensure that the relationship between separated parents is as good as it can be. I say that because there is evidence that if the relationship is better, rather than worse, more money is likely to flow. I understand why the CSA has been wary of going down that route, but I hope that it will look at the issue as it gains in confidence. I have with me two booklets from the Australian CSA called &quot;Me and my Kids-Parenting from a distance&quot; and &quot;Me, my Kids and my Ex-Forming a workable relationship for the benefit of your children&quot;. The Australian CSA produces those because it recognises that if we can make relationships better, make contact amicable and help with parenting from a distance, more money is likely to flow. That is also better for children. I therefore commend that approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/21">Finally, I share the concerns raised by the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire. It will be five years before we get the gross-income scheme. We passed the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act in 2008, and it will be five years-2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013-before we get to 2014 and one gross-income scheme. We all back the scheme, because it is simpler and easier. It will also net the self-employed and take in rental and dividend income. It is scandalous that the original legislation did not include such income-I do not know what MPs were doing when we passed it. That was wrong, because all income should be included. Why have these changes taken so long? Five years seems a very long time. We have seen the differences between the old scheme, the new scheme and the future scheme, so let us move ahead as quickly as we can.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-16a.268.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="268"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091216/halltext/91216h0004.htm#09121668000541">
	<p pid="a.268.1/1">I am pleased to see you in the Chair, Mr. Cook, presiding over a debate on a subject that is highly important to all our constituents. It is good that the Minister responding to the debate is my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1910" name="Mike O'Brien">the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase>, who is my constituency neighbour to the south-west.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/2">If we look at the Government's policy on the NHS since 1997, we can see that a welter of statistics confirm the excellent and vital progress that has been made in many areas. For example, we have over 44,000 more doctors and almost 90,000 more nurses, and 3 million more operations are carried out each year than in 1997, with the number of heart operations more than doubling. Net public spending on the NHS has nearly tripled since 1997. Then it was &#163;35 billion; it is now more than &#163;90 billion. Waiting times are at the lowest level in NHS history.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/3">The risk, however, is that the effectiveness and durability of those fantastic achievements may be undermined by an obsession with organisational and administrative reform of the NHS. In the view of many NHS workers, of patients and indeed of Members of Parliament and community representatives, the commercial mantra of choice is being used as a cloak for the marketisation and privatisation of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/4">At the Brighton Labour party conference in September, the Secretary of State for Health said:</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/5" class="indent">&quot;I cannot see why families shouldn't register with the GP practice that suits them best. So, I've said we'll abolish GP practice boundaries within a year.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/6">That did not exactly come out of the blue, but it caused a great deal of concern among GPs in my constituency and elsewhere. Even those GPs who saw some benefits from that rather rushed reform, such as Dr. Theresa Eynon of the Hugglescote surgery, were quick to express to me their fear that abolishing GP practice boundaries could worsen the plight of those patients most vulnerable to serious long-term health problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/7">The Government's plans provide further proof that the inverse care law is alive and well. As the Minister will know, the idea was first proposed by Julian Tudor Hart in 1971. His law states that the availability of good medical care tends to vary inversely to the need for it in the population that it serves. Put simply, those who need health care services the least use them more, and more effectively, than those with the most need.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/8">That is not to say that there is anything inherently wrong with allowing people to register with a GP practice closer to their workplace, thus enabling easier access to the surgery during the working week. Of course there is nothing wrong with wanting to offer more convenient NHS primary care, although I would quietly suggest that employers could be more flexible in allowing their employees to attend GP appointments; the wheels would not come off the local or national economy if such flexibility were more readily available.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/9">If that was what was being proposed, I would not argue with it, and would not be debating the matter today, but that is not the full story. The Minister said in a speech to the Royal College of General Practitioners conference last month:</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/10" class="indent">&quot;The focus has to be on responding to the needs of patients...Enabling people to choose a different practice near home. Or one near to where they work. Or one with better overall quality scores and patient satisfaction but in a different location altogether.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/11">That confirms that the Government's intentions are much more fundamental than an improvement to GP accessibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/12">The proposal is more to do with the promotion of competition among GP services, supplemented by initiatives such as NHS Choices that utilise the information gleaned from the quality and outcomes framework to give the public somewhat simplistic statistics on GP practice performance. Crucially, given all the academic talk of quality and values, is the future of the truly local services that GPs provide, particularly the invaluable home visits that they make to the homes of the long-term sick, the immobile and the terminally ill.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/13">In the rush, in the words of the Health Secretary, to turn the NHS from &quot;good to great&quot;, the Government risk ignoring the needs of that most vulnerable group of patients. I note parenthetically that the next debate in this Chamber is about age discrimination in health care. I shall read the <i>Hansard</i> report of that debate with great interest. The proposed reform does not seek to end home visits, but there is a very real risk that the needs of our fellow citizens with the most complex health problems will be put in direct competition with the health-care requirements of the more affluent workers and families. Each will have a QOF score, but there are no prizes for guessing who attracts the most points and, therefore, funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/14">I regret to say that the potential of the change to worsen health inequalities goes even deeper than that. Those with the most complex health needs, particularly psychiatric ones, rely on social services that are geographically tied to the local authority. It does not take much imagination to realise that the consequences of abolishing GP practice boundaries may include an increase in the administrative complexity and cost of providing appropriate care packages for all who need them. Dementia patients living at home will be particularly vulnerable to instability and uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/15">All Labour Members hope that the Personal Care at Home Bill, which received its Second Reading this week, and the national care service will together ride to the rescue of all those with social care needs, but a period of uncertainty could result from the abolition of GP practice boundaries. I urge the Government and the Minister to think again, on these grounds alone. I should be most grateful if the Minister made a specific response about the impact of the reform on social care provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/16">I turn to the intellectual threads of this reform. The spiritual leader of private health care in the NHS and former Health Secretary, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1527" name="Alan Milburn">the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn)</phrase>, has rightly stated on numerous occasions that the health gap between rich and poor has grown inexorably since the creation of the NHS. However, that inescapable conclusion has little to do with structural failings within the NHS, as he would be quick to assert; it has more to do with the wealth of a small number of individuals and the private companies that respond to their every ailment, whether cosmetic or chronic.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/17">It goes without saying that widening health inequality is a national concern, and I am pleased that the Government have commissioned Professor Sir Michael Marmot of University College London to consider how we could tackle health inequalities more effectively. We should all look closely at his findings and recommendations, and I hope that we will have an opportunity to debate them in the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/18">Men and women in our poorest communities are dying on average a decade or more before those of their generation in the most affluent areas. Putting it at its mildest, that is deeply troubling. However, that is due as much to the increased and inherent politicisation of this totemic institution since the 1980s. That culminated in the Labour Government putting up the money-but rarely the arguments-for maintaining the NHS wholly within the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/19">With the abolition of practice boundaries, we will undoubtedly increase competition within the NHS. That will be especially so in urban areas, as GP practices have to compete for patients with NHS walk-in centres and one-stop primary care centres-the polyclinics championed in the Darzi review. That will merely distract the NHS from tackling health inequalities, as consistent and lengthy patient records will become more difficult to compile.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/20">As someone with three decades in public sector IT, it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge that computer systems have a role to play in solving the problem, but the less said about the benighted NHS agency Connecting for Health the better. There is little doubt in my mind, however, that we would have had greater success in tackling health inequalities since 1997 if we had trusted and promoted the efficiency of the public sector over that of the private sector and its unseen and unaccountable backers and exploiters.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/21">I mentioned the Darzi Review a moment ago. We are all familiar with its aim of putting quality at the heart of the NHS. Who could disagree with that? I certainly would not, although I would question the use of other commercially-loaded terms by a senior Government appointee, who is supposed to be a clinical health specialist and not a management guru. Those phrases are more likely to come out of the mouth of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne)</phrase>, than one of our most successful and respected surgeons.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/22">However, when my right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington was Health Secretary, he said in a speech to the Commonwealth Fund in Washington 2002 that</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/23" class="indent">&quot;health care works best...when it harnesses the commitment and knowledge of clinicians to improve care for patients.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/24">Private health insurer Kaiser Permanente of the US is cited as an example of that health care harmony, but I shall resist the temptation to be lured down that profitable but politically promiscuous avenue.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/25">The Darzi review is the foundation for these troubling proposals in primary care, with a specific quote from Lord Darzi's summary letter in &quot;High Quality Care for All&quot; establishing the foundation upon which the Secretary of State decided to proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/26">Lord Darzi said:</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/27" class="indent">&quot;Patients will have greater choice of GP practice and better information to help them choose.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/28">That raises the role of primary care trusts in designing and commissioning local primary care services, as they also have a vital role to play in the democratisation of health care. By that I mean involving patients in the decisions that most affect their health, which is a welcome development. Leicestershire County and Rutland PCT seems to be going out of its way to illustrate to patients the worst excesses of the catchment area system that currently operates. For example, patients registered at Whitwick surgery who lived four miles or so away in Hugglescote were told by the PCT that they would have to leave that practice and re-register at Hugglescote. That was immensely distressing to the patients concerned, particularly pensioners who had built up a good relationship with the GPs at Whitwick over a number of years.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/29">At this point, it is worth quoting Dr. Orest Mulka of the Measham medical unit. He is a highly respected GP at a well-regarded surgery in my constituency, and he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/30" class="indent">&quot;Of course boundaries can be misused...but boundaries aren't just for the management of GP workload. They are there to allow a practice to identify with a community and see the health of their community as more than just the sum of individual conditions that are brought to them. They allow practices to develop a sense of pride of caring for their patch.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/31">I repeat:</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/32" class="indent">&quot;They allow practices to develop a sense of pride of caring for their patch.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/33">He went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/34" class="indent">&quot; In my practice we don't discriminate-anyone living in our area is accepted on our list.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/35">I shall use Dr. Mulka's comments as evidence against the Government's claim that abolishing practice boundaries will increase local accountability. If a patient is not a member of the local community, their needs may well be at odds and even in competition with those who live closest and who may have greater clinical need.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/36">Whatever the number of patient participation groups, welcome though they are, they cannot hope to replace that local link. That reminds us of the consumer-led nature of the Government's proposal, which has been described as a move toward a &quot;medical supermarket&quot; where increasing numbers of patients are routinely seen, not by GPs, doctors or nurses, but by &quot;health care professionals&quot; such as &quot;nurse consultants&quot;. We are some way from such dystopian scenarios, but the Government's obsessive delivery of pro-private policies in the NHS inevitably leads in that direction. Many people see the death knell of a publicly resourced and run NHS in proposals such as abolishing GP practice boundaries; creating polyclinics; making PCTs commissioners rather than providers of health care; encouraging NHS hospitals trusts to apply for foundation status; local improvement finance trusts; and-do not get me going on this-private finance initiatives. Moreover, there are other inappropriate and unnecessary market devices.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/37">Such reforms are the logical conclusion to the brave new world of health care partnerships piloted by my right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington when he was Health Secretary. The frequent speeches made during his tenure in Richmond house seemed intent on sending a chill down the spine of GPs and patients and included such baleful gems as the following examples. He said that</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/38" class="indent">&quot;tax funded health care can only be sustainable if it sits side by side with diversity in provision and choice for patients.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/39">What he meant is that it is sustainable only when the local commissioning arrangements allow and indeed favour private sector bids for NHS work. He also talked about</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/40" class="indent">&quot;new private sector providers becoming a permanent feature of the NHS landscape.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/41">Finally, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/42" class="indent">&quot;The NHS scores well on fairness but is weak on choice.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/43">Those quotes are all from the same 2002 speech, but seem more akin to a sales pitch than a policy debate. Let us not forget that from 2001 to 2004 our former Prime Minister and right hon. Friend, Tony Blair, was advised on the NHS by Simon Stevens, who promptly joined the US firm UnitedHealth Group, which made $78.85 billion from health care services in 2008, after leaving the Downing street policy unit. By way of a footnote, let me say that at the same time as vehemently opposing President Obama's modest health care reforms in the US, UnitedHealth, with Simon Stevens on board, is bidding for and winning NHS contracts, and will no doubt regard the abolition of GP practice boundaries as welcome &quot;mood music&quot; at the very least.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/44">To return to the local impact of the Government's plan, Dr. Eynon has concluded that, once again, the change is one that suits the well, working person. That brings to mind the inverse care law that I cited at the start of my speech. We must not shape our primary care system around the needs of the middle-class, peripatetic, urban elite who go to their local paper and MP every time they cannot get an appointment to treat their squash injury, as we should not normalise or accommodate the social and environmental impact of fundamentally selfish lifestyles.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/45">By 2018, when the NHS reaches its biblical span of three score years and 10, we shall have seen GPs metamorphose from the avuncular community leaders of &quot;Dr. Finlay's Casebook&quot; to profit-generating assets in a Dr. Foster's cost centre. The NHS was not created to serve a minority who shout loud enough to see a doctor whenever they want, wherever they are. This proposal is designed to satisfy the few, not the many. To abolish practice boundaries is to hasten the demise of the family doctor.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-16a.277.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="277"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091216/halltext/91216h0005.htm#09121668000545">
	<p pid="a.277.2/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to address this important issue on the day on which we rise for the Christmas recess. One curious thing about the lottery process for Adjournment debates is that one can apply assiduously for a topic for many a week, then find that one has the pleasure of securing it on the last day before we adjourn for Christmas. I am sure that we can therefore look forward to a quality debate but not a quantitatively long one.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/2">Many aspects of health care give rise to concerns about how age is used as a proxy to determine-or, in some cases, deny-access to health care, even when the evidence does not support such practices. There is plenty of evidence that age discrimination takes place in cancer and stroke care, cardiology, foot care and continence and palliative care. Rather than going through the evidence for discrimination relating to each of those conditions, I will focus on one area that demands urgent attention-mental health.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/3">After reviewing the literature and evidence, it is hard not to reach the conclusion that the national health service is institutionally ageist. That is certainly the view of doctors specialising in the care of older people, so I welcomed the Secretary of State's admission in October that age discrimination is still commonplace in health care a decade after the national service framework for older people was meant to have banned age bars and age discrimination across the NHS. It is clear that relative to mental health services for people of working age, the mental health services available to older people have got worse. I stress the word &quot;relative&quot; because there have been clear improvements in some aspects of mental health care for working-age people.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/4">I recently hosted a reception in the House on behalf of the Royal College of Psychiatrists to highlight its call to action at a local level and on the part of individual clinicians. I am grateful to the Royal College for providing me with a briefing for this debate. If we took what we know from the published research and applied it to a typical group of 10,000 people over 64, this what we would find: 2,500 would have a diagnosable mental illness. Of those, 1,350 would have depression, 500 would have dementia and 650 would have other mental illnesses. Most of those people would go undiagnosed and untreated. According to the King's Fund, older people are the only part of the population in which the number of people with mental illness will increase by 2026. If nothing else, we are required to address that demographic demand. A concerted response from Government and the NHS at all levels is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/5">Inevitably, debates such as this-I am sure that the Minister has experienced this on many occasions-turn on what is wrong and needs to be put right rather than dwelling on what is good and wonderful. I make no apology for that, as I hope that he understands that this debate is about raising concerns. I accept that the present Government have not been idle. National service frameworks, New Horizons, psychological therapies and the national dementia strategy are just a few of the initiatives that they have taken. However, I am concerned that insufficient attention has been paid to the mental health needs of older people. That lack of attention is not just harmful to the individuals concerned; it wastes taxpayers' money on late and inappropriate interventions and treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/6">To illustrate, in a typical 500-bed district hospital, an average of 330 beds are occupied by older people, 220 of whom have a mental illness. A shortage of trained staff and age-appropriate services mean that those patients remain in hospital for longer and are more likely to be readmitted as emergencies later. The Government have focused on dementia, with good reason; I have no objection whatever to that. The national strategy is welcome, as was the recent announcement on anti-psychotic drugs. I thank the Minister for getting in touch with me on the day of that announcement. However, a much broader approach to the development of age-appropriate mental health services is required in order to drive change.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/7">The World Health Organisation forecasts that depression will be the second biggest contributor to health costs by 2020, just 10 years from now. The rate of depression is set to rise by 30 per cent. among over-75s, and by 80 per cent. among over-85s by 2026, just 16 years from now. Depression is three times more common than dementia and it increases with age, with the poorest most at risk. It is linked to a greater reduction in health than any other long-term condition, and it leads to a sharper decline in overall health when combined with any other long-term condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/8">Nevertheless, just one in six older people with depression receives any treatment, compared with one in two younger people with depression. It is a major risk factor for suicide and the cause of 80 per cent. of suicides. Although it is good news that the suicide rate has fallen in the past decade, it has not changed among older people. As a result, the suicide rate in people over 65 is double that of people under 25. Research evidence also shows that older people with mental illness stay in hospital longer and are more likely to die in hospital or to lose their independence and be discharged to a care home.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.0/1">I am well aware that St. Nicholas will be rushing down chimneys across the country in the coming week. He was born in 270 A.D. and is still going strong, so he should be a model for us all as we head into mature age. I have also discovered that the etymology of Nicholas is &quot;victory of the people&quot;-it may sound amazing, but it is-so it seems fitting to invoke him here in the mother of Parliaments. Whether he is a redistributive socialist or a right-wing philanthropist is a debate for another time, I suspect, however much hon. Members might encourage me to stray from our subject. All that allows me to wish you, Mr. Cook, the Minister and the hon. Members for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) and for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland) a very merry Christmas.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.0/2">The issue we are discussing is serious and one on which it is our job to hold the Government to account. I hope that the Government's response will be redolent of the spirit of good will to all men, and all women, and not disproportionately to some who are not old. It is also right during our debate, in thinking about discrimination, age, health care and general well-being, that we remember that many people cannot look forward to Christmases as we do, because of poverty or loneliness in this country or due to war abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.0/3">However much we disagree in this place, we are all here with equal mandates to make a difference and, through our aspirations, in their diverse ways, to make this country, and indeed this world, a better place for all people of all ages. I congratulate the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam on securing the debate and giving the matter the airing it indubitably merits, and the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West on the reinforcement he provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.0/4">With the Equality Bill having received its Second Reading in the other place only yesterday, it seems apt to begin with the Government's pronouncements in that Bill on age discrimination. The Opposition have made it clear that we welcome the Government's inclusion of age discrimination in the debate surrounding the Bill. The Minister for Women and Equality asserted on Second Reading of the Bill in this place:</p>
	<p pid="a.284.0/5" class="indent">&quot;No one should suffer the indignity of discrimination-to be told, 'You're old, so you're past it'&quot;.-[Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-11">11 May 2009</phrase>; Vol. 492, c. 553.]</p>
	<p pid="a.284.0/6">Although she no doubt intended her words to apply primarily to the workplace, they highlight a chasm in the Government's thinking on age discrimination-the NHS and social services.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.0/7">Our social care system is still predicated on age banding, at 18 and-topically-at 65. Indeed, the Government are clutching somewhat desperately to the 65 cliff edge in their rapidly collapsing attempts to reform social care. Disability living allowance has been safeguarded for those under 65, but not for those over 65, under the recent pronouncements and the very words of the Secretary of State for Health. I say &quot;rapidly collapsing&quot; because last week the Secretary of State said, as we all heard, that there would be &quot;no cash losers&quot; among those currently receiving attendance allowance and disability living allowance. Given that the reforms in the Green Paper are based on the roll-up of such benefits into the funding package, presumably the Government are not planning to reform social care for those in receipt of those benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.0/8">Furthermore, the Government have given no pledge that people in the future who have needs similar to those who currently receive attendance allowance and disability living allowance will receive an equivalent cash benefit. That is why we continue to hold them to account over that issue. To pick up on the Prime Minister's pre-election report, we will soon be fighting an election to protect not only today's pensioners, but those of the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.0/9">The great irony is that if the Government had not played politics with the Green Paper; if they had been open and honest and published the full modelling that we and all the charities in the Care and Support Alliance called for in advance of the deadline for responses to the Green Paper consultation, but which was not forthcoming-I stress that point in case they reply that they have published something; and if the Prime Minister had not decided to run an election manifesto through the reform with his attempted but failed dividing lines, they might never have caused that confusion over the issue in the policy world, in charities and, above all, in the minds of older, and often vulnerable, people.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.0/10">The reforms of social care being debated by the Government have also failed to address carers and their benefits. Nothing has been done about the cliff edge that exists for carers who earn; I am focusing on the reference to age discrimination in the title of the debate. There is no ability set out in the reforms to smooth benefits to reward work. More pertinent to the debate is the Government's failure to instigate a discussion of the fact that carer's allowance stops at 65. Where will the equality legislation leave that issue? I hope the Minister clarifies that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-16a.286.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" speakername="Stephen O'Brien" colnum="286"  time="015:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091216/halltext/91216h0007.htm#09121668000553">
	<p pid="a.286.1/1">That is a fair request, so perhaps the Minister will take the opportunity to address it. It is particularly fair in the light of how the social care reform Green Paper has been transmuting and transforming itself over recent days, rather than over a planned period of years, or even weeks or months. It has undergone the most radical transformation of policy in the past few days, some would say on the hoof.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/2">The hon. Gentleman's point is fair, because the Government seem to be inconsonant with the timetable, which seems to be advancing rapidly on one side, but with the benefits not being addressed effectively and being postponed until 2018. The Minister will have the opportunity to respond to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/3">Only last month a report commissioned by the former Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1648" name="Alan Johnson">the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West and Hessle (Alan Johnson)</phrase>, found that elderly people frequently receive worse health care than their younger counterparts-a point that has already been referred to. It laid the serious charge that, in an institutional sense, the NHS discriminates against those people. That was covered fairly extensively in media reports at the end of October. Doctors identified patients over the age of 65 and suffering from mental illness as particularly prone to discrimination, as has been emphasised.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/4">I turn now to mental health. A Royal College of Psychiatrists report found that tens of thousands of people over 65 are being denied access to specialist mental health services because of the &quot;arbitrary&quot; age limits, which is precisely the point that has already been referred to. Mental health services have traditionally been configured by age, which means that someone aged 65 can receive a wide range of support through adult mental health services, but a person who is only one year older, regardless of their need, might be placed in an older people's service where the same support is simply not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/5">The over-65s are also denied access to a range of services available to younger adults, including psychological therapies, early intervention, and rehabilitation and addiction services. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam placed particular emphasis on that point. I should therefore emphasise equally the fact that I hope that the Minister will clarify the situation, particularly given that several interventions were made, which have been answered.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/6">The written answer that the hon. Gentleman received restates the Government's priorities, but omits mental health, which we thought was one of the three issues to have been promulgated as being of great importance over the past decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/7">The other question that has arisen relates to the priority that will be given to different areas. Will there be a reallocation of resources? Will there be any extra resources? The issue cropped up during our most recent proceedings on the Personal Care at Home Bill in our debate about the potential for an increase or a reduction in the cash available to dementia research, commensurate with the demographics. We would expect the research effort to match the curve of rising demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/8">I hope that the Minister explains what impact the Equality Bill will have. I hope, too, that he tells us what work his Department is doing to change cultures in our NHS. He will readily agree that the blunt weapon of legislation is simply not enough to bring about systemic change.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/9">Earlier this year, as a result of a large exercise involving written parliamentary questions and freedom of information requests, the shocking number of older people who suffer malnutrition in our NHS hospitals became clear to me, and I decided to expose it. The figures show that 70 per cent. of all malnutrition deaths occur among the elderly. The Minister will know that every year-certainly over the past 12 years-an average of 204 people have died of malnutrition. In 2006-07, the number of patients discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of malnutrition, nutritional anaemia or other nutritional deficiencies was 139,127-an 84 per cent. increase over 1997-98 levels. There was a 12 per cent. increase in the number of patients discharged from hospital in such a state in the last year alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/10">Such things matter because the number of patients leaving hospital with a diagnosis of malnutrition was 8,533 more than the number of people entering hospital in a malnourished state. That includes those who, unfortunately, went into hospital and, whatever their condition, died there, so the number is all the more worrying. The figures suggest that the nutritional status of at least that number of patients worsened while they were in hospital in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/11">Malnutrition is not a condition that we associate with Britain, and least of all with our NHS, but the Government have presided over that increase. My colleagues and I have exposed the figures, and we wait to see what the Government response will be to these malnutrition cases, particularly those among the elderly. Surely, such things can be avoided.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/12">The rise of malnutrition among the elderly points to underlying problems in the most basic forms of care that our elderly receive. If our elderly cannot even guarantee that they will be fed well in hospital, no wonder an increasing number of older people and their relatives are expressing concerns about the standard of care that the elderly receive through the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/13">That is not to run down the NHS. There are solutions and there are some absolutely marvellous examples of best practice, such as the red tray system, which provides an alert without the need to face down the older person over their need for help with feeding. Above all, however, we need enough capacity so that nurses can sit at an older person's bedside and help them feed, rather than sitting behind a screen filling out target forms.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/14">It is important to explain how we create a stronger voice for patients, particularly the elderly and the vulnerable. Legislation may make the NHS accountable to the Government, but the patients should be given the real power to hold the NHS to account. The local involvement networks initiative, or LINks, betrays the Government's failure to create an effective and prominent platform to allow patients to voice their views about the NHS. The Government have not been prepared to make the initiative independent of the NHS. It has been a mark of this Government that they have consistently sought to undermine the patient voice.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/15">In that respect, I am particularly critical of the Government. At Prime Minister's questions, I exposed the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who said that he had consulted before axing community health councils. He then had to write me a grovelling three-page apology to say that the Government had done no such thing and that they just did not like CHCs because they criticised the NHS. All but four of the 107 CHCs were excellent, but Labour abolished them without consultation. They did not like the criticism from CHCs, which were able to amalgamate much of the evidence. In that respect, things such as Bedwatch were very important.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/16">The CHC system was not particularly comfortable for the Government or, let us face it, the previous Conservative Government, because CHCs were independent. However, patients trusted them because they felt that they could have their hands held without being put offside with the NHS, whose services they still needed because they were vulnerable. Patients needed the respect that they could get from organisations that they could trust, and that was possible because CHCs were independent.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/17">Having replaced CHCs with patient and public involvement forums, the Government found that those, too, were too outspoken-particularly the <i>Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health</i>, <i>which was</i> the national voice. The Government therefore abolished those forums and replaced them with LINks. The contempt in which the Government held the patient voice was shown by their tagging of the issue on to another portmanteau Bill-this time, a local government Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/18">Now, Ministers are starving LINks of the resources that they need to become established and effective. I dare say that many hon. Members are receiving representations from LINks that are trying to make it clear that they do not have the resources that they need to do the job that they are required to do.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-16a.288.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" speakername="Stephen O'Brien" colnum="288"  time="015:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091216/halltext/91216h0007.htm#09121668000555">
	<p pid="a.288.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that important point. Some of the better-performing LINks have often been those that bravely stuck with it through the changes. They have provided continuity and a sense of expertise, and they have benefited from a familiarity with the labyrinthine processes of the NHS, social care and other areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/2">Rather than completely abandoning LINks, the solution is to ensure that they develop healthily and fit into the context of the Health Watch policy, which the hon. Gentleman will know well, because the Conservative party has had it in the public domain for the past four years, and I will describe it in a second. That will help to cover the point.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/3">One lesson to be learned from what recently took place in Stafford relates in part to the Government's poor support for LINks and to the lack of a strong local patient voice that can hold trust executives, NHS executives and, ultimately, Ministers to account. That is an ongoing problem. The Conservative party has therefore suggested a national and local independent voice to allow patients to highlight their concerns, as well as increased choice over services, which will enable patients to vote with their feet.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/4">As we begin to move towards a system of payment under which local NHS services are funded according to the outcomes that they achieve for patients, rather than top-down bureaucratic targets, the patient's perspective on their treatment will become increasingly important.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/5">As I made clear to the Older People's Advocacy Alliance earlier this year, we must ensure that older people, particularly those who lack the capacity to express concerns about their care, are given equal access to forums through relatives and appointed advocates. Again, we return to the important distinction between central legislation and grass-roots activity. Legislation can go only so far before older people require local advocates and trained, sympathetic staff-sometimes NHS staff-to ensure that the care they receive off the national radar is of a high quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/6">As a corollary to that, I am pleased that the Government are finally conceding that quality is a far better indicator of improved health care than activity-based targets. However, cases such as that of Staffordshire general hospital and, most recently, that of Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust demonstrate the distance that there is to travel before the rhetoric penetrates to the grass roots of patient care.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/7">Conservatives strongly advocate a shift towards clinical outcomes as a measure of performance in the NHS. With that shift comes a great deal of responsibility towards vulnerable older people, in whose cases it may not be possible to achieve a better outcome or a full recovery. That is an important qualification.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/8">We must ensure that measures such as dignity, nutrition and comfort are rewarded as highly as clinical outcomes in caring for the elderly. There must be no disincentive to delivering quality care to a person whose health is unlikely to improve. On the contrary, we must incentivise NHS staff to ensure that older people receive the care that is appropriate to their needs, regardless of their health.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/9">Our pledge, of which the Minister is well aware, to introduce a payment by results tariff for palliative care will help to ensure that there are services on offer for older people who are terminally ill and who want a dignified and comfortable death. It was with great regret that I witnessed the Government voting against the Palliative Care Bill presented by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1711" name="Caroline Spelman">the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman)</phrase> earlier this year. The Bill was intended to give people the right to choose where they die, whether at home, in a hospice or in hospital. Too many older people do not have that choice and are forced to die in hospital because palliative care cannot be made available elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/10">I have already mentioned the case of Stafford and the more recent revelations about the standards of care at Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and elsewhere. Those cases have emphasised the fact that a hospital's foundation trust status does not offer patients a guarantee of quality health care. It is more important than ever that we should have an effective and rigorous system of regulation at an appropriate level to ensure that hospitals that are failing vulnerable patients such as the elderly do not slip through the net. What is more, regulation must penetrate deeper into standards of care than tick-box targets. The news headlines of recent months only accentuate further the disparity that can exist between a hospital's record on paper and the reality of the care it delivers. So often it is the elderly who are caught in the vortex.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/11">It is vital that inspections should be carried out in person by professionals equipped with the expertise needed to identify poor care. Serious questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the Care Quality Commission, and the Government must prove to patients that they can establish a robust and trusted regulator who can act on their complaints and root out poor practice in the NHS-a regulator who is not at anyone's beck and call, least of all of politicians, but who acts independently on the basis of evidence. Effective regulation is more important than ever in the case of many elderly people who are not in a position to stand up for their own rights or treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/12">I want to touch on the subject of cancer care. It goes without saying that older people's health needs are typically more complex than those of other NHS patients, yet it is older people who face the brunt of discrimination in the NHS. Cancer predominantly affects older people, and the risk of developing many cancers increases with age. Nearly two thirds of cancer diagnoses occur in those over the age of 60, yet despite the high proportion of elderly people who face a cancer diagnosis, access to treatment is far from fair.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/13">Women aged over 70 are not automatically called for breast cancer screening, despite evidence that eight out of 10 breast cancer cases occur in post-menopausal women. What is more, a Roche report reveals that only 30 per cent. of oncologists would prescribe the cancer-fighting drug Herceptin for breast cancer in a 73-year-old patient, compared to 90 per cent. who would prescribe the drug to a 55-year-old.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/14">Inequalities are also prevalent in the treatment of lung cancer. The findings of the national lung cancer audit indicate that the proportion of lung cancer patients in England and Wales who receive active anti-cancer treatment falls with age from more than 60 per cent. for those under 54 to 50 per cent. at 70 to 74 and less than 30 per cent. at 80 to 84. Older people also struggle to get access to stroke treatment and cardiology services-a point that has already been made in the debate-and find that they are frequently pushed to the back of the queue for referral to a specialist and for preventive treatments.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/15">In conclusion, in the next 20 years the number of people over the age of 65 will double, and the number over the age of 100 will quadruple. As pressure on the NHS increases, it is more important than ever to iron out discrimination and ensure that health care is delivered on the basis on need, not age. I hope that the Minister will today give a firm pledge to tackle discrimination head on and ensure that our elderly people, many of whom come to the NHS in a vulnerable and fragile state, are treated with the dignity and respect that they deserve, and above all equally.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-16a.297.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1512" speakername="Phil Hope" colnum="297"  time="015:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091216/halltext/91216h0009.htm#09121668000572">
	<p pid="a.297.1/1">That is a different question from the one the hon. Gentleman raised in the debate. I thought he asked whether it had been downgraded in some way-<i>[Interruption.]</i> I understand now. With that in mind, is important to note that mental health services and the operating framework are where they were before, with vital signs listed and five references made. We have moved on from the 10-year mental health service framework, which is now over-this is its last year-to &quot;New Horizons&quot;, which went out to consultation and has now been published. That supersedes the old national service framework for mental health and will tackle the historic differences, which hon. Members were right to highlight, in the way some older people are treated compared with working-age adults.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/2">The new strategy will build on firm foundations. Spending is up by &#163;2 billion over the past decade. We have two thirds more psychiatrists, a fifth more psychiatric nurses and more than 700 new community mental health teams, giving us a firm foundation and meaning that we can help people of all ages to access the services they are going to need.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/3">For the avoidance of doubt, I have brought a copy of &quot;New Horizons&quot; with me. I shall mention annexe A particularly for the benefit of the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West, whom I do not think has read the detail. Annex A is entitled,</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Characteristics or Descriptors of Non-discriminatory Services for Older People&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/5">and that is mentioned in the main body of the text, which also covers primary care, mental health services, physical health problems, issues to do with research, and so on. It specifically refers to</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/6" class="indent">&quot;community mental health teams&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/7">which I think the hon. Gentleman mentioned,</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment services, assertive outreach services, Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) and psychological services&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/9">and so on. All older people should have the same access to these services that we have been building up over the past few years. I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman the assurances that he and the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam want about older people, who feature large in the strategy and are an important part of the future of mental health services. It is not only about mental health services; it is also about preventing mental ill health in the first place, through a cross-government strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/10">Let me provide some specifics. I will be doing a lot of work over the next few years, chairing a new ministerial advisory group on mental health inequalities to lead this agenda. We will work with the Royal College of Psychiatrists and other professional bodies to help providers re-design these services and tackle some of the cultural issues that mean that older people sometimes lose out. Training programmes for general practitioners and practice nurses, for example, will be developed, helping them become more sensitive to signs of depression among older people. This may also mean longer consultations by GPs, so they have more time to check on an older person's mental well-being and on the physical health reason about which they may have attended the surgery in the first place; and strengthening the availability of services for older people living in residential care homes, as was mentioned earlier, where depression issues can be strong.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/11">For clarification, the 18-week wait to which reference was made applies to consultant-led mental health services, so there is an element of this in the present system. I believe that there are signs that mental health services are changing for the better. We have seen some great examples of GPs, therapists, social workers and care providers working together to provide the integrated personal support that we need.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/12">I am delighted that this debate on the last day before the House rises for the Christmas recess has provided an opportunity to air the matter of support for older people and of tackling age discrimination in health care. It has given me the rare opportunity to spell out at length the Government's high and strong track record on such matters, which is all about quality and consistency. Age discrimination, like any form of discrimination, is unacceptable. We have taken some important steps to remove it from health and social care, but there is of course more to do. I look forward in the months and years ahead to addressing the many issues that I have set out today as we move closer to what everyone supports-a full ban on age discrimination across all services.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-16a.301.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" speakername="Ashok Kumar" colnum="301"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091216/halltext/91216h0009.htm#09121668000577">
	<p pid="a.301.3/1">I agree with every word that the hon. Gentleman has said. I hope he is saying that we have to keep the works open. If he is, I am wholeheartedly with him all the way. The sentiments he expresses are similar to those expressed by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.3/2">In my constituency, we have the world class Skinningrove rolling mills, which until now have concentrated on small sections for the construction machinery sector. They have recently moved into supplying sections for the wind farm industry, which is seen as a sector where exponential growth can be expected. The mills have a vigorous and dynamic management and a committed work force who want the plant to grow and prosper.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.3/3">I have helped the mills over recent months by brokering an offer from the local authority, Redcar and Cleveland borough council, for business rate relief. That offer is substantial, and I hope the Minister will join me in praising the dynamic management and the work force of Skinningrove works for their hard work and commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.3/4">I come to the subject of Teesside Cast Products and the disastrous news about the mothballing of the integrated iron and steel plants of Redcar and Lackenby. There is also the sad news that 1,700 steelworkers might be made unemployed. Furthermore, it is estimated that 8,000 people down the supply chain will lose their livelihoods.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.3/5">The autonomous complex within Corus called Teesside Cast Products was once seen as the future of steelmaking-not just in the north-east, but in the whole country. The future of Teesside Cast Products was secured by a deal with a consortium that agreed to purchase almost 80 per cent. of the plant's output until 2014. That consortium included steel traders from Korea, Mexico and Italy. However, when the demand for steel across the world dried up, the partners, led by the Italians, tore up the agreement and announced that they would not buy any more steel.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.3/6">I place on the record my great praise for all the efforts made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar to reach commercial solutions with the consortium to preserve production at Teesside Cast Products. In fact, she went to Italy to try to persuade the Italians to come back to the table. She displayed great courage.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.3/7">On Teesside, all is not lost. After all, the Teesside Cast Products plant has not been closed completely and, according to Corus, will be kept in a state of total readiness for any possible restart. A full maintenance team will be kept in employment purely for such an eventuality. I need to stress the fact that bringing a blast furnace back online can be done. It was recently done at Port Talbot, after a year's shutdown. It was also done at the associated Corus plant at IJmuiden in the Netherlands.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.3/8">I recognise that the Government have said that they are prepared to help Corus on Teesside, but that seems to be limited to the same recipe of cash for training and retraining. That support is important and helps those displaced by the Corus announcement to find other employment in the local labour market. Positive action in finding other industrial uses for the Redcar and Lackenby site is also welcome. That could be one of the new generation of carbon capture power stations recently given the go-ahead by Government, or used for other low-carbon applications. However, I still believe that that is not enough.</p>
