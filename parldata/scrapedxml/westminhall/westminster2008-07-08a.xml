<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-08a.345.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" speakername="Mark Fisher" colnum="345"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080708/halltext/80708h0001.htm#08070837000503">
	<p pid="a.345.2/1">I am grateful to you, Mr. Martlew, and to the Speaker for selecting this subject for debate. Today's turnout shows that the subject was well chosen. Shadow and former Ministers, and people who really care about this subject and who often speak about it, are here today. Such a well contested and attended debate is somewhat unusual in this Chamber, so I shall keep my remarks brief to ensure that everybody has the opportunity to speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.2/2">The background to the debate is that in 2001, the European Commission introduced a resale right for artists so that they benefit when their work is resold. The measure had long been promoted by the French Government, who called it a droit de suite, and long wished for by artists, who might have received very little money from a first sale, and who saw their patrons and the people who bought their work benefit commercially from its later success and from any appreciation in its value. It was understandable and perfectly correct that artists would lobby for the measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.2/3">Despite the artists' good case and the fact that the resale right was originally intended to cover living and dead artists, as it does, the United Kingdom opposed directive 2001/84/EC when it was first promoted by the Commission because of the damage that it was likely to cause to the UK art market. After negotiations by Ministers&mdash;I had a certain amount to do with those when I was a Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and previously, as an Opposition spokesman&mdash;the UK secured the right to derogate for a limited period. I should emphasise that the derogation applies only to the sale of the work of living artists.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.2/4">It has been a success, although not unqualified. Living artists have undoubtedly benefited&mdash;some 568 benefited in the UK between February 2006 and August 2007. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1779" name="Chris Bryant">the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase>, who has taken a great interest in the subject and who has discussed and debated it previously in the House, reported in a debate in November 2005 estimates that some 85,000 or 90,000 artists would benefit. That has proved to be somewhat optimistic: a relatively small number of artists have benefited but, for them, it has been a success and has improved their living conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.2/5">To date, because, in my view, of the derogation, the UK art market has survived and prospered. It is the largest art market in Europe&mdash;it is very strong&mdash;and it is important for both artistic and commercial reasons. We do not lead in many world markets but, apart from the United States and one other entry into the field in the past year or so, we have the largest art market. That is important for us, not only commercially, but for the arts community, because it puts the focus on London and on the quality of art.</p>

	<p pid="a.349.1/1">The hon. Gentleman has a background in this area and knows far more about the art market that I do. Clearly, I listen carefully to what he and others in the market say, but the evidence so far is that the impact has been minimal.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.1/2">There are, however, other areas where we do have a problem. My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central mentioned the rise of China, and there are reasons why the Chinese art market has developed in the way that it has. We might also see the rise of Russia as an art market, although it is more difficult to see that at the moment because of some of the circumstances in Russia. We must be alive to the problems, but the artists' resale right is a pimple compared with the other problems facing the market.</p>

	<p pid="a.350.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. At Sotheby's, exactly the same figures apply in London, France, the Netherlands, Italy, New York, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Australia and Canada, although the situation is slightly different in Canada. However, my point, if the hon. Gentleman will allow me to make it, is that if the auctioneers can add such an amount of money to their costs and, because of the reach of the two main auction houses, apply the premium around the world, they have a margin that can be cut if they feel that the &pound;12,500 that they would see as being creamed off for artists is having a serious effect on their market. It could be taken out of that premium.</p>
	<p pid="a.350.1/2">As a lawyer I have tried to consider the buyer's premium in terms of the contract, and it has always struck me that there is a real problem with it. The hon. Gentleman is right to point out that it enabled auction houses to reduce the seller's premium, which helps them to attract business; but the seller suffers in another way, because everyone who buys knows that they are paying the buyer's premium, and in a case such as the one I mentioned, no one will bid up to the price that they are prepared to pay. If I am prepared to pay &pound;1.5 million for a work of art but I know that I will have to pay another &pound;200,000 or &pound;300,000 on top of that, I will cut what I am prepared to bid, so the seller loses anyway. That is a serious problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.350.1/3">I have made the point I wanted to make. The evidence is that the scheme works: it has not damaged the market, and it will continue to work. Much of the reason it works is the efficient and effective way in which the Design and Artists Copyright Society has worked on it. It manages the scheme very effectively and fought for it through the various stages of its development that I have described, from 1997 when it first appeared in the in-tray of my right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield. The scheme works and the fundamental question for me is why artists should be treated any differently from writers and musicians; why should their heirs and successors lose when copyright extends for up to 70 years in those other cases?</p>

	<p pid="a.351.0/1">I am conscious that many of the arguments have been rehearsed before, and many hon. Members want to contribute to this debate, so I shall keep my comments brief. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase> on securing this timely debate, and I hope that the Minister will reflect on various points.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.0/2">First, it is too soon to say whether droit de suite has had an adverse effect, or otherwise, on the UK art market. The UK art market has been thriving. The Minister will have seen the report in <i>The Times</i><i></i>this morning on the huge prices paid by international collectors for impressionist and post-impressionist works. That, I think, has artificially maintained London as a centre of the art world in the current uncertain economic climate. The key point relates to international collectors. We are not talking about the small consigner or small purchaser. What really drives the auction houses and dealers&mdash;their engine room&mdash;is the big, expensive items, which are being collected by a new group of international collectors, who are united by one thing: their mobility. They may have properties here and elsewhere, and they move around the world. Consignors recognise that.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.0/3">It is less a matter of the single consignment that might attract droit de suite than of the fact that in an estate with a multiple consignment, the impact of droit de suite on several paintings might seriously affect where the executors choose to consign those works of art. We are playing with fire if we choose not to extend our opt-out in this matter at a time when the United States and Switzerland&mdash;both vibrant centres of the art market&mdash;are not prepared to join in. I would have a rather different view of droit de suite if I knew that, rather like the buyer's premium, it was a universal levy. However, until it is, it would be foolhardy not to extend our opt-out.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.0/4">This is not a question of fat-cat auctioneers, of which I was one&mdash;or rather I was a thin-cat auctioneer, associated for many years with Sotheby's, although I have not been for six or seven years now. When we talk about the art market, we should recognise that we are talking about dealers, the hotels that put up people who come to the great auctions, and&mdash;this will be of interest to the shadow Arts Minister, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1905" name="Edward Vaizey">the Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey)</phrase>&mdash;museums and galleries, and exhibitions, all of which piggy-back on London's identity as an art centre. One only has to talk to the Mayor of London to realise that he wants London to remain pre-eminent as an art centre. That is not something that just happened, or will just continue. Other world centres would love to take on the role, not least Paris, as has been said. It is interesting that President Sarkozy, who is keen to re-establish Paris as a centre of the art market, is apparently having second thoughts. We can all subscribe to the romantic idea of &quot;La Boh&egrave;me&quot; and the starving artist in the garret, but the reality is somewhat different.</p>

	<p pid="a.355.1/1">Indeed. There is perhaps an argument for asking DACS to run parts of the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.1/2">There is a serious point: those who campaigned against artists' resale rights, arguing that it would be impossible to administer, must face the fact that it has been introduced remarkably smoothly. As my hon.

	<p pid="a.356.7/1">In which case, we return to the argument about how an individual chooses to sell works. I thought that the hon. Gentleman was referring to the consignment of lots of works coming from the estate of a recently deceased artist. In that case, it is very unlikely that an individual will say, &quot;Yes, it is a good idea to sell 20 paintings by the same artist at the same time&quot;, because that might dramatically affect the value of each painting and might not produce the best result for the individual.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.7/2">In the end, the Government must face not only the rights and wrongs of artists' resale rights, but what should happen with works by deceased artists. As Members have said, the Government have a derogation until 2010, and if they want to, they must prove to the Commission that there is good reason for extending it until 2012. I will suggest two main reasons why I think that there is no good reason to do so: first, families are often the vital guardians of the an artist's artistic heritage. An interesting case is that of the artist William Scott, who sadly suffered from Alzheimer's for the last eight years of his life. His family passed on to me an interesting story through the William Scott Foundation. In 1950, he created a painting that sold at the time to a collector for &pound;60, of which William Scott received &pound;30&mdash;the dealer took the other half. Out of William Scott's &pound;30, he had to pay &pound;14 for the frame. So he received all of &pound;16 for that artwork in 1950. Last month, that painting sold at auction for &pound;1.1 million. William Scott is deceased, so the family do not receive anything. Some might think, &quot;That's fair enough. He sold it. End of story!&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.356.7/3">Actually, however, after William Scott's death, his family founded the William Scott Foundation, which provides a catalogue r&eacute;sum&eacute; of all his oil paintings, which was not likely to have been done commercially. They have also maintained an archive and, as often happens with many families, provide advice on whether works are fakes. Again, such services are nearly always provided free by families. As I said, they are providing a full authentication service for William Scott works to galleries and auction houses. They also assist students with theses and art history projects, deal with all the copyright and reproduction rights and have already established that 27 works are fake. And what do they do with all the money coming into the foundation? Every single penny goes towards Alzheimer's research.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.7/4">Those who think that, by extending the right to the families of deceased artists, we will simply help the fabulously wealthy children of successful artists could not be further from the truth. I have one other example from Wales. Incidentally, &pound;23,000 has been paid out to Welsh artists since the rights began. I am sure that many hon. Members will know of Sir Kyffin Williams, one of Wales' great artists, who generously gave a large number of paintings to a new gallery on Anglesey. His artwork is still significantly undervalued. I suspect that, in the next few years, it will significantly appreciate. If I could afford to buy one of his paintings, I would. He died nearly two years ago, in September 2006. Again, managing his estate is very complex. Nicholas Sinclair, who manages his estate, says that, in some cases, it is pretty much a daily job. He deals with licensing inquiries, memorial exhibitions and the fakes that have started to appear in auction houses. All that work is done on an unpaid basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.7/5">The value of a Kyffin Williams in five years' time will largely depend on Mr. Sinclair's unpaid work. Those who own important paintings, or paintings by artists who are recently deceased, are likely significantly to benefit from the artists' resale rights going to ensure that families can maintain the heritage of the individual artists. If we want a vibrant British art market&mdash;as vibrant as possible&mdash;we must ensure that the derogation is ended and that artists' resale rights apply not only to living artists but to those who are deceased as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.7/6">In the end, there is a moral point: those who benefit most from the great creativity and imagination of individual artists should surely be the artists themselves and the families who supported them, and whom they supported. If we cannot stand up for that in the House, I do not know what we can do of value.</p>

	<p pid="a.359.1/1">My hon. Friend says it has not. What is true is that we have been able to argue our corner and maintain our share during the exponential increase in the value of the marketplace. However, my hon. Friend should acknowledge that it is also true that in new and emerging markets and traditional markets, our competitors are at an extreme advantage in the coming years because they are not going to implement any international agreed norm in terms of payments of resale rights for artists. That is the reality. Therefore, we should not be arguing against each other; we should be trying to find a way forward. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister will come up with one in a few minutes' time. <i>[</i><i>Laughter.</i><i>]</i> <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> laughs. I was not attempting to undermine my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.1/2">The point that I am making is that the Government, over the past 10 years, have done quite well in getting us to the present position. Those who cried out from the sidelines have done nothing practical to resolve the two issues that must be resolved: one is to protect our place in the international marketplace, and the other is to do something about artists' resale rights, for which there is a desire. We need to do both things. I think that they can only be achieved by international agreement&mdash;whether it is by amendments to the Berne convention or by some other mechanism. Perhaps that is how we should be spending our time over the next two or three years&mdash;using the time for which we are arguing with the EU to have genuine international discussions, so that we can reach a conclusion on the matter. Even if we do not come to a conclusion, we cannot keep coming back to the marketplace with the changes in globalisation and use that as the only lever to defend the rights of the British marketplace. That will not work and it cannot work.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.1/3">The Chinese experience proves that. From a standing start, the Chinese now have more than 46 per cent. of parts of the international marketplace. I hope that in 2010 at the Shanghai Expo&mdash;I will be the commissioner-general for this House at that event&mdash;we ensure that British artists are prominent at that exhibition, as one of the examples of how the UK is an international market leader and wants to remain so. I also hope that we will open up our businesses to increasing business opportunities in markets such as China.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.1/4">I know that the Minister and the Opposition spokesmen need to respond to the points made so far, so I will make a final point. I say to my hon. Friend the Minister that I hope that he continues to take the position that he does regarding the negotiations, but at the same time we need to recognise that simply asking for a derogation is not good enough anymore. We genuinely need to try to find a way of gaining an international agreement that deals with the points that all of us want to be dealt with. We want to see Britain in a strong position in the top three places in the international art market, but at the same time we want to see artists and their families, or whoever comes after them when they die, getting their due worth for the works that they have produced, because, in the end, without the artists, there is no marketplace to defend.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-08a.360.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" speakername="Don Foster" colnum="360"  time="010:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080708/halltext/80708h0003.htm#08070837000544">
	<p pid="a.360.0/1">I am delighted to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" name="Ian McCartney">the right hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase> and other hon. Members who have made very valuable contributions: the hon. Members for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Doran), for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Derek Wyatt), for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) and for East Devon (Mr. Swire). Above all, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase>, not only on securing the debate&mdash;in a sense, that was the easy bit&mdash;but on setting it out in such a rational and calm manner, quite rightly pointing out that we were going to have a finely balanced argument. He put that case very fairly. I will argue that, yes, the argument is finely balanced, but I come down on the other side of the argument to him.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/2">We are debating whether the UK should take up the opportunity of derogation to pass on deceased artists' resale rights to their estates and successors from 2010 to 2012. This is a really important debate. However, what has hardly been said&mdash;only the hon. Member for Rhondda mentioned it, I believe&mdash;is that there are rules surrounding whether or not we can take up that derogation. It is worth reminding ourselves that article 8 of the directive states very clearly that member states may apply to have:</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/3" class="indent">&quot;up to two more years, if necessary to enable the economic operators in that Member State to adapt gradually to the resale right system while maintaining their economic viability&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/4">Those are the criteria against which we must judge whether we even have a case that we should be making. I do not believe that we have a strong enough case against those criteria, although I accept that there are counterbalancing arguments.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/5">When we obtained the extension to the derogation, we also obtained a number of other measures, including the limit of &euro;12,500; I think that that is the figure, but if we can get the correct figure on the record, that would help. That limit has been very significant in ensuring the success of the artists' resale right scheme for artists who are living now. It has not put a huge burden on the art market, despite all the fears that were expressed on its introduction; we have heard them expressed by other hon. Members today, and they were also expressed in the run-up to the introduction of the scheme in 2006. There were those who said that the art market in this country would collapse as a result of what was allegedly a huge imposition on the art market. We have heard the figures; the art market has doubled from &pound;4.2 billion in 2004 to &pound;8.5 billion today. The capping of that limit has been crucially important to the growth of that market.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/6">We only have to look at some of the record-breaking prices that have been reached recently to show how vibrant the art market is. Reference has already been made to the sale in June of the Lucian Freud picture for nearly &pound;12 million at Christie's in London. The interesting point about that particular sale is that the picture was in fact being sold by a private art collection in America, and the owner chose not to sell it in the United States but to sell it in this country instead. That shows the vibrancy of the art market here. With the works of artists such as Freud and Bacon going for such astronomical sums, it certainly seems that that &euro;12,500 limit is hardly having a huge impact on sales. Robin Woodhead, the chief executive officer of Sotheby's Europe, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/7" class="indent">&quot;At the top end of the market the &euro;12,500 ceiling for droit de suite [ARR] on any single work is not going to be a deciding factor. London is such an important centre and the market here is so strong, led by names like Freud, Bacon and Caro, that ultimately I do not believe it will make a difference.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/8">Clearly, the evidence to date suggests that, despite all the fears, the &euro;12,500 ceiling has not made a difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/9">However, the hon. Member for East Devon and other hon. Members are right to ask whether or not extending the right to another group&mdash;the inheritors of the estate of deceased artists&mdash;will make a big difference. So far, nobody has given an estimate as to what they think that figure will be and what the impact of that change will be on the market. I am certainly no expert, and if the hon. Gentleman has better information than I do, I would be interested to hear it. However, the figure that I have been given is that the likely figure that will be collected will be somewhere in the region of &pound;18 million or &pound;19 million. That would equate to something like 0.4 per cent. of the value of the art market, which is a very small proportion in comparison to the figures of 10, 15 or 25 per cent. that we heard earlier on. I genuinely do not see that there has been a strong enough argument to show that this change will have a huge impact on the art market.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/10">We have already heard from the hon. Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey about the very detailed study that was conducted by Maven Research and I will not repeat all of the figures that he has given. Suffice it to say that the vast majority of artists believe that the scheme has been beneficial to them and that its extension would also be beneficial, encouraging them to do more work, which in turn would benefit the art market. As the right hon. Member for Makerfield has said, without the artists there simply is no art market, so we should be encouraging them. Equally, the vast majority of those people who work in the art market itself have said that the current system is not burdensome&mdash;they say it is neither time-consuming in terms of bureaucracy, nor unduly costly, and they support its extension.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/11">However, there are some matters that it is important to address. The right hon. Member for Makerfield made a very important point that those of us who believe that the scheme should be extended without the derogation for two years must acknowledge the point made by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central and other hon. Members, which is that we must remember that we are operating in a global market. There is a threat from the Chinese, the Swiss and the Americans, who are not applying these sorts of additional costs, however small I might argue those additional costs are, to their art market. That is why the right hon. Gentleman is 100 per cent. right to say that one of the crucial things that the Minister must do&mdash;I, too, hope that he will do it&mdash;is to confirm continued support for what was said in 2006 at the introduction of the scheme, which is that the European Union would work to try to ensure that those elements of the Berne convention that apply are adopted globally. It is critical that we work hard to do that and to show the benefits of the artists' resale rights worldwide.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/12">However, I would also say that if we in this country are not prepared to carry on with the scheme that we have already agreed to, that can hardly be a very strong argument in negotiations, as we go around the world and say to people, &quot;You should do it, but incidentally we are not prepared to do all of it ourselves.&quot; It is important that we maintain the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/13">It is also important that we recognise that some of the arguments against the scheme really do not stand up, for example, suggesting, as some hon. Members have done, that it is only the very rich and very successful artists who have benefited. That is simply not the case and other hon. Members have given the figures that show why it is not the case. Other hon. Members have also pointed out that the costs of the scheme are very much lower than some people have suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/14">Since it was raised by the hon. Member for East Devon, I also want to refer to the letter that appeared in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i><i></i>on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-30">30 June</phrase>. He said that it was a letter signed by the likes of Damien Hirst, Sir Nicholas Grimshaw and others, and that it was hardly surprising that they would say what they did in the letter. However, I am sure that he also looked, as I did, at the full list of 500 artists or members of artists' families who were signatories to that letter. The vast majority of them are not household names. They are not making vast sums of money. I shall end by reading a brief extract from the letter:</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/15" class="indent">&quot;We are a group of British artists and artists' families. Some artists achieve success during their lifetime; many do not achieve recognition until after their death...The Government must make the right decision in order to protect the legacy of artists and the heritage of our nation...We should be entitled to bequeath our intellectual property&mdash;the value of our life's work&mdash;to our families. After all, musicians and writers have long been used to a royalty system which has not harmed their respective industries. The Government must implement stage two of the Artists' Resale Right immediately.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/16">I agree.</p>

	<p pid="a.365.4/1">If the hon. Gentleman will stop barracking, our position is absolutely clear. The resale right may enable artists to share in the increasing value of their work, but there remain real concerns over the long-term impact on the competitiveness of the UK art market. Ill thought through European regulations could have a devastating impact on the UK economy. To ensure effective implementation in the UK, we are calling on the Government&mdash;I shall do that in a minute&mdash;to extend the derogation until 2012. That is clear, and I am glad that the hon. Member for Rhondda had the patience to listen.</p>
	<p pid="a.365.4/2">Royalties collected in 2007 accounted for 0.04 per cent. of the total value of the UK art market, whereas they would have accounted for 0.2 per cent. if they had been collected for living and deceased artists. On the one hand, the amount represents a tiny slice of the total UK art market; on the other hand, it represents a massive increase in share. In fact, it is a 500 per cent. increase&mdash;a massive jump.</p>
	<p pid="a.365.4/3">Thirdly, what is the long-term impact? I received correspondence from the British Art Market Federation, which points out that the UK art market has benefited from a global art boom in the past few years but that we should consider the long-term effects if we are not in a boom situation in the future. New York has arisen very quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.365.4/4">Fourthly, we must ask what will be the effect on international UK competitiveness. The right hon. Member for Makerfield put that point very well when discussing globalisation and the context in which we survive. In seeking the delayed implementation of the measure, the Government sought a commitment from the European Commission to introduce resale right into the international Bern convention, the idea being to ensure that UK and European art markets could compete on a level footing with others, namely in the US and Switzerland. If the UK moves ahead with stage 2 without progress on international negotiations, the UK is bound to suffer. I urge the Minister and the Government to get off their hands and get this negotiation underway and ensure that it is in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.365.4/5">We must not forget that this is a retrospective introduction of a right. That is something that we should always be cautious about. I urge the Minister to seek a derogation until 2012 and I look forward to a crystal clear response this morning, because any further hesitation or delay only insults our artists and risks our international art market.</p>

	<p pid="a.369.1/1">Every few months, we debate human trafficking in the House and, with wringing of hands and tearing of garments, every speaker highlights how awful it is. Ministers are abject with apology and say how dreadful it is, and the Government say that they are doing everything they can to stop it. Let us give the Minister his due. He is thoroughly decent and is doing a difficult job with conviction and humour. We all know that he is a good egg. He travels the world searching for answers, studying the problem and meeting officials and, rather like &quot;The Pilgrim's Progress&quot;, is bedevilled, I hope, by obstacles rather than temptations. I pay tribute to his commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/2">I had not considered human trafficking before 2005, although I was trained in the caring professions. I first became aware of its horrors when, as a member of the Select Committee on European Scrutiny, I visited Romania and Bulgaria before their accession to the EU. I had never travelled to eastern Europe before 2005, and I had no idea of the extent of the abject poverty there, nor that fraud was a recognised way of life and that the judiciary and the police were riddled with corruption. I was also oblivious to the fact that there is, and has been for generations, a Roma community with 6 million to 8 million disadvantaged people living in a similar way to that in the middle ages in Britain. Some 70 per cent. of people in most towns and villages live on the breadline, and their only means of transport is a horse and cart, with the horse sharing the accommodation with the family.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/3">In that environment, there are inevitable risks of young people in such communities being trafficked to more prosperous western European countries. Children are often sold through debt bondage to successful gangs who prey on the poorest members of their own communities. Some are duped by the lover-boy syndrome, and are persuaded by lucrative jobs that do not exist but are under the illusion that the Elysian fields are not far away.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/4">Three years ago, trafficking in Britain was hardly acknowledged. There is relatively little mention of it in <i>Hansard</i> before 2004. Trafficking tended to be confused with prostitution, and I believe that it still is. Child trafficking was considered to be something to do with adoption from families who had too many children and wanted to find homes for them. It was something that charities dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/5">What is the reality? Human trafficking is one of the most lucrative businesses in the world, comparable to drugs and arms dealing. If it were not lucrative, traffickers would not do it. However, when the going gets tough, traffickers become craftier. If the risks become greater and the money less certain, traffickers switch to another country or another field of criminal activity. There is a pan-European criminal network, but much trafficking is conducted by a loose association of men and women who make a living by exploiting poor and vulnerable younger people who are looking for a better life.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/6">Two years ago, the media were in full cry. A week did not pass without lurid pictures of grotty rooms inhabited by loosely clad women. The horror stories abounded. More recently, the police raid in Slough resulted in middle-page spreads in the tabloids depicting Roma children, many under 10, pickpocketing, stealing from ATMs and shoplifting. The media captured vividly the discovery of so-called cannabis factories on the edge of northern towns and cities with Vietnamese boys tending the plants for rich and influential bosses.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/7">We must not be too surprised that the result of Pentameter 2 was 167 victims discovered, 528 criminals arrested, 822 premises visited, 6,400 police intelligence reports gathered and &pound;500,000 recovered. Of the victims, 13 were children. That is hardly surprising, but what is surprising is that, apart from the BBC, which ran the news item all day, the media did not give it much media attention. It is as though they have grown bored with the subject, the public are anaesthetised to horror stories that no longer shock, and the media are moving on to something else.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/8">Furthermore, MPs do not see many votes in the fight against trafficking. Constituents are not too concerned about exploitation, provided that it is not in their street. In Devon, most people tell me that it simply does not happen there, but they are wrong. Pentameter 2 found evidence of trafficking in many west country areas, and quite a lot in Plymouth. The fact is that it is all over Britain, and perhaps the Minister will confirm that if he has half a chance and sufficient time.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/9">There is some confusion about nomenclature. The difficulty is the culture of disbelief and the inability of trafficked people to disclose and articulate what they have been through. They are fearful of reprisals. Some of the young people who are trafficked to Britain are carefully schooled so that they can escape quickly from a local authority into whose hands they may be placed. Just yesterday, <i>The Western Mail</i> in Wales, which I read regularly, reported that 35 children were missing without trace from major cities in Wales, raising concern about child trafficking there.</p>

Until they receive more resources, they have enough on their hands without this problem.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-08a.371.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1881" speakername="Anthony Steen" colnum="371"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080708/halltext/80708h0005.htm#08070837000558">
	<p pid="a.371.1/1">I do not know whether to refer to my hon. Friend or the hon. Member. Perhaps I should refer to him as something in-between. I thank him for his intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.1/2">The subject is complicated and the word &quot;missing&quot; in the phrase, &quot;children going missing from local authority care&quot; is slightly confusing. When children go missing, they are often in transit in local authority so-called care. Having been found as victims of trafficking, they are placed in a so-called place of care, but it is not secure, and there is a problem with how secure it should be. If it is too secure, the children are in a prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.1/3">Brothels are where many trafficked women are found. The problem, as I am sure the Minister will say, is to obtain sufficient evidence that the women are prepared to make available to enable the police to nail the traffickers. They are terrified of reprisals, they do not speak the language and many of them are in a strange country. There are great complications in nailing traffickers, who are much more nimble than we are. I am grateful for that intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.1/4"><i>The Western Mail</i> reported 35 children missing without trace in major cities in Wales. The Government clearly have a problem with identifying victims of human trafficking. The Crown Prosecution Service should remember that they have a duty to explore all the facts when dealing with young people involved in, for example, cannabis cultivation and other organised crime before they seek a prison sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.1/5">Let us remember what trafficking is. It is the exploitation of making someone do something that they would not want to do if they were fully aware, and of compromising them, duping them and coercing them. The problem is how to distinguish between genuine victims of trafficking and illegal migrants. That recognition is critical because it determines how the Government treat people. Illegal migrants are usually given short shrift and a one-way ticket back to where they came from.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.1/6">The Government have a poor track record on producing meaningful statistics. The problem is that they do not really have any statistics and those that they do have are totally misleading. We were told that the UK Human Trafficking Centre in Sheffield would change all that, so perhaps the Minister could tell us whether it has. Will the Minister tell us when we will have some reliable statistics that bring together the information from the various police and UK Border Agency operations?</p>
	<p pid="a.371.1/7">One can understand that victims of trafficking are a problem for the Government because there is always some doubt about whether people have been genuinely trafficked or whether they knew what they were getting into and are illegal migrants searching for a better way of life. Even with genuine victims, the Government are often reluctant to identify them early enough and decide what to do with them, where they should go, how to fund them and how to help them.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.1/8">Media coverage of Pentameter 2 suggested that an increasing number of British young women are trafficked from one part of the UK to another. Sadly, the sexual exploitation of British young people is nothing new. Operation Glover&mdash;a police operation&mdash;focused on the internal trafficking of British children, and that is what the media picked up on when reporting on Pentameter 2. Somehow the press completely missed the fact that 13 children from Romania, Nigeria, Brazil, China, Estonia, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Congo and Cameroon were found by Pentameter 2. Two of the children were returned without a welfare assessment and were virtually deported on the spot. In addition, two children went missing within hours of being placed in care. One child was issued with an asylum registration card that contained the details of a false passport given to her by a trafficker even though the police and the UK Human Trafficking Centre both knew that it was fraudulent. UK Border Agency staff who issued the card maintain that they were unable to do anything else even though they knew that the details had been provided to her by traffickers and were totally false. It is clear that the protection response to children cannot be hailed as successful&mdash;in that case it was deplorable.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.1/9">Out of the 167 victims discovered by Pentameter 2, how many were provided with legal representation consistent with the Government's obligation under article 12 of the Council of Europe convention on action against human trafficking? Out of the 13 children found, how many were provided with guardians consistent with the Government's obligation under article 10 of the convention? How many of the victims are now in a safe refuge to which traffickers do not have access and how many have agreed to give evidence against their traffickers?</p>
	<p pid="a.371.1/10">Pentameter 2 has achieved 528 arrests, which is a remarkable number, yet we lack specifics. Where did those arrested come from and how many were UK based? Will the Minister put on the official record from which countries they hailed? How many of those 528 have been charged with trafficking offences? It is interesting to note that the figure of 528 that was reported under Pentameter 2 was adjusted in the revised action plan that was announced on the same day, which states that the actual number of traffickers found was not 528 but only 99. Are those 528 individuals separate or have fewer people been charged with multiple crimes?</p>
	<p pid="a.371.1/11">Have there been any successful prosecutions under Pentameter 2, because on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-03">3 July</phrase> <i>The Guardian</i> reported that there had been 24 successful prosecutions as a result of the operation? In other words, is this massive police crackdown putting traffickers behind bars and if so, how many? Alternatively, are traffickers more nimble with their footwork than the heavy hand of the constabularies acting together with the bureaucracy of the Crown Prosecution Service and the unco-ordinated activities of the UK Border Agency?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-08a.376.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" speakername="Denis MacShane" colnum="376"  time="011:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080708/halltext/80708h0005.htm#08070837000569">
	<p pid="a.376.1/1">Yes, 15 people were found guilty of trafficking for sexual exploitation. A grand total of 17 people&mdash;14 men and three women&mdash;were found guilty of abusing children through prostitution and pornography. Those are absolutely ludicrous conviction rates. Certainly, under Operation Pentameter 2, many massage parlours and brothels were raided and a number of people detained, but as the hon. Gentleman rightly underlined, instead of obeying the injunction of the Bible,</p>
	<p pid="a.376.1/2" class="indent">&quot;Suffer the little children to come unto me&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.376.1/3">the reaction of Government officials was, &quot;Suffer the little children to be put into my hands and I'll boot them out of the country as fast as I can.&quot; Frankly, that shames Britain. Far from a freedom chain to get those sex slaves to freedom, we maintain their exploitation by dumping them back in their countries as quickly as we can, in which case they simply turn round to their traffickers and say, &quot;Get me back in to make some money.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.376.1/4">We need to consider the problem more broadly. The hon. Gentleman took an intervention about Sweden from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1822" name="Fiona Mactaggart">the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase>. Roger Matthews, professor of criminology at South Bank university, who has just published a very good book called &quot;Prostitution, Politics and Policy&quot;, says:</p>
	<p pid="a.376.1/5" class="indent">&quot;In Sweden, where the purchase of sexual services has been criminalised there has been a significant decrease in street prostitution and a lower level of trafficking than in neighbouring countries. Importantly, the recent law which makes the purchase of sexual services illegal appears to have affected public attitudes in general with the majority of teenage men seeing the purchase of sexual services as illegitimate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.376.1/6">I would welcome a change in culture in Britain whereby the majority of teenage men&mdash;indeed, adult men&mdash;considered as illegitimate the purchase of sexual services, and until we have that change of culture, all our fine words and all our co-operation through the Parliaments of Europe will count for nothing.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.1/7">We can contrast Sweden with the state of Nevada, where prostituted women operate legally. Fifty-seven per cent of the students surveyed at the university of Nevada thought that it was impossible to rape a prostituted woman because, once money had been offered or paid, the woman had to do whatever the man wanted. That illustrates the cultural gap between those who argue for the legalisation of prostitution as we see it in Nevada, where people believe that a prostituted woman cannot be raped, and Sweden, where the men are confronted with their responsibility and there has been a cultural change regarding the purchase of sexual services and a significant decrease in trafficking. There is not one country in the world where prostitution is tolerated, legalised or semi-legalised that has not seen an increase in trafficked women. The hon. Member for Totnes will have to face the fact that if he wants to cut supply, he will have to consider the demand side.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.1/8">A number of us have raised this issue. My right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House did so, and my hon. Friend the Member for Slough&mdash;who might catch your eye in a few minutes, Mr. Martlew&mdash;proposed certain amendments. They fell because, as we know, the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill was having its own difficulties in getting through all its stages in the two Houses of Parliament. I understand that, and my hon. Friend the Minister and my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary have agreed to consider the matter. There have been visits to Sweden and other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.1/9">We need to examine the issue because, until we name and shame the men, we will not do much, even if we do raid as many massage parlours and brothels as were raided under Operation Pentameter. When we raised the issue in the past and said that there were a large number of trafficked women in Britain, we were rubbished by the media. The hon. Member for Totnes was right to draw attention to the fact that the media tend to back away from the subject; they are nervous of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.1/10">I took part in an interesting debate last week with David Davis, our former colleague, who is now standing in a by-election; Mr. Henry Porter, who writes for <i>The Observer</i>; and Mr. David Aaronovitch, who writes for <i>The Times</i>. Mr. Aaronovitch was on my side, and Mr. Porter was on Mr. Davis's side. When these issues were raised by the Leader of the House, my hon. Friend the Member for Slough and others, Mr. Aaronivitch and Mr. Porter both argued powerfully that there should be no curb or limit on the right of men to buy whatever sex they wanted.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.1/11">I mentioned some statistics a moment ago, as listed by the Ministry of Justice, but it is interesting to note that there is no statistic for the offence of having sex with someone under the age of 18 without consent. Consent is difficult to define, but my hon. Friend the Minister for Borders and Immigration said in the House in answer to me that to have paid-for sex with anyone under the age of 18 was rape. However, that statistic is not listed. As we know, the number of convictions for rape in Britain is pathetically and absurdly low, because we do not have people in the Crown Prosecution Service with specific responsibility for rape cases.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-08a.377.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" speakername="Denis MacShane" colnum="377"  time="011:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080708/halltext/80708h0006.htm#08070837000571">
	<p pid="a.377.1/1">I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman. I may claim some credit for initiating a campaign, by raising the matter two or three times in Prime Minister's questions, about the Council of Europe's convention on action against trafficking in human beings. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is about trafficking in general and not only the trafficking of women. I support stronger trade union rights, workplace inspections, rights for agency workers and others, but that is not quite where the Conservative party wants to be on protecting workers from any sort of exploitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.377.1/2">I return to the question of statistics and finding hard information. When my hon. Friend the Member for Slough and others raised the issue, we were criticised for using figures that were said to be unrealistic. I cited the figure of 25,000 trafficked people, which was given in the <i>Daily Mirror</i><i></i>and came from a Home Office estimate three or four years ago. Julia O'Connell Davidson, a professor&mdash;there is always a professor involved&mdash;from the university of Nottingham, wrote to <i>The Guardian</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-28">28 December</phrase> criticising me and claiming that I had made a &quot;startling assertion&quot;. She said that that number was</p>
	<p pid="a.377.1/3" class="indent">&quot;more than the entire work force of Debenhams. How is it that this vast number of women and girls are so readily available to male clients and yet simultaneously so difficult for the police to detect?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.377.1/4">Of Operation Pentameter in 2006, she said that</p>
	<p pid="a.377.1/5" class="indent">&quot;only 84 women and girls...conformed to police and immigration officers' understanding of the term 'victim of trafficking'.</p>
	<p pid="a.377.1/6">Again, I cite newspaper figures, but I understand that, as a result of Pentameter 2, the figure given everywhere is 18,000, and I am sure that the hon. Member for Totnes and my hon. Friend the Minister will confirm it.</p>
	<p pid="a.377.1/7">It is worrying when we have top professors rubbishing the statistics and the facts. In 2005, the same professor wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.377.1/8" class="indent">&quot;There are places in the world where it is estimated that between 15 and 30 per cent of those working in prostitution are under the age of 18 and that up to 75 per cent of the male population engage or have engaged in prostitution use. In such places, proposals to penalise anyone who buys sex from a minor could translate into proposals to incarcerate half the male population.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.377.1/9">That is an extraordinary argument. The professor seems to be giving the green light to our tourist paedophiles.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-08a.378.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" speakername="Denis MacShane" colnum="378"  time="011:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080708/halltext/80708h0006.htm#08070837000573">
	<p pid="a.378.1/1">I am talking about trafficking, Mr. Martlew. I am referring to trafficked women. We have to get the facts and figures right. Since the majority of trafficked women come from the countries to which the good professor refers, I have to make the point. A reductio ad absurdum argument obtains in the mindset of those who argue not for a reduction of sex slave traffic, but for its regulation&mdash;indeed, its legalisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/2">I am not sure whether the Home Office deals with the English Collective of Prostitutes. We know nothing of its figures or its financing, whom it represents or who controls it, but it argues on its website&mdash;I checked this morning&mdash;that Government feminists and Christian fundamentalists have joined forces in claiming that prostitution is violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/3">Those 18,000 people, according to Pentameter 2, were trafficked into Britain for sexual purposes&mdash;they are the prostituted women at the heart of our debate. I therefore state that the use of prostituted women occurs in a context of violence. The Ipswich murders might have been a good example. None of those poor victims were trafficked from outside the UK. Perhaps, as the hon. Member for Totnes said, they were trafficked within the UK. Trafficking is about what happens inside the UK. It affects the most vulnerable of young girls, many of whom are in care, without parents and without a social framework or other support.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/4">We need to tackle the demand side, as we did with kerb crawling. The original idea of naming and shaming kerb crawlers was rejected as being an interference with the men's right to go up and down a street and, if they wanted, to pick up a woman and take her away in a car to have sex. Such actions were deemed to be acceptable, but councils and local communities nevertheless went out on the streets and named and shamed. Taking the same approach to brothels and massage parlours&mdash;and now internet sex and mobile telephone sex&mdash;will be an interference in the liberty of the individual, but I am all for it because, if we do not do so, the trade in sex slaves can only increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/5">I join the hon. Member for Totnes in calling for the speedy ratification of the Council of Europe convention. The Government have signed it, but signature is not ratification, as the people of Ireland and the President of Poland know. We need a network of centres in every major conurbation to which these young women feel that they can go. However, they will have to be protected. They have such centres in Belgium, but the pimps patrol around the centres trying to lure the girls out.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/6">We need investment. I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the problem of finding funds to allow local authorities to act&mdash;although, my goodness, we ask our local authorities to do far too much as it is. I remember when the first women's refuge was opened in Chiswick by Erin Pizzey 40-odd years ago. That was the first in Britain, but thank goodness, there are now many more. In each conurbation, we need a safe refuge for trafficked girls and women.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/7">I ask the Minister to give us some indication of when the Council of Europe convention will be ratified. I ask him also to increase the amount of statistical evidence. I shall not ask him to commit himself to acting on the demand side of sex slavery this morning, but the issue will not go away. I ask him to pay little attention to Professor Julia O'Connell Davidson, who is deeply negative and unhelpful on this issue. I hope that the Minister will confirm that she has not been consulted by the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/8">Finally, we need time in the House for a broader debate. This should not be a party issue. It would be a huge interference in the right of the British male to buy sex as he wishes on whatever terms he wishes without being responsible for the prostituted women with whom he has that sex. The men are not going to check whether the girls are 17, 18 or 19&mdash;or even 16&mdash;or whether they come from Lithuania, Thailand or Cameroon or whether they have been trafficked or are here legally. However, until we deal with the demand side, the supply of sex slaves will never dry up.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-08a.384.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1497" speakername="Paul Holmes" colnum="384"  time="011:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080708/halltext/80708h0007.htm#08070837000581">
	<p pid="a.384.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1881" name="Anthony Steen">the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen)</phrase> on securing the debate. He has raised the issue in other forums and will continue to do so. We have heard a number of different takes on it from right hon. and hon. Members who have spoken, some of which I will mention.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/2">Let me say at the beginning that the Government deserve praise for the action that they have taken and for the direction in which they are going. However slow and hesitant they have been in taking action in the past few years, they have done more than any other Government on the issue. We know that they are planning to take further steps, and we hope that that will happen sooner rather than later.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/3">However, there is more to be done. There have been roughly only 70 convictions for trafficking under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, despite the two Pentameter operations. There are no simple answers, as I am sure the Minister will say when he responds. We need to look carefully at experience in the UK and in other countries, and hon. Members have touched on the conflict over the lessons that we should learn. If we are to tackle trafficking and the downside of prostitution, should we legalise prostitution, as has been done in the Netherlands, New Zealand and some US states? Would that bring prostitution into the open, making it much easier to control the worst aspects and help those involved? Alternatively, do we take the Swedish route and criminalise at least the purchase of sex, although the distinction between purchasing and selling is a little like splitting hairs or counting angels on a pinhead? Which example should we learn from? Passionate arguments are made by people on both sides.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/4">If we look at other countries, we can also learn how to deal with the freed victims of trafficking, although, again, the messages are perhaps conflicting. The Government are criticised for their predilection for deporting victims and treating them as criminals. For example, they prosecuted an under-age Vietnamese boy found cultivating the crop in a cannabis factory who had been trafficked into this country as slave labour. They have also been criticised for deporting women and children who have been trafficked into the sex industry. Alternatively, should we give those people special immigration status? The Government have argued over the past year or two that such a solution would not be simple, because it could create a pull factor that draws people into the country and a loophole that they can use to gain legitimate status. We can learn from what other countries have done in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/5">In his opening comments, the hon. Member for Totnes said that the issue had dominated debate in this country for only about three years and that it was quite a recent phenomenon. Back in 2002, as a new Member of Parliament, however, I went with UNICEF to Thailand and the Republic of Laos to look at the trafficking of children for forced labour in factories and domestic work and for the sex trade. Thailand is significant in that it was one of the top five countries of origin among those who were referred to the POPPY scheme following Operation Pentameter, and we can learn from what the Thai Government and UNICEF did in this case. The children came predominantly from the Republic of Laos, which is a very poor country; indeed, it is very similar, although even worse in terms of poverty, to the eastern European countries that are a source of trafficking, as hon. Members have mentioned. The Thai Government, under pressure from UNICEF, realised that if they simply deported back to Laos everybody they freed from brothels and factories in Thailand, they would soon come back over the border, either willingly or unwillingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/6">We looked at cases in which the Thai Government had educated and retrained children who had been freed in police raids for up to a year before taking them back to Laos. The idea was that those children would return to Laos with skills so that they could set up small businesses and have a different lifestyle. However, when we went to the village where one of these girls came from in Laos, which is the poorest country in the world, we saw that her family lived in a breeze-block shanty. There was nothing in the door or the windows, which were just holes in a breeze-block wall. There was one electric light bulb on the end of a long cable, which the family moved from room to room to use. The lesson was that whatever education and retraining these girls were given, many would quickly find their way back across the border because of the attraction of Thailand. Some would then move on to Europe and perhaps England, just as girls who &quot;escape&quot; the absolute poverty of some eastern European countries do. We can therefore learn a lot from the experience of other countries, but we can also learn a lot about how difficult it is to come up with answers. There are no simple answers, and I am sure that the Minister will refer to that, as I said.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/7">Pentameter 2, and Pentameter 1 before it, have shown that successful action can be taken if it is a police priority. Of course, the police have lots of competing priorities. Terrorism has emerged as a major priority, just as knife crime has in the past few weeks and months&mdash;there is a constant cycle of such issues. However, something like trafficking is below the radar and below most people's perception of what is going on, so there needs to be a strong lead from the Government&mdash;as Operation Pentameter showed&mdash;if the issue is to become a police priority. We have seen in this country and in other countries what a push we need from Governments to tackle this issue. One of the great factors in Sweden's success&mdash;in so far as what they are doing in Sweden is a success&mdash;is that they have not only made purchasing sex a crime, but given the police a lot of extra resources and told them that they must make enforcing the law on this issue a top priority. Laws can be passed, but whether they are enforced is another matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/8">Sweden also puts a lot of resources into social services and into providing back-up for women who were involved in prostitution to help them take up alternative lifestyles. Something similar is being done on a small scale in Ipswich, following the terrible murders of five prostitutes there. The local police and social services have run a major programme to get women off the streets by providing housing and drug rehabilitation and by helping women into jobs and education so that they can take up alternative lifestyles. A whole package of measures is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/9">I hope that the Minister will tell us what the detailed lessons of Operation Pentameter and the visits to countries such as the Netherlands and Sweden are and what package the Government will introduce in this country. We are 10 months&mdash;nearly a year&mdash;on from the end of the operation, but what lessons have the Government learned? When will they publish their findings? What do they plan to roll out across the UK based on that experience?</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/10">What will the Government do about victims who can currently stay four weeks, or 16 weeks if they co-operate with the authorities? In 2006, a Home Office Minister responded to a question by saying that there were no plans to give victims special immigrant status. However, if the Government are to ratify the Council of Europe convention by the end of the year, as they have said they will, they will have to create some form of special immigration status for victims of trafficking who are freed as a result of police action.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/11">The POPPY scheme is very good, but it can take only 25 people at a time. Will the scheme be rolled out across the country? If it is, will it be adequately resourced or will it just be left to existing local police and social services budgets to pay for the implementation of Pentameter and the POPPY system? Will any such scheme be based on the Dutch example of the four safe houses in Amsterdam? Such safe houses have personal guardians, 24-hour on-duty care, chaperones to take children out so that they cannot be picked up by traffickers on the streets and 24-hour CCTV monitoring of the surroundings. In the Netherlands, only 8 per cent. of freed children subsequently go missing, which is much better than the record in this country. A UNICEF report noted that 183 of the 330 child victims of trafficking whom the police found in this country later went missing. Where do these children go? What research are the Government doing through local authorities into where these children go and how we can combat the problem?</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/12">What are the lessons for sentencing policy from Pentameter and the surrounding research? Respondents to Government consultations have said that there should be a heavy minimum sentence as well as a maximum sentence and that it should be linked to deportation and a ban on re-entry following completion of the sentence. Is that the way that the Government plan to go? What are the lessons for the provision of legal assistance and immigration advice to the women and children who are caught up in trafficking and whose identities are revealed as a result of operations by police and social services?</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/13">What lessons from Pentameter do the Government therefore intend to implement? When will they implement them? Will they implement in full UNICEF's recommendations from March 2008 and the recommendations in the October 2007 report by the Joint Committee on Human Rights?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-08a.404.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1774" speakername="Martin Salter" colnum="404"  time="013:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080708/halltext/80708h0010.htm#08070837000603">
	<p pid="a.404.1/1">It is possible to create fish passes, but one of the big problems is that there is a world of difference between a comparatively modestly sized dam and a massive barrage that is effectively turning the tidal estuary into a lake. The huge volume of water that is released to generate the force and pressure to power the turbines will suck salmon smolt and all migratory fish through what is effectively a mincing machine.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.1/2">It is no coincidence that a powerful coalition has come together to challenge the Severn barrage, including the Anglers Conservation Association&mdash;the main pollution-fighting body&mdash;the National Trust, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Salmon and Trout Association, the Wildlife Trusts, the United Usk Fisherman's Association, the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, WWF UK, Wye Salmon Fishery Owners Association and the Wye and Usk Foundation. Those experts in their fields produced, together with the RSPB, a collective response that highlighted the point that I am seeking to make today.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.1/3">I wish to read into the record that construction of a costly 10-mile barrage across the River Severn would create similar problems, by blocking the path of thousands of fish returning to the Severn and its tributaries, the River Wye and the River Usk. A barrage to generate tidal energy would also destroy wild bird habitats formed naturally by the Severn's huge tidal range and protected by European law. The Government would have to recreate those sites elsewhere and ensure that they were of similar value to wildlife and that they were on a similarly large scale. Helping fish to adapt to the plugging of the Severn by creating a new pathway from the sea further up river will be even harder, particularly since the Government have nominated the Severn estuary for EU protection because of its importance to fish stocks. So the Government are nominating that vital economic, environmental and wildlife corridor, yet at the same time they are considering putting a barrage across it that could have devastating consequences for the whole fishery.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-08a.406.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1491" speakername="Jonathan R Shaw" colnum="406"  time="013:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080708/halltext/80708h0010.htm#08070837000609">
	<p pid="a.406.1/1">My hon. Friend no longer has a garage full of fishing gear, which will be a relief to Mrs. Salter, I am sure, who will take advantage of the additional space that has been created in the Salter household.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.1/2">Again, I offer my warm congratulations to the hon. Member for Broxbourne. This debate gives me, as the Minister with responsibility for fisheries, an opportunity to acknowledge the value of recreational fishing to the economy, and also to outline some of my Department's work in recognition of that value, and of course the pleasure that I know from first hand it brings to the 3 million people in England and Wales to whom the hon. Gentleman referred. I recognise the importance of anglers as stakeholders in the management of fish stocks. I am also clear that we must take proper account of the needs of recreational anglers as we develop and implement our fisheries policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.1/3">It is important to focus on a range of areas in angling. The hon. Gentleman concentrated on coarse and game angling, and I shall concentrate my comments on that. If time allows, I may talk about sea angling.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.1/4">Coarse and game angling are among the most popular sports in England and Wales, and they are big business. Freshwater angling makes an important contribution to the economy. Accurate figures are hard to find, but the Environment Agency and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs recently commissioned a detailed study, &quot;The economic impact of freshwater angling in England and Wales&quot;. The key findings of that study, which was published at the end of last year, were that expenditure by about 1 million licensed anglers on freshwater fishing trips totals &pound;1.18 billion per annum. As the hon. Gentleman said, that involves some 37,000 jobs and household income of around &pound;980 million. Those are large figures. Research shows that average annual expenditure by coarse anglers on permits, tackle, travel and other costs is &pound;859 per angler. We are therefore talking about a successful multi-billion pound industry, which is particularly important to rural communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.1/5">One of DEFRA's public service agreements is to ensure that people have access to the natural environment, and what better pastime is there than enjoying angling in the wonderful English countryside? Whatever the true figure, angling provides not only an important contribution to the economy, but access to the countryside and the aquatic environment, as well as contributing to a healthy lifestyle.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.1/6">The popularity of freshwater angling is increasing, which is good news. The number of rod licences taken out in England and Wales has increased by about 10 per cent. over the past decade, and currently stands at 1.2 million, with the majority of licences&mdash;typically between 750,000 and 850,000&mdash; being taken out by coarse anglers.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.1/7">The rationale for the development of the Government's policy on angling and the management of salmon and freshwater fisheries remains the salmon and freshwater fisheries review group report, which was published in March 2000, and to which the Government responded in February 2001. The overall aim of the Government's salmon and freshwater fisheries policy is to promote conservation, restoration, and rational management of salmonids, eels and freshwater fish stocks.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.1/8">Under the Environment Act 1995, our delivery partner, the Environment Agency, has a statutory duty to maintain, improve and develop fisheries for salmon, trout, other freshwater fish and eels. Conserving freshwater fish is required by the UK's international commitments. Research has shown that the presence of fish is valued not only by anglers, but by other interests in fisheries, and the general public. Encouraging the development of fisheries is consistent with the Government's policies to benefit the general public by encouraging rural development and farm diversification and helping to create a fair and healthy society.</p>

	<p pid="a.410.4/1">My hon. Friend is making an eloquent presentation of the problems, but I have to say that on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-08">8 April</phrase>, Sayers did in fact write to me. However, I am afraid that the company has not kept the promises made in that letter, which states in relation to the Liverpool site that</p>

	<p pid="a.410.4/4" class="indent">&quot;The operational review excludes our retail shops and, consequently, the shops within Liverpool should not be affected.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.410.4/5">I do not know whether my hon. Friend is aware, but since then, 18 shops on Merseyside have been closed. Sayers has not kept to its word on that or on conducting consultations. In fact, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-07">7 June</phrase>&mdash;two days before the Lyndale chairman and chief executive bought the Sayers the Bakers Ltd, as it became known in Bolton&mdash;it sent cheques to the staff. All those cheques bounced. I do not know whether my hon. Friend is aware of that, but it is an episode of what amounts to corruption on the part of these people.</p>

	<p pid="a.413.5/1">That is another story altogether.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.5/2">Let me go through the effects of what has happened. The job losses have very severe implications for some communities. At the moment in the area represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, West Derby, there are 2,719 people unemployed. The unemployment rate where this factory is based is 7.6 per cent., which is the 20th highest in England. That number of job losses in the Liverpool and Merseyside region will have a major impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.5/3">In personal terms, there has been real brutality. Security guards marching people off the site at which they have worked for years is just unacceptable in the modern day and age. There are lost wages and lost overtime. I believe that the work force and the union have been treated with contempt by the management, and the taxpayer will now pick up the burden. This is not the only example. There is an example in my constituency, Varig Airlines, where exactly the same happened. A company supposedly goes bust and then the next day is operating in the same way with the same managers and has run away from its liabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.5/4">I believe that we are dealing with a scam. It was planned over time by the same personnel who are now benefiting from it&mdash;Mr. Quinlan and Sandy Birnie. The advisers, who are now the administrators and who are benefiting from it, helped to plan it. I believe that an inquiry should be set up into how the company entered into administration. It should consider the company directors' liabilities. Questions should be asked. Was the company trading while insolvent? Was a device used to avoid responsibility? Was the management buy-out merely a front?</p>
	<p pid="a.413.5/5">People have been hurt and have lost out&mdash;not Mr. Quinlan or Mr. Birnie, and not Stoy Hayward, but the workers themselves. The inquiry should consider all such matters. We need to consider whether a change in legislation is necessary to prevent this happening again. We need to review the law, perhaps changing it to prevent companies from evading their responsibilities.</p>
