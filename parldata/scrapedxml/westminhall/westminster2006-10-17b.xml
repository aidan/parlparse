	<p pid="b.183.2/1">It is a pleasure to be under your chairmanship, Mr. Taylor. I thank the Secretary of State for being present. I understand that he has had to change his plans and I am very grateful to him for that.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/2">I should start by saying that my personal experiences in Afghanistan pale into insignificance when compared with some of those that our troops in Helmand have suffered. I have certainly had my fair share of being rocketed and bombed by the Taliban, but that is nothing compared with what our troops have been going through, and it is only right that I put on record my deep appreciation of our armed forces serving in Afghanistan and, in particular, of 16th Air Assault Brigade.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/3">I can pinpoint the exact moment when I realised that British troops would be serving in Afghanistan for a very long time. It was 09.32 on <phrase class="date" code="">8 September</phrase>&mdash;a moment after I felt the shock wave pass through my body from probably the largest car bomb there had ever been in Kabul. The shock wave was not particularly shocking&mdash;I got used to the experience as a bomb disposal officer&mdash;but I shall never forget the sounds of agony and the smell of death that followed.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/4">If there is one message that I want to get across to hon. Members today, it is simply this: if we are to achieve the strong and stable society that the Government want to achieve in Afghanistan, we will be there for a very long time&mdash;perhaps 15 or 20 years. If we manage to raise Afghanistan to the level of a third-world country in that time, we could perhaps pat ourselves on the back. None the less, that is the task that faces us.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/5">In my role as a Royal Engineers officer, I was charged with delivering in a small way the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan and I travelled to the four corners of the country&mdash;to Kandahar and Helmand in the south, Herat in the west, Mazar-e-Sharif and Faizabad in the north, and Kabul and Bagram in the east. While much of the media focus is on the war-fighting in Helmand, we are making progress elsewhere in the country. In the north and the west, where the situation is much more benign, some reconstruction and development is taking place, but progress is painfully slow.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/6">However, we must give credit where credit is due. There has been some progress in Government thinking since the disastrous days of planning the Iraq war. The three Ds&mdash;defence, development and diplomacy&mdash;now form the bedrock of the strategy for the eventual planned withdrawal from Afghanistan. The theory behind the three Ds, at least, is rather like that behind the three strands of a rope: when they are applied concurrently, their effect is far greater than when they are applied on their own, and they are certainly far more effective than when they are applied sequentially, as they used to be. The question, however, is whether that new approach is working in Afghanistan. Having spent nearly eight weeks travelling the length and breadth of the country trying to deliver reconstruction and development, I would have to say yes, but as I said, progress is painfully slow.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/7">I imagine that the Secretary of State will outline Afghanistan's commitment to the millennium development goals, although, unfortunately, we are currently implementing only four of the eight plus one goals to which Afghanistan has signed up. He will perhaps also outline what has happened since the Afghan compact was agreed in London earlier this year and how we are trying to implement the compact via the interim Afghan national development strategy. However, I am here to tell him that the theory in Kabul is one thing&mdash;the reality on the ground in the provinces is entirely different.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/8">Far from the capital, Kabul, and the influence of the fragile central Government, in provinces such as Helmand and Kandahar, the strategy is, in theory, being delivered through provincial development committees&mdash;civilian Afghan committees made up of locally appointed provincial leaders. As a rule, however, those organisations simply do not meet, and the result is that there is little, if any, genuine dialogue between local people and coalition forces. In practice, what little reconstruction there is is delivered not via the local government, but via the military, through provincial reconstruction teams, or PRTs. With few exceptions&mdash;Nimruz, which is sandwiched between Helmand and Iran is one such exception, and Daykundi, just to the north of Helmand, is another&mdash;most provinces have a PRT. Those organisations are, in effect, delivering central Government influence to the far-flung corners of the country. Having visited several of those areas, it struck me that despite the politically comforting name, the fact remains that PRTs are predominately military units designed to provide security and that the diplomatic and development elements appear almost as bolt-ons or afterthoughts.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/9">Earlier this summer, I visited the UK-run PRT at Lashkar Gar in Helmand province with the Select Committee on Defence. Then, as now, it appeared that little if any development activity was going on because of the fighting&mdash;something that the British Government have quietly recognised with the recent deployment of 28th Engineer Regiment in an effort to fill the development gap.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/10">In recent weeks, much has been made of the lack activity by the Department for International Development in Helmand&mdash;even the whereabouts of the DFID representative seem to be a mystery. It is clear that when representatives have been present in the province they have rarely wandered far from camp. If they had done so, they would have discovered, just 10 minutes away from the PRT, a refugee camp full of starving children who appeared to be gaining little, if any, benefit from our presence in the region. What better recruiting grounds could the Taliban want? Why are we failing to deliver food and basic medical supplies&mdash;basic hearts-and-minds stuff&mdash;to those people? Can the Secretary of State at least reassure me that poverty eradication is a priority in Helmand?</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/11">Another area of controversy&mdash;notionally, at least, the British are taking a lead on this&mdash;is the counter-narcotics strategy, but there has been little if any progress in that area too. Opium cultivation rose by 59 per cent. in Afghanistan in 2006. Afghan farmers grow opium not because they want to, but because they need to; it is one of the few crops from which they can make any money. Many Afghan farmers would be open to growing alternative crops if they thought that that was sustainable. Among the few things that are sustainable in the long term are vineyards and orchards, but they take seven to 10 years to establish and in the main support is available for only one or two years. Subsistence farmers simply cannot take the risk of converting to vineyards and orchards unless they have a long-term guarantee of support.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/12">One of the principal problems with the PRTs has been their leadership. In theory at least there should be a triumvirate structure, with each discipline head having an equal say. In practice, the military has led in all areas, with mixed results. In the south, where fighting dominates, the military lead has been natural, and it has been broadly accepted as a practical necessity, although it causes some resentment among other partners. The problems really start when the requirement for a military lead diminishes, as in the relatively benign northern and western regions. While attending a PRT conference in Herat, I witnessed two Spanish delegates from the same PRT almost coming to blows over who supported whom.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/13">Even the name &quot;provincial reconstruction team&quot; has become controversial. At the same conference, I heard representatives from NGOs and civilian organisations argue that only they could deliver reconstruction and that the best the military could do was deliver stability. On that basis, &quot;provincial stability team&quot; would be a far better name. In that respect, it is interesting that the first task of the 28th Engineer Regiment, which has been sent to Helmand to deliver reconstruction, is the completion of permanent vehicle checkpoints. That work is vital to providing stability, but it can hardly be classified as reconstruction. What is in a name? I guess that the problem is political and that &quot;reconstruction&quot; sounds so much more progressive and acceptable than &quot;stability&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/14">To be fair, some PRTs are achieving success. Shortly before I came back from Afghanistan I went to Faizabad to witness the opening of a new runway, which the PRT there had built with the help of Slovakian engineers. That runway is vital, because for the first time there is a link between Kabul and Faizabad, and that will help the economy. Local leaders were delighted that that work had been delivered. On my way back I flew via Mazar-e-Sharif, accompanied by the very first PRT commander there. He told me how, only three years before, one could not even land there during the daytime without being shot at. Now the town has quite a flourishing economy. So some progress is being made.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/15">Frankly, though, the concept of reconstruction in Afghanistan is optimistic, because it implies that there are institutions and infrastructure to reconstruct. Some Government ministries, such as the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, are progressing fast and have offices in some provinces, but others have little, if any, capacity. After decades of war, the professional class simply does not exist. Almost all of that class are ex-patriots who have returned to the country, and that in itself is causing a conflict with those who stayed behind to fight.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/16">Coalition forces are also learning fast that it is all very well building schools but little will be achieved without the teachers to put in them, such is the impact of a local lack of co-ordination between international bodies, each following its own agenda in splendid isolation. However, some progress is being made and it would be wrong of me not to highlight the good work of Colonel Pat Fryer in building the Afghan country stability picture. We now have a digital image of every reconstruction project and piece of infrastructure in Afghanistan, which will prove to be a marvellous tool in future years.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/17">Genuine efforts are being made at provincial level to build capacity in local government, but that is proving to be a painfully slow process. I recall a member of the PRT based in Ghor province telling me that he struggles even to get the provincial council to meet. After a chaotic start, when some PRTs, NGOs and international organisations operated with little, if any, consultation with local people&mdash;for example, the magnificent new women's centre in Qalat city remains empty because local men refuse to allow their wives to go to it&mdash;steps are now being taken to deliver provincial development plans, listing regional development priorities drawn up not by coalition forces but by local people. However, where they exist, they remain on the whole little more than laundry lists.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/18">Rightly there is a determination that all development should, where possible, have an Afghan face to it, thereby demonstrating to the local population that there are benefits to supporting the far away central Government. The problem is that Afghan face equals Afghan pace, and very little gets done quickly. All too often, military commanders, frustrated at the concept of Afghan face, Afghan pace, use the military chain of command instead. Although that delivers much quicker results, it does little to build capacity in the provinces.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/19">Perhaps the most striking thing is that even now the debate about how best to deliver development continues. Let us consider the contrasting approaches of the Department for International Development and its US equivalent, the United States Agency for International Development. USAID tends to use quick-impact projects, spending large amounts of money in the provinces to give its local military commanders some tactical effect. For example, in Kandahar, lots of wells have been built. A local military commander will turn up and a well will be dug. Local people can see some benefit of the military commander, but there has been little strategic thought. I talked to representatives of one of the NGOs that still operates in Helmand and discovered that so many wells have been dug in parts of the province that some of the ancient karez&mdash;the water channels which Afghans have used for centuries to bring water off the mountains&mdash;have run dry. The water table has been lowered by well digging.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/20">DFID puts less emphasis on quick-impact projects and tends to deliver a longer-term strategic effect, trying to build capacity in the provinces. The problem is that we are not seeing much early tactical effect, so what is the answer? Like most things in life, the answer is probably to try to find a balance between the two approaches.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/21">I attended a reconstruction conference in Kandahar in early September, which coincided with Operation Medusa, NATO's largest land offensive for many years. There is something odd about discussing reconstruction and development when 200 yd away the sound of outgoing artillery might be accompanying the discussion. At the conference, one PRT commander&mdash;not a Briton, I hasten to add&mdash; confessed that he felt that the only reason why he was building so many schools and clinics was to please politicians back home, and that ultimately building four walls and a roof has little long-term effect unless we manage to get people in to run things. If we do not do that, such places will simply end up as homes for the Taliban.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/22">Both the Afghan Government and the international community are growing increasingly frustrated at the lack of progress. The problem is that reconstruction and development are simply not possible without stability. The latest plan is to try to deliver stability by introducing four so-called Afghan development zones, predominantly in the south. Effectively, they are merely an attempt to reorganise the troops that we have in theatre into small lozenges to deliver stability. It might well work and it is a good plan, but we are simply redistributing forces that we already have in Afghanistan. A cynic would say that the whole of Afghanistan should be an ADZ and that the latest plan simply recognises that we do not have the troops in theatre to deliver what we need.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/23">I am sorry if I paint a grim picture, but it is an honest assessment to colleagues of what I have experienced in Afghanistan during the past eight weeks. I believe that we are making progress, but as I have said on several occasions, it is painfully slow. The Government have called for a public debate on our role in Afghanistan. If we are to have that debate, it must be with a degree of political honesty, and if we are to achieve our aims, we will be in that country for a very long time to come.</p>

	<p pid="b.187.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase> on his speech; it is good that we get a reality check on what is happening in Afghanistan. It is an extraordinary story. I believe that there was almost universal approval of our going there in the first place both to get rid of the haven that existed for al-Qaeda and to end, as far as was possible, much of the medieval cruelty of the Taliban Government. Great successes have been achieved on education and democratic change.</p>
	<p pid="b.187.2/2">Having had five years during which there were remarkably few British casualties&mdash;just seven, most of whom were as a result of accidents&mdash;we made the monumental error of invading Helmand province. The result has been a further 33 British fatalities, most of whom died in combat. We had a debate on this subject in February during which that was forecast. Another military gentleman, Captain Leo Docherty of the Scots Guards, resigned from the Army last month in some despair at a situation that he described as &quot;barking mad&quot;. He described how the military achieved a victory in the town of Sangin and pointed out that that was when some development should have gone in. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.187.2/3" class="indent">&quot;The military is just one side of the triangle...Where were the Department for International Development and the Foreign Office?...The window was briefly open for our message to be spread, for the civilian population to be informed of our intent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.187.2/4">In fact, nothing happened and the Taliban regrouped and attacked a few days later and there were six British casualties as a result.</p>
	<p pid="b.187.2/5">I would have thought that this morning I would have heard a cry of some despair from the military in Afghanistan who have been given several impossible tasks. In the past 12 months in the Helmand province operation they have been told that their task was to eliminate poppies and that their task was not to eliminate poppies. They were told that their job was to storm the Taliban strongholds and they have subsequently been told that their task is not to do that. They were firmly told that their job was one of reconstruction, but they are now told that their job is not to do any reconstruction. They were told in a famous saying, which cannot be unsaid, that there was a hope that they could go into Helmand province without firing a &quot;single shot&quot; and of course they have been ordered to fire tens of thousands of shots with the result that many hundreds of Taliban and other Afghans have been killed.</p>
	<p pid="b.187.2/6">We know that this battle cannot be won using military power alone; hearts and minds must be won. That is not done by using bombs and bullets, as the Americans have been trying to do in their &quot;Operation Enduring Stupidity&quot;, which consists mainly of aggressive search and destroy missions, usually from the air, in which many people, both innocent and guilty, are killed. That is entirely counter-productive.</p>
	<p pid="b.187.2/7">Hearts and minds are not won by cheating the Afghan farmers. We paid out &pound;21 million of British taxpayers' money in compensation. That represents just a small part of what we have spent. The total bill for the eradication of poppies will be around &pound;240 million. The &pound;21 million was sent to the corrupt Karzai Government to compensate farmers and some of them received cheques for &pound;380, but all the cheques bounced and there has been an energetic campaign to find out where that money went. The farmers are going through the courts to establish their claim for compensation. None of the money got through to them and perhaps the Minister will tell us this morning where that &pound;21 million went.</p>
	<p pid="b.187.2/8">We are dealing with a culture and a country that for two centuries at least has been run by endemically corrupt warlords. We went there as the Feringhi&mdash;that is the name they use for us now&mdash;and lost three wars. The Russians went there and I remember a member of the Russian Duma telling me with contempt, &quot;You have invaded Afghanistan. We did the same. It took us six days to conquer Afghanistan, but we were there for 10 years.&quot; They had an army of 120,000&mdash;not the 5,000 that we have or the 30,000 that NATO has&mdash;but they left in ignominy and 15,000 of their soldiers were killed.</p>
	<p pid="b.187.2/9">We are on the brink of either going forward and rethinking our operation or losing everything. Unless we have attainable objectives to consolidate the gains that have been made around Kabul in education by recasting the operation in the Helmand province, we may leave Afghanistan with the same ignominy with which the French left Vietnam after Dien Bien Phu, the Americans left Vietnam and the Russians left Afghanistan. We have forgotten the nature of guerrilla warfare.</p>
	<p pid="b.187.2/10">There were vivid accounts of French soldiers standing in serried ranks with epaulets and ceremonial swords shining when they surrendered. They were the pride of the French army, but they surrendered to a rabble that came out of the bush, many of them barefooted with home-made weapons. The most high-tech equipment they had were bicycles. That guerrilla army beat the French army.</p>
	<p pid="b.187.2/11">Unless we understand the hearts-and-minds argument and see the extent to which we are losing the support of the Afghanistan people, we shall enter a cauldron of grievous suffering and death. It is no exaggeration to say that we are following the same path with the same delusions as the Americans followed in Vietnam. We should reject the calls for escalation because, if we do not, we shall be in the same situation as in the past when, because of the belief in politicians here, the military are there, in Afghanistan. Great anger is being expressed on websites, and Ministers and others would do well to listen to what serving soldiers are saying.</p>
	<p pid="b.187.2/12">There is an alternative for Afghan farmers. It is not to destroy the poppy crop. We know about the abject futility of trying to reduce the poppy crop. We know, as Lord Birt said in his strategy paper, that the supply side of the drugs trade cannot be destroyed. In Afghanistan, we are trying to do in five years what America has failed to do in Colombia in 20 years. Colombia is in a state of bloody chaos with three armies, two of them funded entirely by drugs. Destroying the poppy crop would make no difference whatever to the supply of drugs because, for every reduction in Colombia, more drugs were produced in Peru and Bolivia. Exactly the same would happen if we reduced the crop in Afghanistan. It would be grown in Myanmar, Laos and surrounding countries. There is no chance of preventing that and of imposing on Afghanistan a Swedish-style democracy or of ensuring that there will never be a place for Osama bin Laden to hide in Afghanistan, north Pakistan or elsewhere. Despite the might, subtlety, bribery and wealth of the American army, it has not yet found him. Nothing we can do by changing the system would ensure that there is no place for Osama bin Laden to hide. These are our unachievable objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.187.2/13">Our soldiers are right to ask what on earth the politicians are doing and what the mission is. It was said of the charge of the Light Brigade that those involved had no chance of objecting to what was an act of military stupidity. A latter-day Tennyson writing the story of Helmand might say, &quot;Blair to the right of them, Bush to the left of them, Holler'd and thunder'd. Their's not to reason why, Their's but to do and die: Into the valley of Death, Into the mouth of Helmand drove the 5,000.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.190.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase> on securing this debate and I thank the Secretary of State for making time to come and contribute to it. The subject is important and arguably one of the most important. I hope that in future we shall have opportunities to discuss it in the House rather than in this Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.0/2">I do not think that there is any disagreement that we need to be active in Afghanistan, because it certainly requires assistance to meet the objective of peace and self-sustainability. However, views differ throughout the Chamber on the strategy and size of our commitment.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.0/3">I was fortunate to visit Afghanistan recently and it was good to see the steady progress that has been made in areas around Kabul and other areas to which my hon. Friend referred. The problems that we are facing came home to me when I met some newly elected Afghan MPs who do not go to their constituencies in places such as Helmand because it is too dangerous. That quickly summarises the state of affairs there. We need much more effective and coherent co-ordination of operations in Afghanistan if there is to be progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.0/4">I fully agreed with the decision to enter Afghanistan. The threat was real and the enemy was active. Al-Qaeda was present and the Taliban Government were sympathetic to its cause. However, five years on, I am left wondering how much more could have been achieved had the 230,000 allied forces been moved to Afghanistan instead of going to Iraq in 2002. Five years after we first went into Afghanistan, we have only just gone into the Helmand province, which is probably the heart of where the most focus is required.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.0/5">I praise 16th Air Assault Brigade, which has made a fantastic effort there, but there is an issue of strategy. As a military person, I question why 16th Air Assault Brigade was sent there alone. We have huge and valuable experience of peacekeeping and war-fighting operations in Bosnia, Kosovo and so on, yet we sent out a light infantry unit for a task that required more armour, more firepower and more mobility. I encourage the Secretary of State to do what he can to influence the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Defence to ensure that our troops are properly armoured. That includes sending out one of the seven remaining Warrior battalions in this country that are not on deployment. I do not believe that Snatch Land Rovers provide the necessary protection, and the matter needs to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.0/6">The debate focuses on reconstruction. I fully agree with the comments of my hon. Friend. My experience of the development teams was that they are in a competitive game. USAID has a different strategy from DFID. Embassies have different forms of income coming through and different ideas of where the money should be spent. A myriad of agencies are competing against each other for contracts and work. I have said before and I repeat that there needs to be a UN-mandated co-ordinator for all reconstruction activities. Otherwise there will be continued competition&mdash;not necessarily between agencies but between what the military are doing on one hand and reconstruction efforts on the other.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.0/7">South of Kandahar I saw a school that had been rebuilt with international money and that was fantastic. Unfortunately, three weeks after it was completed there was a crop-eradication programme around the school which removed the livelihood of the community, so everyone left and there is now an empty school building south of Kandahar which no one is using.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" name="Paul Flynn">The hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> touched on the biggest issue about which we are in complete denial: the poppy crop. We try to distinguish the military front from reconstruction and from poppy growth, but the three are intertwined, and we must come to terms with that, otherwise our policy has no long-term future. Our policy on poppy crops is failing. We have a policy of eradication and replacement, and we cannot separate it from long-term factors even if we intend to remove the terrorism link with Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.0/9">The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime opium survey shows that last year was the largest opium crop ever. It represented a 59 per cent. increase on the previous year's crop, which was also the largest crop up to that point. The amount of crop exported has risen from 4,100 tonnes to 6,100 tonnes, which means that Afghanistan produces 92 per cent. of the world's opium. Helmand province has increased its capacity by 162 per cent. right under our noses. That is where we are supposed to operate. To put it another way, Helmand province produces just under half the world's opium.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.0/10">Britain is responsible under the list of G8 tasks for counter-narcotics and the counter-narcotics programme. We are well placed to lead. Last year, the United States spent more than $780 million, the UK about $100 million and the EU about $150 million on poppy eradication and replacement programmes, but let us face facts: the money was wasted. Crops have increased, and we must find another strategy to deal with the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.0/11">I have mentioned to hon. Members before that a similar story took place in Turkey in 1969, when Turkey was identified as the main source of the heroin that was entering the United States. President Nixon declared a war on drugs, and he was about to impose military and economic sanctions on Turkey. There were four years of hostility between the two countries as they tried to work out how to deal with the huge amounts of heroin entering the United States from Turkey. Eventually, after trying to make the crop illegal, Turkey asked the UN, &quot;Can we legalise it? Can we have a poppy programme in which poppies are grown under licence and distributed to the international community? There it will be controlled, it will not leak out, and it will be turned not into heroin, but into morphine and codeine&mdash;other products of which there is a world shortage.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.190.0/12">That was back in 1969 and the 1970s. We do not hear of an opium or heroin problem from Turkey anymore. Indeed, other countries throughout the world grow poppies under licence. There is a massive threat and challenge in Afghanistan, however. I stand to be corrected, but I believe that about 90 per cent. of the heroin on British streets comes from Afghanistan. Yet, we are in denial; we believe that we can somehow eliminate the crop. The poppies play into the hands of the terrorists. The saddest fact is that when we try to eliminate those crops we alienate the very people whose hearts and minds we are trying to win over. That is fundamental.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.0/13">In refugee camps around Lashkagar, there are 10,000 to 15,000 people, and the numbers are rising because people have lost their communities. If one visits the camps, one finds that every third or fourth person wears a black turban. It is the mark of the Taliban. They walk around freely and recruit people from the refugee camps. So, when we talk about the enemy, the Taliban, we must be specific, because &quot;Talibanisation&quot; is the process whereby such people are recruited. The recruits are not Taliban sympathisers in the sense that they have a cause; they just want to put bread on their tables, feed their families and get on.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.0/14">The recruits see that the international community has been in their country for five years, and that their communities have been ruined by the destruction of the crops that have kept them going. It is understandable why when someone from the Taliban gives them a rocket-propelled grenade and says, &quot;Take a pop at a Land Rover or an American vehicle, and we will give you two months' salary in exchange&quot;, they would be happy to do so. We are losing the battle for hearts and minds because of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.0/15">Organisations in Afghanistan such as the Senlis Council and others would be keen to run a pilot scheme. Let us test the water. I am not saying that it would work. I really do not know whether it would, but why not give it a try? We have discussed how long it takes to grow a peach tree, pomegranates and so on, so let us consider a five-year programme to wean farmers off poppy cultivation. Each year they could give their poppies to a UN-licensed scheme, and at the same time part of their crop could be replaced with other produce. We could tax it, so the Afghan nation benefited, too. Most importantly, however, we would deny the terrorists the chance to benefit from the money, which is exactly what happens now.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.0/16">My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes discussed the long term. We might be in Afghanistan for 15 years, and it might be worth looking at the map of Afghanistan again. With its Pashtuns, Tajiks and Baluchis, we might ask whether the territorial line that encircles the country is ideal. Alternatively, we might ask the Baluchis, &quot;Were you to recreate your own country, where would it be?&quot; I think their answer would be that they would take a nice chunk of Pakistan that Pakistan does not like to talk about, and into which it does not send anybody in a uniform. We might consider that idea in the long term if we asked those people what they wanted to do. They are loyal not to Kandahar, Kabul or President Karzai, but to their families and their ethnic grouping. Until we understand that, we will never win the battles that we are fighting in Afghanistan.</p>

</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.192.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1856" speakername="Chris Mullin" colnum="192"  time="010:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0002.htm#06101743000470">
	<p pid="b.192.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase> on raising this important subject and on his sobering speech. I intend to travel down <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the same road on which the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> journeyed, although not as far as his final remarks. His suggestion of redrawing the map in Afghanistan and Pakistan opens up a new can of worms, which might get us into further difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.1/2">I cannot claim any recent first-hand experience of Afghanistan, because it is more than 30 years since I travelled there. I recall a time before the earth changed places with the sky, when King Zahir Shah was in his palace, the Buddhas were in their place in Bamiyan, the markets in Kandahar and Kabul were overflowing with fresh produce and it was possible for any foreigner to travel almost anywhere on public transport&mdash;albeit on aged German buses that still had their German destinations, such as Munich railway station, on the front.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.1/3">Nevertheless, I have picked up from people with recent experience of Afghanistan that things are not going well. That is the flavour of the debate. In particular, they are not going well in the south of the country, where our troops appear to be besieged in their bases, venturing out only in heavily armed convoys and patrols. As hon. Members have said, there is no meaningful contact with the locals, and we are in danger of losing the south. If we do, it will mark the beginning of a new Taliban state that may spread north whether we like it or not.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.1/4">Local people are becoming increasingly desperate. They are squeezed between the Taliban and the international community. Incidentally, they believe that all the international community, whether Canadians or British, are Americans. They refer to them as Americans. Among refugee camps, which are within 10 minutes of our military bases, as hon. Members have remarked, there is hunger. Among children, there is starvation, and there is little or no sign of aid.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.1/5">The pursuit of the opium eradication policy without any viable alternative strategy merely drives people into the hands of the Taliban. We appear to be destroying the crops only of those people who cannot afford to pay bribes not to have them destroyed. They are the smaller and more vulnerable farmers. For the larger farmers, who can pay the bribes, it is business as usual. Anybody who sees the new houses of police chiefs being built in the area will see where some of those bribes have gone. As hon. Members have remarked, there is little or no development activity. The aid agencies, including DFID, have more or less withdrawn from the south, and foreigners are increasingly reluctant to venture out of their fortified compounds, for reasons that I understand perfectly. It is not for me, sitting here in the comfort of the United Kingdom, to lecture the people on the ground in Afghanistan on what they should do. However, we have not the slightest hope of winning hearts and minds in such a situation. As others have said, the time has come to contemplate alternatives, unless we believe&mdash;I do not know anybody who does&mdash;that things are going so well that we can afford to ignore those who suggest alternatives. New thinking is required.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.1/6">The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East, mentioned the Senlis Council, which has people on the ground in Afghanistan and appears to venture out where most foreigners fear to tread, including into Lashkagar. It recently published a report assessing the first five years of the international presence in Afghanistan, entitled &quot;Afghanistan Five Years Later&mdash;The Return of the Taliban&quot;. I have sent a copy to the Secretary of State, although he may not yet have received it as he has been away. I have also sent copies to the Secretary of State for Defence and to the Minister responsible at the Foreign Office, each covered by a personal note. I hope that somebody will examine the report, because it tells a somewhat different story to the one that Ministers appear to believe. Over the months in which I have tried to interest Ministers in the work of the Senlis Council, it has depressed me that it has been so difficult to engage their attention. That is particularly true, I am sorry to say, of those in my old Department, the Foreign Office, and in the Ministry of Defence. I have had more luck with DFID, as one might expect, and I took some people from the Senlis Council to meet the Under-Secretary of State for International Development.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.1/7">Any alternative strategy&mdash;the report presents the one proposed by the Senlis Council&mdash;must involve local people. I wish to impress upon Ministers that they should at least consider the proposal mentioned by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East, for opium to be grown under licence for the international medical market, although I know that there are practical difficulties. The alternative is more of the chaos that already exists in Afghanistan and is writ large in Colombia, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" name="Paul Flynn">my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> said. We are afraid to discuss the matter because the Americans do not approve, but we must push it up the agenda. Pilot projects must obviously take place before the scheme can be considered viable, and there are practical difficulties, but they are not all that large compared with those of carrying on down the present road. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the experience of eastern Turkey. If a scheme can work there, it ought to be able to work in Afghanistan. I believe that India grows opium under licence, as do half a dozen other countries, but the Turkish experience is the best example.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.1/8">The Senlis Council, which as I have said has people on the ground in Afghanistan in places where others fear to go, is offering to run pilot schemes. If I were at DFID I would be talking to it about that offer. An impressive woman named Norine MacDonald, a Canadian, is in this country at the moment. She has been based in Afghanistan for 18 months, and has just come back after three months there. I urge the Secretary of State to meet her while she is here this week: he would hear a version of events different from that which he is likely to hear from his officials.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.1/9">It is clear from what has been said by anybody with even a small knowledge of the situation in Afghanistan&mdash;my knowledge is small&mdash;that our military on the ground know that the present strategy is not working. Opposition Members have spoken to them, and they are frank about its failure. They are up for change: Ms MacDonald said to me last night that our military are among the most open-minded about doing things differently. The only hope for Afghanistan, particularly the south, is a sustained effort to win hearts and minds before it is too late. The present programme, based partly on the forcible eradication of the poppy crop, which leads to hunger and in some cases starvation, will not work.</p>

	<p pid="b.194.0/1">There is a distinction to be made between Afghanistan and Iraq, and I wish to return to what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" name="Paul Flynn">the hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> said. Although I voted against the war in Iraq because I believed that it was against international law, I certainly supported our intervention in Afghanistan. It was in support of international law and various UN resolutions and at the behest of the democratically elected Government of President Karzai. I am not sure why the hon. Gentleman accuses the Afghan Government of being corrupt. Those of us who have met President Karzai and his Ministers know that they are trying to do as good a job as they can in difficult circumstances, often with not many resources. Many of them have returned to Afghanistan having lived abroad and are intent on bringing security and development.</p>

	<p pid="b.195.1/1">I do not have much time, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1726" name="Patrick Mercer">my hon. Friend the Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer)</phrase> wishes to get in.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.1/2">When, in the last Parliament, the Select Committee on International Development produced a report, we made it clear, as has every non-governmental organisation concerned, that security is a precondition of development. As Sikander Ali of Islamic Relief made clear to us, development is also a precondition of security. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase> said, the two go hand in hand. On the two visits that I have made to Afghanistan, the question has struck me, &quot;Where are the jobs going to come from?&quot; The terrain is inhospitable at the best of times. I believe that someone once said, &quot;When God made the Earth, he had a few rocks left over and decided to make Afghanistan.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.195.1/3">When the International Development Committee was first in Kabul in 2002 we asked people what they thought they could do about jobs. The Kabul chamber of commerce was interested only in importing such things as hair shampoo, and the only export seemed to be carpets. Most of the carpets were going to Pakistan, and traders in Peshawar were making most of the profit.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.1/4">I am glad to say that I have made a small contribution with Chris Beales, whom I first met at the Inner Cities Religious Council and who has been involved with the Afghan diaspora in the east of London. We have set up Afghan Action, which with the help of a DFID grant from the business linkages challenge fund now has a factory and a training school in Kabul. In the next two or three years we hope to train 350 young men and women and employ 140, making carpets to be sold directly to the UK under fair trade principles whereby all the profits will go back into supporting those people. That has required a considerable amount of effort, but with the best will in the world we will train only 350 young people. Thousands need to be trained. We know that the Taliban destroyed many of the orchards and vineyards; one does not have to go far from Kabul to see the scorched earth of the Taliban. A country that used to produce much of the world's dried fruit is no longer able to do so. Answering the question of where jobs will come from will require a lot of focus.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.1/5">Many of us have asked <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1856" name="Chris Mullin">the question posed by the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin)</phrase>, on poppies. The advice of the NGOs in and around Kabul is that it would be impossible to distinguish legal, licensed poppy growing from the illegal. We have a duty to be in Afghanistan and we must recognise that we will be there for a long time. It does not help to take pot shots at the Government of Afghanistan, who are doing the best that they can under the circumstances. We must have more focus on where jobs will come from, because it is not a country with extractive industries or mineral wealth and resources.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.196.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1726" speakername="Patrick Mercer" colnum="196"  time="010:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0003.htm#06101743000474">
	<p pid="b.196.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase>, whose remarks were most perceptive. I also thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase> for securing this debate in the first place. The recent cover of <i>The House Magazine </i>said it all. I looked on with not a little envy, and would like to congratulate him on the example that he has set to many of the rest of us.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/2">Three things have rather chilled me over the past couple of months, the first of which was my visit to Kiev. It is a little known fact but, for whatever reason, about 60 per cent. of the Soviet forces that fought in Afghanistan were Ukrainian. The beggars in Kiev are of a wholly different class from anything that we see even in London. Many of them wear their veteran's caps, desert camouflage and Soviet orders from their times in Afghanistan, and an awful lot of them are minus limbs. Many of them are scarred horribly from the effects of bullets and shrapnel. They are an eloquent testimony to getting it wrong in Afghanistan. I wonder how closely we have paid attention to the lessons that the Soviets learned.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/3">The second thing that worried me was a comment that was made by Mr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the second in command of al-Qaeda. He said, &quot;Don't bother bringing your troops home, there's no need&mdash;there'll be no more Dr. Brydons this time&quot;. I am looking around and wondering just how many people know who Dr. Brydon was. He was the single British survivor from the 1842 expedition. The fact that that name does not necessarily trip off our tongues, but that it does trip off the tongue of an important individual in al-Qaeda, alarms me.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/4">The third thing that worried me seriously was my conversation with some American special forces officers yesterday, who said, &quot;Do understand that the war in Afghanistan is all-out war. Your troops are going there to fight&mdash;nothing more, nothing less. You must understand that the only solution is the destruction and the death of the Taliban.&quot; I do not think that that is correct and, without wishing to criticise our American allies in any way, I think that they have essentially missed the point.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/5">We must remember that our forces&mdash;and by that I do not just mean our armed forces, but our officials, our NGOs, our effort, our treasure and our emotions&mdash;are all driven towards creating the conditions in which the Afghan authorities can govern their country properly and peacefully. We are not there as a force to invade. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes said that he had painted a bleak picture, but I am not sure that he painted as bleak a picture as he suggested. He painted a picture in which there is hope, but in which, above and beyond everything, we must maintain a sense of balance about the campaign, both military and civil.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/6">My big fear is that over the next few months we will allow winter to make us complacent. The fighting will die down. Very shortly we will have some wonderful stories of heroism, with serious awards for gallantry&mdash;possibly Victoria crosses&mdash;to gentlemen who have bravely fought tooth and nail. We may allow ourselves to be distracted and to think that the war, or at least the fighting along the border, is won and that things are probably back on an even footing.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/7">Winter is when things go quiet&mdash;ask Roberts, of the British punitive expedition mounted from 1878 to 1880, which was extremely successful for a punitive expedition, inasmuch as it killed a lot of people. Ask him what happened in the winter. Things go quiet. The farmers and the Taliban retire to their deep valleys, where the satellites and the B-52s cannot get at them, let alone the special forces patrols. The farmers prepare their crops for the next season. It will be easy for the western press to say, &quot;Yeah, things are fine, guys&mdash;let's not worry about it&quot;, but what happens next spring? What happens when we find ourselves without the troops, money or Government direction to take on the next phase of the campaign, both civil and military?</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/8">I am grateful for the presence of the Secretary of State, for whom I have a huge amount of respect, and I would like him to answer one or two questions. The first concerns the delivery of international aid straight to the Afghans via the Afghan reconstruction fund, which is administered by the World Bank. How cleverly are we delivering money into the hands of the Afghans? Forgive me for using that horrid phrase, but if we are to empower the Afghan politician, authority, policeman, soldier, hospital or whomever, surely they must have budgets that they can use and that they can direct right to the spot where the trouble is. We cannot empathise exactly with the problems that face the Afghans&mdash;only they can&mdash;but we can make those in power seem powerful and influential in the eyes of the Afghans only if the money goes to the right places at the right times and is administered by Afghans, not Americans, Brits or Canadians. Can the Secretary of State shed some light on that?</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> made some interesting points about what motivates the Taliban. Are they still an ideological movement or have they become a pragmatic movement? What dialogue are we trying to establish with the Taliban? I appreciate that such dialogue is probably loathed by some of our allies, such as the Tajiks and others, but we must surely be clever in the same way that we were, at times, pretty clever in the 19th century on the north-west frontier. Will the Secretary of State make it clear how subtle and sophisticated we are being in talking to the people who oppose progress inside Afghanistan?</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/10">I shall end on that point, but I roundly condemned the Government's tactic of sending few troops and few guns to Afghanistan when I led a similar debate in February this year. I hope that the Government have realised that we sent too few men, not to do killing and military tasks, but to enable security to reign, the NGOs to do their job and proper, sensible aid to be brought to the embattled people of Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="b.198.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase> both on securing this debate and on making an incredibly good start to it, by laying out issues that only someone of his experience and background could present. I found that extraordinarily helpful. I also thank the Secretary of State for coming to this debate. I want to hear what he has to say and there are important questions to answer, so I shall keep my contribution short. I want to make two comments and then ask some questions.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/2">First, my party supported the agenda for Afghanistan that the Government set out five years ago, but implicit in that support was the commitment of the international community not only to tackle the terrorist threat to the west, but to work together to bring reconstruction and economic development to Afghanistan. We are exceedingly worried at the slow pace at which that project has advanced. Secondly, as others would agree, Afghanistan has in many ways been a victim of the misguided US-UK adventure in Iraq, which has taken military resources, distracted promised investment in reconstruction and, perhaps most importantly, diverted high-level international attention away from what should have been one of the major projects of the past five years.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/3">Some of my questions were asked in another place by Lord Garden, so the Secretary of State will have advance awareness of the issues that we want to pursue, which are about the progress towards reconstruction and development. The Afghanistan compact was agreed in London in January and set down some benchmarks, one of which stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/4" class="indent">&quot;All illegal armed groups will be disbanded by end-2007&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/5">Does the Secretary of State really believe that that can still be achieved? We are all conscious that reconstruction and development are impossible without security.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/6">The compact also says that by the end of 2010 there will be in place</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/7" class="indent">&quot;effective measures...that contribute to the elimination of poppy cultivation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/8">Does the Secretary of State not regard that as rather optimistic when, as others have said, there has been a 60 per cent. rise in the poppy harvest in the past year, when Afghanistan produces 92 per cent. of the world's heroin supply and when the country depends on the export of illegal opium for some 70 per cent. of its gross domestic product? What can the Minister tell us to give us confidence that there has been a genuine shift to alternative livelihoods? Others have raised questions about that and about whether we should consider the licensed growth of poppies for medicine. Will the Minister enlighten us? Can he tell us something about the overall strategy that might give us some reasonable hope?</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/9">The compact states that by the end of 2010</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/10" class="indent">&quot;the National Action Plan for Women in Afghanistan will be fully implemented; and...female participation in all Afghan governance institutions...will be strengthened.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/11">How will that be possible, given that the education of girls, which lies at the heart of that aspiration, is&mdash;at least in the south and the south-east&mdash;being totally undermined? It had seemed to be locked in place, but now schools, especially girls' schools, are being closed because of pressure from the Taliban and local communities. What action are the British Government taking to reverse those unfortunate experiences?</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/12">The Afghan compact requires the Government to raise domestic revenues to more than 8 per cent. of GDP by 2011. It also requires such revenues to cover 58 per cent. of their recurrent budget by that year; that compares with 28 per cent. now. Given the escalating costs of security and civil service reforms, is that realistic? Corruption is genuinely an issue, in part because of how we took control of Afghanistan&mdash;not through conquest, but through alliances with people, many of whom were inherently corrupt and now dominate many of the ministries, particularly at provincial level. The compact obliges the Government to fight corruption, but does not say how. Perhaps the Minister could enlighten us on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/13">An article by Christina Lamb in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of <phrase class="date" code="">8 October</phrase> discussed the turf war between DFID and the Ministry of Defence. A little like the United States Agency for International Development, the MOD wants any possible jobs for young Afghans so that they have options other than joining the Taliban, joining a militia or growing poppies. DFID is looking for sustainable development. We all read that in Helmand province DFID could mention only a few market stalls as its contribution, as it has found the situation difficult. How will that circle be squared? Will the Minister tell us more?</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/14">We also read in that article that the British military, as others have mentioned, are turning to local militias&mdash;renamed &quot;auxiliary police&quot;&mdash;to guard various districts and allow the redeployment of British troops for reconstruction and development. What assurances do we have that that is not a new underpinning for the corrupt and authoritarian powers of warlords?</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/15">The UK mission in Afghanistan has always been characterised as firmly centred on the reconstruction effort. The United States has never been shy of saying that its mission has been one of &quot;search and destroy&quot;. There has always been confusion about the agendas and their priorities. When the US takes command of NATO forces in February, which agenda will take precedence? Can NGOs operate seriously if offensive air power is being used other than as a last resort?</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/16">Other questions have been raised in the debate. I thank you, Mr. Taylor, for the opportunity to speak. I shall take my seat, because so many of those questions need to be answered.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.199.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" speakername="Mark Simmonds" colnum="199"  time="010:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0003.htm#06101743000476">
	<p pid="b.199.0/1">Like other Members, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I join him and other Members in congratulating and thanking British troops for their bravery and commitment in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/2">This has been an excellent debate. My hon. Friend commenced it with an articulate and informative contribution, based and founded on his personal experience. I am sure that the Secretary of State will acknowledge that across the Chamber&mdash;although I emphasise the contributions from the Conservative Benches&mdash;there is real expertise and knowledge, and a genuine concern about what is going on in Afghanistan. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">My hon. Friends the Members for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase>, for Banbury (Tony Baldry) and for Newark (Patrick Mercer) have made significant contributions, in their own inimitable styles.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/3">We Conservatives support the Government's aim in Afghanistan: to prevent the recurrence of a failed state, and the re-emergence of Taliban or al-Qaeda terrorists and the effect that that would directly have on Britain's security. We accept that preventing Afghanistan from becoming a rogue or fragile state is a complex mission, at the heart of which must be the reconstruction of the country in all its facets. The creation of a stable state is challenging, but it is fundamental for regional and global security, for controlling narcotics production, for the improvement of the capacity of the Afghan Government and for Afghan citizens.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/4">In January, we welcomed the Afghan compact, which commits the British Government, other donor Governments&mdash;the involvement of some was surprising&mdash;the Afghanistan Government and the UN to improving conditions in the country. As other hon. Members have said, the key principle of the compact is to give more ownership of the process of development and reconstruction to the Afghan Government and their people. The other key aspect is the improvement of economic development&mdash;a point well made by my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury. Significant benchmarks were set out in the compact, and I should be grateful if the Secretary of State said whether they were being applied and met. Does he still think that they are working and correct?</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" name="Paul Flynn">The hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> made a good point in saying that he did not understand what the obtainable objectives in Afghanistan were&mdash;counter-narcotics, counter-insurgency or nation building? Will the Secretary of State set out the Government's priorities and the order in which they put those issues?</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/6">I shall not detail the expenditure proposed for Afghanistan except to say that the Government have rightly made significant commitments, bilaterally and through multilateral channels, to enable capacity to be built. It should be put on record that it is estimated that during the past five years, since the allied forces' intervention in Afghanistan, 2,000 schools and 70 new hospitals and clinics have been built, and that 4.5 million refugees have returned home. Those significant achievements need to be acknowledged.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/7">However, numerous challenges remain, not only for the donor Governments, including the British Government, but for the Afghan Government, the Afghan people, the NGOs and the aid agencies. Only yesterday, there were suicide bombs in Kandahar and Kabul. Terrible atrocities are taking place on the main highway, as I am sure the Secretary of State is aware.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/8">I am not sure that I agree with one of the points made by the hon. Member for Newport, West. We need to tackle both the supply and demand for opium production. It would not be acceptable to leave the supply side to blossom and grow unchecked. We need to strengthen the Government, civil society, the provision of infrastructure, the development of sustainable public services and the creation of a non-narco economy. All those challenging issues need to be taken head-on.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/9">In some parts of the country there is economic activity and improvement in infrastructure, but progress is being hampered by the deteriorating security situation, persistent unemployment, poverty and corruption. The real key to the issue is that very few Afghans have felt much benefit from the political change of the past few years. Most still live in abject poverty; Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world and is not on track to meet any of the millennium development goals&mdash;so much so that the MDGs in Afghanistan have been added to and put back by five years to 2020. There is a Government in Afghanistan, but they do not have much capacity. They have very little penetration and reach in rural areas among the traditional make-up of Afghan society and the different ethnic groups in different parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/10">I shall not concentrate on security, as other Members have mentioned that, but I should like to make a couple of points. The international community needs to do far more to develop faster the Afghan police force, which is two years off track. There are significant problems. The force is criticised for being fragmented; many police remain loyal to local warlords rather than the national interest. That needs to be tackled.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/11">My hon. Friend the Member for Newark made reference to my next point. Military commanders in Afghanistan are speaking of a small window of opportunity for reconstruction and development in the next six months&mdash;during the winter, until the spring returns. Does the Secretary of State agree that that short window exists? If so, how do he and his Department intend to take advantage of it?</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/12">Will the Secretary of State confirm how many DFID personnel are in Afghanistan? How many, if any, remain in Helmand province? Under what circumstances will he allow them to return, hopefully to start the reconstruction and redevelopment process?</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/13">I should like to make a couple of points about the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. Nine provinces face a critical shortage of drinking water, and the failure of many cereal crops could leave 2.5 million people in Afghanistan facing a chronic food shortage. What thinking have the UK Government and DFID done and what contribution have they made to the latest UN drought appeal? What steps are the Government taking to ensure that the situation does not escalate into another major humanitarian disaster?</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/14">We are deeply concerned that Afghanistan and the Afghan Government are not on track to meet any of their millennium development goals, which as I have said have been pushed back to 2020. What is DFID doing to improve progress towards the targets, and how many of the goals does it expect Afghanistan to reach by the revised 2020 deadline?</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/15">One of the most oppressive features of the Taliban regime is their appalling behaviour towards women. We very much welcome the freeing up and expansion of education facilities available to women in Afghanistan, but there are suggestions that up to 200 schools in Kandahar and 165 in Helmand have been closed for security reasons. DFID and the military must focus on reopening education facilities, particularly those for girls, and protecting female Government employees who work in high-risk areas. When does the Secretary of State hope and anticipate that many of those schools will be reopened?</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/16">I would also like to pick up briefly on cross-Whitehall co-ordination, which was mentioned by other hon. Members. There is no doubt that there have been friction and tensions between the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office and DFID. The inability to agree on how the post-conflict reconstruction period should be handled has led to delay in setting up the post-conflict reconstruction unit. It would be helpful if the Secretary of State would say which Minister is accountable or responsible for the unit&mdash;that is not clear&mdash;and if he could detail exactly what the unit has achieved in Afghanistan so far. All that comes out of the International Development Act 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/17">As well as ensuring the necessary co-ordination in Whitehall, efforts must be made to ensure co-ordination on the ground between various multilateral and bilateral donor parties, the Afghan Government, Bretton Woods institutions, NGOs and civil society. From his direct experience, my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes made some interesting suggestions and analyses in respect of how things must change, and I hope that the Secretary of State will take some of them on board.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/18">I do not want to repeat points that have already been made about opium production except to say what others have said about opium cultivation rising by 59 per cent. The Secretary of State is fond of saying that production fell in the previous year, but he knows that it fell only in terms of acres, or hectares, cultivated, and not in yields. In fact, decreases have been due to bad weather, not to the fact that people have stopped trying to grow the crop.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/19">The production of opium as a potential source of heroin is not the only problem. It is the currency in some parts of Afghanistan, and it meets a demand in the country itself&mdash;it is not all exported. People are robbed of their livelihood, and in some parts of the country those who grow the crops are in serious debt to drug barons and exporters. If they do not produce opium, they often have to pay those debts with their children. There are serious societal issues that must be tackled, and I believe that all hon. Members agree that some fresh thinking is needed in this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/20">Aid is the final issue that I would like quickly to explore. It is estimated that DFID now channels 70 per cent. of its aid directly to the Afghan Government; only 30 per cent. goes through NGOs and civil society. Putting aside for a moment the point that was made by the hon. Member for Newport, West about corruption in the Afghan Government, they do not have the capacity to spend the money on agreed infrastructure and other projects. It is estimated that only 10 per cent. of the available aid money has been spent.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/21">The Secretary of State must focus his Department on ensuring faster yet still effective allocation of money. It must ensure that money is spent by the central Government and, perhaps, through other routes in the more rural places that the central Government have not reached. There seems to be a contradiction in the British Government's strategy, in that they acknowledge that President Karzai's authority and reach are limited to the immediate area around Kabul, yet they seem to be putting more and more money directly into central Government. We know that the Afghan Government do not have the capacity to spend money in the more rural areas to alleviate poverty, which is needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/22">Many NGOs complain that funding from DFID and other donors is being withdrawn. As they are perfectly capable of delivering the services that are required on the ground, I suggest that the Secretary of State needs to revisit the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/23">We hope that very quickly following the establishment of security DFID and other international donors will be ready and prepared to act as speedily as they can. That was one of the main problems in 2001, when the Taliban were taken out in the first element of the military conflict. We must ensure that that does not happen again. It would also be helpful if the Secretary of State would give us his view as to whether and when Afghanistan will be able to survive without such a level and type of donor support.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.0/24">Conservative Members support the Government; we wish Afghanistan to be stable, but that will happen only with adequate necessary resources from both the military and the international donor community. First, security must be provided and then, immediately post-conflict, there must be the reconstruction and redevelopment that will demonstrate to the Afghan people that they are better off remaining under a fledgling democratic state than returning to a damaging and poisonous theocracy.</p>

	<p pid="b.203.0/1">I thank all hon. Members for co-operating in respect of the length of their contributions to the debate. I now call on the Secretary of State to reply for the Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.203.1/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the authority, knowledge and, above all, insight with which he spoke. His speech deserves to be widely read, and I shall return to some of his points in the course of my remarks. I am sure that we are all grateful to him and to all our troops for their service in Afghanistan and for their courage and professionalism in extremely challenging circumstances. That point was made by several hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/2">I welcomed the speeches of all those who contributed: <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" name="Paul Flynn">my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1856" name="Chris Mullin">my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin)</phrase>, the hon. Members for Banbury (Tony Baldry) and for Newark (Patrick Mercer), and the Opposition spokespeople, the hon. Members for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) and for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds).</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/3">I last visited Afghanistan in June and spent some time in Kabul and in Lashkar Gah. I was able to see the progress that has been made as well as how far there is yet to go and the obstacles faced by the people of Afghanistan. The hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes referred, as did others, to the tragic history of the Afghan people, who have been terrorised by 30 years of conflict, widespread poverty, a complete lack of essential services and&mdash;the thing that most forcefully strikes me and other hon. Members&mdash;an absence of capacity.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/4">As has been said, Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world. The most chilling statistic is that one in four Afghan children do not live to see their fifth birthday. One third of those children do not celebrate even their first birthday&mdash;they die before they are one year old. Afghanistan, along with Sierra Leone, has the highest infant mortality rate in the world. Only 47 per cent. of men and 15 per cent. of women can read. The challenge is immense, and the first thing that we must do is be absolutely straight about the scale of it. What has characterised this debate has been the honesty and candour with which all hon. Members have spoken.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/5">The hon. Gentleman also knows the history of British involvement, and that we are part of a wider endeavour with the United Nations and NATO and one of 36 countries contributing to the international security assistance force.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/6">I agree completely with the hon. Gentleman and others who spoke that this is a long-term commitment. The challenge that the Afghan people face in changing their country and therefore their lives will involve a long, hard slog, to use a technical term. That is what we are talking about, and it will not be easy for the Afghan people quickly to undo the effects of the conflict. That is why we must demonstrate a long-term commitment.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/7">I was asked to sum up what we are trying to do. We are trying to help the Afghan Government and people to create a stable and secure country. That is in their interests above all, but it is also in our interests, not least because of the circumstances that led us and others into Afghanistan after September 2001. That is why I say in all honesty to my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West that I do not recognise parallels with Vietnam. I believe that the circumstances are different, not least because we are supporting an elected Government. However, that is not to say that there are not challenges, and I shall return to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/8">We must acknowledge that there has been some progress, and the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness just outlined some of it. A good indicator of whether things are moving in the right direction in a country where there has been a conflict is whether people who fled the country when fighting was going on have come back. The fact that more than 4.5 million refugees have returned to Afghanistan since 2001 is an indication that things are better than they were when those people fled the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/9">The presidential and parliamentary elections have taken place and 25 million people participated. One answer to the point raised by the hon. Member for Richmond Park is that, as she will know, 25 per cent. of Afghan parliamentarians are women. They are doing better than we are in that respect. Some 6 million children have returned to school and a third of them are girls&mdash;I shall come back to the important point about intimidation. Immunisation has saved the lives of 35,000 children and&mdash;this links to the point about jobs that was raised by the hon. Member for Banbury&mdash;in 2005 the legal economy was estimated to have grown by 14 per cent. Private investment has soared from $22 million in 2003 to more than $400 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/10">Road rehabilitation, which is now taking place, will help to connect the major urban centres. One of the most striking things about Afghanistan is how it is decentralised by its geography. It is quite hard to get around. The improvement of communications and road communications will help people to travel, to meet each other and, crucially, to do business so that the economy will have the chance to grow.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/11">The UK is the second largest bilateral donor after the United States of America. We have spent about &pound;390 million since 2001, and that is the fifth largest DFID programme. At the London conference, which was mentioned by a number of hon. Members, the Prime Minister committed us to a 10-year development partnership with Afghanistan, which is another sign of long-term commitment from the Government. That is intended to try to help the Government of Afghanistan to plan for the long term and to invest in schools, hospitals and infrastructure. We are also providing support through the European Commission, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/12">The hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes clearly set out&mdash;the point was also made by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East&mdash;the choice and tension between doing things quickly and building capacity for them to be done in the long term by the Afghans. The hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes used exactly the right word; there is a balance to be struck, and that is what we are trying to get right. The way in which we give our support has led to Britain being described by Finance Minister Ahady as a model donor.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/13">We give 70 per cent. of our assistance directly to the Government of Afghanistan and that is one of the ways in which we can avoid lots of donors doing their own thing, which was the point made by the hon. Gentleman. It is also the best thing that we can do to show that there is an Afghan face to redevelopment and reconstruction. It is about giving the Afghans the tools to do the job. We are the largest donor to the recurrent budget, which covers the central costs such as salaries for teachers and health workers. It is for that reason that the Afghan Government want donors to provide more support in that way. They have acknowledged Britain's contribution, and the point that came across most forcefully at the London conference was a request to other donors to do more of that. The Afghans recognise that that is the most effective way in which, over time, they can increase their capacity to build effective state institutions that will last. Directing funds through the Government of Afghanistan also enhances their accountability and authority. That directly responds to the point made by the hon. Member for Newark. We know that such an approach is the most effective way of ensuring sustainability in the long term. That is why it is a question of balance.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/14">The hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes twice talked about progress being painfully slow and, in some ways, he is absolutely right. We all share the frustration, but we have to accept that if the goal towards which the people of Afghanistan and the Government are working is to be realised&mdash;an Afghan Government, elected by their citizens, delivering health care to people who are sick, education to children, and security in every province of the country&mdash;it will take time.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/15">The hon. Member for Richmond Park asked about the Afghanistan compact. It covers benchmarks that have been jointly agreed between the international community and the Government of Afghanistan. The UN has a job in monitoring it. She raised good questions about the rate of progress and the honest answer is that we will not know whether those benchmarks will be achieved until we reach those dates, but they express a set of targets towards which we are working. The rate at which the Afghans will be able to make progress on meeting the benchmarks will depend in part on security. There are some significant hurdles to overcome; we must be straight about those, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/16">When I was in Lashkar Gah, I went down to the banks of the bright turquoise-blue Helmand river to look at some work that DFID has been supporting. The thing that I remember, apart from the young boys who were having a swim having taken their examinations in school earlier in the day, was that the interpreter who turned up so that I could have a conversation with them and others was wearing a black facemask that covered his face. He had a baseball cap pulled down over his head. Why? It is a risk, in Lashkar Gah, to be seen to be working with the British&mdash;the foreigners.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/17">On the same day, Governor Daud of Helmand and his director of education, who we met in the hotel there, explained that 60 of the 224 schools in Helmand province&mdash;those figures are imprinted on my brain&mdash;are currently shut because of intimidation. Some head teachers have been murdered, as have some students and school officials, because they continue to try to teach girls. When will they reopen? It depends on when they feel that it is safe and secure enough to do so. That is why bringing security is, in my view, the precondition to development.</p>

	<p pid="b.206.1/1">I shall come to that point in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/2">There are 18 DFID staff in Afghanistan overall&mdash;15 in Kabul, one in Kandahar and two in Helmand. The development adviser, subject to the final security review, will return. We have a quick-impact problem manager in the country. There is no turf war between Government Departments; I want to make that clear.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/3">I pay tribute to the bravery not only of our troops, to whom I have already referred, but of our staff, who we ask to work there. Let us not forget that two weeks ago a group of them were in two vehicles queuing outside Governor Daud's premises when someone set off a suicide bomb. They are not people who do not dare to leave the premises to go out and see what is going on. No one has said it today, although others have in some newspaper reports, but that is a monstrous calumny against the bravery of our people who are out there doing their work.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/4">We are trying to balance the quick-impact project money that we have made available, in response to the more difficult security situation, to help the engineers who are out there to deliver things quickly with initiatives such as the rural development programme, which we hope will bring clean water and new roads to 120,000 people in Helmand in 2007&mdash;not because DFID has started to dig wells but because it is finding partners with whom to do such work. We are considering the drought appeal and I undertake to look further into the point that the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes raised about the camp not far from the provincial reconstruction team.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/5">I turn finally to the question of poppies. I accept entirely that the challenge in overcoming the curse of the poppy is a long term one. The hon. Gentleman was right that if a farmer has a choice between growing something and feeding their family and not growing it and their family starving, they will grow that crop. Those responsible should be arrested and the law enforced, but eradication must take place alongside the alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/6">I want to finish on the point about the Senlis Council's report. I shall simply quote the Afghan Minister's comments on legalisation:</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/7" class="indent">&quot;The poor security situation in the country means there can simply be no guarantee that opium will not be smuggled out of the country for the illicit narcotics trade abroad...We could not accept this.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/8">The conversation needs to be had not with me or the Foreign Secretary but with the Government of Afghanistan&mdash;it is their country&mdash;and they have a clear view about the Senlis Council's proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/9">This has been an extremely good debate, because people have spoken frankly, from their own experience, about the scale of the challenge. I am clear in my mind that what we are doing to support the people and Government of Afghanistan is the right thing for the long term. The scale of the challenge is enormous and we must stay with the Afghan people as they rise to it.</p>

	<p pid="b.208.1/1">I am pleased to have the opportunity to debate the subject of housing homeless people. For me, as for most hon. Members, it is not a debate about dry policy but a reality with which I come face to face each week through the lives of my constituents. The old and the young, families and the disabled&mdash;most of them are women&mdash;all come to my advice surgeries with the problems of homelessness.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.1/2">First, I pay tribute to the Government for their record in tackling the problem. We used to have a huge problem with people sleeping rough, particularly in this city. As I recall it, when the Conservative party was in government, it complained about the problem only when Ministers tripped over people sleeping rough on the pavements during ministerial visits to the opera. Chronic homelessness and overcrowding in the inner cities led to the resurgence of TB. We also saw the refusal to recognise the problems of the young homeless&mdash;of 16 and 17-year-olds&mdash;and of the single homeless, and the growth of an army of homeless women and children living in bed-and-breakfast hostels across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.1/3">During the nine years of Labour government we have seen the virtual elimination of rough sleeping, a reduction of 70 per cent. in the number of homeless families and an improvement in the rights of homeless people, especially for the many women who are forced into homelessness as a result of domestic violence. We have also seen a reduction in homeless acceptances by local authorities. The crude measure of homelessness has dropped to its lowest level since the early 1980s. In the Green Paper &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; and in the &quot;Breaking the Cycle&quot; report on social exclusion, the Government recognised for the first time the disastrous social impact of homelessness.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.1/4">Although I shall listen with great interest to what Conservative Members have to say, for all who have had to deal with the Conservative party either in central Government or local government, the tag &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot; rings very hollow when it comes to housing the homeless. However, despite the many achievements of the Government in tackling homelessness, I still see too much of it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.208.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" speakername="Sally Keeble" colnum="208"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0005.htm#06101743000483">
	<p pid="b.208.3/1">The figures for housing completions are a matter of record, and we all know what they are. However, I draw from two experiences. The first was the leader of an inner London council having to house destitute people under a Conservative Government who were vicious in their determination to try to ignore the plight of the homeless. The other is having to deal with a Conservative-controlled council that is equally brutal in how it deals with a number of my homeless constituents. It is a matter of recognising housing need and of properly assessing and meeting it. The Labour party, in government and in local authorities, has a record that the Conservatives could never hope to match, much less beat.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.3/2">As I said, however, despite the Government's many achievements in tackling homelessness, I still see too much of it. Not only that, the homeless people that I see are often the most vulnerable and the most in need of support; the very people whom I would expect to be helped by the state. Homelessness may have reduced, but it has intensified in nature. I shall deal with four particular issues. I know that some of my hon. Friends wish to raise other concerns, so I shall not stray on to that territory.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.3/3">The first is the need to get families with children out of bed-and-breakfast accommodation; the current rules must be tightened. Another is to stop councils making the unacceptable decision that people intentionally have made themselves homeless, and especially to ensure that a proper assessment is made of vulnerability among adults. The third is to stop diverting the homeless into private sector accommodation that is often completely inappropriate to their needs. The last is to end the single room rent. Underlying all that is the need for more social housing to rent. I welcome the recommendations of the Select Committee, as well as the commitment by the Chancellor to increase spending, which he sees as a key part of the spending review.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.3/4">I start with getting families out of bed-and-breakfast accommodation. We have seen a welcome reduction of 80 per cent. in the overall numbers since March 2002. Government guidance is that bed-and-breakfast accommodation should be used to accommodate families with children only as a last resort and only for six weeks. Although it might be possible for some councils to interpret that in a reasonable fashion, that is not the case in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.3/5">My understanding of &quot;last resort&quot; or &quot;emergency&quot; is that someone's house has burned down, or that everything else has been tried and failed. Yet in Northampton, I find that the threat of bed and breakfast seems to be used routinely to deter people from applying for social housing, and it is still used routinely for families who face what might be termed predictable homelessness; families who have been served with notices to quit their private sector rented accommodation because the landlord wants to sell the property, or lone parents with children who are evicted by grandparents or friends who have given a month's notice of their impending homelessness and who have time to find a more acceptable alternative.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.3/6">I shall give some examples of what is meant by bed and breakfast. In one instance, a young lone parent in my constituency was placed in a bed-and-breakfast hostel where, as she complained to me, a relative of the owner rifled through her belongings. She felt unsafe and left, and was promptly branded as being intentionally homeless; she was therefore refused further help with housing. She had suffered a compound series of issues in her previous life, so by any reasonable standard she should have been regarded as vulnerable and in priority need. It would be hard to interpret what had happened to her as intentional.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.3/7">Another example was of someone being refused housing by a local authority but being helped by social services; there was a particular need to ensure parity of treatment between the two groups. A Muslim widow with seven children was placed in a bed-and-breakfast hostel that had no cooking facilities. Because of that restriction, she had to walk across town each day to a community centre in order to cook a meal for her children and then walk back with the cooked meal.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.3/8">Finally, only last weekend a woman with three children came to my advice surgery. She was being evicted by her landlord because he wanted to sell the property. She had nowhere to live and went to the local council, which said that she would have to come back on the day of the eviction and that they would probably put her in bed-and-breakfast accommodation in a town about 20 miles away. Not only would that have made it virtually impossible to sort out her accommodation needs, it would mean disruption for the children; they would not receive schooling and they would also lose their friends. When she was eventually placed in a single bed-and-breakfast room in a hostel in Northampton, she saw it as a real concession; never mind that that she was in a bed and breakfast, with all its attendant difficulties. Frankly, that is being bullied.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.3/9">The Government have to be much more specific about the circumstances in which families with children are placed in bed and breakfast, and about the facilities that they should have. They should ensure that the rules apply equally to families placed in accommodation by the housing authority under homelessness legislation and those placed in hostel accommodation by social services under the Children Act 1989. By whichever route they get there, the same standards should apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.3/10">If it is not possible to be more specific about the circumstances, the Government should take the bold step of completely ruling out bed-and-breakfast accommodation for families. I realise the difficulties that that would create, but we cannot have families with children being placed in unacceptable accommodation. That is unacceptable, as is the default route whereby, instead of being dealt with under homelessness legislation, those concerned are dealt with by social services under the Children Act; that is because they do not have the same safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.3/11">Although the pressure on the numbers of families in bed and breakfasts is welcome, it is one of the causes of the dramatic increase in families in temporary accommodation. In my own region of the east midlands, the numbers have more than doubled since 1997, and the evidence from Shelter on the position of those families is acute. As some of my colleagues want to speak about that, I will leave further description of that problem to them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.210.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" speakername="Andrew Love" colnum="210"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0005.htm#06101743000484">
	<p pid="b.210.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that those who suggest that much of temporary accommodation is of good quality are wrong? The experience of my constituents and, I suspect the constituents of most hon. Members, is that the least good accommodation is generally used for temporary accommodation and most people's experience is very negative.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.210.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" speakername="Sally Keeble" colnum="210"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0005.htm#06101743000485">
	<p pid="b.210.1/1">I completely agree. The problem of instability is profound and has a huge impact on families.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/2">A further issue is that of decision making in terms of intentionality and the difficulty that homeless people have challenging those decisions. For example, there is a woman whose case I have already raised with the Minister's Department&mdash;I have not yet had a reply&mdash;who is disabled, has mental health issues and is a former care leaver who walks with difficulty and uses crutches. She was judged to be intentionally homeless because of an eviction for rent arrears, which she says was due to problems with housing benefit. I have been through the circumstances carefully with her and it seems that her explanation is entirely credible. She is presently living in a privately rented room above a pub. The landlord wants to evict her not, I hasten to say, because of problems with the rent, but for quite different reasons. Her single room is up several flights of stairs and, bearing in mind she walks with crutches, there is no lift and the kitchen is down a flight of stairs, with the toilet and bathroom&mdash;her washing facilities&mdash;up another fight of stairs.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/3">In order to avoid going up and down to the kitchen, she eats what she is able to cook in her room, which is not very healthy. The problems of getting to the toilet are more acute&mdash;I will not go into the details out of respect for her privacy. This woman has survived a pretty horrendous time in and out of care and subsequently a number of other difficult circumstances in her life, yet she is coping remarkably well. I am surprised that she copes at all, despite the fact she feels very depressed about the conditions in which she is forced to live.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/4">There are, of course, procedures that should have ensured that that woman was not left in that position. She is supported by a number of organisations so it is not just me who has heard her story. It is hard for someone in her position to challenge the local authority, especially when there is no one to take on housing cases funded by legal aid in Northampton and decisions simply go unchallenged.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/5">Intentionality officially accounts for just under 10 per cent. of homelessness refusals, but those cases often involve the most vulnerable people who have difficultly challenging flawed or inconsistent decisions. A great deal more work needs to be done to ensure that there is consistency within the decision making process and that decisions are taken properly. The vulnerability of people should be properly assessed and they should be given a real opportunity to challenge decisions. That process might already appear to exist on paper, but in reality, certainly for many of my constituents, it simply does not happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/6">I would also like to refer to the diversion of homeless families into private sector accommodation. I have pressed the Government on that a number of times because it is a real problem for my constituents. Although the Government's intentions are clear, they are not being translated into action on the ground. I still find that constituents who face homelessness are encouraged to go into private sector housing and claim housing benefit before their vulnerability is assessed, instead of making a homeless application. A young couple came to see me who were homeless and vulnerable; the mother of a former care leaver and a young man evicted by his mother with a young child and a second expected. They were diverted away from making a homelessness application towards a private sector tenancy, which they ultimately took. When I last heard from them they were on their second private sector tenancy and facing difficulties because they could only get six-month tenancies and therefore have to keep moving.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/7">Another woman was diverted away from making a homelessness application despite being a victim of domestic violence. She was unable to manage the rent for a private sector tenancy&mdash;housing benefit does not now routinely cover private sector rents&mdash;fell into debt, was evicted for non-payment of rent, and was judged to be intentionally homeless because of the eviction for rent arrears. She was then refused further help. Some of my constituents who are now routinely caught in that situation are paying &pound;50 per month and more on top of their housing benefit for their private rented accommodation with no security of tenure beyond six months. People who are forced to move from one short tenancy to another find it difficult to get work and finding that extra money out of benefits it very difficult. My constituency has very high levels of employment, including among women, so it is not an issue about people wanting to work. If people cannot work it is because of the practical difficulties in their way.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/8">The single room rent means that single people under the age of 25 can only claim housing benefit for a single room. That is perhaps the last matter hanging over from the Conservative Government and is long overdue for change. Research from the Department for Work and Pensions shows that 87 per cent. of all single room rent claimants face a shortfall because of the low level at which the single room rent is paid, usually around &pound;35 per week.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/9">I wish to pay tribute to the YMCA in Northampton for its outstanding work on that and other issues relating to single homeless people in the town. I am concerned about the possibility of funding cuts to what is a life-line service for many young people in my constituency. Not only is the single room rent forcing young people into debt, it is perpetuating the continuation of a sub-standard category of housing that should have disappeared long ago. A home shared by friends is a far cry from a property where each room houses a different person. There are a group of private sector landlords who subdivide and let their properties to maximise their housing benefit receipts: a type of benefit farming that traps the most vulnerable and marginalised in the worst housing whether they are young, single people or homeless families. A change in the rules on the single room rent would help prevent at least part of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/10">This debate comes 40 years after the historic screening of &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot;, which led to establishment of Shelter, and its outstanding campaign on behalf of homeless people. This Government have worked closely with Shelter on many housing issues and have transformed the rights and realities for many families at the bottom of the housing ladder. Despite the great progress that has been made under this Government, my judgment is that a lot of &quot;Cathys&quot; are still out there somewhere with their children, drifting in and out of bed and breakfasts, temporary accommodation and the occasional private sector tenancy. Those who are more resilient have managed to get a home of their own, but for the most vulnerable, there are still wide holes in the safety net and I ask the Minister to ensure that they are closed so that all of the &quot;Cathys&quot; can finally come home.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.212.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="212"  time="011:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0005.htm#06101743000486">
	<p pid="b.212.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase> on securing this important debate. While I respect her temptation to take a side swipe at the Tories&mdash;we can all respect that&mdash;I think that homeless people are better served by raising this debate above the tiresome, tribal debates and squabbles that often take place; homeless people deserve that.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/2">I also entirely agree with the hon. Lady's concluding remarks regarding the single room rent. From my own experience of my west Cornwall and Isles of Scilly constituency of St. Ives, I know that there is a significant problem with the setting of local reference rents generally. Because of the methodology used, they are often set significantly below the rate that the private sector charges for properties, certainly in my area. That leaves many people who are on low incomes, earning and non-earning, facing a significant shortfall between the housing benefit that they receive and the rent that they are charged, in an environment in which private rented accommodation especially is scarce and extortionately expensive compared with incomes, at least in my area, which has the lowest incomes in the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/3">The debate is about homelessness and I want to deal with two matters. One relates to the gathering of the data&mdash;the basis on which we take decisions or Government policy is decided. I had an exchange of letters with the Minister for Housing and Planning a year ago, querying the figures given by the Government at that stage. The theme that I want to develop and the question that I want to ask is whether the Government believe that homelessness is the result of dysfunctional people who have simply failed themselves and that accommodation does exist, or whether there is a malfunctioning of the housing system and the housing market, which I argue is more likely, particularly in an area such as my own.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/4">The impression given, certainly in the exchange that I have had with Ministers, is that homelessness is a problem of data collection and definition. There is a rather patronising centralist view that somehow those stakeholders out in the sticks are not competent enough to establish and operate strategies to deal with the problems. All the correspondence and dialogue that I have had points to a failure of the Department, whether Ministers or officials, to accept that there might be a malfunctioning of the housing system and the housing market that results in pressures throughout the system such that those who are dropping out at the end are in fact properly functioning people who simply cannot be housed because insufficient housing is available for them and their circumstances are not a result of a failure in themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/5">In commenting on this issue, especially with regard to my constituency, I should congratulate a large number of voluntary sector projects in particular. One in which I was involved from the very early stages is called Breadline; it is just up the road from me in Bread street in Penzance. Since 1986, that project has provided very significant help to homeless people and unemployed people in the Penwith area. The YMCA has some hostel accommodation, particularly for younger single people, in the Penwith area. Penwith Housing Concern provides support, advice and counselling, particularly for those who have suffered substance and alcohol misuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/6">The Salvation Army undertakes its own quarterly count and provides us with extremely helpful figures on the people with whom it makes contact and provides support for, and works with other agencies in a very professional manner in the Penwith area. It has recently secured another hostel to assist and relieve the problem locally. Of course, there is also Shelter, with which I was involved before I was elected as an MP, and many other organisations. There are also the local authority professionals in this sphere, for whom I have a very high regard as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/7">In setting the backdrop to my comments on this issue, I should say that I undertook a survey of estate agents in March/April last year, about 18 months ago. I asked very simple straightforward questions regarding how properties had been sold, to whom they had been sold and the prices and the estate agents' estimates, as they are in the best position to give estimates, of the change in house prices and the change in the nature of the market. I found that, in the whole of west Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, twice as many properties were sold to second-home buyers as to first-time buyers. People locally will be not surprised at that; in fact, they will be surprised that first-time buyers are able to buy and get that toehold in the market at all, given the house prices. I will not bore hon. Members with statistics&mdash;those can be trotted out on many occasions and I can supply them to people&mdash;but certainly the average house price in the area vastly outstrips local wages. According to one's source, the average house price is anything from seven to 10 or 12 times local wages. That is not a surprise and it is not a surprise that large numbers of properties are purchased for recreational and investment purposes by people who want to enjoy them as holiday accommodation and for their own leisure and investment.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/8">I am not involved and nor am I interested in the politics of envy. People are of course entitled to buy properties for recreational and investment purposes if that is their desire. However, we need to consider a range of policy issues relating to the impact that that is having and whether we need to change policy, particularly in the area of planning use class orders, to constrain the numbers of properties that can be purchased and converted from permanent to non-permanent residency.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/9">Hon. Members, including you, Mr. Taylor, may be asking yourselves, &quot;Well, what has second-home ownership to do with homelessness?&quot; This is the very point that I want to make. Second-home ownership is having a very direct effect in this regard. If the market is significantly influenced by extremely wealthy people&mdash;wealthy compared with locals&mdash;who can intervene in the market and in fact set the whole tone of it, and if the price regime is largely generated or led by that development, it will inevitably have an impact on families who, 20 or 30 years ago, might have anticipated that they would have a chance of getting into the market. They now cannot and they are looking for the very scarce accommodation available through either the public or the private sector for rent. Particularly in the private sector, such accommodation is not only scarce but extortionate in price.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/10">Further to the survey that I undertook last year, I undertook a survey this summer and found that five times as many properties were sold to second-home buyers as to first-time buyers. That is just 18 months after my original survey. Again, the findings are not a surprise. In St. Ives, for example, an estate agent told me that 60 per cent. of properties were sold to second-home buyers and 0 per cent. to locals. Many people will not be surprised by that outcome, but perhaps it is a surprise and very disturbing to people here to hear that that is the dysfunctional way in which the housing market operates in my area.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/11">Down on the Lizard peninsula, an estate agent told me that 65 per cent. of properties were sold to second-home buyers and 0 per cent. to locals. <i>[Interruption.] </i>I do not know whether you can still hear me, Mr. Taylor, given the intervention from a phantom driller off to my right&mdash;that is not a political statement. I am trying to show a significant connection, relating to how the housing market works for thousands of people, who are unable to express their demand, desire and need for housing in the market place, as they might well have been able to a generation ago, even in an area as difficult as Cornwall.</p>

	<p pid="b.215.0/1">Was not one of the findings of the Affordable Rural Housing Commission that the activities in question were localised in very small areas in the south-west? Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting, as a consequence, that we should intervene in the market place to restrain, somehow, the level of activity in the housing market?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.215.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="215"  time="011:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0005.htm#06101743000488">
	<p pid="b.215.1/1">Absolutely. I do not argue that the problem is a nationwide one. It is clearly localised to Cornwall, parts of south-west England and Norfolk, the Lake district, Somerset and some other places. It is not inconceivable, and it would certainly be acceptable in my view, for the Government to provide local authorities with the tools, if they wanted to use them. It would be appropriate only in areas such as those I have described, where second-home purchases have a detrimental impact not only on the housing market but on such matters as community infrastructure and the viability of schools. There is clearly an opportunity, as the Affordable Rural Housing Commission suggested in its report, not for the Government to intervene themselves but for them to provide local authorities with the tools to do so where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.1/2">In view of the time, I want to return to the issue of homelessness, and to provide a backdrop to show why, surprising as it may appear, homelessness, which is assumed to be an urban phenomenon affecting only metropolitan and inner-city areas, has significantly affected an area such as mine in west Cornwall for the past 10 to 20 years. It has certainly not gone away. Our problem is, first, that the Government do not accept the level and seriousness of the problem in my area.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.1/3">In Penwith alone&mdash;my constituency covers most of Kerrier, Penwith and, of course, the Isles of Scilly&mdash;the count on 14 and <phrase class="date" code="">15 March</phrase> last year demonstrated that there were six rough sleepers in Penwith district. It is the smallest by far of the six districts in Cornwall. The figure for Cornwall as a whole was 11. That is an absurd figure. Anyone who works in the relevant policy sphere will know that that does not at all reflect the seriousness of the problem in the area. The figures that the Salvation Army gave me for that period suggest that the number was in the region of 40. Some of the latest figures suggest that the number remains the same. The official figures that I have had most recently from Penwith district council, despite tremendous efforts by the district and by other stakeholders working together to bear down on the problem, show eight rough sleepers now in the district.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.1/4">Transient people coming to the end of the line are an issue. The district has the image of a place to which people can escape, and that is a theme that certainly has an effect in an area such as my own. However, we also generate a significant amount of indigenous homelessness, and the Government need to take that fact on board. The ministerial response to me on this matter suggested that the reason for the relevant figure was a problem with the statistical measures that were used, or a problem with Penwith district council and its manner of addressing the problem. I was told that officers from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister came down and spoke to local stakeholders, and suggested ways to tackle the problem. All those measures were already in place in the area. There are also 65 people in bed and breakfast. Those are single people, not families. Alternative hostel accommodation is being provided for families in my area.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.1/5">There is a significant problem in the area, and the Government do not seem to want to accept that it is a problem. I believe that they view it as a matter of the statistical count, and of the homeless people themselves, rather than as the product of a dysfunctional, malfunctioning housing market in which pressure higher up leads inevitably to unbearable pressure further down the housing supply chain, so that large numbers of people are homeless in areas such as mine. Those areas need their problems addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.1/6">I hope that the Minister will accept that what I have outlined is not simply a statistical exercise, but is an issue that must be related to the working of the whole housing market.</p>

	<p pid="b.216.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase> on raising this appropriate debate, at a time when we know Cathy coming home is still an issue. I am glad that she pointed out how much has changed and the improvements that have been made, although there is still much more that we can do. I want to discuss that in the brief time that I have.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/2">I took an interest in this issue because, after the 2005 general election, I was challenged, as I often am, by BBC Radio Norfolk, to say what I was doing about homelessness. I held my hand up and said, &quot;Well, not a lot, really,&quot; but I knew then that I had better do something about it, and my researcher and I set to work in the Norwich area to find out how homelessness was created. We visited rough sleepers, soup kitchens, drug counsellors, housing officers and charity chief executives, and managed to get them all together in a room. They were all very well at telling me individually how well they were behaving, but they did not seem to know each other or work together very creatively. That was the lesson that I came away with after my initial six months of study; they really ought to work together. We need a whole city programme in which that happens, and we need to be radical about looking after homeless people.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/3">There is a lot of confusion among the service users, who have been given little help or information by statutory bodies, and who are sent from one charity to another and one hostel to another. There is no standard process for them to follow, and it is no wonder that they fall through the net; in actuality there is no net. There is no way of tracking an individual's progress through the system and no uniform method of assessment and referral. It is difficult to get information about where to go. There is no uniform assessment of needs at all.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/4">My young researcher asked why there was not a website in the city of Norwich, which has had a proud record on housing for years. I know that not everyone uses websites, but that would at least be a slightly creative thing to do in this day and age to enable people to see which places were or were not full. I think that that will happen now.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/5">I have been through all the statistics and have found out that the number of households in temporary accommodation in the eastern region rose by 171 per cent. between 1997 and 2005. I always can be suspicious of statistics and figures, but that one is being heavily quoted, and perhaps the Minister would look into it.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/6">The issue of housing&mdash;the lack of affordable and social housing that affects families across the board, from the homeless to first-time buyers and others&mdash;has already been covered in the debate. I know that the Government are making efforts to increase affordable housing, and I welcome that. The right to buy has crippled the housing stock in Norwich. Both Norwich MPs get many visits on the subject. Nearly half of every surgery is taken up by people who cannot find a home and do not understand why there are empty homes in the city of Norwich that they cannot get into. Some of those people would be quite prepared to go into the houses and decorate them, but there is always some pathetic excuse as to why they cannot use houses that have been empty for a few months or so. That is one problem with the affordable housing issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/7">As an aside I ask this: when we do build houses, could we please think about the environment and climate change? Also, having a bit of photovoltaics around would not do any harm. We could combine the problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/8">The second prong of homelessness has not been touched on today, so I shall spend a minute on that. I want to lubricate the system by which people who are registered as being homeless can be helped. We cannot immediately put people into homes because the homes are not there; I want to address the issue of how assessments are made as to whether people have made themselves homeless. Under section 191 of the Housing Act 1996 the local authority must determine if an applicant is intentionally homeless. The Department for Communities and Local Government guidelines on homelessness say that an applicant is intentionally homeless if they have deliberately done or failed to do something which has caused them to be homeless. That leaves little room for the interpretation of individual circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/9">My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North has illustrated one or two cases, and I will give another. She referred to &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot;; those were the days. Back then, everybody had to watch because there were only two channels, BBC and ITV. My goodness, those were the days; we had to watch political history unfolding in front of our eyes on television rather than skipping and floating around 50 different channels. I have a young male constituent who suffers from depression, which is common in people who are homeless. Mental health problems occur much more frequently than in the days of &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot;. My constituent lived in private rented accommodation and had problems managing his money, which is not particularly abnormal; it happens. He got into rent arrears and lost his tenancy, and he was classified as intentionally homeless. The stringent interpretation of the priority need legislation is leaving many vulnerable people homeless who really should not be and who need our help. The system has to help them. My constituent found it difficult to get local people to take his problem seriously. Legislation and the filling in of forms got in his way, as he found that incompatible with his particular problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/10">I went round and talked to people about the paper-based medical assessments, which people have to fill in. A general practitioner's word is not good enough; a medical assessment form has to be filled in. I met the Norfolk and Waveney mental health partnership homeless mentally ill outreach team&mdash;there's a mouthful&mdash;who told me that the council in the eastern region refused evidence of an applicant's doctor or support workers in favour of these paper-based medical reports. The council relies heavily on the type of medication and dosage in making a final assessment of a person's condition and, therefore, whether they are in priority need.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/11">There is a world-class agency in Norwich called Julian Housing Support, which gives amazing housing support for people with mental health problems. That organisation says that it is necessary to assess people as individuals rather than through a strict medical model that fails to take into account a person's choice to decline medication, and other factors. People with mental illnesses frequently do not take their medication or do what their doctors tell them. Gosh, does anybody in the Chamber do everything that their doctor tells them? I certainly hope not.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/12">I have tabled parliamentary questions on this issue, and was told that it is for a local authority to decide which services to use, and the Department recommends certain agencies as being useful. In friendship, I say to the Minister that we need high-quality initial decision making about individuals. Is the Department prepared to commission research into the quality of these paper-based assessments and withdraw support if they are found wanting? I believe that some of them will be found wanting, and that there may be other ways to get the necessary information.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/13">We know that because of the nature of homelessness, many people find themselves in the same situation on a regular basis. Drug and alcohol dependencies are much more frequent than they were 40 or so years ago. Mental health problems and drug and alcohol dependency mean that there is a whole new problem, which needs to be handled in a new way because of the vulnerability of the people concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/14">I am pleased that Norwich city council now has a full-time private sector facilitator to help people to get into private accommodation, and I congratulate the council on that. I also congratulate the landlords in Norwich on trying to help out. However, we should not spend all our time helping private landlords; we should find other solutions to help the weakest and most vulnerable in our society.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/15">I shall finish by talking about hostels and the problems with them. They are always full, there is no move-on accommodation, the individuals who stay in them become institutionalised, and rough sleepers cannot get a foot on the ladder of rehabilitation. I have talked to Norfolk Supporting People and Norwich city council, which has produced a marvellous document, &quot;A Review of Hostels and Supported Housing in the Greater Norwich Housing Sub Region&quot;, for which I have high hopes. We had a meeting, and somebody from the Department came and gave a presentation about the work being done by the Department's hostels capital improvement programme, which helps to create bright, vibrant, positive, modern hostels. Was not the PowerPoint presentation magnificent?</p>
	<p pid="b.216.1/16">The scheme's mantra, quite rightly, is not more beds, but better beds. Its aim is to make hostels centres of excellence. We need more such programmes to help people, because hostels become full very quickly, and people become institutionalised and cannot move on. We need more of that kind of programme and we need hostels that are supportive and rehabilitative environments in which people can access health and career services and counselling. While the Minister is at it, I wonder if she would give Norwich city council a bit more money. It has good ideas but its homelessness grant is very small.</p>

	<p pid="b.219.0/1">I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Taylor, and congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I come to the debate from the perspective of a Member in the capital with all the housing problems we have here, particularly concerning the homeless, but I understand that there are other perspectives and problems. One theme of today's debate is the fact that homelessness is becoming a significant problem in all regions of the country and that we need to deal with it.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.0/2">I congratulate the Government on making homelessness a priority. Others have spoken at length about the rough sleeping initiative, which has been very successful, but no one mentioned the introduction of the strategy for local government on homelessness, which has focused local authorities' attention on the issue and some of the supply steps that they can take to deal with it. We have also had the extension of priority categories&mdash;16 and 17-year-olds who are vulnerable and people who come from institutional settings&mdash;which has done a great deal to stop people falling through the safety net into rough sleeping.</p>

	<p pid="b.219.1/1">I apologise for not being here at the start of the debate, Mr. Taylor. I had another engagement.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.1/2">My hon. Friend mentioned vulnerable 16 and 17-year-olds. Does he agree that the work of the foyer movement is doing in relation to housing for vulnerable young people is especially important in this country? Does he share my hope that the Government will reconsider the 16-hour rule which prevents some young people, at the age of 19, in foyers from receiving housing benefit, and which makes them choose between education and somewhere to live?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.220.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" speakername="Andrew Love" colnum="220"  time="011:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0006.htm#06101743000493">
	<p pid="b.220.0/1">I agree with all of that. I assume that the Minister will not be able to respond directly on the 16-hour rule. I will add, however, that while the foyer movement is doing an exceptionally good job, there is a real problem with move-on accommodation. That comes back to the homelessness issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.0/2">My final point about the Government's initiative is that we should accept the work that is being done to end the use of bed and breakfasts for families. I would, however, concur with those who mentioned the large amount of emerging evidence showing that bed and breakfast is still used for families in the short term. I hope that the Minister will take that issue back to the Department.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.0/3">I want to look now at some of the continuing problems that we have with homelessness. I make no excuse for focusing to some extent on the situation in the capital, where homelessness is still a significant problem. Nationwide, about 100,000 families live in temporary accommodation and something like 116,000 children are particularly affected, according to Shelter. Although I congratulate the Government on setting a target to halve the numbers in temporary accommodation over the next few years, it is a major task, and they need to redouble their efforts to deal with all the issues involved. Let me just mention some of those issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.0/4">Others have mentioned the time that people spend in temporary accommodation, and the insecurity and isolation that they experience as a result. There is also the impact on the health of many of those who live in temporary accommodation, and it is mainly children who are affected. Finally, families are continuously moved from one set of temporary accommodation to another, especially in London, and the amount of time that children spend out of school has an impact on their education and their future ability to achieve more as part of the next generation. Those are real concerns, which have been expressed right across the board.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.0/5">I want to echo a question that I raised earlier about the standard of temporary accommodation. We are often told that such accommodation is good quality, and there have undoubtedly been improvements. Indeed, there was some very bad accommodation five or 10 years ago, but things have not improved so much that we cannot still say that many people still live in bad accommodation; indeed, three constituents came to my last surgery to talk specifically about the quality of their accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.0/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North talked in some detail about the emerging problem of the rather over-zealous way in which people attempt to prevent homelessness. In particular, they are using the private rented sector for settled accommodation, but many of the people who are placed in that sector have had dismal and negative experiences of it. It does not seem adequate to the task of providing settled accommodation to put such people back into that sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.0/7">When the changes were made to the Housing Bill, mediation was touted as a way forward, and I still accept that 100 per cent., but some local authorities have been rather over-zealous in implementing mediation. It is often used as a weapon to persuade 16 and 17-year-olds whose relationships have broken down to go back into the family or to persuade those in marital situations that have broken down to reunite, when there is no real prospect of securing a settled situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.0/8">I am acutely aware of the time, Mr. Taylor, so let me briefly mention solutions. We must press the Minister on this because we are coming round to the comprehensive spending review, which will give us an opportunity to look at solutions. I recognise that the things that the Government are doing will continue to produce improvements and I hope that we will be able to halve the number of people in temporary accommodation over the next few years. However, we all recognise that we need to go further, and that was one of the major recommendations of the Barker review, which the Government set up. The review clearly showed the slump in the provision of new affordable rented accommodation, and steps must be taken to address that problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.0/9">The Communities and Local Government Committee, in its recent report, which I hope the Minister and the Department are looking at closely, suggested that there needed to be a significant increase in affordable accommodation. However, it also went further. Some of the resources that are available are spent not only on affordable rented accommodation, but on providing low-cost home ownership. I am very supportive of low-cost home ownership initiatives, and I want to see the 1 million additional home owners the Government have committed themselves to creating, but we must look carefully at the balance of resources between the two issues. I therefore echo <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase>, because we need to think seriously about additional resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.0/10">The Government have set themselves a priority for housing, and cross-cutting reviews on housing and growth are going on. Given all the concerns that our constituents have expressed to us, let me therefore make a plea to the Government as they undertake that work. The only real solution to the problems of homelessness is additional supply of affordable rented accommodation. I therefore hope that the Minister will respond on that point and, more importantly, take it back for discussion in the Department.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.221.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1559" speakername="Andrew Slaughter" colnum="221"  time="011:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0007.htm#06101743000494">
	<p pid="b.221.0/1">I will, of necessity, be brief, and I think that I can be because I simply want to make one slightly extended point as a trailer to my own debate on the Floor of the House on Friday. Obviously, that debate will be well attended, as most Friday Adjournment debates are, but I shall try to whip up a little more enthusiasm for it. Its subject is the provision of affordable housing in the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, about which there are some toe-curling and eye-opening things to be said.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.0/2">Today, however, I start with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" name="Andrew Love">the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love)</phrase> about the provision of genuinely affordable social housing, which primarily means social housing, certainly in London. Of course, there are many other issues around <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">the subject raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase>, and I pay tribute to her not only for securing the debate, but for the part that she is playing in getting the issues of affordable housing and homelessness higher up the agenda. That is happening thanks not only to the Minister for Housing and Planning and the departmental team, but to a groundswell of support, certainly on the Labour Back Benches.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.0/3">As I said, there are many issues around homelessness, but in the end, the provision of genuine affordable housing must be the key issue, and the case for it is being made. The Select Committee has made the case, as have Shelter and other organisations. Shelter's campaign for an extra 20,000 units of affordable housing should be supported. In London, that would mean that than 15,000 new units of affordable housing were built each year, rather than 9,000, although the Greater London authority says that the figure should be 20,000 units, and that might be right.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.0/4">The Government deserve all credit for taking away the worst excesses of homelessness since 1997. With the effective ending of bed-and-breakfast provision and street homelessness, the worst excesses have gone, but long-term, affordable, permanent housing has been on the decline for many years because of the right to buy and other measures. The problem for the Government is that a lot of affordable housing is not affordable, and they must not be caught out by that trick. Intermediate housing at &pound;300,000 and &pound;400,000 is not intermediate housing. I fully support intermediate housing where it provides starter homes and takes people out of the rented sector, but I do not support the sort of intermediate housing that is cynically being built under the guise of affordable housing. That is being done primarily by Tory councils, but also by Liberal councils, certainly in London. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1858" name="Michael Gove">The hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)</phrase> looks sceptical, so he must attend my debate on Friday if he wants to find out more about the subject. He defends his case very well and very smoothly, but I tell my hon. Friend the Minister that if the Government are not careful, they will be taken for a ride on this issue; a smooth ride perhaps, but a ride nevertheless.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.0/5">If we want to tackle the problems of homelessness in London in the long term and to build stable communities, as we did after the first and second world wars, there must be substantial investment in genuinely affordable housing.</p>

	<p pid="b.222.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase> on securing this valuable debate. I know that she has spent a great deal of time on this issue. She raised important issues, beginning, as she said, with a full-frontal assault on the Conservative party's record on this subject. She is right to point out that the current social housing crisis was started under the right-to-buy scheme when there was not adequate replacement to ensure that we had the necessary housing stock. The current Government have failed to address that since they have been in office. I look forward to hearing more from the Minister on how they are planning to address it.</p>
	<p pid="b.222.0/2">The hon. Member for Northampton, North spoke about the problem of people still being placed in bed and breakfast accommodation, and the effects that that has on them, not just in terms of their immediate surroundings and the pressures and strains that it places on families, but in terms of location.</p>
	<p pid="b.222.0/3">Intentionality is a key issue. When one talks to local authority officers, one finds that they feel under pressure to be as rigorous as possible in the definition of &quot;intentionality&quot;. I am being generous to them and to the environment in which they are working.</p>

	<p pid="b.223.0/1">Something has not come out in the debate so far. As we have concentrated on families in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, we have missed the growing crisis in this country concerning hidden homelessness. Crisis estimates that there are at least 380,000 single homeless people. Will the Minister address not only those people who are in bed-and-breakfast accommodation but also those who are in squats and on sofas in the homes of friends and family, as many of our constituents are? There is a growing problem because we have an overly rigid system that is failing to deal with homelessness.</p>

	<p pid="b.223.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a very valid point, to which I shall return. When we are considering how local authorities assess homelessness we want a consistent approach: one that consistently reflects the situations that people are experiencing rather than the strictures within which the local authority is working.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.1/2">I agree with the hon. Member for Northampton, North that there is pressure to go into the private rented sector, which undoubtedly has a contribution to make. However, I echo other hon. Members' comments: the approach is not necessarily the one that my party would support. Greater investment in social housing offers far better provision for people's housing needs. She also discussed the single room rent. I hope that the Government will return to that issue. Things have moved on considerably since its introduction, and her party and mine opposed it at that time.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">My hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> referred to the situation in our own region of Cornwall, particularly in respect of second homes. I hope that the Minister will update us on the response to the Affordable Rural Housing Commission's proposal, in line with that of my party, to examine planning use categories and to give local authorities in areas where that matter is a problem the chance to deal with it. I hope that there is a contrast with the approach taken by her colleague, the Minister for Housing and Planning, when she was interviewed in the <i>Financial Times</i> not long after the report came out. She basically said that this was not an issue that the Government were interested in tackling. I hope that the approach has moved on a little.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> referred to the lack of a thorough system of tracking, to be sure of how many people are involved and what the need is. He is right that that could be improved. He also referred to sustainability in housing. When there is investment in new social housing, the fact that sustainable housing in terms of energy efficiency would make such housing more affordable on an ongoing basis for the people who live in it should be reflected. I was glad that he raised that point. He also focused on some vulnerable groups, and that is useful.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.1/5">Other hon. Members highlighted the situation in the capital. It was useful to hear that there will be further opportunity for that to be discussed later in the week. We must be clear that homelessness is much more than rooflessness; <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" name="Greg Mulholland">my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> made reference to rough sleeping. While my party welcomes the efforts that the Government have made in dealing with that, it is clear that there are disputes about the official statistics on people who are currently sleeping rough. As he was saying, we must also focus on the fact that many people live in temporary and inadequate accommodation. There are now twice as many families living in temporary accommodation as there were when the Government came to power. Council house waiting lists have risen by 50 per cent., and 100,000 are officially homeless. Shelter's powerful briefing on this issue said that the real figure is more like 500,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.1/6">We must address homelessness as the biggest blight on the quality of life of the citizens of this country. It is difficult to address health if people are living in inadequate housing. People cannot take educational opportunities that are presented to them if they have to live in intolerable conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.1/7">Families who are placed in temporary accommodation have the constant worry that they will be moved on somewhere else. That insecurity is found in the private rented sector, where people may be on housing benefit and do not have settled accommodation as they have shorthold tenancies of perhaps six months to a year. They do not have the security that allows them to plan further forward and to feel settled in a community. They feel that they are at risk in future of once again finding themselves homeless and having to return to the local authority for assistance. That means that children are unable to establish themselves in schools or to cement friendships, and that can adversely affect their education and wider social well-being.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.1/8">Current Government guidelines state that councils should avoid using bed-and-breakfast accommodation wherever possible, especially for families with children. However, they state that private landlords can be a source of high-quality, self-contained temporary accommodation. I hope that the Minister will deal with how we can get away from short-term accommodation in tackling this problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.1/9">Earlier this year, I tabled a question on Newham's local space initiative, Ealing's safe haven partnership and London and Quadrant housing trust's homeless initiative leasing scheme, all of which are initiatives aimed at bringing temporary accommodation into use as permanent homes and examining new ways of tackling the need for temporary accommodation. I did not get a comprehensive answer, and would welcome further information from the Minister on how many families have been provided with settled homes through those programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.1/10">Single people make up the majority of those living on friends' floors. They are the hidden homeless to whom my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-West referred, and they tend to be low down on councils' vulnerability criteria. We need to address, as a country, what these criteria are and come up with a better standard, so that councils have slightly less scope to come up with their own criteria on vulnerability.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.1/11">One would think that creating new social housing stock would be the obvious thing for the Government to do to tackle this problem, but only 170,000 new social homes have been built since 1997. Meanwhile, the social housing stock has been reduced by a net 500,000 homes and local authority waiting lists have also risen by that figure. We must invest more in social housing and we need to build it as quickly as possible. Some local authorities, such as Liberal Democrat-led South Shropshire district council, to which I have referred in previous debates, have used existing possibilities in respect of section 106 agreements to increase the amount of social housing that can be provided as a result of private development. I hope that other local authorities will take the chance to do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.1/12">We must also tackle the issue of bringing empty property back into use, which several local authorities have been examining recently. I welcome the Government's initiatives on empty dwelling management orders, which give greater tools to local authorities to address that. The solutions are varied, but we must target resources more in the direction to which other hon. Members referred by providing social, rented accommodation which would offer a permanent, settled solution for people who find themselves homeless and would prevent them from having to return to the lack of security in the private rented sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.225.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Williams. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase> on securing this debate. In her speech she showed a passionate and moving commitment to the plight of homeless people. I know from her contributions in the House that the homelessness crisis has been one of her top political priorities and she has helped to force the issue up the agenda. Her eloquence today reminded us of how effective an advocate she is for the vulnerable and those in need.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.0/2">I entirely endorse the hon. Lady's comments about temporary accommodation. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" name="Andrew Love">the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love)</phrase> said, the quality of temporary accommodation in which some homeless people find themselves has improved over the years, but it is still almost always not good enough and not what a civilised society wants.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> mentioned that, to his surprise, the number of people in temporary accommodation in the east of England is now 171 per cent. of what it had been in 1997. I must disappoint the hon. Gentleman because the situation in the east of England is slightly better than in the country as a whole where the number of people in temporary accommodation has doubled. It is 200 per cent. more than it was in 1997. I know that the Government have made a commitment to halve that but if they do so they will only restore the figure to what it was in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.0/4">I pay tribute to the Government's commitment, which is part of their overall worthy and admirable commitment to help to reduce poverty, particularly child poverty. However, we must put the statistics into perspective because the hon. Member for Northampton, North, for understandable reasons as a loyal member of her party, thought it was appropriate to cast aspersions on the Conservative record. I am the first to acknowledge that between 1979 and 1997 Conservative Governments made mistakes, but we should bear in mind two matters. The original steps to tackle the acute crisis of homelessness occurred under a Conservative leadership with Michael Howard's championing of the rough sleepers initiative. In addition, during the early 1990s and particularly the 1980s, Conservative Governments were committed to increasing the supply of social housing. As the hon. Lady almost acknowledged, the record for supplying social housing under Conservative Governments was much more successful than the Government's record since 1997.</p>

	<p pid="b.226.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the right to buy decimated the housing stock in this country? That was a Conservative highlight.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.226.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1858" speakername="Michael Gove" colnum="226"  time="012:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0007.htm#06101743000500">
	<p pid="b.226.1/1">The right to buy certainly ensured that more people had the opportunity of owning their homes, and that policy has now been embraced by both major parties because home ownership is a way of spreading assets more equitably throughout society.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/2">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" name="Daniel Rogerson">the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson)</phrase> said, one of the flaws in the right-to-buy legislation was that local government and other social landlords could not use capital receipts effectively to reinvest in housing. We propose that future attempts to encourage low-cost home ownership should allow local authorities and housing associations to use the receipts from those sales to fund an overall expansion in the supply of housing. That is an appropriate way both of meeting people's aspirations to own and of ensuring that we have more social housing for those who are genuinely in need.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/3">I want to return briefly to what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1559" name="Andrew Slaughter">the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter)</phrase> said. He rightly drew attention to the fact that some housing that is designated affordable, not least in the capital, is affordable only to those who are earning strikingly high salaries. In the strictures that he applied to Conservative local authorities he perhaps forgot that the building of Imperial Wharf in the south of Hammersmith and Fulham occurred with the encouragement of the Deputy Prime Minister and the support of Hammersmith and Fulham council. It is unfair to single out particular local authorities because of their political colour for the part they play in the situation that he so accurately described. That undermined the validity of his important point that when we talk about affordable housing we must ask, &quot;Affordable for whom?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">The comments of the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> were useful in helping to clarify the debate. He invited us to consider whether homeless is a consequence of fractured lives or of a broken housing market. He preferred to concentrate on the failures in the housing market. There are failures, but my analysis differs from his. We must not overlook the way in which some of the most acute homelessness problems result from fractured lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">My right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> was, unbelievably, attacked by Ministers for a speech that he made earlier this year and which became known as the hug-a-hoodie speech. In that speech my right hon. Friend drew attention to the fact that when dealing with crime we must look at social exclusion, social breakdown and the causes of crime. Unfortunately, I am afraid that in their raucous populism the Government sought to undermine what he was saying. What he said about the causes of crime and the importance of social exclusion applies also to homelessness. Factors applying to homelessness include problems of social fracture: family breakdown and the placing of children in care, which is often not the best solution for those who are in desperate need; the way in which we deal with prisoners and the failure adequately to educate prisoners for a life outside when they complete their sentences; the problems of drug abuse and alcohol addiction; our failure adequately to provide services for those who face those challenges and problems; our failure over generations to deal with the transition of servicemen from service life to civvy street; and, as the hon. Member for Norwich, North eloquently said, particularly the problems of those with mental health challenges. Will the Minister give a commitment today that the supporting people programme will be not only protected but enhanced to ensure independent living for those with mental health challenges and learning difficulties who want and deserve independence, dignity and a home of their own?</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/6">Housing charities and pressure groups have said that we must address those issues when dealing with homelessness. I pay particular tribute to <i>The Big Issue</i> and its campaign for a Rolls-Royce service for the homeless. It pointed out that the cost of accommodation if people are kept permanently in a state of not having dignity and independence is a long-term drain on the Exchequer. In the long term, early intervention to deal with the problems of social fracture not only helps to rebuild lives but makes sense for the economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/7">I particularly commend the work of some of our social enterprises, such as the Notting Hill housing trust, which works to ensure that people in accommodation are given skills and the opportunity to save through its schemes, and Thames Reach Bondway, a social enterprise that I had the opportunity of visiting and whose &quot;Moving In, Moving On&quot; programme helps to equip people with the skills required to ensure that when they have a roof over their head they acquire independence.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/8">When mentioning social breakdown and the way in which it contributes to the most acute need, we cannot escape the fact that we need more homes in this country. I was delighted when my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney spelled out at the Conservative party conference the vital need to increase housing supply. We have heard today an interesting and often moving analysis of the difficulties of local authorities and others in allocating housing to those in need. Every hon. Member who is familiar with economics recognises that the different ways of solving the problem all come back to the allocation of a scarce resource. Housing in this country&mdash;not just social housing but all housing&mdash;is scarce, which is why we have house price inflation ahead of the rate of inflation elsewhere in the economy and why local authorities are often forced to make difficult decisions when allocating scarce stock.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/9">Some hon. Members mentioned &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot;. There was a powerful article in <i>The Observer </i>last Sunday by Nick Cohen who pointed out that the problems identified 40 years ago exist today because we are simply not building enough homes to deal with the successor generation of homeless people and successor generation of those who want to get on the property ladder.</p>

	<p pid="b.228.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is making a pertinent case, but if we are to deal with house price inflation and homelessness we must build more houses. One of the biggest impediments to that is the nimby tendency in many constituencies, including, I suspect, that of the hon. Gentleman. What will the Opposition do to persuade local authorities throughout the country of the necessity of building more houses?</p>

	<p pid="b.228.1/1">I do not like the term &quot;nimby&quot;, but I also do not like the attitude to which the hon. Gentleman refers, which is a belief that we should attempt to restrict the increase in housing supply that this country needs. The political leadership shown by my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney is part of that process, but the Government have a part to play, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.1/2">The hon. Gentleman mentioned my constituency. In my constituency I have been campaigning to ensure that the special protection area status and the habitats directive, which English Nature has enforced, producing a moratorium on house building, are lifted. I am a Conservative MP, campaigning for more homes in my constituency, who is being frustrated by the way in which Government rules apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.1/3">I shall be interested to hear the Minister's proposals for changing local government finance and the planning system to ensure that we increase supply. We should not wait until the pre-Budget report. I should like to hear now the changes that she plans to implement to ensure that housing supply increases.</p>

	<p pid="b.228.2/1">As ever in such debates, there are many questions and not much time to answer everything, so I apologise in advance to hon. Members to whom I shall not be able to respond in detail.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.2/2">I want to try to respond specifically to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">the issues that my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase> raised. I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate and on continuing to raise an issue that is clearly of great concern to her in her constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.2/3">The Government have a strong record on tackling homelessness, and I am grateful for the opportunity to set out some of our achievements and aims. The latest quarterly homelessness statistics showed that numbers of new cases of homelessness have fallen to levels not seen since the early 1980s, continuing a trend that started at about the beginning of 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.2/4">The latest statistics show that we are also making good progress in reducing the number of households in temporary accommodation, which is too high. At about 94,000 households, the number is 7 per cent. lower than at the same time last year. We have a target to halve that number by 2010, which we are determined to achieve. Although the level is decreasing, we have done much to minimise the negative impact of homelessness, so that 85 per cent. of households&mdash;92 per cent. of households with children&mdash;in temporary accommodation are in self-contained homes with their own bathroom and kitchen.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.2/5">On coming into office, the Government were quick to get to grips with the worst manifestations of homelessness. In 1998, the Prime Minister set a target to reduce rough sleeping by two thirds by 2002. It was met one year early and to date it has been sustained, reducing numbers from 1,850 to about 500. In 2002, the Government set a target to end by March 2004 the use for more than six weeks of bed-and-breakfast hotels for families with children. It was ambitious, many said it could not be done, but the target has been met and sustained.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.2/6">We have achieved those successes by continuing to invest in the prevention of homelessness. I shall return to that issue, because it is important. We have invested &pound;200 million over the three years to 2007-08. That includes investment in rent deposit schemes to enable households to find good quality accommodation in the private sector, if that is what they want, and investment in mediation services to resolve family and relationship breakdown and enable young people to remain in the family home.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.2/7">In 2002, we also strengthened the homelessness legislation, providing one of the strongest statutory safety nets in the world for homeless households, and requiring all local authorities to draft a strategy to prevent homelessness and provide accommodation and support. Although I am proud of our record of achievement, I am confident that we can do more.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.2/8">I shall turn to the specific issues that my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North raised, because we have been concerned about issues in Northampton. The report of an inspection in 2005 said that housing services provided</p>
	<p pid="b.228.2/9" class="indent">&quot;a fair, one-star service that had uncertain prospects for improvement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.228.2/10">The housing inspectorate is carrying out a progress check on the housing service to analyse the progress that has been made since that report. The findings will contribute to the overall progress assessment that the Audit Commission issues in January 2007. On the positive side, there has been an improvement in homelessness figures.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.2/11">Several hon. Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" name="Andrew Love">my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love)</phrase>, raised an important issue about the quality of temporary accommodation. He is right: it is not only about what is provided, but the quality of what is provided. We have issued statutory guidance to local authorities, and as I said, 92 per cent. of families with children are now in self-contained homes. However, we are not content, so we are conducting a survey of 2,500 households in temporary accommodation to understand more about their experiences. We shall issue that report towards the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.2/12"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">My hon. Friends the Members for Northampton, North and for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> raised the issue of intentionality. All councils are required to assess applicants in accordance with the legislation, and we monitor that to see whether there is any difference in the statistics on people who are identified as intentionally homeless. The statistics have remained steady, so we are not picking up concerns about that issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.230.0/1">Does my hon. Friend think that families placed in bed and breakfast by social services under the Children Act 2004 should have the same safeguards as those people placed in bed and breakfast by housing authorities under the Homelessness Act 2002? I have had cases in which people placed by social services have stayed in bed and breakfast for 18 months.</p>

	<p pid="b.230.1/1">That is a concern, and I shall take it back to my Department. We need to address it with the Department for Education and Skills, and I shall to write to my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/2">The Government set up their homelessness system to prevent homelessness. I am sure every hon. Member agrees that it is better to prevent homelessness than to have to deal with it. Homelessness legislation was always intended to be a safety net, and not the main route to social housing. Good practice says that people should be given a choice, and that may include the private sector. Many people live quite reasonably in the private sector, and it is an option.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/3">It is also important that if families are at risk of homelessness, whether in the private sector or anywhere else, they talk to their councils early on, because measures exist to enable housing authority assistance. On the issue of the gap between the market rent and housing benefit, discretionary housing payments can be used temporarily to allow more suitable and affordable accommodation to be found. Single room rent is a matter for the Department for Work and Pensions, but we continue to work together.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">The hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase>, whose constituency I recently visited, raised the issue of the whole system. My Department, with the Government offices for the regions, supports local authorities so that they can improve their strategic housing role. They must consider not only the social market, but the whole market and how it works.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North raised the issue of hostels. They are funded through the supporting people programme, as he identified, which requires staff to assess support needs and construct support plans that supporting people commissioning groups then monitor. We are not complacent about hidden homelessness. We are considering other ways of identifying it, such as measuring overcrowding in concealed and shared housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/6">I do not have much time, but <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1858" name="Michael Gove">the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)</phrase> should not give me lessons on the problems of homelessness. I worked in social services for 16 years under a Conservative Government. The hon. Gentleman rightly identified the problematic issues and their causes, but for anybody who had to turn away 16 and 17-year-olds without accommodation or funding, or who at half-past 10 at night had to phone a housing officer to look for accommodation for a mother with three young children, there were no answers under the previous Conservative Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/7">Too many households live in temporary accommodation, but we have a strategy in place which I believe will succeed in meeting our target to halve the number by 2010. We are committed to delivering a wide range of preventive services, increasing homelessness grants to local authorities and voluntary sector agencies by 23 per cent. by 2007-08, helping 1.2 million vulnerable people sustain independent living through the &pound;5 billion supporting people programme over three years to 2007-08, providing 75,000 new social rented homes between 2005-06 and 2007-08, and building an extra 10,000 social homes a year by 2008. We will also invest &pound;90 million to improve hostels and their services, and help rough sleepers make a permanent move away from the streets.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/8">In conclusion, I thank all Members who have participated. This is an important area. The Government are not complacent, and we are doing more, including ensuring that a greater number of homes and affordable homes are built throughout our country.</p>

	<p pid="b.232.1/1">This is an issue close to my heart, and it is a privilege to be able to discuss it under your chairmanship, Mr. Williams.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/2">It is an unfortunate fact of life that for at least a generation, perhaps longer, the great city of Belfast, part of which I have the honour and privilege of representing, was known to most of my colleagues in the House and most of the public for one thing only: the violent and futile conflict between its people. I hope that that conflict is now resolved. Had I been making this speech 50 or 100 years ago, the city would have been known for something very different. It would have been recognised as one of the most vibrant and successful manufacturing and trading centres in these islands. Indeed, when the Harland and Wolff shipyard was at its peak, Belfast was known as a global centre of manufacturing and trade. We had not only that shipyard but a massive ropeworks and Mackie's foundry, to name but a couple, each employing more than 8,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/3">At the centre of all that success were Belfast lough and the port of Belfast. At that time the natural resource provided by the lough and the port, and our wise management of it, gave Belfast a strategic advantage over the rest of the region. That advantage has been the bedrock of the city's economic life since the earliest days of Belfast, when it was a small community founded at the mouth of the Farset river and known in Gaelic as B&eacute;al Feirste; the mouth of the Farset.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/4">Officialdom's attitude to the port down the years has often reflected closely the quality of life in Northern Ireland and the expectations of people living there. When things were bad throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the port was largely left to its own devices. The priorities of that time were different from today's, with a few notable exceptions; individual Ministers sent from this House to administer government in Northern Ireland focused largely on containing a deteriorating security situation and then, in their own interests, getting out of there as quickly as possible to a better job in government. Through that difficult period, the port of Belfast continued to do its job, giving the enduring businesses that still operated there a reliable, economical link to the outside, normal world of commerce. It was a commercial success at a time when we had few successes.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/5">In the 1990s, the peace process began to emerge. Life and business made their first faltering steps back to normality and the people of the region began to hope and expect that the quality of our lives would improve. As part of that process, the Belfast harbour commissioners examined the port's facilities carefully, and wisely began to invest heavily in improving them to ensure that the port could capitalise on the improved business environment around it. That the harbour commissioners continue to take seriously the role that they have taken on is reflected in the projection that between 1995 and 2010 they will have invested a massive &pound;250 million in developing the port and the harbour estate around it. Amazingly, and as an obvious benchmark of the port's success, that investment has been achieved without any direct expense from the public purse.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/6">I wish also to mention another organisation close to my heart; the Laganside Corporation. It was established in shadow form in about 1987 and went live under legislation passed early in 1989. It did some of the greatest work that our city has ever seen and was innovative and successful. It played a major role in reminding the people of our city of their connection with and reliance on Belfast lough and the River Lagan, which flows into it. The Laganside Corporation took over wasteland and waste docklands that people never dreamed would be of any use again. With appropriate infrastructure investments it turned hundreds of acres of worthless land into land for which anything up to &pound;1 million or &pound;2 million an acre is paid today. By bringing people back to the water and bringing the waterside of Belfast back to life, Laganside raised public awareness of the port's key role and reminded us all what an amazing resource it had been and continues to be for our future.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/7">It is a matter of deep regret to me and to many of those interested in the improvement of the welfare of Belfast that the Laganside Corporation is shortly to be wound up despite the fact that much of its work remains to be done. Yes, an exit strategy was designed all those years ago when the body was set up, and it was intended to survive for only 15 or 18 years, but it has done such an outstanding job and there is still so much more to do that it should not be wound up. I will continue to bring the need for an immediate and effective successor to the attention of the House in the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/8">The greater awareness created by the Laganside Corporation and the waterfront developments meant greater scrutiny of the work of the port and the challenges that it faced. In 1998 a report issued by the Department of Education, as it was then, covered some of the issues involved and concluded that Northern Ireland's trust ports, of which Belfast is one&mdash;there are others in Derry and Warrenpoint&mdash;should be granted greater financial freedom and more powers to do their work.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/9">In 2001, a Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly, chaired by my party colleague Alban Maginness, carried out a detailed assessment and came to a similar conclusion: that things should be loosened up and that the enormous potential of the port could be achieved, and the potential benefits to the people realised, only if it remained a fully accountable trust port but with greatly extended powers to give it the financial and managerial flexibility to compete successfully with its competitors in Britain and the Republic of Ireland. I regret to say that the bulk of the recommendations in that Assembly report have been ignored. None of the necessary extended powers recommended was ever implemented. Instead, in 2001 the Office for National Statistics required that trust boards be classified as public corporations. That regulation eventually came into effect in 2005. The already restricted regulatory environment in which the port operated was further tightened and the clearly expressed will of the Assembly and the devolved Government ignored.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/10">Against that background, four months ago the Department for Regional Development published a public consultation document on the powers, status and governance of public trust ports in Northern Ireland. The Department has considered ports policy in parallel with a UK-wide consultation, and the report follows a lengthy period of debate. Unsurprisingly, the debate and uncertainty do nothing to improve our facilities or give the trust ports the freedom that they need to develop the appropriate infrastructure and help us to compete.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/11">Before I briefly consider what I would like to come out of the exercise, I want to look at the current state of the port of Belfast. By any financial measure, Belfast is one of the most successful and efficiently run ports in these islands. Only last month the port of Belfast was named Irish port of the year at the transport and logistics awards. It is by far Northern Ireland's largest port and a strategic asset for the entire island of Ireland. It handles 60 per cent. by volume of Northern Ireland's seaborne trade and 20 per cent. by volume of the trade of the island as a whole. The port of Belfast handles &pound;19 billion of trade annually, in which is contained 25 per cent. by value of the goods coming from and going to the whole island of Ireland. The port is a significant gateway for trade and the economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/12">Apart from being Northern Ireland's most important gateway for trade, the port is an economic catalyst and contributes significantly to its principal stakeholders, namely the Government, port users and the wider economy. Any failure of the port to develop to meet the demands that are placed on it would directly impact on thousands of businesses, big and small, and tens of thousands of workers who rely on it directly and indirectly for their jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/13">The port of Belfast is also one of Northern Ireland's key infrastructure developers. It has facilitated some of Northern Ireland's most important economic urban regeneration projects, including the Odyssey complex, the Northern Ireland Science Park, Clarendon docks, Sydenham business park, Belfast city airport, which was built on port land, Hollywood exchange and, last but not least, Titanic quarter, where 25,000 homes will be built over the next 25 to 30 years. The total gross development value of Belfast harbour estate projects since 1991 is &pound;700 million. The Federation of Small Businesses made something of an understatement when it said in a recent submission that it was questionable whether those sums and those projects could have been achieved under a totally public sector model of governance.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/14">As the port of Belfast has succeeded, so too has the Exchequer. I understand that in the past 10 years around &pound;34 million has been paid by the port in corporation tax and that &pound;10 million has been paid in rates by the port and the port's tenants&mdash;that is, people who have leased land off the port. I am told that, all in all, the port supports somewhere in the region of 175,000 jobs in industries not only right across Northern Ireland, but in a big slice of southern Irish territory as well. However, to deliver the regional economic growth that I and others in Belfast want, it is estimated that 69 per cent. more capacity is required in the next 19 to 20 years, to 2025.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/15">It is essential, not only for Belfast and Northern Ireland, but for the island of Ireland&mdash;particularly the northern half, within the Belfast port catchment area&mdash;that we move to achieve the capacity required to do the business. I see a major opportunity in the review for Belfast, Northern Ireland and the northern half of the island of Ireland finally to implement the Assembly's recommendations of five years ago and to allow the port to develop into a major strategic asset that can take the city of Belfast to a new level strategically and economically.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/16">One example of the strategic opportunity that exists is the potential for transatlantic freight. Ireland does not currently have a transatlantic freight terminal. However, as the economy continues to race ahead and the north finds it feet for the economic boom that can and will follow the restoration of devolution, the case for a transatlantic freight terminal on the island becomes more and more compelling. Realistically, there are only two sites for such a development, Belfast or Cork. I believe that the choice should be Belfast; there is no surprise in that. With the investment in the roads network between Belfast and Dublin, the port of Belfast can come genuinely to compete with the port of Dublin in both revenue and Ireland-wide importance. In many ways the port of Dublin is choked, and serious discussions are taking place about relocating it away from the city centre, because the large vehicles trying to access the port are in conflict with a city that is bursting with all sorts of new technology projects and so on.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/17">That brings me back to the review. We must do whatever is necessary to ensure that the potential success is realised. The first and most obvious answer is that the port of Belfast and more generally all Northern Ireland trust ports require the end of public corporation status and the long-awaited granting of fuller commercial powers. It is widely recognised that public corporation status is incompatible with the commercial realities of running a modern port, because it subjects organisations that are run in the commercial world to a public sector regime and the inherent Government controls that that entails. I am all in favour of transparency and openness, but it is vital that the ports should be freed up to do the job quickly and efficiently.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/18">Ports trade commercially, and they generate their incomes and finance capital expenditure commercially. They have no preferential access to public sector spending. Commercial operations are required to be flexible and agile, and ports need decision-making processes that are at odds with much of public sector control. Trust ports need to be fully accountable to the public, but that is achievable without labelling them with the wholly inappropriate title of public corporation. All the trust ports in Northern Ireland share that view, and I understand that they have provided detailed proposals to the Department for Transport on getting the balance right between accountability and financial flexibility. I call for those proposals to be adopted. It is vital that any conclusion drawn from the review should finally give the port of Belfast the commercial, managerial and financial freedoms that it requires to address the needs of the Northern Ireland economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/19">That is only half the story, however. I am concerned that the recent review also reopened a debate about what appears to be the privatisation of the port of Belfast land bank, creating the possibility of the port being stripped of its assets. However, free land in and around the port appears to be limited. Most if not all the land is tied up in leases lasting for 100 to 150 years from now. The concerns and anxiety about the implied threat has destabilised our situation. Access to that land is essential in the public interest. The port is a public organisation, and the public interest has to be kept at a high level.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/20">To those who wonder why the port of Belfast should be the city's largest land holder, I would say that the public interest in the harbour estate is protected by legislation enshrined in the previous Assembly. Again, much of the harbour estate was created at the port's own expense as the harbour extended. The port started small in the heart of the city, but as it needed deeper and deeper water it moved out and developed reclaimed land from Belfast lough. My figures suggest that 97 per cent. of the non-port land supports various forms of useful economic activity. Some 2 per cent. of the land was released for other uses in April 2006, and 1 per cent. is unusable. It would be wrong to interfere unnecessarily with the activities of the port and the success that it has been. Indeed, my opinion on that seems reflected and supported by no less an expert than the Minister with responsibility for shipping, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" name="Stephen Ladyman">the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)</phrase>, who said this to the ports policy review conference:</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/21" class="indent">&quot;We're not in the business of 'fixing things that ain't broke'. Any future policy will be grounded on the evidence of what does or doesn't work in practice.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/22">I say to that Minister, and his colleagues in the Northern Ireland Department of Regional Development, that the port of Belfast is not &quot;broke&quot;. It needs to be retuned and given more flexibility, freedom and scope to act commercially. It is delivering substantial benefits to the Northern Ireland economy and is well placed to gear up for future challenges. All Belfast wants is for the sentiment expressed by the Minister at the conference to apply equally to all UK ports. If that does not happen, the ability of Belfast port to prepare for and service the substantial anticipated economic growth will be hindered. In the short term, breaking up the port would yield some financial benefits but it would create obstacles in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/23">Massive investment will be required to build new quays, berths and deeper channels to accommodate growing international trade and a new generation of larger ships that, I hope, will use the port. The required investment will come relatively easily if the port has greater commercial agility and the ownership of the harbour estate is protected.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/24">At the beginning of my contribution, I remarked that until 50 years ago, Belfast was known as a centre for manufacturing and trade. If we make the correct decisions for the port now, Belfast will be able to resurrect itself as a centre for manufacturing and trade. Some 95 per cent. of all our trade is seaborne; I repeat that, by volume, Belfast handles 60 per cent. of Northern Ireland's trade and 20 per cent. of the whole island's trade.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/25">If time were available, I would add much more, but I shall leave the issue here. I call on the Minister to state whether he shares my vision of the potential of the port of Belfast. I welcome his views on the issue, whether he agrees with me or not, because we must have a serious debate on the port before any decisions are made that could put a positive and successful economic future at risk.</p>

	<p pid="b.237.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Williams. This is the first such occasion since you were elevated to the Chairmen's Panel. It is a pleasure to see you ensconced at the heart of the British establishment, where you definitely belong.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.0/2">It is also a pleasure to respond to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1402" name="Alasdair McDonnell">the debate secured by my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South (Dr. McDonnell)</phrase>. I say right off the bat that I entirely share his vision of a thriving, prosperous and successful Belfast port and harbour. I entirely get the message that the harbour is important&mdash;and not only in its own economic terms, nor only for the economic development of south Belfast and the city of Belfast. It is vital to the economic development and future prosperity of the whole of Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.0/3">As my hon. Friend knows, we are now looking at the responses that came in as part of the ports review. I am a bit constrained in outlining the way forward, because we need to consider what people have said as part of the consultation process. My hon. Friend's contribution today is an important part of that process and we shall take his points seriously.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.0/4">At the beginning of his remarks, my hon. Friend spoke movingly about Belfast's proud industrial heritage and past and the centrality of the docks and port in building the city's prosperity in the last century. From my conversations with him on this subject here and in Belfast, my hon. Friend knows that I entirely share that vision of the importance of the port in the industrial present, not only the industrial past.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.0/5">Like my hon. Friend, I come from a port town&mdash;much smaller than Belfast&mdash;that has a proud shipbuilding history, now sadly almost gone. However, it continues to thrive as a port. People who, unlike me and my hon. Friend, do not have day-to-day dealings with ports and harbours simply do not understand their enormous commercial potential in this day and age. More and more freight is travelling the world on larger and larger vessels and more and more people are going on cruises and so on. The potential of ports is greater today than it has been for a long time. People who do not have many dealings with them do not understand that; they think that ports belong to the 19th century. My hon. Friend and I know that that is not the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.0/6">I should like to pay tribute to Frank Cushnahan, the outgoing chairman of the Belfast harbour commissioners, who has worked very hard during many years of involvement with Belfast. He is retiring, but only in the sense that he will not be chairman for much longer&mdash;he is certainly not &quot;retiring&quot; otherwise, but comes forward to express his views on what should happen in Belfast. He has done a great deal to advance the cause of the port of Belfast and I wish him a long and happy retirement.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.0/7">I do not want to go over every bit of ground covered by my hon. Friend, but it is important to understand the scale of Belfast port and harbour to understand the seriousness of the decisions that the Government will have to make on its future and that of others in Northern Ireland. The eight miles of Belfast port's quays occupy 2,000 acres. The port has 1.2 million sq ft of warehousing and 100 acres of terminals. As my hon. Friend rightly reminded us, two thirds of Northern Ireland's seaborne trade and a quarter of that for Ireland as a whole is handled by the port. It is doing very well and going from strength to strength. It is the busiest ferry port in Northern Ireland, ferrying 1.2 million passengers, many of them lucky enough to be going to Scotland. I join my hon. Friend in paying tribute to the port for garnering the title of Irish port of the year at the recent awards ceremony.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.0/8">My hon. Friend is right to highlight the fact that standing still is not an option for the port of Belfast; this era of globalisation, developing trade, changing ship design and changing business processes means that the port has to evolve and change. My hon. Friend highlighted one model that he thinks would serve that change process, but there is no difference between us&mdash;we both believe that the port of Belfast, although currently successful, has great potential into which it can grow. We must find the right mechanism to unlock some of that potential and allow the port to flourish to an even greater extent.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.0/9">I am happy to acknowledge the Belfast harbour commissioners' response: their five-year, &pound;140 million capital expenditure programme, delivering new terminals, new logistics facilities and new container capacity. I look forward to seeing those developments emerge, albeit from this side of the water.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.0/10">Belfast port is successful, thriving and crucial to the well-being of Northern Ireland. In that context and as part of the review, we are giving consideration to the power, status and governance of the public trust ports such as Belfast to ensure that they are appropriate for their crucial role.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.0/11">Time is short, so I shall cut to the model raised by my hon. Friend: giving extended commercial powers to the port, as recommended by the Assembly and the Executive. My hon. Friend was fair enough to acknowledge that that was part of a package on tighter public accountability. He knows that all that was caught up in and affected by the ruling by the Office for National Statistics that certain trust ports should be considered as public corporations for public expenditure purposes. There is a dilemma at the heart of that: if ports are to remain public corporations, how do we give them greater commercial freedom while ensuring that there are public lines of accountability? That is one of the options outlined in the ports review and it is under consideration. It is not the only one; on this side of the water, there are many examples of privatised ports that do an excellent job of developing their facilities&mdash;and, in a sensitive way, the associated land bank&mdash;for the economic benefit of people who live around them. There is not simply one available model. We have to look at the special circumstances of Belfast port. We also have to ensure that we design a model that is appropriate to all the trust ports in Northern Ireland. Of course, the specific circumstances of Belfast port would automatically read across to the other trust ports, but it is the largest one and is absolutely central to this discussion.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.0/12">The Government take seriously my hon. Friend's advice. We will reflect on the model that he proposed and in due course introduce plans that will unlock the greater potential of Belfast port, as we entirely share his vision for it.</p>

	Youth Service Funding
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.239.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" speakername="Paddy Tipping" colnum="239"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0009.htm#06101743000508">
	<p pid="b.239.1/1">It is a great pleasure to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Williams. I know that you take an interest in the youth service, which is an important service. I am pleased to have this opportunity to praise the work of youth service workers and to draw attention to funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/2">I want to make an opening remark about young people. If one were to believe the tabloid press, one would think that young people were difficult and a threat to our society. I believe that they are a force for change. Young citizens can make a real difference to our society, and it is important to praise them rather than constantly criticise them.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/3">It is also important to praise the work of the many people who work in the youth service and who provide a range of avenues for young people's development. I am pleased that the Government recognise the work of the youth service. After all, in recent years they have commissioned a great number of publications and reports about it. Let me highlight some of them: &quot;Transforming Youth Work: Resourcing Excellent Youth Services&quot; in 2002, and &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; in 2003, followed by &quot;Youth Matters&quot; in 2005, the same year in which Ofsted's report, &quot;Effective Youth Services&quot;, came out. More recently, &quot;Youth Matters: Next Steps&quot; was published this year. In July, the Department for Education and Skills and the Treasury working together made an important statement about the need to introduce proposals in respect of the youth service during the comprehensive spending review. I welcome that&mdash;it is a real opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/4">All those reports accept the value of the youth service. It can reduce antisocial behaviour and crime, help reduce truancy&mdash;I have personal experience of projects that get youngsters back into school&mdash;and tackle social problems such as drug misuse and teenage pregnancies. Most importantly, good youth work involves young people, makes them active citizens and gives them an opportunity to debate not just society and international affairs but how tangibly they can affect local governance.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/5">In a way, all those outcomes can be measured, but one of the real issues for the youth service is that a good deal of its work cannot be measured quantitatively. Much of the youth service centres around building personalities and developing young people. It is about the relationships that exist between youth workers and young people. In effect, we are talking about a qualitative rather than a quantitative relationship, and one of the areas of social policy that we need to do further work on is being clearer about how we measure qualitative relationships. Of course, one of the ways to do it is to ask young people themselves. When asked, they give a resounding cheer for the youth service. They see it as an important project and sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/6">I am pleased that the Audit Commission in its report &quot;Misspent Youth&quot; suggested that for every &pound;1 that is invested in the youth service, a corresponding &pound;8 is spent in the voluntary sector. For every &pound;1 from the state, &pound;8 of voluntary work is produced. The Audit Commission stated clearly that investment in youth services could help save money in other Government services, particularly in health and education. Despite those favourable reviews and reports, the youth service is under threat. I do not want to exaggerate the situation, but the Government need carefully to consider several factors so that the service can go forward into the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/7">The first threat is the development by local authorities of integrated children's services, which come out of &quot;Every Child Matters&quot;. In principle, I support that move. It must be right that education, social services, play services and youth services work together within a local authority, but my fear&mdash;it is one that exists in the youth service&mdash;is that when it comes to considering the spending on youth services compared with spending on, say, schools or children in care, the youth service, which traditionally has been a Cinderella service, may lose out. It really is important that the youth service plays an important part in the new integrated children's services. There are people in local government who advocate the youth service and its importance.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/8">One of the things that the Community and Youth Workers Union has done is to review the strategies provided by local authorities to the Government on the way forward on integrated youth services. I am concerned that the youth service gets no mention at all in 50 per cent. of those published strategies. That reinforces my anxiety that it will lose out in the new local government world. That is a challenge to the local authorities but also to the people who work in the youth service. They must argue strongly&mdash;I know that they will&mdash;about the importance of their service.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/9">My second point is about the need for a statutory basis for the youth service and its work force plan, and the need for people who work with young people to be professionally licensed. Those are all long-term campaign aims of the TUC and the CYWU. The CYWU has long argued that only with a statutory base can we be sure that the youth service will have priority in local government services and resources. It is interesting and coincidental that the Education and Inspections Bill is in the other place this afternoon. Clause 6 places a requirement on local authorities&mdash;I stress this&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/10" class="indent">&quot;so far as reasonably practicable&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/11">to provide a range of recreational provisions for 13 to 19-year-olds. There has been substantial debate about whether the clause gives the statutory basis that the youth service deserves and needs. I understand that the Government are to introduce amendments to strengthen the youth service, and I would be interested in hearing from the Minister, before the debate in the other place this afternoon, what the Government's thinking is about a statutory base for the youth service.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/12">Thirdly, I want to discuss current spending on the youth service. I am grateful for the figures provided by the National Youth Agency. In the last financial year, 2004-05, the average local authority spent &pound;75 per head of population on the youth service&mdash;on young people aged 13 to 19. There was a lot of variation in what local authorities did. The highest spender spent just over &pound;200; the lowest spender spent &pound;23.23. My local authority, Nottinghamshire, spent &pound;89.78, and the Minister's local authority, Gloucestershire, spent &pound;74.22, which was about the average. It is interesting to note that 13 local authorities spent less than &pound;50, well below the average of &pound;75. I remind the Minister and his Department that in &quot;Transforming Youth Work&quot;, one of the Government's publications, the suggestion was made that the average spend&mdash;the appropriate amount&mdash;should be &pound;100 per young person. That shows that we still have a long way to go. We can look at local authority spending on the youth service in another way, as a percentage of total education spending. Again, I am grateful to the NYA for providing the figures. In 2004-05, spending on the youth service as a proportion of total education spending was 1.18 per cent., slightly down from 1.2 per cent. in 2003-04 and significantly different from 1996-97, when the figure was proportionally higher at 1.24 per cent. Spending on the youth service is patchy.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/13">One of the important things for the youth service has been the ability to benchmark its spending against the Government grant. Using the youth and communities sub-block allocation to local authorities, as defined in the education formula spending, it is possible to see what the Government are allocating and expecting local authorities to spend against the actual spend. As I have argued before, the amount spent is significantly below the expectation. I am concerned&mdash;this is a real challenge to the youth service&mdash;that in funding integrated services in future that spending will be contained in the children and young persons' services block, and it will not be possible to disaggregate the amount of money spent on the youth service. I hope that the Minister will consider that issue and that it will be considered during the joint Treasury departmental spending review.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/14">There is a long history of local authorities trying to avoid spending on the youth service. In the '80s and '90s, some local authorities tried to stop spending on the youth service. The CYWU intervened and stopped them from doing that. It is interesting that Bromley outsourced its youth service and has now taken it back in-house. At the moment, there are problems in Northamptonshire&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase> will speak about that&mdash;with youth workers being sacked and Ofsted finding the service unsatisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/15">I do not want to end on a dismal note. I am a strong believer in the youth service. My local authority in Nottinghamshire has an excellent service. I know that it faces hard choices in the future. It spends &pound;6.5 million on youth services but because of budget planning it is talking about reducing that by about &pound;500,000. However, I want the good things&mdash;such as the shadow exercise that took place in Sherwood forest, the E2E project and the work that is done to involve young people in monitoring Connexions&mdash;to go forward. It is important that we have a strong, statutory youth service that is well resourced by local government.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.0/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" name="Paddy Tipping">my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase> for allowing me to speak in his Adjournment debate. In Northamptonshire, as he said, the decision was made by the Conservative-controlled county council to shut down the statutory youth service and outsource it to the independent and voluntary sector. The CYWU campaigned strongly against that and won a wide level of support from the general public, the churches, for example, and other organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.0/2">In principle I am not one of those who have a huge objection to outsourcing to the independent and voluntary sector. However, the CYWU's arguments in this case have all proved to be absolutely accurate. If something is to be outsourced and contracted to the independent and voluntary sector, there has to be a voluntary sector to contract with. In this instance, there simply was not. The areas that most need youth services are often those where the voluntary sector is least active. For example, in the Goldings and Overstone Lodge estates in my constituency, a door-to-door survey that I carried out with local residents showed that their highest need was for some youth facilities. It also showed a startling lack of access to services elsewhere in the town and constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.0/3">In Southfields estate, the one person who did all the youth work was unfortunately very elderly and died, and was profoundly missed by all of the young people. Some of the mothers and I held a mini fun day on the estate during the school holidays to give the children something to do. I would rather do five night sittings on the trot than do one fun day on a difficult estate, because of the difficulty of the work. The mothers are determined to carry on and set up something, and all credit to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.0/4">I applaud the voluntary sector and the other parts of the statutory service for the work they do for young people. For example, the county's music and performing arts service, which my daughter has gone to since she was two years old, is astounding. Fantastic work is done for youth sports and an amazing job is done through the supplementary schools. However, there is a bit missing. We have to ensure that we target the areas of disadvantage. There is no point in hugging hoodies if we do not even have them in a room to hug.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.0/5">It is important that we have a youth service with a clear commitment to dealing with the issues of social disadvantage, which is given real guidance to ensure that that happens. That is what I fear is now sadly missing in my constituency. It is really important as things move forward, particularly as we get integrated budgets, that the need to tackle social disadvantage among young people and to reach difficult, excluded young people is clearly carried out in the interests of our communities. I am grateful to have had the chance to make this point.</p>

	<p pid="b.242.0/1">I congratulate you in your role as Chairman, Mr. Williams. It is good to see you. I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" name="Paddy Tipping">my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase> on securing this debate. He prefaced his remarks by praising the youth service and also, rightly, young people for the contribution that they make. That is an apt position to start from, because in my role as Under-Secretary in the Department for Education and Skills I have had dealings with many groups of young people and he is absolutely right to say that they have a positive contribution to make. Good youth services&mdash;he mentioned his youth service in Nottinghamshire, and I know that there is some excellent work going on there&mdash;make the best of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/2">I also welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase>. Obviously, there are problems in her part of the world, as she has mentioned, and she has been championing the issue in her constituency. I shall say a few words about that in the course of my speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/3">First, I think that this is absolutely the right time for this debate. It is an essential debate, which the Government welcome. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood said, the Government recently announced plans for a radical reform of youth support services. &quot;Youth Matters&quot; laid out our vision for youth support services. It emphasises the benefit of bringing services together around the needs of young people through an integrated youth support service. That will empower young people, giving them more choice and influence over their services. Having said that, I understand the comments that my hon. Friend made about the youth service being a Cinderella and about where it stands in the priorities of local authorities. I shall come on to that in a moment, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/4">The reforms make clear the Government's recognition of the great importance of youth work and their commitment to make agencies and the services that they deliver even more responsive to the needs of young people. I note that some young people have just arrived in the Public Gallery to listen to the debate; they are most welcome. I refer to local authority youth services when I speak of youth work, but we do not overlook the valuable youth work delivered by the range of trained professionals based in other community and voluntary settings. &quot;Youth Matters&quot; demonstrates the Government's recognition that those delivering youth work are crucial to the impact of the reforms.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/5">I shall briefly summarise why those reforms were and are necessary. First, despite tremendous enthusiasm, organisations providing services and help for young people do not always work together as effectively or imaginatively as they should. The result is that money and effort can sometimes be wasted. Secondly, teenagers and their parents do not have enough say in what is provided, which results in services not always meeting individuals' needs&mdash;hence &quot;Youth Matters&quot; and &quot;Youth Matters: Next Steps&quot;. Thirdly, more can be done to prevent young people from drifting into a life of poverty or crime. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood has already mentioned the benefit of youth services in cutting crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/6">We passionately believe in having more integrated arrangements for delivering youth support; support that helps the most disadvantaged in a tailored way. That is why we look to Children's Trust arrangements to lead the delivery of integrated youth support, of which youth work is a key part. However, the impact of integrated arrangements are limited if we focus attention on individual funding streams in isolation. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood made the pertinent point that we are not talking only about the early years but about youth service and young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/7">Of course, as we embark on reform, youth work itself will go through its own period of transition, with its own challenges, and my hon. Friend described what has happened in his area. Young people do not conform to single silos; the young offender will often play truant, may have mental health problems, and will often lack a stable family environment, so youth support must operate in the wider playing field. I hope that Children's Trust will help in that respect, bearing in mind the &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; agenda and bringing services together.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/8">We want the new arrangements to give youth work the chance to flourish; through it, young people can achieve the outcomes that they want. We want to build on what is working but we know that we have to do some things differently. Inspection evidence tells us that about one in four youth services is not performing adequately, and we all want to give young people more than an adequate chance. We want to give young people the best whenever we can.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/9">It is natural that periods of transition such as those that youth services are going through now should give rise to concerns about positions and roles. The debate about youth service and youth work funding highlights that, but I emphasise that integrated working does not mean a loss of identity for youth work or for any other deliverer of youth support. I hope that today's debate will highlight that for all local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/10">I hope that we can begin to think of funding for that aspect of youth support as part of a wider pool of resources, which are meant to help young people reach their potential by sharing knowledge with others. Youth support can refine its strengths by learning from the experience of others within the wider support services.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/11">The debate should not be restricted to focusing on one service's funding and how it is determined. We should take as our starting point the following questions. How do we give young people the help they need? What is the best way of delivering it? Who can deliver it, and how can we help them to deliver it?</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/12">I welcome the call for a focus on the most disadvantaged, and for youth work to be targeted there. For example, projects such as Late Zone in Dartford recruit young people on the streets to come and visit them. Late Zone is open on Friday nights between 10 pm and 11.30 pm; it is an informal information session and includes opportunities for young people to access coffee bars and other activities. I would like to see far more such projects; they reach out to young people at a time when they most need it. Other projects such as Midnight Football do similar work.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/13">However, we must recognise that the young person's journey is fraught with change, including in circumstances. All young people have needs, and they can find their needs suddenly accelerating, which can put them outside the support offered by the universal services. That is why we have introduced target support pathfinders in 14 local authority areas; they will inform those concerned as to how local user support services can be best designed so that they can respond to the needs of the most troubled young people. More detailed guidance will be issued later in the year, based on findings from those pathfinder projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/14">The funding of youth work was mentioned by my hon. Friends. We want local authorities to consider what is needed in order to make a reality of the vision in &quot;Youth Matters&quot;. That is why the Minister for Children and Families, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1849" name="Beverley Hughes">my right hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston (Beverley Hughes)</phrase>, wrote to all local authorities in early February. She made clear that we are providing new funding for the youth opportunity and youth capital funds of &pound;115 million over two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/15">Those two funds have been received with great enthusiasm by young people and all who support them. As a result, local authorities should not be making cuts to core provision for youth work. They should instead be building on the transforming youth agenda; and we want them to give priority to spending on youth support in order to ensure that all young people achieve the five &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; outcomes. Indeed, my hon. Friend mentioned the 5.8 per cent. increase in his own local authority area.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/16">In total, &pound;1.6 billion is available for support services for young people, and I want to see local authorities using those resources, as local leaders of youth policy, to deliver effective services for young people. I know that some issues are currently being considered in relation to the youth service in Northamptonshire. Northamptonshire county council is working to produce an action plan that responds to the issues raised by Ofsted inspections. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North that we shall be monitoring progress closely. Ultimately, it is for local authorities to decide how much they spend on local services, but I assure my hon. Friend that I am happy to remain engaged; she was right to bring the matter to the attention of the House today.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/17">I welcome the opportunity to look at the strengths of the current Education and Inspections Bill. In the context of the move to integrated arrangements, the Bill promotes integration by legislating on youth work matters in order to help local authorities take changes forward. The Bill strengthens previous outmoded legislation, and will help local authorities to consider how best to use the wide range of resources available to them to commission, facilitate and provide youth work. The new duty will require local authorities, as far as possible, to secure access for young people to sufficient educational leisure-time activities in order to improve their well-being. Youth work is a significant source of the current provision of such activities, and we expect authorities to recognise the importance of youth work in meeting the new duty. We will make that clear in statutory guidance. The thematic view set up by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor earlier this year rightly looks right across youth matters&mdash;at the whole landscape&mdash;and sets out our vision until 2017. That marks a real long-term commitment to services for young people, of which local authority youth services will certainly be an important part.</p>

	<p pid="b.246.1/1">This is not a debate about the desirability of getting freight off our roads, hence the formation of the title. It is a debate about the necessity of ensuring that rail freight locations are correctly located in areas well served by direct transport, road and rail links, and with minimum impact on local communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.1/2">This is not about nimbyism. I want to stress the need for a truly critical appraisal of the merits of locating a large industrial facility in the green belt accessed off local roads in areas of acknowledged traffic congestion, poor air quality and noise pollution. In fact the Department of Health's own 2006 health profile for St. Albans accepts that our local air quality rating is below the accepted England average. The Radlett area is a particular hot spot that contributes significantly to that poor rating. I am seeking to outline to the Minister why this particular proposal is an inappropriate development. It is at an early stage, but I feel that I ought to make the case for our communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.1/3">The district council has already allocated &pound;500,000 of taxpayers' money to fight this proposal and given my concerns, the views of the county council and the regional planning committee, which I will seek to highlight later in my speech, I am asking the Minister to call this decision in at the earliest possible stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.1/4">I am sure that the Minister agrees that this proposal must be robustly scrutinised in terms of strict planning criteria and not pushed through as a result of a desire by the Government to locate up to four new interchange sites around a London hub. We must move away from the positive rhetoric of the developer HelioSlough as its proposals seek to gloss over the real impact of this development and do not adequately address concerns over the impact of increased traffic and green belt requirements. The proposals also fail to fulfil locational requirements of the Strategic Rail Authority's rail freight interchange policy document, paragraph 4.2 of which states:</p>
	<p pid="b.246.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Strategic RFIs tend to be large commercial operations which...may not be considered suitable adjacent to uses such as residential which may be sensitive to the impact of noise and movements&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.1/6">Park Street is a village and access from the site will be directly adjacent to residential homes and along village roads. I, like many people, am in favour of getting freight off our roads, but strategic rail freight interchanges must be appropriately located. This former gravel working is a metropolitan green belt site that ought to be returned to an acceptable amenity for local residents.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.1/7">The Minister said in response to my question of <phrase class="date" code="">11 October</phrase> about maintaining the integrity of the green belt that</p>
	<p pid="b.246.1/8" class="indent">&quot;it should be altered only in exceptional circumstances.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.246.1/9">She went on to say that</p>
	<p pid="b.246.1/10" class="indent">&quot;the Government are currently considering the report of the independent Panel...The Panel recommends that the general extent of the Metropolitan Green Belt in Hertfordshire and Essex...should be maintained.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-11">11 October 2006</phrase>; Vol. 450, c. 743W.]</p>

	<p pid="b.247.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on obtaining this important debate and on the lead she has taken in addressing the issues surrounding the proposal. As well as addressing technical rail issues, this debate is also important for road traffic and strategic reasons, as she has rightly outlined, and for even wider environmental reasons regarding the green belt. Does my hon. Friend accept that anyone who looks at the proposal has to consider whether it will have a massive impact on the green belt in Hertfordshire, particularly in the area around St. Albans, Park Street, London Colney and Radlett in my constituency? In effect, those communities will coalesce into each other, and an area of green with important environmental qualities will be lost.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.247.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" speakername="Anne Main" colnum="247"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0010.htm#06101743000513">
	<p pid="b.247.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. One of the important aspects of the green belt is to stop the coalescing of smaller communities and that facility will indeed be lost should the site be developed in that particular way.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/2">HelioSlough&mdash;the proposed developer&mdash;maintains that its study on the site shows that Radlett is an optimum site with regard to location. That may be its opinion as a result of its own study, but a county development control report released on <phrase class="date" code="">Monday 16 October</phrase> profoundly disagrees with that assertion. It states that the developers' study is not robust and that</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/3" class="indent">&quot;officers are also of the view that a location North of London is not that preferred to handle anticipated demand for rail freight which is forecast to arise largely from Haven and Thames ports and Southampton and the Channel Tunnel&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/4">It concludes that</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/5" class="indent">&quot;for these reasons the very special circumstances that would be necessary to warrant the release of this Green Belt site are considered not to have been adequately demonstrated by the applicant.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/6">It is not just local people who believe that this green belt site is strategically important. The report says that the site has not demonstrated any real reasons to show it should be treated as an exceptional circumstance. The regional planning sub-committee report also agrees with that conclusion on the green belt, adding that</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/7" class="indent">&quot;the application is therefore not consistent with Policies SS7 and LA1 of the Draft east of England Plan&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/8">The Radlett site proposes a large 3.5 million sq ft strategic rail interchange, warehousing ancillary office developments served by the rail sidings linked to the slow up-line&mdash;the midland main line&mdash;with no direct motorway access. I do not wish to go on about access on the rail line because it has not actually been demonstrated that the site will get the additional capacity or access to it: that is a transport issue, not the issue I am dealing with at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/9">There is no direct motorway access and all road access from the new signalised roundabout on the north orbital will be off the A414. A direct road access link for the proposal has already been refused and deemed unacceptable by the highways authority, so all new and existing traffic must still use local roads.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/10">County development control's view in a report to the director for the environment is that the A414, which will provide the access point,</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/11" class="indent">&quot;is already an extremely busy road with flows on this section some of the highest non motorway flows in the county. The applicant shows that a fully operational SRFI would add around 12 per cent. to existing flows. Typically a traffic increase of 5 per cent. is considered to be a material increase and therefore this development is likely to have a significant impact on the road network.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/12">That would have a huge and detrimental impact on local road networks.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/13">A report from the regional planning sub-committee dated <phrase class="date" code="">6 October</phrase> said that</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/14" class="indent">&quot;on the evidence presented so far it is not clear that sufficient capacity could be released on the strategic highway network and hence is not consistent to the policy T3 for access.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/15">Again, an excellent planning reason to turn the proposal down.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/16">The impact on the local roundabouts is less well defined in the developer's proposals, but the county report says, from the scanty recommendations that are in the developer's proposals, that</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/17" class="indent">&quot;officers are not satisfied that the solutions offered will prove acceptable in either congestion capacity or safety terms.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/18">It is also worth noting that in the health outcomes for St. Albans, we have some of the highest road traffic incidents, which is above the national average.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/19">Work by the Highways Agency for the regional spatial strategy examination in public showed that specific congestion issues were anticipated for this part of Hertfordshire. Without the proposal, we are still anticipating a massive impact on congestion, and the proposal will only add to that in a detrimental way. The A414 in particular, which will provide the access point, was highlighted as creating congestion issues. Any highways problems that already occur on the M25, and they are numerous, cause rat-running and severe additional congestion. The addition of thousands of extra lorries trying to access the site would cause mayhem beyond comprehension.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/20">The traffic implications beyond the two roundabouts that feature heavily in the developer's application are also important. The developer seems conveniently to forget that this will impact on the whole of St. Albans and my hon. Friend's constituency as well. It is not just a Park Street and Radlett proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/21">The Highways Agency does look further afield and is concerned about the junctions where traffic joins the trunk road networks: junction 21A and 22 on the M25 and junction 3 of the A1(M). As a result of those concerns, the Highways Agency has already issued a holding objection to the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/22">The proposed Park Street bypass, which has long been argued for by local residents, is a key part of this scheme. Unfortunately, that will not deliver the bypass scheme the residents wanted in order to get the lorries that are already there out of Park Street and eliminate the traffic that clogs the village. It will have no impact on the traffic concerns of the Highways Agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/23">With regard to alleviating traffic within the village, it could be possible, for example, to exclude heavy goods vehicle traffic from Park Street and Frogmore, but the impact on HGVs that currently use Harper lane, the B556, to access junction 22 of the M25 and on all related local car movements will not be addressed by any bypass proposed for this application and therefore it does not address current traffic concerns and will only add to them. That remains a valid concern and was accepted by the highways authority in its report.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/24">Point 17.9 of the county development report, that</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/25" class="indent">&quot;the level of benefit in traffic reduction has not been proven&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/26">fully supports the residents' views of the application. According to point 17.10, the county council is not convinced at this stage that the proposed mitigation measures are adequate to address the problem. Nor are the environmental implications for Radlett and Elstree fully addressed. Overall, the report recommends refusal of the application.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/27">The employment forecast to do with strategic rail freight interchanges is usually heralded as a good thing. The forecast for this proposal is 3,500 employees, but more than 50 per cent. of the staff are expected to live outside Hertfordshire. The employment gains will be greater than the level of supply in the local area, which is not a priority area for regeneration. There will be little economic benefit to the local area, merely increases in traffic congestion as people try to get to work on already congested roads. In fact, the site is deemed to be poorly located to attract necessary staff. Many of them will be unable to live locally due to the constraints of the village and the fact that house prices are extremely high, and many will be low-paid workers.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/28">Point 5.6 of the regional report concludes:</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/29" class="indent">&quot;Other locations may fit better with the regional policies on regeneration and not require the length of commuting of this site.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/30">This is vital. If the Government truly wish to get traffic off our roads, they must ensure that they are not busing and ferrying in people from other areas just because they say that they want to get freight off the roads.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/31">Contrary to the developers' proposals, the county believes that for the developers to suggest that existing or improved local transport services will serve 67 per cent. of potential employee catchment areas is not credible in practical terms. There has been an attempt to advance a case as to how bicycle and bus services could be improved, but none of the proposals has been deemed credible. The document also states:</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/32" class="indent">&quot;The target non car mode share for journeys to work of 35 per cent. is considered unachievable on the evidence presented...With no evidence that practical difficulties can be overcome.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/33">All that means that the proposal does not, cannot and probably never will meet planning policy guidance note 13 requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/34">Again, I question the developers' proposals, which I know the Minister will have on her desk in the not-too-distant future. The highly selective theoretical noise projection tables included in the proposal include no actual noise readings from the seven existing rail freight interchange sites. I myself have stood in Park Street with a monitor and I can tell the Minister that noise levels already well exceed the European decibel levels. Supporting data for traffic generation were helpfully gleaned from the Daventry site, but noise readings were not included. I feel that that was possibly because they would do little to bolster the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/35">The noise calculations are based on the questionable theoretical premise that there will be an 89 per cent. decrease in traffic flow through Park Street. I dealt with that earlier. In fact, the majority of traffic that currently goes through Park Street will not be tempted to use the bypass. The bypass will merely serve as a link road into the site for people working on the site. The figures for decreased traffic flow through Park Street and Frogmore are questioned by both county and region in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1634" name="James Clappison">their reports. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison)</phrase> has massive concerns, as do many Radlett residents, who feel that the traffic impacts may well be much greater.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/36">How can it be possible to direct not only HGV traffic but all traffic going east on the M25 or north via the M10/Ml through the strategic rail freight interchange and then make it turn left on to the A414 and come all the way back to the Park Street roundabout? Logic suggests that local roads will see a massive increase in rat-running to avoid the detours.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/37">I seek assurances from the Minister today that she will not take at face value the blithe assurances on the part of the developer that the scheme will benefit the area. In fact, it will have a catastrophic impact. It is completely contrary to green belt policy. It fails on many transport accounts, and the residents are looking to the Minister to take an objective planning decision on the proposal where it fails on all accounts. I would welcome assurances from her on how much weight she will place on the views of local people, the local district and county councils&mdash;the district has yet to express a view on this; it has a hearing on it on <phrase class="date" code="">1 November</phrase>&mdash;and the regional planning committee, which I have quoted extensively. I trust that when she has examined all their evidence, she will robustly reject the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/38">May I add a footnote to that? It has cost so much money to fight these large developers. Local authorities feel totally disadvantaged in their fight against massive, inappropriate development that they believe the Government wish to sanction or rubber-stamp. I am looking to the Minister to give us absolute assurances that that will not be the case in this matter.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.250.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" speakername="Yvette Cooper" speakeroffice="The Minister for Housing and Planning"  colnum="250"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0011.htm#06101743000514">
	<p pid="b.250.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" name="Anne Main">the hon. Member for St. Albans (Anne Main)</phrase> on securing this debate on a matter that concerns her in her constituency and on raising the proposals for the former aerodrome site at Radlett in St. Albans. The proposal is to build a 3.5 million sq ft strategic rail freight interchange on that site. I understand that HelioSlough, the site owner, submitted an outline planning application for the proposal to St. Albans district council on <phrase class="date" code="">28 July</phrase>. I understand that it seeks approval for means of access, for siting and for landscaping, with all other matters reserved. The application will be considered by the council's planning committee on <phrase class="date" code="">1 November</phrase>, as the hon. Lady said towards the end of her speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.0/2">The site does fall within the metropolitan green belt and, given the adopted plan, the proposal may well be referred to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for consideration. I shall say a little more about that in due course. In the meantime, I understand that the Highways Agency has served on the council a direction under article 14 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, which prevents it from taking a decision on whether to grant planning permission, because the applicant has not yet provided sufficient information for the Highways Agency to ascertain the full impact of the proposal on the motorway and trunk roads concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.0/3">The direction from the Highways Agency will remain in place until <phrase class="date" code="">31 December</phrase>&mdash;the end of this year&mdash;unless sufficient information has been provided before then to satisfy the agency, given its criteria and the issues that it has to take account of as part of the planning process. That does not preclude the council from considering the application or determining its views on other aspects of the application. Given that concerns are always raised about the time scale of consideration of planning applications, it is right that councils should be able to consider other aspects simultaneously while Highways Agency concerns are explored. Nevertheless, until a satisfactory conclusion is found to the agency's concerns, the article 14 direction must remain in place, which means that the council will be unable to reach a final decision on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.0/4">If the Highways Agency's concerns are addressed and the decision is to refuse planning permission, of course the applicant will have the right to lodge an appeal with the Secretary of State. If the council is minded to grant planning permission, the application will be referred to the Secretary of State for consideration. There is a 21-day period within which the decision must be made on whether the application should be called in for the Secretary of State's determination. Should the matter be called in by the Secretary of State, there would need to be a public inquiry, which would look into all these matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.0/5">In view of that and of the fact that the Secretary of State may well have to take a series of decisions relating to this case, it is clear that I cannot discuss the merits of the application. It would be improper for me to do so, as it could be seen to prejudice the case or fetter the Secretary of State's discretion, should she decide to call it in for her own determination or should it go to appeal&mdash;or, indeed, prejudice the call-in decision itself. I know that the hon. Lady has requested that the matter should be called in. I must make it clear that there are of course clear rules on the way Ministers deal with planning cases, given the quasi-judicial role that the Secretary of State must play. I will, however, refer to a series of more general issues that need to be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.0/6">Hon. Members are right to say that there is a wider need to get freight on to rail rather than roads, given the need to cut carbon emissions and as part of a long-term strategy to safeguard the environment, in this country and around the world. I understand that the examination in public of the east of England plan identifies the need for one strategic rail freight interchange for the east of England, and that the Strategic Rail Authority's submission to the plan stated that at least one rail freight interchange needed to be accommodated within the east of England region, serving broadly the north quadrant of London and adjacent parts of the east of England.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.251.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" speakername="Anne Main" colnum="251"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0011.htm#06101743000515">
	<p pid="b.251.0/1">On that very point, the report accepted that no site-specific recommendation was made; it also noted, particularly on the employment issue, that the site at Radlett was not a good fit. There were also massive concerns about the road links, which also meant that there was not a particularly good fit. The report merely accepted the general location policy for the east of England, which is a very large area, and certainly did not come down in support of our site.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.252.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" speakername="Yvette Cooper" colnum="252"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0011.htm#06101743000516">
	<p pid="b.252.0/1">The hon. Lady has raised an important point. The Secretary of State has not yet responded to the examination in public of the east of England plan, and will need to do so in due course. As I understand the position, the panel does not identify any particular location, and clearly such matters need to be taken into account when planning applications are examined. We can note the points raised by the panel and the report commissioned for the East of England Development Agency, which suggests that there is an increasing need for rail freight services resulting from major container port schemes and the ability of the rail infrastructure to accommodate the increase in demand, but we need to be clear that that must not prejudge any planning application, and certainly not one that must go to the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.0/2">With planning applications it is necessary to consider a series of site-specific details, including the designation of the land as greenfield, brownfield or in the green belt&mdash;and, given the importance of protecting the green belt, wider considerations must be taken into account. It is also necessary to consider a wider range of details concerning applications, such as transport, impact on the area and economic considerations.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.0/3">As I mentioned earlier, I understand that the Highways Agency is seeking further technical data from the applicant on the impact of the proposal on the motorway and trunk roads involved. I know that the Highways Agency is already seriously considering the traffic implications, as it does in every case, to ensure that they are properly taken into account.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.252.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" speakername="Anne Main" colnum="252"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0011.htm#06101743000517">
	<p pid="b.252.1/1">The Highways Agency, as the Minister points out, is looking at the implications of the wider effect of the proposals, which the developer's proposal does not deal with. However, the highways authority has already made site-specific observations on the predicted impact and has considered that it is not acceptable. I hope that, although further data may bring solutions to other parts of the equation, specific weight will be given to the existing fact of the almost intractable problems on the site.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.252.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" speakername="Yvette Cooper" colnum="252"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0011.htm#06101743000518">
	<p pid="b.252.2/1">As I have said, it would be improper for me to comment on the detail of the Highways Agency's views at this stage. It would be inappropriate given the Secretary of State's potential role in the process. The Highways Agency's views need to be taken into account by local councils and planning inspectors as well as by the Secretary of State. As I have also made clear, we give the Highways Agency additional powers through article 14 directions to prevent decisions on planning permissions being made when there is not satisfactory information about the implications for the road infrastructure in the area&mdash;particularly major road infrastructure such as motorways and trunk roads. That is precisely to ensure that the planning system properly takes account of transport considerations, wherever the application is made.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.252.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" speakername="Anne Main" colnum="252"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0011.htm#06101743000519">
	<p pid="b.252.3/1">As a matter of clarification, given that no relevant noise readings were included in the proposals for traffic impact and transport impact, would the Minister expect noise impact facts and figures as part of the environmental statement?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17b.253.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" speakername="Yvette Cooper" colnum="253"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo061017/halltext/61017h0011.htm#06101743000520">
	<p pid="b.253.0/1">Again, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the details of the application, the factors that would need to be taken into account or the level of evidence that would be required on particular issues. In general terms we require consideration against local plan considerations and issues to do with the green belt, transport, the environment, noise, pollution, climate change and the need for economic development. A wide range of issues need to be weighed in the balance by local planning authorities when they consider major applications such as the one we are discussing.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.0/2">The green belt is an important factor, because green belts are a long-standing element of planning policy, to which we attach great importance. Many businesses operate within the green belt and people live there, so clearly there must be ways in which it can respond to those conditions. Equally, however, we set particularly strong tests for new and future development in the green belt. Those are embedded in the planning policy statements.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.0/3">The local planning authority also needs to consider wider issues set out in planning policy statement 1, the main planning policy statement for development. Those are issues to do with sustainability and the recognition that our quality of life depends on transport and easy access to jobs, services and shopping, but that there is also a need to sustain our communities for the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.0/4">I think, therefore, that it is right that in the first instance the matter should be considered by the local planning authority. It is a matter to be considered first by that authority and the Highways Agency, before they decide what view to take of the proposal. If it is decided to turn it down there may be a chance of appeal, in which case the Secretary of State will have a role at that point. Should the planning application be accepted, the Secretary of State will need to take a view on whether the proposal should be called in.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.0/5">I recognise the strong feelings that the hon. Members for St. Albans and for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) have about this matter and I understand that they would like the case to be called in rather than decided by the local authority. We think it important that at this stage the local authority should take the first view, before the Secretary of State takes a decision&mdash;before the matter is referred to the Secretary of State to decide whether the proposal should be called in.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.0/6">I assure hon. Members that whenever call-in proposals are put forward the Secretary of State gives serious consideration to all the relevant circumstances to make sure that an application is appropriate for call-in. We take the view that we should not call in cases that can better be decided at local level by local planning authorities. Therefore it is right to continue with the approach under which it is deemed that only a small minority of cases should be called in for determination by the Secretary of State. Nevertheless, within any individual case we always take the points that are made very seriously.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.0/7">In the circumstances, it is not possible for me to comment in any further detail on the application, given the point that it has reached in the planning process.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.0/8" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.0/9" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at Two o'clock.</p>
