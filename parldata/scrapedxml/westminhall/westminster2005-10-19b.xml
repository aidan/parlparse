	<p pid="b.247.3/1">I am delighted to have the opportunity to debate such a vital issue. I shall endeavour to keep my remarks reasonably brief, and without having recourse to a welter of scientific data.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/2">At the outset, I pay tribute to the Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus, the national charity that is located in my constituency, to its staff and volunteers, and to the thousands of families who have coped with that terrible disability over the years with love, compassion and fortitude.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/3">The Government have the opportunity to prevent thousands of pregnancy terminations and severe disability for hundreds of children and young people, and so improve the nation's health, by fortifying flour with folic acid. Since the landmark Medical Research Council international study of 1991, the efficacy of fortifying foods with folic acid to prevent the most common neural tube defect, spina bifida, has been proven beyond doubt. Lost opportunities since then fly in the face of the UK's strong tradition in preventive medicine and public health. In short, the condition is as preventable as polio was&mdash;and is.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/4">Spina bifida is a neural tube defect and one of the UK's most common congenital malformations, leading to paralysis and incontinence. A major secondary complication is hydrocephalus&mdash;excess fluid on the brain that can lead to brain damage if untreated. It occurs early in pregnancy, at about four weeks, when the spine and the brain are being formed. One or more of the bones fail to develop properly, leaving the spinal cord exposed and the cord and nerves damaged to a variable extent.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/5">Although the incidence of neural tube defects has been reduced over the past 30 years from 3.8 per 1,000 births to approximately 1.8 per 1,000, due mainly to better antenatal screening, about 1,400 pregnancies still occur each year in the UK which result in about 1,200 elective terminations and 200 live births. Sadly, our rate of neural tube defects ranks among the highest in the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/6">I turn first to the detailed evidence in favour of fortifying with folic acid enriched products such as flour and bread. Folic acid is the synthetic form of folate, a water-soluble vitamin in the B-complex group, which occurs in a variety of foods such as green vegetables, beans, pulses and grains, yeast and beef extracts.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/7">Following the 1991 Medical Research Council vitamin study, which found that more than 70 per cent. of neural tube defects were preventable, the Department of Health's expert committee recommended in 1992 that women planning pregnancy should increase their intake of folic acid by eating foods high in folate, by taking a 4 mg folic acid supplement daily, and by eating foods fortified with folic acid, such as certain types of bread and breakfast cereal. Academic studies have also shown that if the supplement intake were increased to 5 mg a day, up to 85 per cent. of neural tube defects could be prevented.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/8">The most recent evidence for that can be found in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-12">12 March 2005</phrase>. The Health Education Authority launched a campaign promoting the benefits of folic acid in 1996, and it remains of the same view today. In January 2000, the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy published a report under the auspices of the working group on folic acid, in which it recommended mandatory universal flour fortification at 240 micrograms per 100 g flour in the UK. That would have</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/9" class="indent">&quot;a significant effect in preventing neural tube defect-affected conceptions and births without resulting in unacceptably high intakes in any group of the population&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/10">The then Minister for Public Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" name="Yvette Cooper">the hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase>, welcomed the report's findings and promised a wide-ranging public consultation on its conclusions. The results of that consultation showed that 59 per cent. of those consulted who expressed an opinion supported the fortification of wheat flour with folic acid, with 30 per cent. against it and 11 per cent. expressing reservations.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/11">In 2005, in the American journal <i>Pediatrics, </i>a mammoth study of 11 million births and 4,468 cases of spina bifida showed that the incidence of neural tube defects in infants fell by up to a third in some ethnic groups following the increased enrichment of grain products with folic acid throughout the 1990s.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/12">In 2002, against that background of strong empirical evidence, the Food Standards Agency decided, perversely, not to recommend the mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid, and that approach was confirmed by the Department of Health in June 2004. That is despite the experience in countries such as Canada, Chile, South Africa and, of course, the United States, where recommendations regarding the need for folic acid in early pregnancy are integral to a policy of promoting the widespread fortification of flour. The entire population receives at least a small additional amount of folic acid, with evidence showing that such a population-wide approach is effective in reducing the incidence of neural tube defects. Since 1998, at the direction of the US Food and Drug Administration, enriched cereal grains have been fortified with synthetic folic acid throughout the United States.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/13">Above all, we must remember that taking pills cannot prevent or ameliorate neural tube defects per se, because many pregnancies are unplanned, and if prevention is to be effective, the women's folate status has to be high, not after she falls pregnant, but at the time of conception and immediately afterwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/14">Unfortunately, awareness of such issues among women is declining, despite the laudable efforts of various public health campaigns, recent Department of Health advice in its leaflet, &quot;Thinking of having a baby: Folic acid&mdash;an essential ingredient in making babies&quot;, and the work of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. A MORI poll for Action Medical Research in October 2000 showed that only 56 per cent. of women of childbearing age&mdash;those between 15 and 55&mdash;were aware of the health benefits of folic acid for unborn babies.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/15">In analysing preventive strategies against neural tube defects across Europe, the <i>British Medical Journal</i> study of March 2005 that I quoted earlier specifically discounts the efficacy of recommending the peri-conceptional supplementation of folic acid in planned pregnancies as &quot;not effective enough&quot;. Supplementation simply does not work. In addition, studies show that the relatively poor bio-availability of natural food folate, as a result, for example, of cooking, leads to a degree of deficiency in any case. The report also stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/16" class="indent">&quot;Folate status of most women of childbearing age could be raised by fortifying a staple food with folic acid, which would also help to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in the prevalence of neural tube defects.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/17">That is because such defects disproportionately affect poorer people. Poor diet and poor education continue to account for the fact that lower socio-economic groups are more susceptible to neural tube defects.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/18">Let us turn briefly to the safety issues sometimes cited by participants in the debate on this issue. Research studies using folic acid at high doses have shown no evidence whatever of toxicity. Folic acid is safe, even at levels very much higher than those advocated to prevent neural tube defects, such as those recommended by COMA. In particular, and unrelated to toxicity, there is a concern that the &quot;masking&quot; of vitamin B12 deficiency has arisen&mdash;that folic acid could delay the diagnosis of that deficiency&mdash;but there is no evidence of that occurring, even in countries with fortified flour, as a recent US study concluded. The COMA report expressly dismissed those concerns in 2000. Indeed, there is evidence that older people would in any case benefit from folic acid fortification.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/19">Let us briefly examine the possible technical obstacles to fortifying flour. There are none. There are issues in the marketplace relating to labelling and trade, but that is all. Not unreasonably, the baking and milling industry has indicated that it requires a Government directive before implementation across the board. Voluntary fortification has increased, but applies to only a very small proportion of the bread market.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/20">We have reached a crossroads, and public policy on this issue is in a state of inertia. It is sad to note that the rate of neural tube defects remains at 1.8 per 1,000 pregnancies and has been at that level for 17 years, since 1988. We await with interest the detailed report and recommendations from the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, which the Minister advised me in a written answer on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-12">12 September</phrase> would be published later this year. We shall see. Unfortunately, judging by past performance, we are likely to see obfuscation, evasion and delay, particularly from the Food Standards Agency. Why? The facts are clear for all to see.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/21">About three quarters of neural tube defects could be prevented if all women took a daily dose of 4 or 5 mg of folic acid before pregnancy. Flour fortification at the COMA-recommended level, resulting in an increase in folic acid of about 0.2 mg a day, would prevent 300 neural tube defects annually in the United Kingdom. There is a need for an effective public health strategy based on folic acid fortification of flour to an effective level. No other single public health measure could prevent as many serious congenital defects and the tragedy of so many pregnancy terminations. Folic acid fortification would be practical, feasible and safe and would even deliver benefits for cardiovascular health, as some studies have found.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.3/22">Even as a libertarian, I confess that I have no truck with the arcane debates about the state versus the individual. We must be pragmatic and practical, as we have been in the past. If we had not been, we would still have a country full of children disfigured by polio, despite the fact that a vaccine was available to lift that terrible burden from them. The Minister can help to lift a terrible burden today from the hundreds of families who may in future endure heartache and be required to care for their loved ones in a way that goes beyond the bounds of most people's experience and endurance. Let us remember that we are talking about a congenital condition that is largely if not wholly preventable. We have seen the evidence from across the world. We now require the political will and the courage to take the tough decisions needed to improve the lives of our fellow citizens. I hope and trust that the Minister will rise to that challenge.</p>

	<p pid="b.250.4/1">There is a limited amount to be said on the subject, and I do not intend to repeat what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1759" name="Stewart Jackson">the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson)</phrase> has already said. I congratulate him on securing the debate. I note with interest the fact that we have discussed the subject before. Four years ago, the previous Member for Peterborough also called for an Adjournment debate on this matter. Depressingly, we do not seem to have moved on very much in those four years. I shall return to the final remarks of the then Minister in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.4/2">It is worth discussing briefly the sort of advice that women receive these days when planning their pregnancy. Given that many pregnancies are unplanned, there is clearly a problem, because the folate status of many women will not be at the required level. Someone might not want to take medication. Moreover, it is quite difficult to reach the required level simply by eating a diet rich in folates. One needs to drink about 10 glasses of orange juice a day or to eat a perfectly obscene amount of Brussels sprouts, neither of which is probably very good for you.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.4/3">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence confirmed that all women should be advised to take supplements preferably for about a month before they start trying to conceive, and to continue to take them for the first three months of pregnancy. I remember that when I worked as a pharmacist, women were put on a higher dose of 5 mg of folic acid if they were considered to be at risk. That advice was revised more generally for the wider population to say that a 400 microgram-a-day supplement should be sufficient.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.4/4">Studies have shown that, apart from the period when quite a high-profile campaign was run about this, only about a third of women have any idea that they should be doing something about their folate status. Most women do not see a midwife before they become pregnant. That simply does not happen, so it is too late to act on that advice by the time one has one's first appointment with the midwife&mdash;an appointment made despite the shortages.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.4/5">The current situation has, I believe, been outlined, but I should point out that recent research shows that 1,420 pregnancies were affected by neural tube defects, 90 per cent. of which resulted in a termination. One can argue whichever way one wants, but the NHS can ill afford the cost. There is certainly a cost to the women who must cope with terminating a pregnancy that may have been much wanted. We should not underestimate that cost, because this is not only about pounds, shillings and pence, but about women's lives and about something that could easily be prevented.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.4/6">The long and the short of the issue is this: should we be fortifying flour because, as has already been pointed out, by the time most women know they are pregnant, it is too late to start taking the supplements? I was a little uneasy about the idea to start with. The Liberal Democrats consulted on it in a recent review of health policy. Some people were quite against the fortification of foods in the same way they are against the fluoridation of water. The difference with flour is that we do not have to fortify everything; we can make sure that an alternative is available, if one is needed for some reason. It can, for example, be a problem if epileptics have too much folic acid, so there could be an alternative available for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.4/7">The situation is much the same with salt; most people do not realise that, years ago, iodine was put into salt in many parts of the world to help counter certain deficiencies. There are many precedents of putting substances and vitamins into products. Nearly every breakfast cereal is fortified in some way. Margarine&mdash;for those who eat that disgusting stuff&mdash;is fortified with vitamins A and D. At the time, these changes were all regarded as public health measures. It seems clear that we should seriously consider the fortification of flour and flour products, as long as there is an alternative.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.4/8">The evidence from the United States seems to show that the fears about masking B12 deficiency and potentially pernicious anaemia in older people were unfounded. We would do well to consider that. We should also bear it in mind that 38 other countries have adopted the measure.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.4/9">Looking back at the last time we had such a debate, I see that the then Minister said the Government took the issue seriously and were looking into it, and that various recommendations were coming out. However, we have not heard anything on the subject from the Government since. This is a timely opportunity for the current Minister to tell us what the Government will do to address the problem.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.252.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" speakername="Andrew Murrison" colnum="252"  time="009:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h01.htm#51019h01_spnew6">
	<p pid="b.252.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1759" name="Stewart Jackson">the Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson)</phrase> on raising this topic for debate. Having spoken to him, I know that he feels passionately about it. The debate is timely, as we really ought to be reviewing what progress the Government have made. I commend ASBAH, which has done a great deal to raise the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.0/2">First, I shall set some context. As part of my preparation for this debate, I looked into our country's performance as regards child health and perinatal mortality. I must say that we do not do particularly well compared with European countries such as France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Indeed, the rise in stillbirths recently reported by the confidential inquiry into maternal and child death is alarming and, when we are talking about spina bifida and neural tube defects, we need to set that in a wider context. I hope that when the Minister speaks, she will spare just a couple of minutes of the ample time that will be available to her to let us know what her Government are doing to improve the health of children, particularly the very young.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.0/3">UNICEF figures on low birth weight for this country are particularly revealing. The latest figures available, which are for 2004, show that 8 per cent. of children in this country have low birth weight, compared with 6 per cent. in Spain and Italy, and 7 per cent. in Germany and France. We appear to be at the lower end of the European batting order. Most people in this country would find that unacceptable. We hope that a Health Minister will address those adverse comparisons when making policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.0/4">In a similar vein, we looked at what the European health report of 2005 said about the burden of disease for young children in the European region. We found that the figures for disability-adjusted life years per 1,000 births for conditions early in life were unflattering&mdash;those for neonatal mortality were even more so&mdash;with the European average for countries that pretty well approximate to our own at about 4, with France at 4.2, Holland at 4.9, Spain at 4 and Germany at 4.8, while Poland is at 5.3 and the UK at 7.2. It is unacceptable for our country to have figures that tend towards the eastern European average rather than that in comparable countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.0/5">I shall deal now with the specifics of spina bifida. We are understandably reluctant to introduce compulsion in this country in place of informed choice. My hon. Friend has mentioned the Health Education Authority's campaign in 1996, which appeared to have been successful in raising the prominence of spina bifida awareness. Since the campaign ended about five years ago, we have seen a decline in the understanding of neural tube defects. Although I understand the Government's reluctance to introduce compulsion, and I share some of those sentiments, I think that much more could have been done in the interim to revisit the authority's campaign.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.253.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="253"  time="009:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h01.htm#51019h01_spnew7">
	<p pid="b.253.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the problem with a campaign is that it must be ongoing? The cohort of women who are interested in the subject is perpetually renewing itself. Women who become pregnant today may have been teenagers when the campaign was running, so they may not have been aware of it. The subject is not one about which mothers talk to their daughters. There is a continued need for education which is not being fulfilled.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.253.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" speakername="Andrew Murrison" colnum="253"  time="009:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h01.htm#51019h01_spnew8">
	<p pid="b.253.1/1">The hon. Lady is quite right. I disagree only in so far as to say that mothers do talk to their daughters about such issues. I hope that those mothers will remember some of those education campaigns. From my relatively recent experience, there is a memory among women of the need for folate. It has entered into our lexicography in a way that it previously perhaps had not, so the campaign did have value. However, I agree entirely with the hon. Lady that it must be revisited. The issue must be on the agenda all the time. The level of risk, sadly, has not changed, so we must ensure that women are constantly aware of the need for folate. There is no doubt about that. I hope that when the Minister makes her remarks she will be able to give us some encouragement that a campaign of the type that was carried out in the mid-1990s will be reintroduced. That would be very useful.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">The hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> mentioned the analogy&mdash;if it is an analogy&mdash;between the fluoridation of water and the addition of folate to flour and bread. I think that there is an analogy, and I shall probably annoy dentists by saying that there is a substantial difference between dental caries and neural tube defects. Neural tube defects are potentially devastating, and we must do what we can, in public health terms, to reduce their incidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/3">Another difference, as the hon. Lady pointed out, is that we have an element of choice with bread products, or an element of choice can at least be introduced. Fluoridation of water, however, means that most people have no choice. There is a stark difference between the two. It is perhaps slightly ironic that the Government seem to be quite keen on the fluoridation of water, yet that enthusiasm has not been matched to date in their views on the addition of folate to flour products. It would be interesting to hear the Minister's thoughts on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/4">I am old enough to remember at medical school the axiom that one did not give folate before checking an elderly person's B12 status. Twenty years on, that debate obviously continues. I am interested in recent research that suggests that the risk to an elderly person is more hypothetical than real. Nevertheless, those who specialise in health care for the elderly are concerned that, in providing folate in flour products, we may mask B12 deficiency. The pernicious anaemia will be treated, but the neurological consequences of B12 deficiency, which are the serious consequences of that deficiency, will not. I imagine that the Minister has that in mind and it may have informed some of her reluctance to take action up to this point.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/5">We have also heard that certain anti-convulsants and folate do not really mix and that folate affects the efficacy of sodium valproate in particular. Those groups that champion people with epilepsy are concerned, perhaps, that the addition of folate to food might have adverse consequences. That can be managed, and strategies would allow it to be managed reasonably well. It is probably not an insurmountable obstacle, but it is a factor.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/6">COMA's recommendations in 2000 were fairly unequivocal, yet the Government decided that the Food Standards Agency should look at the matter. One wonders sometimes whether the agency is scratching around for things to do. I will make no further comment than that. Having the FSA look at the matter seems to have been kicked it into the long grass; the agency has been considering it since 2002. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us where it has got to.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/7">We need a definitive plan. It is no good passing the proposal on to agencies so that no action is taken. The Government need to decide whether they are going to do it or whether they will pursue a libertarian line, which would be perfectly understandable. We need a statement from the Minister about which route she intends to take.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/8">I hope that the hon. Lady will also look at ways of encouraging food manufacturers to add folic acid in a way that stops short of compulsion. Notwithstanding the remarks of the industry, I am sure that that might be achieved through the various interventions open to the Minister. Perhaps she has some thoughts as to how we can get around the sticky issue of introducing compulsion. In this country we are naturally reluctant to have things added to our food. We all enjoy watching &quot;Big Brother&quot;, but we do not particularly want Big Brother ordaining what we shall eat, and most people in this country have little choice about the bread that they eat. Perhaps the Minister will consider the possibility that wholemeal flour might not have folate added if she is minded to ask manufacturers to add folic acid into bread more generally. People need to have an element of choice in their diet.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/9">I hope that the Minister agrees that it is highly desirable that foods are labelled in a way that is accessible to people so that they can make their own choice. There will be those who decide, for whatever reason, that they do not want that substance, and they need to be able to make the choice. Some will hold that folic acid may have long-term adverse consequences for their health, although I can see no evidence for that, and they are entitled to their view. They may choose not to take foods to which folic acid has been added.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/10">The Government might look slightly foolish if we found in 10, 20 or 30 years that there was a public health issue about the addition of folic acid and they had ordained it without giving people a choice. That would be a bad thing. The Minister has ages to talk about the subject, so I hope that she will be able to cover most of the points.</p>

	<p pid="b.254.0/1">I am pleased to be able to respond to the debate this morning. I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1759" name="Stewart Jackson">the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson)</phrase> for raising the issue and to his predecessor, Helen Clark, who, as ASBAH is based in Peterborough, saw this as an important part of her constituency work and secured the last Adjournment debate on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.254.0/2">I appreciate the points made by all hon. Members this morning. As with any public health matter, particularly a move to adopt a universal approach to tackling different issues&mdash;whether through fluoridation or through the food supply&mdash;there are often convincing arguments for the proposal. The issues that have been raised are important, because we need to make sure that we have explored all the evidence, including emerging evidence, to ensure that the benefits outweigh the potential harm to others in the population who might be affected. I do not, however, rule out the universal approach. I am in favour of water fluoridation, so it would be hypocritical of me to rule out the idea of seeking better mass campaigns or initiatives in other areas of health.</p>
	<p pid="b.254.0/3">More than 500 pregnancies a year are affected by neural tube defects, of which spina bifida is the most common. However, the issue is complex. Universal fortification of any food, such as wheat flour, as a public health measure, needs the fullest consideration. In the 1960s it was suggested that the risk of a woman giving birth to a child with a neural tube defect might be affected by her intake of the vitamin folate. Definitive evidence emerged in 1991 that supplementation with folic acid, the artificial form of the naturally occurring vitamin folate, significantly reduced the risk of NTDs in women who had already had an NTD-affected pregnancy.</p>
	<p pid="b.254.0/4">At that time the Government issued guidance advising supplementation with 4 mg of folic acid to prevent reoccurrence of NTDs. That guidance was later expanded to cover the prevention of first-time NTDs, with the recommendation that all women planning a pregnancy should take 400 micrograms as a daily dietary supplement from when they began to try to conceive until the 12th week of pregnancy, and that they should consume folate-rich foods&mdash;green leafy vegetables and folate-fortified foods.</p>
	<p pid="b.254.0/5">I take the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> about Brussels sprouts. I asked officials the other day about other folate-rich foods, and broccoli was mentioned. I was told that one would need to eat 2 kg of broccoli to get the recommended amount. I know that broccoli is a superfood, and it is one of my favourite vegetables, but that is a pretty tall order for any individual on a daily basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.254.0/6">Our policy, and that of previous Governments, has been to try to ensure that women of childbearing age are aware of the need to take folic acid supplements before and at the time of conception, to minimise the risk of an NTD in their offspring. In 1995 the Health Education Authority ran a national integrated campaign that targeted women of childbearing age, health and other professionals, such as teachers and journalists, and the commercial sector, including food retailers and manufacturers.</p>
	<p pid="b.254.0/7">I give credit to that campaign for achieving some heartening success. Unprompted awareness among women increased from 9 per cent. in 1995 to 49 per cent. in 1998, and prompted awareness has risen from 51 per cent. to 89 per cent. I am pleased to inform hon. Members that the last infant feeding survey, published in 2002, reported that 73 per cent. of mothers had taken supplements or modified their diets in early pregnancy.</p>

	<p pid="b.256.0/1">Does the Minister concede that supplementation does not work with respect to the absolute desire to reduce the number of neural tube defects each year, as represented by the scientific data over the past 13 years?</p>

	<p pid="b.256.1/1">Clearly, there is still a problem. More than 500 pregnancies a year are affected and, as I was going to say, there is of course still a problem with the number of unplanned pregnancies. About half of all pregnancies in the UK are unplanned and by the time a woman knows she is pregnant it may be too late for folic acid to be effective.</p>

	<p pid="b.256.3/1">I was referring to supplementation of folate.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.3/2">As to reaching those women whose pregnancies have not been prepared for, I welcome any support and encouragement from those in this Chamber to the Government over widening access to contraception services. The issue of women's and girls' sex education, and their awareness of contraception, was raised earlier. These are important things for young women, and men, to learn. I take it that hon. Members will give full support for some of our work in our sexual health campaign in the months and years ahead. Those issues are tied together in the context of how people can best plan pregnancies, and they have implications in other areas besides the one that we are focusing on today.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.3/3">In 2000, the Department's advisory committee, the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy, concluded that universal fortification of flour at   240 micrograms per 100 g in food products as consumed would have a significant effect in preventing NTD-affected births and pregnancies, without resulting in unacceptably high intakes in any group of the population. It was estimated that this would reduce the incidence of NTD-affected pregnancies by 41 per cent. and would have prevented 38 of the 93 NTD-affected births in England and Wales in 1998.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.3/4">We consulted on the recommendations in the report in 2000. Views were sought in particular on whether universal fortification of bread or flour was desirable; whether any such fortification should be mandatory or voluntary; the practicalities of fortification; the impact of the recommendations on consumers and consumer choice; and food labelling and technical issues for industry. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">The hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase> mentioned food labelling, which is extremely important in food safety and better health.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.3/5">The consultation was therefore complex and the responses raised a number of issues. As the hon. Member for Peterborough mentioned, the majority of respondents&mdash;59 per cent.&mdash;were in favour of fortification. However, that was not overwhelming. The most common concerns related to the potential risks of fortification, in particular the risk of B12 deficiency among older adults. A significant number felt that there was still not sufficient information available about the possible adverse effects. Almost 80 per cent. of respondents felt that consumer choice would be lost if all flour were fortified. Respondents from the industry also stated that there may be technical problems associated with any mandatory policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.3/6">All those concerns demanded further exploration and the Department of Health and the Food Standards Agency commissioned relevant research and undertook further work to develop a sound policy. I should remind the hon. Member for Westbury that one of the reasons this Government had support across the House for the creation and establishment of the agency was the knock-on effect of the disaster with BSE which was caused by a previous Tory Government and the issue of the quality of independent advice to Government on the safety of our food. The agency's public remit may not be exactly as some people might wish, but its remit is to advise the Government independently on the safety of food and to enable the consumer to make clear choices about the food they purchase.</p>

	<p pid="b.257.0/1">I am trying to avoid the overtly partisan nature of some of the Minister's comments. I fully concede that both Conservative and Labour Governments have not acted with due alacrity over the last few years, so we do not need to stray into political point-scoring. Can the Minister tell me what single piece of detailed, definitive scientific research the Department is using to militate against a policy of fortification with folic acid?</p>

	<p pid="b.257.2/1">In the previous Adjournment debate, the then Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1776" name="Jacqui Smith">the right hon. Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith)</phrase> said:</p>
	<p pid="b.257.2/2" class="indent">&quot;To make full sense of the findings on the prevalence of B12 deficiency, a cost-benefit analysis has been carried out by the Department of Health.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2001-12-19.395"><i>Official Report</i>, 19 December 2001; Vol. 377, c. 395</phrase>.]</p>

	<p pid="b.257.3/1">I am happy to write to the hon. Lady with more detail. In the next part of my speech I shall explore the issue of B12 deficiency a little more. There is a balance to be struck. Sometimes we do not have enough information to hand about the potential adverse effects. It is a difficult and complex area. The findings in the United States have been cited this morning; there are sometimes difficulties in comparing different countries' practices, like with like. I like to think that we, with our health service that is free at the point of service, have a lot to teach America, although I do not say that we cannot learn from the Americans. There are clear issues about access to health services, particularly for older people, and the problem of identifying whether folic acid masks B12 deficiency and thus affects the ability of the health service to ascertain whether an older person suffers from it.</p>
	<p pid="b.257.3/2">The benefits for women of childbearing age of taking folic acid are well established, but many feel that the potential risk of vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly for older people, is not. Many hon. Members agree with that. High levels of folic acid can make it difficult to diagnose B12 deficiency, which can, if undetected for a long time, cause damage to the nerves and spinal cord, leading to severe disability. The anaemia that usually appears first allows early detection of B12 deficiency before any nerve damage occurs. Older adults are at the greatest risk of B12 deficiency, because they are less able to absorb vitamins from foods&mdash;we will all have to adjust to that as we get older. There is, therefore, legitimate concern that the fortification of foods with folic acid could increase the number of older people at risk of undetected B12 deficiency.</p>
	<p pid="b.257.3/3">Information on the true prevalence of B12 deficiency in the UK was unknown in 2000, and we felt that it was not right to make a decision at that time without further work on that and other issues. Recent research funded by the Department indicates that 10 per cent. of people aged over 65&mdash;approximately 5,000 to 6,000 people&mdash;could be at risk of undetected B12 deficiency.</p>
	<p pid="b.257.3/4">As has been mentioned, fortification was introduced in the US in 1998, from which there seem to be some good outcomes. No other European country has implemented a mandatory fortification policy; countries that have include the United States, Canada and Chile. Although a number of respondents to the consultation suggested that we could use the American policy to inform our policy, it is difficult to compare the situations there and here. I acknowledge that there are no adverse reports in America, so far, about B12 deficiency, but the Americans have not focused on unidentified B12 deficiency. For all we know, it could be that people there have suffered from B12 deficiency that has led to more severe problems, but the situation with the American health systems means that it has not been picked up.</p>

	<p pid="b.258.0/1">Is the hon. Lady aware of the paper that Professor A.V. Hoffbrand gave to the ASBAH symposium on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-10">10 May</phrase>, in which he quoted four academic studies from the United States that failed to show any empirical, clinical evidence linking folic acid intake with B12 vitamin deficiency in young or old people?</p>

	<p pid="b.258.1/1">That is interesting. I am happy to consider the paper and to make sure that our officials are aware of any developments in the United States, but it is important to consider the differences between health services, particularly in relation to the ability of the poorest people in society to access them. We in this country have something to be proud of in that regard.</p>

	<p pid="b.258.2/1">I would like to clear up a small point. Is the Minister saying that because she disagrees with the health care delivery system in the United States, she believes that the public health surveillance system there is defective? That is the implication of her remarks.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.259.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" colnum="259"  time="010:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h01.htm#51019h01_spnew20">
	<p pid="b.259.0/1">No, it is not. I am saying that the health services of other countries cannot necessarily be compared, like with like. The United States has some examples of extremely good health care, but I am advised that the problem of B12 deficiency does not have a particularly high priority when trying to identify whether fortification poses a risk. The FSA and the Department of Health believe that that matter needs further consideration. As I said, I shall ensure that our officials are made aware of recent research, and that it informs all discussions on fortification.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.0/2">The FSA has also been addressing other issues of concern to consumers, such as the labelling of fortified foods, an issue mentioned by the hon. Member for Westbury; the legal position; and the technical aspects of fortification, such as problems with the fortification of wholemeal flour to which no vitamins or minerals are added, and the additional amounts required to overcome loss of folic acid during processing. The FSA has conducted detailed discussions with industry to ensure that any proposed action is feasible. If we are to make a recommendation for change, we must ensure that that important work has been done.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.0/3">The FSA board subsequently concluded that it would not recommend the mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid, and it wished further to review emerging evidence on the impact of fortification on B12 deficiency in older people. I understand that that work is ongoing. We agreed with the board's advice and asked the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition to consider the implications of folic acid fortification and any emerging evidence on the benefits and risks. I shall check that the papers cited by the hon. Member for Peterborough have been taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.0/4">The SACN has been considering the risks and benefits of fortification, not only in connection with the prevention of spina bifida but because of its potential to reduce blood homocysteine levels and thereby the risk of heart disease. The hon. Gentleman mentioned circulatory disease. Those interesting developments may lead to fortification having more than one added value.</p>

	<p pid="b.259.1/1">I promise that this will be my last intervention&mdash;probably. I am anxious to press the point before the Minister concludes her remarks. Will she give an undertaking that the results and recommendations of the SACN will be considered promptly by the Food Standards Agency; that is at least within 12 months, and preferably within six months? That is not an unreasonable request, given that it is now 14 years since the Medical Research Council's landmark report. With all respect, ASBAH and the families who are suffering and will suffer as a result of that congenital disease have waited long enough.</p>

	<p pid="b.259.2/1">I am certainly looking into what progress has been made, and I understand that the SACN is hoping to finalise its report early next year. It is meeting tomorrow, and its decisions on timetabling will be reported to me. I have also asked officials to raise the question of the level of fortification to ensure that it is considered by the committee; it is an important aspect of the discussion. The committee will be finalising its report early next year, after publishing it for external consultation with stakeholders. The Food Standards Agency and my colleagues in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will consider the SACN recommendations carefully.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.2/2">The hon. Member for Westbury made a number of statements on health, low-weight births and so on. Those are important issues. The Labour Government were the first to recognise that there is something called health inequality. Conservative Governments called it &quot;variations in health&quot;. Over the past few years, we have been trying to understand why, despite the available evidence, we are not reaching people in poorer communities as well as we should. That has been happening for decades.</p>

	<p pid="b.260.1/1">No, I should like to develop my argument. We are debating important issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.1/2">We know that public health and people's choice of lifestyle are often affected by social and economic factors. That is why, for example, we have some 88 spearhead health communities; we have identified them as some of our poorest, and we have identified better ways to reach them. Most Members of Parliament, and their families, feel confident enough to access the latest information on the internet about how they should look after themselves and what vitamins they should take. For some in our communities, that is not the case, partly because our health services have been structured so that they focus only on treating people when they are ill rather than trying to prevent them from falling ill in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.1/3">&quot;Choosing Health&quot;, which was published last year, is the first comprehensive White Paper dealing with public health which recognises that Government have a role. Clearly, the health service has a role, and local government has a role in matters such as the quality of the environment. Tackling crime is important as well, but how can we allow individuals to make choices&mdash;choosing health&mdash;for themselves? I shall give one example relating to low-weight birth, which I was interested by when I read about it. We have made enormous progress in England in addressing some of the issues concerning smoking, particularly in raising to a high level the awareness of the dangers of smoking while pregnant among women who are or who want to become pregnant. I am proud to have helped to establish the first service of its kind for pregnant women in Doncaster, which then became the national Quitline service to support pregnant women wishing to give up or reduce smoking.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.1/4">Despite good evidence that smoking rates have gone down while this Government have been in power, tremendously so among pregnant women, there is a smaller group of pregnant women, often very young and often of low educational attainment, who have a confusion in their minds. Some of them weigh up the consequences of smoking against those of having a heavier baby, thinking that a low-weight baby would be less painful in childbirth.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.1/5">That is one example showing how, when we are talking about public health, within and between communities, with men and women, older and younger people, and people from different ethnic backgrounds, we must understand where they are coming from if we are to make some progress in reducing health inequality. For too long, the health service has been quite traditional and has focused on hospital services rather than on what happens in communities and how we can work together.</p>

	<p pid="b.261.1/2">We introduced the Sure Start programme. I was pleased to be able to sit on the board of the trailblazing Sure Start unit in my constituency. I have seen it grow over the last few years because of the help and support that it gives to people and their families&mdash;men and women, grandparents and others. They also use the outreach services. I have seen a transformation in the role of health visitors and community midwives, who are working much more with families on issues that are wider than the conventional issues of antenatal care.</p>

	<p pid="b.261.3/2">A point was made by, I think, the hon.

	<p pid="b.262.3/1">Thank you, Mr. Amess. I hope that we will make progress on the core subject of today's Adjournment debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.3/2">We all agree that universal fortification is a complex issue and raises all sorts of questions about the scientific evidence base and about what is publicly acceptable. We have touched not only on the health outcomes, but on how we make fortification work, how we keep people informed and how the industry can respond technically. I hope that, after careful consideration of the benefits and of how we manage any risks, we can make progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.3/3">The Government continue to encourage women of childbearing age who might become pregnant to increase their folate intake, including through the use of supplements. We are also promoting the use of pre-conceptional supplements and increased dietary intakes of folic acid through the &quot;healthy start&quot; and &quot;five a day&quot; programmes, for example. In addition, we are considering ways of addressing concerns about the prevalence and about the identification of vitamin B12 deficiency among older people in its own right. We are also supporting the folic acid flash scheme, which helps consumers to identify foods that manufacturers have voluntarily fortified with folic acid. I shall have a look at what further work can be done with industry on voluntary change.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.3/4">I hope that I have reassured Members that we are taking this issue seriously. After the previous agreement with the FSA not to recommend fortification, we have not simply let the issue drift. We constantly consider reviewing the situation and updating our approach, based on any evidence that comes forward. We shall be considering the issue in great depth.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.3/5">I welcome today's debate. We shall endeavour to find the best public health solution, taking account of the benefits and risks to all sections of the population. I say to the hon. Member for Peterborough that I certainly hope that it will not be 12 months before we reach conclusions on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.3/6">Sitting suspended.</p>

</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.263.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1451" speakername="Ian Liddell-Grainger" colnum="263"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h02.htm#51019h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.263.1/1">I shall start, unusually, by praising the Government. Then again, there is nothing like good news. I thank the Government for calling in the Exeter airport bid. I do not think that there is any doubt in my constituency that we did not want Bristol and Exeter airports owned by one company, whoever it might be. I hope that the Government will consider the issue in the light of transport competition and will take the right decision, which is to put the matter back into the melting pot so that we do not have two regional airports in the west country owned by one company.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/2">I am grateful to have secured the debate, but also rather sad. This is not the first time that I have stood in Westminster Hall to question the transport policies of my local county council. The Minister may be relatively new to her office, but her capable team will certainly have given her chapter and verse about my regular parliamentary interventions on the subject over the past four years. The trouble is that there are enough chapters and verses to fill the Library. I have stood here and bemoaned Somerset county council's road speed management policies more times than I and probably the Liberal Democrat rulers of the council would care to remember. I have criticised the council for cutting bus subsidies and I have fearlessly, on occasion, had to name names. Today, I reserve the right to do the same all over again.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/3">Perhaps the leader of Somerset county council, Mrs.   Cathy Bakewell, is already bracing herself for another personal tirade. Perhaps down in her bunker in Taunton, the official spin doctors are even now loading fax machines with a counter-attack, a spirited defence of their Lib Dem leadership. I can already sniff the cordite, but just hold your fire and hear me out. The truth is that I would much prefer to be sharing the warm glow of civic pride. How refreshing it would be to pat Mrs. Bakewell on the back and pamper her with praise. I would love to stand here and congratulate the county council on a terrific transport policy. That is one of my genuine ambitions, but I am sorry, Mrs. B.; it ain't gonna happen today.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/4">What follows is a tale of muddle and woe, a story that would be more plausible if it involved a chaotic boarding house run by John Cleese. It is about what really goes on down in county hall or, as everyone else in Somerset seems to call it, Bakewell towers. We are talking about a branch of local government that has a huge impact on people's lives. The transport division runs the buses, maintains the roads and, importantly, gets children to school. We all accept that that is not an easy task in beautiful rural Somerset with its meandering roads. It requires a dedicated and experienced team of people behind the scenes, with a thorough and businesslike approach. It cries out for annual progress reports. I believe that Her Majesty's Government insist on such reports; APRs are very important things.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/5">The last one conducted for Somerset's transport division was called APR4. It was a study of how the council had performed in the year ending April 2004 and it considered specific targets and compared them with real results. APRs are ready-reckoners of local government; at a glance, one can spot what has gone wrong and what has gone right. In Somerset, the comparison was stark. Between APR3 and APR4, something went badly wrong. The wheels of the transport department are&mdash;dare I say it?&mdash;perilously close to falling off. Who is to blame? Aha! This is where the plot begins to thicken.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/6">Before the electors of Bridgwater and west Somerset sent me to this place, I was an Army officer. When something goes wrong in the Army, it is the officer who has to take the blame, and rightly so; it is the officer's head on the block. The same should, and usually does, apply to local government. That is why the top people&mdash;the departmental managers of county hall&mdash;are paid upwards of &pound;44,000 a year. That is why we have elections to keep in, or kick out, the politicians. The whip hand is with the people.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/7">It is all fine and dandy if the council leaders produce sensible policies for the highly paid managers to undertake and the highly paid managers have a dedicated team of people. In Somerset, however, the council leaders have come up with a tuppence ha'penny transport policy; actually, I would not give them as much as half a tuppence. The highly paid transport managers cannot get enough people to work for them. I want everyone to hold that thought. In Somerset they cannot get the staff. When one hears the whole story, I suspect that one will understand why.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/8">It is a bit like running an army with generals and officers but no troops; that may be rather too close to home. It is a guarantee of cock-up and disaster. Remember that this is a department with the power to spend millions of pounds of public money every year; it is the department that organises road repairs and deals with multi-million pound, blue-chip contractors, negotiates with bus contractors and deals directly with Government. We would rightly expect such responsible tasks to be undertaken by a team with experience, but we would be bitterly disappointed, as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase> has said on many occasions.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/9">Many of the important and responsible tasks requiring experience and professional know-how in Somerset county council's transport division were at the time being executed by&mdash;wait for it&mdash;an office junior. I said earlier that I reserve the right to name names, but in this case I will withhold it; I do not attack the executive. The junior in question turned out to be a minor. With such a degree of inefficiency displayed by the transport division, the Government office for the south-west ordered a full internal inquiry, in the course of which it became clear that the junior officer was doing far too much important work and doing it with understandable inefficiency. How could he cope? It was not his pay grade.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/10">I would not have been so bad if the junior had possessed the magic powers of Harry Potter, but that junior was what Alastair Campbell would describe as a bog-standard junior. I do not blame him personally; I would never do that. Fresh out of school, perhaps, still a bit spotty, very keen but wet behind the ears. I certainly blame the managers and, above all, just like the Army it is the general's fault. The buck must stop with Councillor Bakewell.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/11">In Dickens's day they sent boys up chimneys; it appears that in Councillor Bakewell's day they seem to have found a new use for child labour in Somerset county council's transport division.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/12">I am afraid there is a lot more. The Government office of the south-west did a lot of digging and found a great deal of dirt and, in my book, dirt is inefficiency. Here is an example. The investigators looked at the strategic performance targets set for the divisional transport division; two-thirds of them&mdash;66 per cent. of the targets&mdash;had been missed badly. In the Army, that is a rate of miss for which a person would have been court-martialled. I do not just mean a miss by several miles, I mean that in many cases the targets were not just missed; they were never fired at in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/13">Money allocated for specific targets and projects in Somerset was not spent at all in many cases. The report from the experts at the Government office describes the efforts and efficiency of the transport division as &quot;weak&quot;. It is an appalling circumstance. It is a rather genteel description, but, surprise, surprise, Somerset county council is already behaving as though it was unfairly treated. It says that being weak is awfully close to being not so weak. However, it is a heck of a long way from being strong, which it should be.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/14">I approached county hall for a report, but it did not want me to have sight of it. I wonder why? Could it be that it did not want me to read about the serious lack of managers? Yes, the managers have been leaving like rats from a sinking ship. I had to get a copy of the report from the Minister's Department and the Library. It was finally e-mailed to me after I had threatened to name names in Parliament. That is a damning criticism of a body that handles so much public money.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/15">There is more. The report looked at Somerset county council services overall and came to the conclusion that it is obvious to those of us that use the service that the thrust of corporate thinking is directed at social services and education.</p>

	<p pid="b.265.0/1">Is my hon. Friend aware that the administrative confusion, added to the fact that there is an annual raid on the transport budget for other purposes, has led to a marked deterioration of the secondary roads in Somerset? There is no routine resurfacing of those roads and there is an enormous backlog of maintenance. Is that not a direct contradiction of the promoted sustainability, which we hear all the time? Does my hon. Friend agree that that is a further illustration of the great gap between words and deeds with which we are familiar from the Government, but which has now also crept into county council government?</p>

	<p pid="b.265.1/1">I thank my right hon. Friend and agree with the point that he makes. He is the senior MP in Somerset, and for 20 years has held the county council to account.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.1/2">As my right hon. Friend said, the secondary roads in Somerset are a disgrace. In fact, a local county councillor called them</p>
	<p pid="b.265.1/3" class="indent">&quot;a load of cart-tracks.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.265.1/4">At the moment, the county council is desperately trying to sort them out&mdash;to tar them and bring them up to standard&mdash;but it is failing dismally. I agree with my right hon. Friend that if the roads are not sorted out, they will get much worse.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.1/5">It is small wonder that, in 2003, transport was considered so unsatisfactory by the public that Councillor Bakewell gave the budget an extra &pound;3 million to try to paper over the cracks. Did that work? Did it heck. That was the year when major internal organisational changes were implemented. In other words, the report identified a clear muddle. It was also the year of the wretched road sign fiasco, when half-baked policies to cut down accidents led to hundreds of silly speed signs in all the wrong places. That policy was implemented without decent consent and millions of pounds was wasted. No one was consulted. The only pleasure that I take in criticising the county's policies is that at least they had the guts to reverse them, even though they had spent &pound;2 million in the wrong way.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.1/6">The road management policy was reversed simply because the public in Somerset rebelled and said, &quot;Enough is enough.&quot; I again have to pay tribute to the Government, because the Minister's predecessor said that they would not support the policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.1/7">I admit to one extra personal pleasure; the fate of the Liberal Democrat councillor who shared the implementation of those policies. At least the electorate had the sense to chuck out ex-Councillor Tim Carroll.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.1/8">I read the Government's own report, or as much of it as the county council was prepared to let me have, with a growing feeling that it explained many things that had gone wrong and are still going wrong with the council's transport policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.1/9">Now I understand why the county was so stupid as to slash its bus subsidy by a quarter of a million pounds. It happened because the division that could have defended bus subsidies was woefully short of senior managers with the brains or the clout to intervene. They did not dare to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.1/10">Many thanks are in order to the investigators from the Government office for the south-west and the Department for Transport. Without their investigation we might never have known, and without their efforts nothing would have been done to put things right.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.1/11">I am prepared to give Councillor Bakewell one single benefit of the doubt. Her officials say that the next annual progress report will be better, and claim that the Government office for the south-west is now content, or slightly more content. Perhaps the Minister can enlighten me on that matter. Perhaps it will be worth waiting a little longer to see what happens.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.1/12">The report is a classic; a textbook example of how not to run a vital council service. I think that it will be known forever by the people of west Somerset as &quot;Bakewell's folly&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.266.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1451" name="Ian Liddell-Grainger">the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Liddell-Grainger)</phrase> on securing this important Adjournment debate on local transport in Somerset. I have listened with interest to what he has had to say.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/2">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me for not wishing to comment in any detail on the representations that he has made about the leader of Somerset county council. That is beyond my brief and I do not think it would be appropriate for me to comment on those strongly held views.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/3">However, I will talk through the Government's approach to local transport in Somerset and the funding arrangements, and I will refer to some of the points that the hon. Gentleman made about some of the allegations concerning the delivery of local transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/4">I shall begin by stating that the Government are committed to sustained long-term investment to improve local transport as a key element of our 10-year plan. We announced in December 2000 that &pound;8.4 billion would be made available to implement local transport plans across England over the following five years. In December 2000, we said that Somerset county council would receive more than &pound;22.5 million</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/5">In December 2000, we said that Somerset county council would receive more than &pound;22.5 million for integrated transport measures in its first local transport plan. In fact, we provided almost &pound;3 million in reward funding and supplementary bids in addition to that figure. In last year's White Paper, &quot;The Future of Transport: a network for 2030&quot;, we confirmed our commitment to continue that high level of investment in all forms of transport. The planning guidelines, published for the five years of the second local transport plans, maintain those levels of high investment.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/6">Subject to the results of the consultation and the final assessments of Somerset county council's second local transport plan, we plan to make available to it similar levels of investment of almost &pound;24 million in the next five years. Of course, that figure could increase significantly if the local transport plan were assessed as being one of the best in the country. On the other hand, a bad assessment could reduce the level of funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/7">Local transport plans are intended to address the very real needs of people in Somerset. The focus will be on our shared priorities, which have been agreed with our partners in local government. There are four main priority areas on which we focus. First, we expect plans to tackle congestion, which is a cost to us all in lost time and in air pollution. Secondly, the local transport plan will aim to improve people's access to the jobs and services that they need for day-to-day living. This is not necessarily about improving transport, although it will be in many cases, but about taking services out to the people who need them. Thirdly, local transport plans will continue the excellent work undertaken in the past five years to improve road safety. Finally, local transport plans are intended to improve air quality overall.</p>

	<p pid="b.267.0/1">The Minister said that two of the objectives were to reduce congestion and to improve air quality. Congestion is a particularly acute problem in Taunton, the county town of Somerset. The vision for Taunton, as part of an overall regional strategy, is that two new bridges will be built in Taunton to improve traffic flow and to ease congestion in the town. Will the Minister, either this morning or at some point in the future, say where the Government have got to on the decision to fund those two bridges, and whether she is sympathetic to those projects?</p>

	<p pid="b.268.0/1">I am afraid that I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman today what the Government's position is on the funding or the general commitment to those bridges, but I am happy to write to him with an update.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.0/2">Transport authorities are now working up final plans to take account of lessons learnt and to plan for the next five years. My Department is working closely with authorities across a range of topics and is advising where necessary on improving delivery and achievements of targets. Final local transport plans will be presented to Government next March.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.0/3">I emphasise that we are still consulting on the precise way in which we will allocate funds through LTP2. Under the current proposals, as I have said, Somerset will enjoy similar levels to those in the first local transport plan as a result of this formula. I note the hon. Gentleman's concern that rural areas appear to lose in this process, but that will not be the case in Somerset. We are keen that the way in which these important resources are allocated to local authorities should be clear and transparent, which is why we undertook the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.0/4">I listened with interest to what the hon. Member for Bridgwater said about Somerset's particular local transport problems. Last December, my Department allocated Somerset &pound;20.5 million for this year's integrated transport allocation, including &pound;16 million for maintenance. As he knows, last year's assessment of all transport authorities' performance classified Somerset's performance as weak. In order to help Somerset to improve its performance, my Department has commissioned W. S. Atkins to advise it, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out. This work has highlighted several areas that require improvement, and W. S. Atkins has recommended measures to address those problems. I am sure that Somerset will consider how to implement the report, and that its officials will work with my officials in the Government Office for the South West to improve their performance. We are assessing Somerset's latest APR, and will make the result public later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.0/5">The hon. Gentleman will also be aware of the need for prudent management of regional transport funds. We have taken a bold step by introducing regional funding allocations so that the regions will have a responsibility to advise Government on their priorities for the future funding of projects and schemes. Somerset will no doubt contribute to the prioritisation process, and I look forward to hearing more about the county's involvement.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.0/6">Somerset has also contributed to, if not led, the south-west region's discussions on improvement of freight movements across the county by co-ordinating the production of a regional freight map. That crucial work will ease local people's concerns about HGVs in villages, and will provide operators with clear route guidance to avoid problems. Again, I look forward to seeing how the work can inform a sensible and consistent routing of HGVs to minimise their impact on local communities, and to provide an efficient network for the delivery of goods throughout the region.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.0/7">The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the recent opening of the Silk Mills road bridge in Taunton, which now spans the main south-west rail line, replacing an historically congested level crossing. That is part of an additional &pound;14.5million package of local transport major projects improvements, providing free flow of traffic to complement the development of a new park and ride facility that will soon be offering temporary parking for Christmas shopping. It is further evidence of the Government's commitment to address congestion points within the county.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.0/8">In addition, an &pound;11.6m package of transport measures designed to alleviate congestion in north-west Taunton is currently being assessed by my officials, with a decision expected next year following receipt of the region's advice on its priorities for that type of scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.0/9">I hope that I have been able to demonstrate that the Government are committed both to continuing investment in local transport in Somerset and to working with local authorities to ensure that their performance is raised. We are closely monitoring that performance and will continue to do everything that we can to work in effective partnership, both in setting priorities and in ensuring that our investment is delivered properly in order to improve the transport system in the hon. Gentleman's constituency.</p>

	Private Sector (NHS)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.270.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" speakername="Kevan Jones" colnum="270"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h03.htm#51019h03_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.270.1/1">I am pleased to have secured this debate. The use of the private sector in the health service is a topic of great interest not only in the House but in the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.1/2">I shall start by making it clear that I am not against private sector involvement in the NHS per se. By calling this debate I shall no doubt be labelled as troublesome, lefty and against any reform. I am not against reform. I am open to suggestions that work for my constituents or those of other hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.1/3">If the private or independent sector is able to provide services that complement those provided by the NHS, at a competitive price, without affecting the standard of care or undermining the NHS's general principles, its involvement should be welcomed. It should be welcomed as long as we remain true to the principles of the NHS. In other words, the service should meet everyone's needs, be free at the point of need and be based on patients' clinical need rather than on their ability to pay.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.1/4">I am almost sure that the Minister will refer to the fact that the private sector has been involved in the health service from its inception. I agree with that. The County Durham and Darlington Acute Hospitals NHS Trust is a good example of use of the private sector. At Bishop Auckland hospital and at Darlington memorial hospital, a private company called Lodestone has provided screening services for the past five years. At Bishop Auckland hospital, the waiting time for non-urgent scans is three weeks and at Darlington it is about four weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.1/5">However, where the private sector operates in the NHS, we must ensure that three main criteria are met: the founding principles of the NHS must be adhered to; the public must receive value for money; and NHS services must be complemented, not undermined. Unfortunately, the case to which I shall refer affects my constituency, where I wonder whether any of the three criteria are being met.</p>

	<p pid="b.270.2/1">Would my hon. Friend add a fourth criterion to the three that he has given, and with which I do not disagree? The resources given to the private and independent providers in the NHS should be similar to the NHS units with which they compete. Independent sector treatment centres, for example, have no obligation to provide acute and continuing care. They are also given, on average, 40 per cent. more resource, so they are able to cherry pick, compete with and close down NHS units.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.270.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" speakername="Kevan Jones" colnum="270"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h03.htm#51019h03_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.270.3/1">I strongly agree with that. If the private sector is to complement the health service, it should compete on a level playing field, not on an advantageous playing field, which clearly some parts of it are being set up to do.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.270.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1728" speakername="Paul Farrelly" colnum="270"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h03.htm#51019h03_spnew3">
	<p pid="b.270.4/1">I do not want to make the list of criteria endless, but does my hon. Friend agree that there should always be, as a fifth criterion, proper, considered consultation and debate about wide-ranging proposals? It is unfortunate that we have not had that because the Government slipped out the paper a week into the summer recess.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.271.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" speakername="Kevan Jones" colnum="271"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h03.htm#51019h03_spnew4">
	<p pid="b.271.0/1">I shall be referring to that later. It is important that local people have a say in the way in which their health service is run.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.0/2">By way of background to how I got involved in this debate, in February of this year, a woman called Pat Hall who lives in Craghead in my constituency came to see me. She explained that she was experiencing a long delay in getting a magnetic resonance imaging scan and was confused as to why she was being sent to the James Cook university hospital in Middlesbrough rather than the University hospital of north Durham, which is very near to where she lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.0/3">As most Members would have done, I wrote to the chief executive of the local NHS trust for an explanation. Very helpfully, a few days later, the chief executive, John Saxby of the County Durham and Darlington Acute Hospitals NHS Trust wrote back to me. What he wrote was illuminating. He of course apologised for the delay in Mrs. Hall's scan. He referred to some wider issues that affected not just this case but others in north Durham.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.0/4">Mr. Saxby pointed out that the Department of Health nationally had agreed an initiative which resulted in the commissioning of Alliance Medical Ltd to provide additional scanning services to the NHS. He described how the mobile scanning unit provided by Alliance Medical had arrived at the University hospital of north Durham, only to find that the reinforced parking area required for it was not near enough to the electrical power supply. As a result the scanning unit was moved to Middlesbrough. My constituents had to travel down to Middlesbrough rather than to their local hospital. The distance is about 30 miles. Some might say that that is not very far, but my constituency has very low car ownership. People living in some of the outlying villages might as well be on the moon: 30 miles is a long distance for people with no access to cars.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.0/5">Mr. Saxby described the problems with the contracts he was facing and I will return to that later. I found some of the wider issues he raised absolutely fascinating. I should like to read out some of what he describes as his &quot;quibbles with the contract&quot;. He states:</p>
	<p pid="b.271.0/6" class="indent">&quot;The MRI scanner at University Hospital North Durham is considerably under-employed and has been for some time, and it is the case that had the 'Alliance Medical' money been directed to us at the University Hospital North Durham we would have been able to put on a large number of scanning clinics, which would have almost eliminated in total our waiting times and waiting numbers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.271.0/7">He went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="b.271.0/8" class="indent">&quot;It was a disappointment for us when the Department of Health said that providing individual hospitals with additional resources was not an option, the additional resources had to be made available to the private sector.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.271.0/9">He concluded:</p>
	<p pid="b.271.0/10" class="indent">&quot;We are not alone in this as there are a number of hospitals up and down the country, which have spare capacity within their existing scanners.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.271.0/11">I was concerned, as I am sure other hon. Members would be, by what Mr. Saxby said in his letter.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.0/12">First, there was the shambolic case of Alliance Medical arriving at the hospital and not being able to operate the service because the electricity supply was not laid on, forcing my constituents to travel 30 miles to Middlesbrough. Secondly, and far more seriously, the local NHS trust was seeing money that could have been used to operate an underused scanner diverted to a private company at the expense of the NHS. Finally, this was happening not only in north Durham but throughout the country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.272.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1907" speakername="Helen Jones" colnum="272"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h03.htm#51019h03_spnew5">
	<p pid="b.272.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the situation is even worse? Many of the independent treatment centres are being paid above NHS costs as well as being able to cherry pick the easiest operations. Yet they have no responsibility and nothing built into their payments for the cost of training staff and ongoing staff developments.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.272.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1907" speakername="Helen Jones" colnum="272"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h03.htm#51019h03_spnew6">
	<p pid="b.272.1/1">I entirely agree. It is an area that I shall explore later. Trying to pin down exactly what the costs are is difficult as they are shrouded in mystery somewhere in the Department of Health. Following Mr. Saxby's letter, I asked a series of written questions to try to get the facts about this contract. I was keen to find out what the Department of Health's view of the contract was and, in particular, I wanted to know whether the contract represented value for money.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/2">Contrary to press reports in <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> of <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-27">27 March</phrase> this year, I have not been gagged, and over the past six months I have asked more than 100 written questions to try to get to the bottom of this matter. I have not been reassured by the answers that I have received. Overall I have a number of concerns about the replies from the Minister and his predecessor, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1387" name="John Hutton">the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton)</phrase>, and even the reply to my oral question to the Secretary of State herself a few weeks ago. I hope that by answering some of my questions, which the Department seems reluctant to answer in writing, the Minister can free up some of my time and ensure that I do not have to table five questions a day to the Department.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/3">I suggest that any right hon. or hon. Member who wants to get to the bottom of an issue should keep asking parliamentary questions, because the way in which they are answered raises even more concerns. I have used this process to glean as much information as I can, and the information that I am about to give is the Department of Health's own&mdash;it is not my opinion. If the Department wants to deny the facts, it can happily look through my hundred-odd written questions.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/4">My first concern is that, in commissioning a private firm to run the scanning service, the Department has made no assessment of existing capacity in the NHS&mdash;this is where things get a little boring, so I hope that everybody will stick with me. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-05">5 October</phrase>, in answer to a written question, the Minister said that what he described as</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/5" class="indent">&quot;an unparalleled expansion in most diagnostic services&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/6">was the result of</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/7" class="indent">&quot;plans . . . based on understanding and meeting local needs for diagnostic services, which have been developed through working closely with local health communities to understand their needs for extra capacity.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-10-05.2831"><i>Official Report</i>, 5 October 2005; Vol. 436, c. 2831W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/8">I wonder how that answer squares with the facts at the University hospital of North Durham, whose scanner is only five years old and is used for only 50 per cent. of the time that it could be.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/9">In other answers, the Minister refers to the capacity planning exercise that took place in 2004 with the strategic health authorities. Apparently, it concluded that MRI scanning services needed to increase by 100 per cent. over the next three years. Unfortunately, the Minister and the Department do not refer in their answers to any assessment of existing capacity&mdash;they talk only about expanding capacity. Furthermore, I spoke to my local strategic authority, which confirmed that no such planning exercise had been undertaken. Like the University hospital of north Durham, it has simply been told by the Department that it has to use a centrally procured contract with Alliance Medical and that that is the way to get the waiting list down in Durham.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/10">That can lead to only one conclusion: the commissioning of Alliance Medical to provide scanning services was done on the basis of political dogma, not evidence. According to the dogma, if waiting lists are long, the NHS must be too inefficient to sort out the problems and a private firm should be given the money to tackle them instead. However, the failure to examine existing capacity has led to a problem, because, in north Durham, an NHS-provided scanner is sitting there unused.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/11">The other problem is how we test whether the contract is good value for money. The Minister was unable to tell me the average cost of a scan on the NHS and, in a written answer on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-22">22 June</phrase>, declined for reasons of commercial sensitivity to tell me the average cost of a scan provided by Alliance Medical. In the same answer, however, he stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/12" class="indent">&quot;The contract was secured at excellent value being approximately half the national health service equivalent cost for the total patient episode.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-06-22.1091"><i>Official Report</i>, 22 June 2005; Vol. 435, c. 1091W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/13">I therefore have a simple question: could the Minister define what he meant by value for money? I would be grateful it he could tell us today how he arrived at the statement that he gave. I say that especially because, having read various medical journals over the summer, including the magazine of the Society and College of Radiographers&mdash;that is how sad I am&mdash;I saw that the managing director of Alliance Medical had said:</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/14" class="indent">&quot;At the time the contract was awarded, there was an NHS reference price of around &pound;330 per scan.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/15">If he can announce that in a national publication, why can the Minister not give the information to me, as an elected Member of Parliament?</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/16">It also appears that the Department of Health does not have much information about the impact that Alliance Medical has had on the scanning waiting lists. In a written answer on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase> to a question asking how much Alliance Medical has reduced waiting times in the Durham and Darlington trust area, I was told that the information is not held centrally. That was a surprise to me, because I read an article in <i>The Guardian</i> by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health that stated that waiting times for scans, in Barnsley of all places, had been reduced substantially.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/17">It transpires&mdash;I have been digging&mdash;that the figures in the article were, to quote from another written answer,</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/18" class="indent">&quot;based on reliable information provided by Alliance Medical Ltd.&quot; &mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-07-21.2178"><i>Official Report</i>, 21 July 2005; Vol. 436, c. 2178W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/19">I am disappointed that such reliable evidence was not available for my area, either through the Department of Health or Alliance Medical.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/20">I shall turn briefly to the performance of Alliance Medical. I was unable to determine how it was performing in meeting the obligations of the contract. I was told in a written answer that the contract</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/21" class="indent">&quot;is monitored weekly, quarterly and annually&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-07-05.342"><i>Official Report</i>, 5 July 2005; Vol. 436, c. 342W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/22">I was then told on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase> that the annual review was taking place in July and that if a decision could be published consistent with commercial confidentiality, that would take place later. I am still waiting for that report to be published.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/23">The House will also be interested to know that an article in the <i>Health Service Journal</i> in August spoke of how 70,000 scans had not been carried out by Alliance Medical, meaning that only 62,000 had been carried out. Alliance Medical has been operating at less than half its capacity under its contract with the Department of Health.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/24">On more than one occasion I have had cause to wonder whether the Department of Health is in possession of the facts. The conclusion that I have come to is that it is clearly not. In an oral answer to a question that I asked in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-12">12 July</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made great play of the Government's desire to reduce waiting times. She said:</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/25" class="indent">&quot;We need both to reduce the unacceptable waiting times for scans and to meet our target of a maximum of 18 weeks from GP referral to hospital treatment by 2008.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2005-07-12.685"><i>Official Report</i>, 12 July 2005; Vol. 436, c. 685</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/26">However, when I asked how many trusts were meeting the target of no more than 18 weeks' wait from GP referral, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr.   Byrne)</phrase>, replied:</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/27" class="indent">&quot;We do not currently collect information on the length of time from GP referral to start of treatment&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2005-10-05.2843"><i>Official Report</i>, 5 October 2005; Vol. 436, c. 2843</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/28">How can we make statements about the efficiency of a contract if the Department is not collecting the information?</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/29">I have lost count of the number of replies that I have had from the Department of Health&mdash;all hon. Members will have experienced this&mdash;telling me that the information is not held centrally. How can we then monitor the contract with Alliance Medical? In these days of data sharing and communication between trusts, surely the Department of Health should be able to provide such basic information.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/30">There is the issue of how the contract is undermining the NHS. Although it is obvious that the NHS is undermined when money that could have been used to reduce NHS waiting times goes to a private sector company, I am also concerned that the NHS is being undermined in two other ways. In signing up to the contract, Alliance Medical had to agree not to employ staff who had worked in the NHS over the previous six months. I believe that that is right. However, I am not convinced that any systems prevent that from happening.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/31">In answer to another written question about the way in which the additionality clause is enforced, I was told that staffing is a matter for Alliance Medical. I am concerned that we are relying on the good will of the contractor not to breach the terms of the agreement. It would also appear from another answer that no monitoring system is in place to check whether staff are being poached from the NHS. Even if we assume, however, that staff are not being poached, we should bear in mind something that the Royal College of Nursing has pointed out&mdash;that the independent sector treatment centres are not obliged to follow the &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; agreement. I am concerned that the centres are mechanisms for delivering reform in the NHS through a two-tier work force, despite the many assurances from Government that that would not happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/32">The operation of the Alliance Medical contract has been a salutary lesson in how not to use the private sector in the health service. None of the three criteria that I set out for assessing the viability of private firms' provision of NHS services has been fulfilled. Did the contract remain true to the founding principles of the NHS? No. People in my constituency were forced to travel 30 miles out of their way to get treatment that could have been provided locally, with the result that the service has not been open to all. It has been open only to those who could get in a car to get there.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/33">Did the arrangement give value for money? It seems, from the replies that I have and the sketchy financial information that is retained in the Department of Health, that that is very unlikely. I have yet to see a scrap of evidence that the arrangement was good value for money. It is even clearer that in some respects the contract is not being adhered to.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/34">Finally, are NHS services being complemented, rather than undermined? Again, I doubt that. Procedures to prevent poaching seem to be non-existent, and while a private firm is paid to provide scans, a pretty good NHS scanner that is less than five years old sits idle in the University hospital of north Durham.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/35">I have said that I am not opposed to the use of the private sector in the NHS, but it should be employed only where it adds value in patient choice or in the service. Clearly, the contract is leading not to more efficiency, but to more inefficiency. Mike Sobanja, the chief executive of Alliance Medical, made a comment that seems to me to sum up what is wrong with the national top-down approach. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/36" class="indent">&quot;It seems to me a little sad that the centre is not able to create contracts that are really needed by the NHS.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/37">If what I have described is a demonstration of efficiency in the way the NHS will use scanner services, it shows that those losing out are not only taxpayers but my constituents. I hope that I shall receive some answers to the points that I have raised&mdash;and that they may be more effective than the hundred-odd written questions that I have tabled.</p>

The only way to achieve that is if all speeches last 30 seconds, which will not happen. I have therefore decided to give preference to the seven hon. Members who wrote, according to when they wrote. I ask those hon. Members whom I call to bear in mind the circumstances of others. The winding-up speeches will start at 3.30 pm. If we appear to be running out of time, and hon.

	<p pid="b.276.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">The hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> has done the House a service in obtaining this debate. It is a tragic reflection on the machinery of Government that it takes an hon. Member 100 questions to get some straightforward answers about matters pertaining to institutions and NHS facilities in his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/2">A similar story unfolded in Oxfordshire, where the ophthalmic treatment centre functions at only about 50 per cent. of capacity, but a block contract has been granted to the private sector as if it were operating at 100 per cent. capacity. All the money that is going to the private sector for operations that the treatment centre does not carry out is money that cannot be spent elsewhere in the NHS in Oxfordshire. In the meantime the excellent work that used to be done at the Oxford eye hospital is undermined.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/3">The NHS in Oxfordshire is in freefall. The strategic health authority tells us that within this year&mdash;by March&mdash;the Oxfordshire health economy has to save some &pound;35 million, of which &pound;25 million must be saved from the Oxford Radcliffe NHS trust. That is simply not going to happen. There is no way that the trust can save &pound;25 million between now and the out-turn of this year without a draconian slash-and-burn policy, which I am sure that the Minister does not want to see.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/4">On the back of that, the strategic health authority has decided that it will put out the management of the primary care trust to the private sector. This week, I and other hon. Members received a letter from the chief executive of the PCT. A kind of NHS-speak seems to be developing, which is completely incomprehensible to most of us. What on earth does a phrase such as</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/5" class="indent">&quot;increasing the culture of developing choice and plurality in the NHS&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/6">mean? How the hell does putting out the management of a PCT to the private sector increase</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/7" class="indent">&quot;choice and plurality in the NHS&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/8">Ministers and officials are simply deciding that a particular provider will run the management of a PCT. It is complete gobbledegook.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/9">The strategic health authority proposes to procure the management services of Oxfordshire PCTs, and has made it clear that bids from the private sector will be welcome. On the Order Paper today, there are 16 questions from myself. I shall not detain the House for too long, but I want some assurances from the Minister. First, I want an assurance that if the contract is let to the private sector, we shall not have a situation where I and other hon. Members table questions, to be told that it is all commercial incompetence.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/10">I had a proposal for an accommodation centre for asylum seekers in my constituency, which was to be let to Group 4. Whenever I tabled a question to ask Ministers about the contract, I was told that it was commercial incompetence. When I asked about certain matters of liaison with the local community, I was told that that would depend upon the contract. So who is going to draft that contract? Will it make it clear that if the private sector takes over the management of the PCT in Oxfordshire, it will have to be answerable to scrutiny committees of local authorities in the normal way? I do not want the chief executive of Oxfordshire county council to write to Capio or Universal Health, which I understand is run by a former policy adviser at No. 10, asking him to appear before the scrutiny committee of Oxfordshire county council, only to be told, &quot;Terribly sorry. It's not in the contract. We are not obliged to come and answer for what we are doing in procuring the primary care trust in Oxfordshire, because that's not in the contract.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/11">Secondly, I want to know what assessment Ministers have made of the redundancy costs on direct-line managers within existing PCTs that put such matters out to the private sector. Indeed, I should be interested to know what assessment of the effectiveness of the policy Ministers have made, because if a contract for putting out the management of a PCT to the private sector fails, what then are Ministers going to do? Is that not simply a cynical exercise where Ministers realise that the Oxfordshire health economy is in such difficulty that if it fails, they can simply blame the private sector? I should like to know what consultation and authority Ministers have already given to the strategic health authority to let the contract. In the letter to hon. Members, it says that there will be &quot;a rapid appointment&quot;, which is hardly consistent with proper consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/12">Indeed, the Minister will not be surprised that bodies such as the Royal College of Nursing, and other royal colleges, are appalled at the way in which the policy is being taken through, and the fact that there has been no consultation. I shall read from a straightforward letter from one of my constituents:</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/13" class="indent">&quot;As you know, whenever there is a major configuration of services within the NHS, there is a duty on them to publicly consult, usually for a period of three months. To date there has been no consultation with the public, staff or trade unions locally. Whilst Thames Valley Health Authority plans to consult later this year on the boundaries of the new PCTs, Health Authority and Ambulance Trust, they do not plan to include the management arrangement within this consultation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/14">That is from a member of the Royal College of Nursing. It is appalling that staff have not been consulted. The strategic health authority says that there has been</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/15" class="indent">&quot;informal discussion with key local stakeholders&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/16">I have yet to find anyone with whom there has been discussion, either informal or otherwise. That is craziness.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/17">I realise that many hon. Members wish to speak, so I shall ask the Minister one simple question, and I hope that it will be supported by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" name="Evan Harris">the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase>. Will the Minister undertake to come to Oxfordshire in the next two or three months to meet its six Members of Parliament to discuss the Oxfordshire health economy in general and specifically the proposal to put to private tender the management of the PCT for the whole of Oxfordshire? As far as I am aware, it is the only PCT in the country where the proposal has been made. It seems to have been drawn up on the back of a fag packet somewhere in the strategic health authority, probably in consultation with some unit of which we have never heard in the Cabinet Office or No. 10, as being a whizzo idea, but it requires a sensible discussion and the six Members of Parliament for Oxfordshire want to be engaged in that discussion.</p>

	<p pid="b.278.0/1">I endorse everything that the hon. Gentleman said, and through him ask why it is felt that the proposal has anything to do with competition or contestability. There will not be competition. Will not there be a huge vested interest if BUPA runs the commissioning in Oxfordshire on whom it buys from? Which private company will offer its prices to executives from BUPA or United Health? Yes, the proposal is radical&mdash;radically stupid.</p>

	<p pid="b.278.1/1">My colleague makes a perfectly sensible point. There is a legion of policy questions that need to be considered and properly answered. The idea that the strategic health authority will make a &quot;rapid appointment&quot; of a team to run the PCT in the way proposed is appalling. It is an appalling use of the machinery and the process of government when the Oxfordshire health economy is already in freefall and when substantial cuts will almost certainly have to be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.1/2">I ask the Minister to ensure that his private office digs out all the papers on the issue and puts them in his Box. I hope then that his diary secretary will get in touch with us and arrange a time when the Minister can talk to us, as perfectly intelligent Members of Parliament, about the policy implications. The hon. Member for North Durham has the opportunity of being in the same Division Lobby as the Minister and still has to table questions.</p>

	<p pid="b.278.4/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I shall try not to take nine minutes for my speech like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.4/2">Like many on the Labour Benches, I am a zealous supporter of the NHS. I believe that as far as possible all its services should be provided by NHS staff and facilities. However, I recognise that in 1997 we inherited a situation in which the capacity of the NHS had been diminished. By and large, my constituents want to be treated quickly, effectively and as close to home as possible. Like many Labour Members, I accepted that there was a case in the short term for exploiting the surplus capacity&mdash;I stress surplus&mdash;in the private sector at marginal cost, but we have gone far beyond that.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.4/3">There has been a ten fold increase in the amount of NHS-funded care provided by the private sector. I shall focus on one practical example of how the proposed second-wave independent sector treatment centre for West Yorkshire might adversely affect the NHS in Leeds, and therefore my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.4/4">We have an acute trust that has suffered from a chronic deficit for many years; it is attempting to address that challenge. That is not to say that there have not been major improvements since 1997. We have 850 more nurses, 125 more consultants and180 new junior doctors, and waiting times and waiting lists have fallen appreciably. However, these enormous gains are often overshadowed by the short-term measures that are necessary to address the deficit.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.4/5">The advent of independent sector treatment centres has provided some short-term gains in terms of reducing waiting lists and times, but we appear to be moving into an era where the private sector is simply being grown for its own sake, as my hon. Friend has already suggested. The goalposts have been moved; they have been widened as a target for the private sector and narrowed as a target for the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.4/6">I understand that the Department of Health carried out an assessment of contestability in West Yorkshire and has concluded that we need more of it. Will the Minister comment on that? We already have contestability in Leeds. The Leeds PCTs are commissioning more activity from outside the Leeds acute trust than ever before, which represents a &pound;14 million reduction in that trust's income.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.4/7">The Secretary of State has approved a strategic outline case for a new children and maternity hospital, to be built at St. James's hospital in Leeds. That is a very welcome and long-overdue move, but its progress depends on the trust being able to put together a successful outline business case. The trust therefore obviously needs to maximise its income. It has made allowances for the loss of commissioning from the local PCTs and for the proposed second-wave treatment centre, but there will be real concerns if its income diminishes further.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.4/8">I was very concerned to discover that the proposed second-wave treatment centre for West Yorkshire is to have a guaranteed minimum income of &pound;45 million, underwritten for each of its first five years. Where is the contestability in that?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.279.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1627" speakername="Jon Trickett" colnum="279"  time="015:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h03.htm#51019h03_spnew14">
	<p pid="b.279.0/1">Like my hon. Friend, I am a West Yorkshire MP. Have health service officials told him, as they have told me, that although the Department has said that there is a need for more contestability in West Yorkshire, there is no evidence for that statement, which is simply dogmatic? Does he therefore conclude that the argument is driven by dogma from the centre rather than by reality on the ground?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.279.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1770" speakername="Paul Truswell" colnum="279"  time="015:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h03.htm#51019h03_spnew15">
	<p pid="b.279.1/1">I am a charitable individual, and I understand my hon. Friend's interpretation, but I did start by saying that I understand that there has been an assessment. Otherwise, I agree that the argument is based purely on dogma.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.1/2">As I said, the &pound;45 million, which is underwritten for each of its first five years, is &pound;20 million more than the figure given in the earlier proposal, which incidentally the trust supported on the basis that it was intended to help the delivery of the 18-week access targets by 2008. One is bound to ask where the money for that underwriting is coming from, and, again, how that relates to contestability. Ironically, it now appears that the treatment centre will not be available until after 2008, so that any extra capacity that it provides will not contribute to achieving access targets by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.1/3">The trust has also been asked which specialties that it currently provides might be transferred to the new independent sector treatment centre. Transferred work, of course, does not represent an increase in capacity. It goes without saying that to acquiesce would be suicidal for the trust.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.1/4">The trust must retain and maximise its income in order to address its deficit and to compile a robust outline business case for the children's hospital. When a hospital loses patients, the drop in its income will generally be greater than its drop in expenditure because of the national tariff process.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.1/5">I conclude my remarks with these few comments. I leave it to other colleagues to paint the wider picture of concerns about the promotion of the private sector, but I share their fears, which I am sure more of them will express, that it will leave the NHS with the most costly and complex cases and emergency work, that it will lead to higher cost, that it will divert staff and distort work force planning, that it will redistribute existing work loads rather than increase capacity, and that ultimately it will reduce choice by threatening existing providers, such as the Leeds acute trust. That is without even mentioning the current proposals for PCTs.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.1/6">Ideally, therefore, the impact of this drive towards the private sector and its longer-term effects should be properly evaluated, and the first wave should be properly assessed before we move to the second. If Ministers are not inclined to do that, at least the potentially damaging aspects of the initiative, which I have tried to tease out today, should be fully explored.</p>

	<p pid="b.280.0/1">I am delighted to contribute to the debate, and I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> on raising such an important issue, which has become very hot this week.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/2">Some months ago, I asked my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister about MRI scanners at Luton and Dunstable hospital. A certain amount of sand was thrown in my face, but there were no adequate answers. Those scanners have come on-stream this week, but there is no funding for radiographers to operate the second scanner. The first scanner replaced an old scanner, and the second scanner was new. The Government had been encouraging hospitals to increase their scanner capacity, and we are still decades behind many other developed countries. I think that Britain is at the bottom of the league table for numbers of scanners compared with other developed countries, so we need additional capacity.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/3">Luton and Dunstable hospital has provided just that. However, money was not set aside for radiographers; it was earmarked for a mobile private scanner at the hospitals in Stevenage and Bedford. That scanner is literally on the back of a lorry. It is not a good service and it has been featured on television as such. Patients and funding have been guaranteed, but the service is so poor that patients are often referred back to Luton and Dunstable hospital because the quality of scanning required cannot be provided. That is not a market; it is ideologically driven, to force public money into private pockets at the expense of quality public provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/4">I raised the matter with a Health Minister. I will not mention the Minister's name, because that would be too embarrassing. I questioned the Minister at length on why that had been done in Luton and why it is being done elsewhere in the country, and after every single answer had been broken down, the only answer was, &quot;Well, people might be able to take advantage of moonlighting staff.&quot; In other words, the Government want to persuade a few NHS staff to do a bit of extra overtime in the evenings without telling the hospital that they are doing it.</p>

	<p pid="b.281.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the problems of dealing with staff will become more acute with the second wave of independent sector treatment centres, because the Government will relax the restrictions on those companies taking on NHS staff? That does not increase capacity one iota.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.281.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" speakername="Kelvin Hopkins" colnum="281"  time="015:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h03.htm#51019h03_spnew18">
	<p pid="b.281.1/1">Absolutely. I thank my hon. Friend for her very helpful intervention.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.1/2">My local primary care trust has done a tremendous job in dealing with serious health problems in the locality. Luton has a degree of deprivation in certain areas, particularly affecting some of our minority populations, but the PCT has become a specialist at targeting such health problems. If the PCT is broken up and merged with others, we will lose that specialism; it will be dissolved into surrounding areas, which are quite different from Luton.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.1/3">Setting that to one side, however, the PCT has done a tremendous job in two respects. First, it has established a walk-in centre in the town centre, which has been a fantastic success. It sees 50,000 patients a year. There has been a shortage of GPs, which we were not able to address, but that facility is making up the gap. That is public enterprise and it is a real success. The PCT has also set up a treatment centre with qualified nurse practitioners, who take some of the burden off the accident and emergency department at the local hospital. It also has outreach programmes to do advanced primary care in the community. It is doing a fantastic job. The PCT has recruited 28 skilled nurses from outside the town.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.1/4">That additional capacity is all in the public sector and everything is done brilliantly. That is exactly what the Government said they wanted in the &quot;Choosing Health&quot; White Paper. The PCT is doing a tremendous job in difficult circumstances. It was even, until recently, able to overcome its financial difficulties, despite being &pound;10 million a year below its fair funding target. It has had problems this year, along with many other PCTs throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.1/5">However, the PCT will be forced to privatise those services, as well as all the other traditional services that it provides, because it will not be permitted to provide direct services. Not only will the services be lost to the private sector; we must ask whether the private sector will be interested in dealing with poor people with difficult diseases and old people. I think not. It will be interested in what is profitable, and what is profitable is not necessarily what is needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.1/6">I asked my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister another question last week about Balfour Beatty, a private sector company that took over public sector work and has just been fined &pound;10 million for negligence. I believe that it should have been prosecuted for corporate manslaughter, but we do not have a law governing that yet. That private culture will be inflicted on the health service as well as on our railways. That is wrong and should be reversed.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.1/7">We have had a brief debate so far. I will not say much more, although I could do. I am concerned about the impact on my constituents in Luton and, in particular, on the poor people of Luton who have serious health problems. They will suffer. We are rapidly moving towards the US system of health, whereby 40 million people have no health cover at all. When New Orleans was flooded, it took six days to get a single doctor into the city. That is what we are moving towards. I want a public health service that is committed to serving everyone at the point of need, whoever they are and whatever their circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.1/8">I have just attended and spoken at a meeting of ASLEF and I learned a new term for something that is particularly mad. ASLEF talks about something being &quot;Dagenham, East&quot;&mdash;two stops past Barking.</p>

	<p pid="b.282.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> on his forensic exposure of so much that is wrong with the Government's rush into the extra use of the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/2">I shall speak for a few minutes on the importance of the level playing field, which has been mentioned many times already. Back in the 1980s, when domestic services were privatised, the staff in my hospital were persuaded to put in a bid. It was a level playing field and the staff won. On a level playing field, I believe that the best of the NHS could win every time.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/3">I want to draw to the attention of the House some of the snags of the independent sector treatment centres, in addition to excess cost, which has already been mentioned. Those issues have been raised with me by the previous president of the British Orthopaedic Association. Some of those concerns were addressed in my Adjournment debate in June, but many of them were not.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/4">I shall speak first about accreditation. Accreditation in some countries in Europe is not of the same standard as that in the UK, where surgeons are accredited to have full responsibility. Consultant appointments under the NHS are made by committees with Royal College and university representatives and, if there is no suitable appointee, no appointment is made. Professional recruitment agencies, when recruiting for the independent sector treatment centres, virtually have to make an appointment, and they seek surgeons from countries where they may be paid a mere &pound;10,000. The attraction of the UK is that surgeons can earn &pound;70,000, and so we are robbing other countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/5">There are still no specific arrangements for the handling of complications. Should they be handled by the NHS? Who will deal with complications that occur in the independent treatment centres? In January, the British Orthopaedic Association sent a large dossier to the Department of Health, raising problems of process. That has been partially answered. More recently, it has sent a more important dossier of patient complaints about the independent sector treatment centres, but as yet has had no response.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/6">The major issues of training and tariffs have been mentioned. I understand that some specialist hospitals fear that they could lose their training recognition if there are reductions in training opportunities,</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/7">The Government claim that independent sector treatment centres are largely responsible for the improvement in waiting lists. That claim must be challenged. I have tabled a parliamentary question to try to confirm what I was told by an ophthalmic surgeon just a few days ago: that in 2003&ndash;04 the NHS performed more than 300,000 cataract operations, due to huge efforts from NHS doctors and nurses. The mobile independent sector ophthalmic provider, since it started about two years ago, has undertaken between 10,000 and 14,000 cataract operations. It has not really had the chance to make that much difference.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/8">I believe that, if there were a level playing field and it came down to competition, the NHS could compete. However, I am passionately opposed to any form of competition in health care, and to the purchaser-provider split, which I believe did a vast amount of damage.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/9">I am encouraged that so much resistance is being demonstrated this afternoon to the Government's rush to privatisation, which I think would be a disaster.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.283.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" speakername="Tony Lloyd" colnum="283"  time="015:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h03.htm#51019h03_spnew20">
	<p pid="b.283.0/1">I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister is delighted today to be surrounded by his hon. Friends. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> on securing the debate. He has done a great service, because this issue has touched a deep and raw nerve among hon. Members on both sides of the political divide.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.0/2">I shall try to be brief, and I shall reiterate some of the points that have been made, but in relation to the Greater Manchester surgical centre. Like others, I am passionately committed to the concept of a public sector national health service, and think that it has served the nation well. The ideological arguments for it are sound, but those for the intrusion of the private sector have been neither well made nor properly researched or established. That concerns me because what is happening is an ideological move mainly by stealth. The Greater Manchester surgical centre is an example of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.0/3">When the idea of the surgical centre was first mooted, there was no public consultation with Members of Parliament or any proper consultation with the referential public bodies involved with health. The primary care trusts in Greater Manchester were effectively dragooned into playing a part&mdash;some were acquiescent and some were resistant. Hon. Members will understand that because of micro-politics in the health service, information was not always placed in the public domain. Therefore, debate about the surgical centre was low key. At no point was any public justification or explanation given as to why that capacity was needed in Greater Manchester when existing hospitals could provide for the needs of local communities effectively. Indeed, had the investment from public money that went into the surgical centre been available to the health service, it is certain that we would have significantly improved the capacity and competence of those national health service operators.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.0/4">The main issue that I want the Minister to address today is that of contracts. Will he tell us which complete imbecile drew up the contracts governing the surgical centre? It might be invidious if Ministers were to name names, but questions must be raised about the competence of the people who draft contracts for the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.0/5">The contract for the surgical centre not only pays over the odds relative to the cost of treatment elsewhere, but gives a guaranteed minimum price to the surgical centre, which receives that money whether it performs the operations or not. That means that the national health service will spend about &pound;1.4 million on operations that have not been performed in the surgical centre, because there are not the patients. Who in their right mind would draw up a contract that is so open-ended and unfair to the public and so massively favourable to a private sector provider? If present trends continue, the surgical centre will, in a year of operation, cost the national health service, and therefore the public, &pound;6 million. One might say that that is a trivial amount in the grand scheme of the health service budget, but about 40 per cent. of the value of that contract is being poured down the grid. That is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.0/6">Hon. Members will have different views on the role of the private sector. I would sooner that that role were narrow, constrained and more tightly controlled than in the example that I have given, but I know that the surgical centre, now that it exists, will be offered protection into the future. The consequence of that, in an area where there simply is not the demand for those services, will be the erosion of services in our hospitals, which means cutting back the public national health service to defend the private sector. That is simply intolerable.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.284.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1845" speakername="Lynda Waltho" colnum="284"  time="015:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h03.htm#51019h03_spnew21">
	<p pid="b.284.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> on securing this debate, and I welcome the fact that he is not ideologically opposed to private involvement if it passes the founding-principles test.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/2">When I first saw the subject of the debate, I was concerned that it would be along the lines of &quot;all private, bad; all public, good.&quot; Stourbridge is served by Dudley South primary care trust. For some years, the private sector has successfully provided it with counselling services. It provides young people with drug counselling and help with sexual problems at The What Centre. Private physiotherapy treatment has also been successful.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/3">A more important example is that of audiology. I know that many areas have problems employing audiologists, but Dudley South PCT has brought in the private sector to help reduce waiting lists. The average waiting time was about 18 months. I know that it is higher in some parts of the country, but Dudley South PCT recruited additional audiology professionals to help. It has also set up night clinics, as well as making a contract with the private provider Ultravox which successfully assists with services that are already provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/4">People wanting an audiology appointment need an average of three appointments. First, the ear is moulded; a fitting appointment is necessary; and a further appointment is often needed. The contract, which was set up after a bid in July 2004, has been overseen by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/5">The modernising health service programme has been important in the Dudley South PCT. I am a new MP, and I have dealt with only a few audiology surgery cases, but I can see what a difference the programme is making in my constituency. I am concerned that we do not throw the baby out with the bathwater. It is important that we do not reject services simply because they are private. In my constituency, the programme is making a difference, although I accept that that may not be the case elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="b.285.0/1">I am listening carefully to my hon. Friend, but does she agree that the private sector should not be deployed if that occurs at the expense of existing NHS provision, as we have heard happens elsewhere in the country?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.285.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1845" speakername="Lynda Waltho" colnum="285"  time="015:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h03.htm#51019h03_spnew23">
	<p pid="b.285.1/1">It should not be at the expense of the national health service, and I am sorry if I gave that impression. In my experience of the Dudley South PCT, however, it is not being done at the expense of the NHS; it is helping to solve problems. The main fact that I want to get across is that it has been helpful.</p>
	<p pid="b.285.1/2">I have not yet dealt with scanners and other problems, but the provision that I have mentioned has certainly helped in the surgery cases that I have dealt with. The proof is that my constituents tell me, &quot;Thanks for flagging it up. Thanks for pointing me to that service. I have an appointment.&quot; For me, it has worked. I am less experienced than my colleagues, but I speak from my experience.</p>
	<p pid="b.285.1/3">My constituents have benefited also from the hospice movement. Acorns children's hospice is based at Selly Oak in Birmingham, but it serves my constituency and south Birmingham and the black country area. That, too, is in the voluntary sector, but it is in danger of being lumped into the &quot;private, bad&quot; group, which is not the case. In fact, it gives such a brilliant service that it has helped almost 2,000 families in the past 16 years.</p>

	<p pid="b.285.2/1">The hospice movement might be a private sector provider, but does my hon. Friend agree that we should consider with care the perversity that a private sector provider such as that mentioned by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> is getting money for old rope&mdash;although I would not, of course, use such an expression&mdash;whereas a hospice such as Treetops in my constituency, which gets no funding from the NHS, loses out despite the fact that many think that its services should be funded through the NHS?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.286.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1845" speakername="Lynda Waltho" colnum="286"  time="015:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h03.htm#51019h03_spnew25">
	<p pid="b.286.0/1">Absolutely. I agree with my hon. Friend, and I know that Treetops does as good a job in his constituency as Acorns does in mine. When I visited Acorns and spoke to the chief executive, I learned that it receives less than 10 per cent. of its money from the health service. It costs some &pound;4,500 per day to fund the excellent services that it provides. They include jacuzzis; hydrotherapy; bedrooms designed for life-limited children, as they are called; facilities in bedrooms to assist with moving children from their wheelchairs into bed and so on; and a respite service for families. It also provides care after death, in that it has bedrooms, which are cold, where residents and family members can go to say goodbye to the child. That is a brilliant facility compared with a mortuary. Those services are brilliant, and more than 90 per cent. of the funds are provided by fundraising. That long answer is my way of saying, &quot;Yes, I agree.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.286.0/2">It is perverse that money is provided for old rope at one end of the scale, yet at the other end brilliant services such as those provided by the child hospice movement are desperate for the funds with which they could extend their help to thousands more families. In my limited experience since becoming an MP in May, I have seen good private provision. I acknowledge that I am at the beginning of my career, and I might yet see the other side, but that needed to be said.</p>

	<p pid="b.286.3/1">I, too, begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> on a superbly begun debate. The very large attendance at a debate in which not everybody knew that they would be able to speak is indicative of the importance of the subject. That is one reason that the Government should have initiated the debate&mdash;at far greater length, and in Government time. Another is that, as has been said, a major reform of the primary care trust system was slipped out at the end of July when we had all left for the summer recess, and that has not been debated properly in the House. A great deal of rapid change is taking place in the heath service, and it is our job to scrutinise it. The Government should facilitate that process, rather than relying on the issues being brought before the House by energetic Back Benchers such as the hon. Gentleman, who has done us a great service.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.3/2">I start where the hon. Member for North Durham started&mdash;by saying that we are not saying today, &quot;Private bad, public good.&quot; Rather, we are concerned that there are those who might say the contrary, &quot;Public bad, private good,&quot; and that the pendulum has swung too far. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1845" name="Lynda Waltho">the hon. Member for Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho)</phrase> that we should have no problem with the idea that some high-quality health care should and can be delivered by people who are not direct employees of the NHS. I had already written &quot;hospices&quot; on my notes before she spoke. She also mentioned counselling, and many of us encounter people who receive good-quality care in private nursing homes. If it were so important to us that staff be strictly employees of the NHS, not many of us would ever visit a GP or a dentist. It is not simply a matter of being employed by the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.3/3">If the private sector is to have a part to play in the NHS, it must pass a number of tests, several of which have been mentioned. We have ended up with about six. I shall clarify the key tests. We must start with accountability. For me and for many of my constituents&mdash;I am sure that it is the same for many hon. Members&mdash;accountability in the NHS seems to be diminishing. We are told that we cannot find out about so much of what goes on because it is commercially confidential, and that we cannot challenge decisions. If we ask in the House about certain decisions, we are told that they have been made by the trust. If we ask the trust, we cannot get rid of its management. Where is the accountability? If the private sector were more extensively involved, what would that mean for accountability?</p>
	<p pid="b.286.3/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" name="Evan Harris">the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase> made a powerful point when he referred to the contracting out of commissioning in Oxfordshire. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> rightly said, what would that mean for accountability? This week, Nigel Edwards of the NHS Confederation argued that the NHS not doing health commissioning was a little like British Airways saying that its core business is air miles and that the running of planes was too difficult for it. Why does the NHS exist, if not to determine dramatically the provision of health services? If we are to go down that route, why have an NHS at all? We have not received an answer to that question.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.3/5">If the private sector is to be involved in the NHS, it must be competitive on the basis of costs. However, as we have heard, it has been given a favourable deal on cost in too many cases. It has been given guaranteed business. There is an irony in the way in which the Government use the rhetoric of the market and the drive up in standards by fierce competition, but then mollycoddle the private sector with guaranteed contracts and prices. How does the giving of subsidies to generate a market constitute fair competition and a level playing field? Hon. Members must make no mistake. That is what is happening. The Government are determined that there shall be a market; unaided, the private sector will not enter it. It has to have its hand held. The Government's determination to form a market is creating unfairness.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.3/6">The hon. Member for Banbury and others asked how we specify a contract. That is essential. If the contract were not specified correctly, the private sector provider would cherry pick and choose the cheapest cases. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1907" name="Helen Jones">the hon. Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones)</phrase> said, private sector providers will not undertake training unless they were required to do so under the contract. Sometimes the answer can be, &quot;Well, we can deal with that. We shall draw up better contacts&quot;, but the world moves on. Life changes. In effect, a contract can be rewritten if it was in respect of an organisation in the public sector. It can be asked to do something different, because the world is different. However, if a contract were drawn up five or 10 years ago, it would be difficult and expensive to change. Will the private sector be as responsive as the public sector when the world changes? I fear not.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.3/7">What about quality? Clearly, if the private sector is to provide NHS services, the quality must be as good. There is no reason to suppose a priori that it will not be, but there might be a danger of it not being as good. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> referred to accreditation. NHS provider services and NHS employees go through a process of accreditation. However, when services are contracted out&mdash;possibly using overseas staff&mdash;can we be confident that all the medical staff involved will be of the same quality? So far, I do not think so.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.3/8">What about scanners? Over the summer, I visited several hospital trusts. I heard about a mobile scanner unit in a car park that had two problems: first, people had to go up three steps to get into the unit. People who were sick could not access it. Secondly, because it was a mobile scanner, it was not as big as the regular scanner and, thus, tall people could not access it. Essentially, it was a scanner for short, healthy people. I have nothing against short, healthy people per se, but I do not think that they are a priority of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.3/9">Alliance Medical has a contract, yet the Government have been so determined to avoid embarrassment that they said to the NHS, &quot;If you use an Alliance Medical scan, you can have it for free. We shall not compel you to use the scan. You can choose someone else. If you want to pay the price, that's fine, but the service will be free from Alliance Medical.&quot; I wonder which company would be chosen in those circumstances. Is that good value for money for the taxpayer?</p>
	<p pid="b.286.3/10">We must bear in mind that getting the private sector in the NHS on a subsidised basis will generate a market, and that means gainers and losers. The losers might be in the NHS, if that is not properly protected. As the hon. Member for North Durham said, what will be the impact of such issues on the core NHS, the NHS ethos and on the universal public service that we want? We do not know what the transition mechanisms are. The NHS needs keyhole surgery, but it is getting amputation. One department will close and then another; the unit cost to the rest of the hospital will be too high, so it will not be able to compete and it will go. Is that the transition mechanism? What will happen? We have not been told.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.3/11">As has been said, this process is driven by dogma. The funny thing is that one might have imagined from the title of our debate that the dogma would come from the person who sought it, but it has not, because the hon. Member for North Durham has said that he is willing to consider private sector involvement. The dogma is coming from the Government, who are in a desperate rush to get the market in because the Prime Minister wants a legacy before he retires.</p>

	<p pid="b.288.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I also congratulate other hon. Members, who have made important contributions. I am delighted to hear that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> has nothing against short, healthy people or tall, healthy people.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/2">It will be interesting to hear the Minister's response to the series of questions that he has been asked. I hope that he will pay more attention to the views of his colleagues in the House than the Secretary of State did to ordinary Labour party members when the vote on this important issue was held at the conference in Brighton.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/3">Conservative Members welcome the fact that the Government are talking much more about the need to introduce patient choice. However, choice is a meaningless term if we do not have spare capacity. That is where the private sector will become increasingly important in delivering NHS services.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/4">The Government have issued some statistics regarding their intentions. About &pound;3 billion will be spent over the next five years to pay for about 1.7 million operations in the private sector, mostly via independent treatment centres, as we have heard. Conservative Members believe that the private sector could play a much greater role for the benefit of the NHS and that the Government's approach is not the way to proceed; indeed, it is fundamentally flawed. In essence, they are block-booking capacity and deciding where capacity will be needed. That runs the severe risk not only of being inefficient, but of ignoring what patients want and need.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/5">The example given by the hon. Member for North Durham clearly illustrates the point. The chief executive of a university hospital is claiming that the Government have contracted out MRI scans despite the fact that his own scanner was &quot;considerably underemployed&quot; and that he could practically have eliminated waiting lists if he had been given the cash instead. That is complete nonsense; it is not how the system should be working.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/6">As we have heard from several Members, another problem is that the evidence suggests that the Government's approach is more costly. I commend the hon. Member for North Durham on his tenacity in extracting answers from the Government, and according to a recent parliamentary answer to a question from one of his colleagues,</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/7" class="indent">&quot;it is estimated that procedures purchased under the ISTC programme cost on average 9 per cent. more than the national health service equivalent cost&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-03-16.273"><i>Official Report</i>, 16 March 2005; Vol. 432, c. 273W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/8">As several hon. Members have said, the Government's nationally agreed targets with the private sector have been poorly drawn up and have resulted in valuable NHS resources lying idle. The contract with Alliance Medical is one such example.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/9">To create downward pressure on prices in the private sector and encourage more competition, the Government need to create a right to supply the NHS. Otherwise, the result will be exactly what we have at the moment&mdash;private companies selected by the Government continuing to be paid to cherry pick easy operations from the NHS. That is not the right way to proceed&mdash;it is neither sustainable nor sensible. It also risks antagonising staff and alienating them from the private sector and the benefits that it has to offer.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.290.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1409" speakername="John Baron" colnum="290"  time="015:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h03.htm#51019h03_spnew31">
	<p pid="b.290.0/1">I shall make some progress because I want to ensure that I give the Minister plenty of time. If there is time at the end of my speech, however, I will take the hon. Gentleman's intervention.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.0/2">The Government are wedding themselves to a particular approach and are reluctant to relinquish control from the centre. That is why the NHS has not made the progress that it should have done in recent years. It would be churlish not to accept that some progress has been made, but despite a 70 per cent. real-terms increase in funding, average waiting times have lengthened by five days&mdash;that is the Department of Health figure&mdash;and the number of hospital treatments has risen by only 5 per cent., despite the hard work of NHS staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.0/3">The Conservative approach to the private sector is in complete contrast to the Government's, and I know that it will not find wide acceptance in this place. Under our right to choose policy, the decision to involve the private sector would ultimately be made not by the Government or the primary care trust, but by patients and GPs. Our right to choose policies would allow any patient to go to any hospital, free of charge, that can perform the operation at the NHS cost. Such a policy would iron out the great variations that exist in the provision of NHS health care at present. One example of that was brought out last year by the Dr. Foster medical research company which showed that patients had to wait 390 days for a hip replacement at Norwich university hospital yet at Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which is only 90 miles away, the wait was less than half that at 182 days.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.0/4">By empowering patients in this way, resources will find their way to where they are most needed. Such a policy would also allow patients to go to private hospitals if they met NHS costs and standards. This policy would send out a clear signal to the private sector to increase capacity. For too long the private sector has been used by the NHS simply as an &quot;overspill&quot; facility. This does not encourage long-term sustained investment. That needs to change. On the continent, the private sector plays a much greater role in the provision of health care than it does here, but nobody grumbles about it because there are very few waiting lists. The patient benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.0/5">Stockholm in Sweden is a good example of what happens when a genuine choice programme is introduced. In the early 1990s, centrally allocated budgets were put to one side and payment by activity was introduced, enabling patients to take their budget to any hospital that could provide their care for that price. What was seen over a relatively short period was a major mushrooming in the number of care providers coming into the market and competing for patients. With more than 200 new care providers set up since 1992, there are very few queues in Stockholm to this day.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.0/6">I take this opportunity to raise briefly with the Minister two other important issues that have been alluded to by other hon. Members. The first is the document &quot;Commissioning a Patient-led NHS&quot;, which proposes a shift in role for PCTs from providing to purchasing. That announcement has created great uncertainty and confusion among NHS staff. Many hon. Members have referred to the lack of consultation on this issue. Many staff are unsure as to what will happen to them. In my constituency they are unsure whether they are to become independent providers themselves, work for a private or voluntary company, or join foundation hospitals and sell their services back to the PCT.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.0/7">Will the Minister provide clarification by saying what proportion of health professionals will cease to be employed directly by the trusts? What exactly will happen to community nurses? Will they be required to join private companies? Will chiropodists be expected to set up private practices like dentists? Will the NHS staff no longer employed directly by trusts still benefit from the pay and conditions of &quot;Agenda for Change&quot;? Will the Minister take this opportunity to explain why such a major proposal affecting so many staff, and which includes both PCT reconfiguration and the outsourcing of provider functions, was launched by a simple letter from Sir Nigel Crisp to local trusts? Surely a more detailed paper produced by Ministers was warranted when we are considering such an important issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.0/8">Mention should also be made at this point of the 17.5 million people who suffer from long-term medical conditions. The Government's approach of block booking reflects their thinking, as it does when it comes to targets in that it is focused almost exclusively on the acute sector. Once again, those suffering from long-term medical conditions are being neglected because of the Government's focus on what they perceive to be politically sensitive medical conditions. That has to be wrong. What will the Government do to put this bias right within the health care system?</p>
	<p pid="b.290.0/9">I have one other question for the Minister. Social care is being neglected in areas such as rehabilitation services for the visually impaired, where local authorities are struggling to meet their responsibilities. According to the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, 20 per cent. of local authorities are not providing any services at all. There is much scope for outsourcing some of the responsibility to charities and the private sector. Greater use of direct payments will help that, and I hope that the Minister will ensure that such a system will eventually realise its full potential for all concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.0/10">In conclusion, there is a fundamental contradiction at the heart of the Government's thinking. On the one hand, they are moving closer to our view that patients should be given genuine choice. However, on the other&mdash;perhaps because of dogma, as has been mentioned&mdash;they are clinging on to their old policy of centrally deciding where the extra capacity should be placed. That muddled thinking is causing confusion, not least among NHS staff, and, most importantly, it will not service the patient well. I therefore ask the Minister to directly address the questions he has been asked.</p>

	<p pid="b.291.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss these matters this afternoon. Of the 10 minutes that I have, I will spend about half responding directly to the concerns raised by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase>. I will then try to cover the other points. Where I fail to do so, I will write to hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.291.0/2">This afternoon reminds me of when I got to my feet to make my maiden speech, and the Whips surrounded me with my hon. Friends. A voice from across the Chamber said, &quot;What are you doing surrounding him?&quot; Someone else said, &quot;We are just keeping him warm.&quot; I feel in good company and very warm this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="b.291.0/3">My hon. Friend has been assiduous in his investigation of the matter. Indeed, rarely has an evening gone by when I have not signed another parliamentary answer, drafted by my noble Friend, Lord Warner, in response to another line of inquiry. After such a long and tantalising build-up, it is satisfying to have the full consummation of an hour and a half's debate. If my wife allowed me to smoke, I would ask my hon. Friend to share a cigarette if not a cigar with me when we are finished.</p>
	<p pid="b.291.0/4">The truth is that this debate and the matter raised by my hon. Friend are important not only because they affect the health and well-being of his constituents but because they touch on a much broader issue of national significance: how the Government will fulfil their big promise to the country in May to cut the waiting time for treatment from the scandal of 18 months&mdash;which we inherited in 1997&mdash;to just 18 weeks. When we were elected in 1997, waiting lists contained more than 1 million patients. Waiting times were out of control. Many people waited 18 months, but unacceptable waits were another part of life for many patients&mdash;long waits to see a consultant and in accident and emergency, and longer waits still for a GP. Thanks to our extra investment, our changes to the system and a lot of hard work from NHS staff, that is beginning to change.</p>

	<p pid="b.292.1/1">No, I will not.</p>
	<p pid="b.292.1/2">NHS staff must never and will never by this Minister be labelled a producer interest. They have been instrumental in creating a Britain in which waiting lists have fallen. If we take the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham as an example, mortality rates have decreased by 13.5 per cent. between 1997 and 2003. That is about a third higher than the national average.</p>

	<p pid="b.292.3/1">I have so many points to cover that I will not give way.</p>
	<p pid="b.292.3/2">At the heart of the debate and the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham is the scanning contract with Alliance Medical. For the benefit of the Chamber, I should explain that under that contract about 65,000 scans have been provided to NHS patients much faster than would otherwise have been the case. My hon. Friend raised concerns about the local scanning facility in his constituency being underutilised and asked a good question about why we do not just give that trust more money to employ more staff and put on extra scanning sessions.</p>
	<p pid="b.292.3/3">By way of introduction to my five quick points of response, I should say that money is available in PCTs. Questions are often asked about the availability of radiographers, in particular, when the Government have invested and will invest to fund more. My hon. Friend made a non-ideological argument about putting the founding principles of the NHS into action. After an extensive deconstruction of his argument with the Department over the past two or three days, I am able to reply with five points. If I have missed out bits of his analysis, I will write to him afterwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.292.3/4">First things first. By 2008, if not before, the University hospital of north Durham, in common with all NHS hospitals, will need to use its scanning capacity to the full, either by employing extra staff or by making more effective use of NHS staff. As I said, where there are staff shortages, we shall continue to invest to overcome that.</p>
	<p pid="b.292.3/5">Secondly&mdash;and this will probably make the biggest difference&mdash;funding is in the system for delivery of the 18-week target, which, for the first time, includes diagnostics. Durham and Chester-le-Street PLC will have its funding increased by more than &pound;30 million&mdash;18.5 per cent.&mdash;over the next two years. We cannot reach the 18-week target unless we use the money to ensure that local scanning capacity is used to the full. I know my hon. Friend's methods of persuasion and argument and I am sure that he will help his local PCT to see the logic and wisdom of directing the extra funding into the university trust.</p>
	<p pid="b.292.3/6">Thirdly&mdash;and this may be the coup de gr&acirc;ce&mdash;we are introducing a programme called choice of scan, which is a catchy name for something that means that from November, any patients waiting for an MRI scan who do not have a date scheduled within 26 weeks will be offered the choice of going to another provider, with the money following them. I have no doubt about what that will mean in my hon. Friend's constituency, because at the moment, as he says, patients are forced to go to Middlesbrough, but they should have the choice and the chance to go somewhere local, if that is better for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.292.3/7">Fourthly, we must ensure that we approach the questions with our eyes wide open. Last year, we specifically included diagnostics in our capacity planning exercise. In particular, we asked strategic health authorities two questions: how much MRI scanning do they need to hit the 18-week target and how much of it do they need to obtain from the independent sector? We want to know how much capacity they already have&mdash;which they need to use to the full&mdash;and what the gap is, representing what they will need to obtain elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.292.3/8">Finally, my hon. Friend made several reasonable points about answers that he received, suggesting a lack of information centrally. Most importantly, data on waiting times for MRI scans&mdash;which have been a particular bugbear for him&mdash;are not currently collected centrally, but the Department will introduce such data collection later in the year, to examine the waiting times for some diagnostic tests and procedures.</p>
	<p pid="b.292.3/9">In the three minutes left to me I shall try to cover some of the more general points that were made. I have nothing further to add about PCT reform to what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has talked about.</p>

	<p pid="b.294.0/1">I wanted to ask about the imposition of commissioning on PCTs. Newcastle-under-Lyme PCT employs scores of community nurses and runs a community hospital, and is already addressing market failure by employing salaried GPs; it will also employ a salaried dentist. What case has been made for possibly removing those functions from PCTs such as the one in my constituency, resulting in demoralisation? The Minister is a management consultant. Prima facie what is better and more efficient&mdash;one provider with a good record of managing services directly or a proliferation of organisations managing indirectly through a plethora of contracts and a battery of lawyers?</p>

	<p pid="b.294.1/1">As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has said in the past couple of days, there are two aspects to the question of commissioning in a patient-led NHS. One is the question of ensuring that democratically elected local voices are heard in the debate about reorganisation of boundaries. We shall make sure that that happens. The other is the prime opportunity offered by the primary care White Paper that will be published at the turn of the year to reflect on what hon. Members have said about how primary care services will be provided in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.1/2">I have only one more minute for my remarks and I recognise that I have not been able to answer many of the points that were raised. I shall be making several visits, including to Manchester, Stoke and Stourbridge, where I shall be happy to deal with detailed issues in more depth with hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.1/3">Debates of this sort are invaluable for ensuring that we pursue effectively our policy for achieving the change that we want in the national health service and tackling health inequalities.</p>

	<p pid="b.295.1/1">Since I applied for this Adjournment debate over the summer, the proposed closure of two wards at Victoria central hospital in Wallasey has turned into a real closure. I want to spend a little time outlining the background. As part of a welcome plan to modernise and improve services for older people in Wirral, the two local primary care trusts announced a &pound;2.3 million reconfiguration of services for them in October last year. The focus of the plan was to reduce the need for unnecessary stays in hospital and to prevent avoidable admissions of older people to hospital if they could be dealt with better in a non-hospital setting.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.1/2">The primary care trusts considered that the redesign would enable them to close 52 rehabilitation beds for older people in wards six and seven at Victoria central hospital, in Liscard.</p>

	<p pid="b.295.4/1">I have supported from the beginning the philosophy behind the reconfiguration initiated by the PCTs. No one could possibly object to their aim of preventing avoidable hospital admissions. I have, however, always been very sceptical that such a great number of admissions could be prevented, and so quickly, that the two local wards, which comprise 52 rehabilitation beds, could be closed safely. I believed that the changed services had to prove that they were working well before it would be prudent even to consider closing the wards.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/2">I am also extremely worried about the instability that is becoming increasingly evident in the private nursing home sector. There is an above average number of older people in Wirral, which historically has had a problem with the delayed discharge of patients from hospital. The social services and the NHS have begun to solve that problem by working in partnership, which I greatly support.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/3">However, increases in property prices as a result of our economic success have led to a reduction in private nursing capacity because owners of private nursing homes have sold up to realise profits on their property assets and have left the private nursing care service altogether. Such instability of supply in a crucial area of social care makes it difficult to plan ahead coherently, especially if we want to ensure that there is no delay in discharging older people who have completed their medical care. I believed that that was another reason to value the beds in wards six and seven.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/4">I expressed those views in my response to the PCT consultation, which closed this January. During the consultation, local staff and residents campaigning to keep wards six and seven open collected 18,000 signatures in a petition, which I was the first person to sign. The result of the consultation was that 70 per cent. of the 400 responses opposed the plan to close the wards. It is fair to say that there was overwhelming public opposition to the ward closures, but it is also fair to say that there was general support for developing a more community-based service for older people in which hospitalisation was the last and not the first resort.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/5">I believe, however, that the consultation process was inherently flawed, simply because of the nature of the questions asked. The Minister will have seen the questions asked when he prepared for the debate. Moreover, what on earth is the point of having a consultation if the results are going to be put to one side when they are not convenient to the PCT's plans and intentions? We should have a proper consultation, or we should stop calling these exercises consultations and call them something else.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/6">The PCTs did recognise the strength of local feeling to some extent, however, and did seek to give some welcome reassurance. They also delayed their final decision on closure to prove their view that the redesign of services would dramatically cut admissions of the elderly to hospital. That was a prudent course, which I supported; indeed, I had requested that a precautionary approach be taken on the issue. Initial signs were encouraging. Delayed discharges declined from an average of 55 people a week to just 11. At the same time, I led delegations of staff and local councillors to see the Minister who would take the final decision if no agreement could be reached locally. There was also a lobby of Parliament, which I addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/7">Meanwhile, I continued to support the primary care trust's innovative redesign of services, which included two particular elements to which I should like to draw attention. First, a primary care assessment unit was created at Arrowe Park. It provides screening, testing and assessment processes for older people who may need them. Such people may have been taken ill and appeared at a GP's surgery or accident and emergency without being admitted to hospital. Early experiences demonstrated that the new way of doing screening, testing and assessment was avoiding 60 per cent. of all previous hospital admissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/8">Nobody in their right mind wishes to see an older person, who may have been ill, presenting at the GP, then having to be admitted to hospital merely for a diagnostic test and then getting stuck in hospital and being unable to get back out into the community. Clearly, the 60 per cent. fall in hospital admissions that I mentioned demonstrated that redesign was necessary and could deliver much greater efficiency; that is undeniable.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/9">Secondly, I am particularly interested in the pilot &quot;partners in practice&quot; work that has been done in some local GP clinics in my constituency. It is not rocket science, but it involves looking at a GP's list, ascertaining whether patients have a chronic condition, checking the at-risk groups&mdash;for example, those who have been admitted to hospital more than once in that year&mdash;and using community nursing and health visitor facilities simply to go out to see patients and find out whether they are able to manage their chronic condition, be it diabetes or heart disease, well enough to prevent admission to hospital. That has to be a way forward. I hope that over time it will be demonstrated that some admissions could have been avoided by more proactive, preventative work. None of this is about saying that those things ought not to be happening.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/10">However, there is the ongoing issue of the wards. When I took a delegation of staff and patients' representatives to see the Minister, Lord Warner, he was receptive to our arguments about taking action too quickly, but in the end decided to back the primary care trust's decision on the wards. I was informed of that in a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-08">8 September</phrase>, and I am extremely disappointed that that decision has been confirmed at a national level.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/11">However, we got something out of our campaign. As the Minister made clear in a letter to me, as a result of our representations he had also taken the precautionary approach and insisted on some guarantees from the strategic health authority as a condition of the closure. They were, first, that health authorities must admit any older person who at any time needs admission to hospital as determined by the national four-hour accident and emergency target. That is a welcome and powerful requirement, which will keep the health authorities on their toes in the months ahead.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/12">Secondly, he required that the facilities at Victoria central hospital be maintained over the winter period&mdash;mothballed, essentially&mdash;so that they can be reopened if there is a sudden reversal of the favourable trends on which their closure depends. That is another guarantee that we are not going to have precipitate, quick action that will deprive us of 52 beds that we might subsequently discover we need. I welcome the reassurance that the mothballing of the wards has given us over the winter period.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/13">Thirdly, the Minister announced that there should be a monthly monitoring group to keep a very close check on hospital activity figures and ensure that the guarantees are honoured. Following that decision, I called upon the primary care trust to empower a citizens jury with which to share the information generated by the monitoring group. The idea was that a non-aligned group of local citizens would check that no problems were emerging as a result of the changes to services.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/14">I am pleased to be able to confirm today that the primary care trusts have agreed to my request and have approached Wirral senior citizens forum to perform that important and innovative role. It is an independent organisation, which, I am sure, will be only too ready to alert us if there is evidence of any problems or bed shortages developing as a result of the reconfigurations. I look forward to the forum's independent monitoring, which will provide protection as our services change and develop, and I thank the PCT for agreeing to my suggestion to empower the citizens jury.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/15">In the aftermath of the decision, I visited the wards to talk to staff and patients. I emphasised that the campaign has never been about saving jobs. All staff have been given a welcome undertaking that they will be redeployed within the local health service. That has been organised following full consultation with staff organisations and no outstanding concerns or worries have been raised with me or appear to be developing at Victoria central hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/16">Since the decision was taken, there has been a gradual emptying of the two wards. My information is that 30 patients have been discharged in the normal way and that no changes were made to the way in which they were treated; 21 have gone home; eight have gone into residential or nursing care; and one is in temporary residence.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/17">I wonder whether my hon. Friend has an update of the latest situation concerning the guarantees that Lord Warner gave to me in his letter. Has the decline in delayed discharges been maintained? Since the announcement, I have not been contacted by any constituent about any problems with timely access to hospital beds or for elderly patients, but does the Minister have the latest information and can he give it to me today? In short, does he have any evidence that the loss of the wards is causing problems in the local system?</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/18">Secondly, could my hon. Friend comment on whether it would be possible to consider how the instability in the private nursing sector can be addressed? I am particularly interested in working with the co-operative movement to expand its mutually owned models of nursing care. They not only give greater stability and quality of care, but improve on some of the extremely low wage levels that are all too often a feature of the private nursing home sector. In my view, that is a much better way forward than a completely marketised muddle in the private sector. Will the Department consider how it could assist us in developing such a process?</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/19">Will my hon. Friend the Minister confirm that the future of Victoria central hospital is bright? There have been many welcome developments on the site in recent years, not least the opening of a brand new building for a well-used walk-in centre. It is extremely convenient for my constituents who, instead of sometimes having to travel many miles on two buses to Arrowe Park hospital or Clatterbridge hospital on the peninsula, or even across the river to the Liverpool hospitals, can have treatment for minor accidents and so on and general health checks in the walk-in centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/20">The award-winning Wallasey heart centre has opened. I am pleased to say that it is cutting in half the number of deaths from coronary heart disease in my constituency and making an incredibly positive contribution to the health outcomes of many of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.4/21">I hope that my hon. Friend can reassure me on the points that I have raised. I also hope that he will undertake to keep an eye on the monitoring figures himself so that we can reopen the wards if they are needed, especially during the winter. Finally, will he reflect on the problematic nature of primary care trust consultations that have been highlighted by this case?</p>

	<p pid="b.298.0/1">I start by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1899" name="Angela Eagle">the Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle)</phrase> on securing the debate and I would like to begin my reply to her eloquent speech with a few words of praise.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/2">First, I want to praise the <i>Liverpool Daily Post</i> and <i>Liverpool Echo</i>, which have consistently and factually kept this issue at the forefront of the local community for its readership. The way in which they have framed the debate has again shown that they are a real and effective voice for the local community.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/3">Secondly, I want to extend some praise for local campaigners whose passionate involvement in the campaign to keep the wards open is a credit to local community strength. Thirdly, I must congratulate my hon. Friends who represent the Wirral, in particular my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey. She has previously raised this matter in meetings with my ministerial colleagues my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Lord Warner. I know that her interventions have helped secure important guarantees from the local health community to address the understandable concerns of her constituents. She is a fighter who has won vital advances for her constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/4">I hope my hon. Friend will agree that at the heart of this debate is an honest difference of views about the next steps for improving care for older people across the Wirral, particularly in Wallasey. When Labour was elected in 1997, our job was to pick the national health service up off its knees and to power a shift from the inherited state of neglect to the world that we have today. As a result of our funding policy, the NHS is in receipt of record resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/5">My hon. Friend's constituency sits in the Cheshire and Merseyside area. It has shared in the benefit of more than 400 more consultants since 1997, nearly 5,500 more nurses, and more than 3,800 more health care assistants. That has made a huge difference to the quality of care in Cheshire and Merseyside. The number of people waiting more than six months for in-patient treatment has dropped by 86 per cent. since 1997. The number of people waiting 13 weeks or more for out-patient treatment has dropped by 90 per cent. since 1998.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/6">That means that more people live longer. For example, the mortality rate in the Wirral from coronary heart disease has fallen by nearly 20 per cent. Cancer mortality rates have reduced by more than 10 per cent. since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/7">There has been enormous progress. As a former Chancellor might have said, money has been the root of some of that progress, but the truth is that more money alone is not the answer. Standards of care need to be transformed as well. In the context of this debate, that means there is a question of how we change the way we care for older people.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/8">I want to present the Chamber with two sobering sets of facts about the imperative of strengthening care for older people. First, during this Adjournment debate about 100 people over the age of 65 will be admitted to accident and emergency, a number that resulted from figures from a year or two ago. In 2003&ndash;04, there were 1.6 million such emergency admissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/9">Secondly, during the course of today, 8,000 older and frail people will fall. Of those falls, 70 per cent. will happen tonight. About 200 people will break a hip and 15 will die from their injuries. Nearly 1 million people over the age of 65 are treated by the NHS. About two-thirds of our hospital beds are occupied by older people at any one time. That is why care for older people is one of the most important things that the NHS does.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/10">Providing care on the ward the way we did in the previous century and the one before that is not good enough any more. We can and must do better. Instead of forcing patients to come to the NHS, it is time that the NHS came to the patient. We want the NHS to change; we want it to be not just a hand that catches people when they fall, but a helping hand that supports them in different aspects of their life.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/11">That is why this Department is investing &pound;60 million in partnerships for older people to help councils and primary care trusts help older people to avoid emergency hospital visits and to live independently for longer. That is why we are investing &pound;80 million, through local authorities, in telecare, to support an extra 160,000 older people living at home. Sometimes care at home is not the answer; sometimes nothing else but a good NHS hospital will do. Our job is not just to maintain but to strengthen the world's best safety net.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/12">That brings me to the specific issue of wards six and seven at Victoria central hospital. Three facts are important for this debate. First, for the vast majority of patients on both wards, admission could have been avoided if suitable alternative arrangements were provided in the community at the right time. Secondly, nearly all patients on the wards at any one time were awaiting rehabilitation or transfer to a place in the community. Patients were never admitted directly to wards six and seven at the hospital. They were admitted to Arrowe Park initially and then transferred to VCH for rehabilitation later.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/13">Thirdly, I am advised by Cheshire and Merseyside strategic health authority that in the 12 months to April this year, about 15,000 Wallasey residents were admitted to Arrowe Park. About 4,000, just over a quarter, were aged over 65, and of that 4,000, 159 elderly Wallasey residents&mdash;4 per cent.&mdash;received in-patient care in the 52 beds in wards six and seven at VCH. That is about 1 per cent. of the total Wallasey residents admitted to Arrowe Park.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/14">Local community health professionals were required to make decisions. They took into account the fact that about 148,000 Wallasey residents attended the wide range of facilities such as out-patient and walk-in centres, day case, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and diagnostic facilities. Those facilities are there at present and they will be retained at the VCH site. That is why that site is so important to the future of the local community. That is the context in which decisions about wards six and seven were taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/15">My hon. Friend asked whether there was news about what had happened since changes were made and guarantees were extended to her earlier this year. There are four or five bits of news that I want to bring to the attention of the House. First, I am happy to say that delayed discharge numbers have indeed declined. The number of patients whose discharge has been delayed pending availability of regular nursing home places is now consistently far lower compared to the peaks of around 60 in August last year. There are just 19 patients who are delayed in awaiting social services care. That is broadly in line with the assumptions that were made in the consultation document.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/16">Secondly, the substantial reduction in delayed transfers of care and the beneficial impact of other investments at the hospital have produced a significant reduction in the number of patients who are admitted to the wrong type of ward as a consequence of the pressure on beds. The numbers have been reduced to single figures compared to the 50 or so on a regular basis 12 months ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/17">Thirdly, whereas previously a significant number of patients sent in by GPs as emergencies were temporarily accommodated on trolleys in the accident and emergency department, all those patients can now be admitted directly to the combined clinical decision unit and primary care assessment unit.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/18">Fourthly, at present the main acute sites now routinely have between 30 and 50 empty beds available each day, ensuring that the local community has the spare capacity on which to rely.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/19">Fifthly, the trust and PCTs estimate that the deep vein thrombosis service saved approximately 2,000 bed days during the last financial year and the primary care assessment unit saved 1,500 bed days per annum, avoiding about 700 admissions. The work load at the walk-in centre at VCH has increased steadily over the last 12 months and it is assumed that about 4,000 bed days per annum are being saved because of that service. The services cover the vast majority of people aged over 65.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/20">My hon. Friend asked me to reflect on ways to manage instability in the local care market. I am happy to take that on board and I will return to that point. In addition, I can give her a commitment to maintain a watching brief on the guarantees and the numbers in question so that we can ensure that at a very senior level the right decisions are being made locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/21">None of the improvements in Wallasey happened by accident. They happened because of the new investment in the clinical decision unit of &pound;1 million a year, because of investment in a new walk-in centre, more investment in intermediate care services and in primary care assessment centres, four new community matrons and the new 12-bed heart assessment unit.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/22">In conclusion, I shall say a brief word about democracy, and specifically the involvement of local people in decisions about health services, which was an important part of my hon. Friend's analysis. Since 2003, every local authority with social services responsibilities has had an overview and scrutiny committee that has powers to review and scrutinise health services in its local area. Wirral metropolitan borough council's OSC made a valuable contribution to the arrangements that have been put in place. Its input, coupled with my hon. Friend's specific interventions, has brought about the guarantees from the SHA.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/23">As my hon. Friend rightly mentions, the most important guarantee is the continued maintenance of facilities in wards six and seven throughout the winter period so that they can be reopened if there is any sudden reversal of the favourable trends on which their closure was initially proposed.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/24">The truth is that health organisations cannot overlook the user perspective. In the past, consultations have left people feeling cold. They felt that their ideas were rejected without reason, and they felt that they were not really heard. Many of my hon. Friend's constituents held that view, and that is why we must find new ways of engaging people.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/25">I congratulate my hon. Friend on the establishment of the citizen's jury in her constituency. That idea potentially has a national application, and it comes at an opportune moment. As she knows, the Department is engaged on a listening exercise known as &quot;Your Health, Your Care, Your Say&quot;, which is in full swing around the country. I am glad to say that it reaches its climax in Birmingham in a week or two.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/26">As part of that consultation exercise, several taskforces are looking at specific issues of local democracy. One taskforce, &quot;Having My Say&quot;, focuses specifically on how better arrangements can be put in place to strengthen the voice of patients, users and the public in the way in which we plan and deliver health care. As the health and social care system changes, we must ensure that the new arrangements support patient voices, so that the health services that are delivered are fit for purpose. We must learn the lessons from Wallasey that my hon. Friend has so eloquently brought to the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/27">I can tell her that the &quot;Having My Say&quot; taskforce will make recommendations to Ministers on how we can be confident that views, experiences and the interests of patients and the public are heard and responded to.</p>

	<p pid="b.302.0/1">That is a very welcome announcement. I wonder whether the Minister would undertake to send the taskforce a copy of the <i>Hansard </i>debate, so that they can look in detail at the ways in which the consultation in Wallasey worked and did not work. There are many lessons to learn, and it would be good if the taskforce learned them in a timely fashion before it pronounces.</p>

	<p pid="b.302.1/1">Absolutely. I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I was about to say that I will personally ensure that the case of Wallasey is put before officials who are tasked with getting the next stage of reform right. I congratulate my hon. Friend on the tenacity and firepower that she has brought to campaigning on behalf of her constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/2">Over the next 10 years, this country's community of older residents will grow and grow. Alongside doubling our investment in the health service, we have allocated an extra &pound;10 billion since 1997 to older people who have been on benefits. With those advances in wealth and in health, there is a real promise of a better life for older people who have given us and their community in Wallasey a lifetime of service. They deserve the best care possible, and with this Government running the national health service, they will get it.</p>

	Part-Time Higher Education
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.303.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" speakername="Mark Lancaster" colnum="303"  time="016:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h05.htm#51019h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.303.1/1">I am grateful to have the opportunity to draw to the House's attention the concerns of many of the tens of thousands of students engaged currently in Britain in part-time education. I must say that the experience is made even more pleasurable under your chairmanship, Mr. Amess.</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/2">My intention is not to try to bash the Government over their inequitable approach to full and part-time students. I hope instead to provide some constructive criticism and perhaps gently encourage the Government and, indeed, the Minister to review some of their current policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/3">I am slightly disappointed, however; I made an offer to the Department for Education and Skills to give my speech to the Minister in advance, but that was not taken up. I am sure that we could have made even more progress had that happened.</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/4">The Minister has a reputation for being reasonable and thoughtful. In his defence, my e-mail was sent to his colleague the Minister for Higher Education and Lifelong Learning. That may explain why the Minister did not receive it.</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/5">Mr. Amess, you may be surprised to discover that this debate seems already to have had some impact on a rethink of Government policy. I have waited some 20 months for a review of the Higher Education Act 2004, and only yesterday, just hours before this debate, the Government announced steps towards addressing the imbalance between part-time and full-time students. I am sure that the Minister will assure me that that is coincidence, but he will forgive me for taking some small consolation from thinking that perhaps that is the closest that an Opposition Back Bencher can come to influencing Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/6">As the Minister may know, the Open university is based in my constituency of North-East Milton Keynes. It is the only university dedicated to distance learning, and it supports about 180,000 students, both undergraduate and postgraduate. Nearly all the students at the OU are currently studying part-time. The OU was the world's first successful distance teaching university, and it retains its reputation by offering a vision for the future, as students and businesses demand a more flexible approach to learning. It was ranked among the top five UK universities in a national table on teaching quality by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education. In a recent survey published by <i>The Times Higher Educational Supplement</i>, the OU came out top for student satisfaction. The Minister will agree that it should be congratulated on those notable achievements.</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/7">In recent years, there has been a steady increase in the number of students who undertake degree programmes part-time. Part-time students make up 41.7 per cent. of all higher education students; that is rise of 4.2 per cent. on last year. Understandably, there are many reasons why people undertake part-time study. These include furthering or changing their career, or just having an interest in the subject. A wide cross-section of society is attracted to part-time study, from mothers who wish to gain further qualifications while being primary carers, to retired people who wish to continue their education once they have the time and resources to do so. As we see, it is not a uniform group.</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/8">It is essential that everyone in society is afforded the same opportunity to further their education and develop themselves as and when they want. That is why I find it difficult to comprehend why the Government have made a clear distinction between those students who study full-time and those who do not. When the Government introduced student top-up fees, they clearly stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/9" class="indent">&quot;No student will have to pay their contribution up-front or while they are studying&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/10">That is simply not the case. Students enrolled in part-time courses will have to pay their fees in advance, albeit pro rata. All the policy work done on the Higher Education Act 2004 concentrated on the full-time learner. It is clear to anyone that as a result the part-time sector was largely overlooked.</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/11">Over 90 per cent. of people who undertake part-time study are currently employed. Of that group, many are fortunate enough to have financial backing from their employer, who either meets the full cost of the course or just pays a contribution. Ministers at the Department for Education and Skills have stated that 60 per cent. of all part-time students have an employer subsidy, but that leaves 40 per cent. of part-time students who are self-funded. Indeed, at the OU a recent study showed that only 17 per cent. of undergraduates received support from their employers. Some 8 per cent. of students are supported by state benefits, and 8 per cent. are lone parents. We should also bear in mind that many of the sponsors are small employers who may be unable to meet the rise in fees, or who may be able to sponsor only half the number of students in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/12">I have a real concern that levying an annual tuition fee on part-time students on a pro rata basis, as against a &pound;3,000 full-time undergraduate fee for the same course, may act as a serious deterrent to participation by students. It should also be noted that, under the current policy, part-time students have no access to fee deferral in 2006. The message that the Minister for Higher Education and Lifelong Learning has been trying to send out is &quot;study now, pay later.&quot; I wonder whether the Minister will agree with me in his reply that &quot;pay now to study now&quot; would be a more appropriate message to send to the 41.7 per cent. of higher education students who study part-time.</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/13">The part-time sector has been given no consideration as part of the Higher Education Act 2004. From my calculations, it has taken nigh on 20 months for the Government even to begin to address those issues. I understand that the Treasury has provided &pound;1 billion in extra moneys to underwrite the new fee regime. I want to know how much of that money will assist part-time learners. As I see it, not one penny will go to part-time providers or to part-time students, as those learners will not have access to the generous packages of support in fee grants and loans that are presently available to full-time students.</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/14">That leaves education providers with a financial dilemma. Do they introduce huge fees to compete with the full-time sector, as the Government have suggested, or do they keep fees at the level that they know that the market can bear? If institutions adopt the former strategy, they risk losing large numbers of students; if the latter, they risk creating huge deficits in their budgets, which no institution can afford to do. I shall be interested to hear the views of the Minister on those matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/15">Student support must be consistent across the board. I welcome the announcement made by the Secretary of State yesterday that the poorest part-time students will have their grants adjusted to bring them into line, pro rata, with the fee grant available to the full-time sector. I am sure that the Minister will be keen to expand on that announcement in his reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/16">However, the Government need to go still further. In the announcement yesterday, the Secretary of State acknowledged that</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/17" class="indent">&quot;part-time education plays a fundamental role in our higher education system. It extends access to higher education for hundreds of thousands of students who are unable to study on a full-time basis. And we know from the National Student Survey that the satisfaction levels for part-time students are among the highest in the country. The support needed by part-time students varies considerably. Our new package will protect the participation of students in the most challenging financial circumstances.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/18">If that is the case, why do I find myself asking what further steps the Government will be taking to continue to redress the balance?</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/19">I would like to see an increase in the institutional funding for the institutions that teach large numbers of      part-time students. That would recognise the additional costs that those institutions incur in supporting part-time learners and would put them on a level footing with the full-time sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/20">There needs to be better targeting by the Government of part-time learners. The evidence suggests that part-time students are less inclined to take up loans and grants than full-time students. That is for a variety of reasons. Many part-time students are already carrying debts in the form of mortgages or personal loans, and are therefore reluctant to increase their debt. It is not easy to target information at part-time learners. Most full-time learners are given information at school or college, but because part-time learners are such a diverse group, it is much harder to ensure that they all receive adequate information. In the light of the announcement yesterday, I would be interested to know what publicity the Government are planning to make part-time students aware of their entitlements. Are we to expect a television or leafleting campaign?</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/21">I would also like to draw attention to the recent consultation paper by the Higher Education Funding Council. In the consultation, it is acknowledged that part-time learners do not get treated equally, although the figures have now been amended due to the announcement yesterday. The paper says that:</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/22" class="indent">&quot;Part-time learners do not have access to loans; they have access to less generous grants or bursaries; and must pay fees 'up front'. There is a means-tested course grant of &pound;250, and income-related support for fees, with some institutions providing fee waivers where students are not eligible for tuition fee grants. In 2005&ndash;06 tuition fee grants will be between &pound;590 a year for a half-time student to a maximum of &pound;885 for three quarter Full Time Equivalent or more. This is broadly pro rata to the existing maximum full-time fee of &pound;1,175. Many part-time learners have fees paid by an employer or other agency.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/23">However, the board felt it appropriate to leave things as they were and come back and review the situation once a clearer picture had been formed of the impact of the fees.</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/24">It is clear to me that the Government's rhetoric on support for life long learning is not matched by the right policy or public investment. We are told by the Chancellor:</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/25" class="indent">&quot;I am convinced that Britain can not afford to waste the ability of any young person, discard the future of any teenager, or leave untapped the talents of any adult&quot;. &mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2005-03-16.268"><i>Official Report</i>, 16 March 2005; Vol. 432, c. 268</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/26">It should be noted that those factors only apply if one is aged between 18 and 30 and participating in full-time education. The Government have systematically left out part-time students and adult learners from higher education plans. At a time when we are encouraging our work force to work longer and re-skill, it seems incredible to me that the tools are not in place to allow that.</p>
	<p pid="b.303.1/27">I would be grateful if the Minister addressed five key questions. Why have the Government made a clear distinction between those students who study full-time and those who do not? Why was the part-time sector overlooked in the Government's review of higher education? Why do part-time students have to pay their fees up front? How much of the extra money provided by the Treasury will assist part-time learners? Finally, when will the Government be consistent in their treatment of full and part-time students?</p>

	<p pid="b.306.0/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase> on securing this timely debate. Indeed, the timing could not be more appropriate given yesterday's announcement. I have to disabuse him of the notion that this debate was the trigger that prompted that announcement. As he knows, my hon. Friend the Minister for Higher Education and Lifelong Learning announced the student funding arrangements for part-time undergraduate students for 2006. That announcement was an important one, and I shall explain why later.</p>
	<p pid="b.306.0/2">I shall just take a moment to reflect on the importance of part-time education in general and the Open university in particular. I am delighted to say that in this country we have one of the strongest part-time undergraduate sectors in Europe. During the past decade, it has experienced vibrant growth, which we welcome. Part-time provision increases access to higher education for literally hundreds of thousands of students. There are now more than half a million in total, who, for whatever reason, are unable or unwilling to undertake full-time study. It is clear that part-time students like what they get.</p>
	<p pid="b.306.0/3">The hon. Gentleman will no doubt be aware that the recent national student survey revealed students of the Open university, which is based in his constituency, to be the most satisfied in the country with those at that other dedicated part-time provider, Birkbeck college, close behind. What is more, a strong part-time sector is essential to our higher skills strategy, supporting people in work to enhance their skills and opportunities for vocational progression.</p>
	<p pid="b.306.0/4">Part-time provision is a success story of our higher education sector and at the centre of that success is the Open university. It is our only university dedicated to distance learning, educating a third of part-time undergraduates from all walks of life and drawn from every corner of the country. Our part-time sector has a proud history that is to be celebrated and nurtured.</p>
	<p pid="b.306.0/5">If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I would like to take the opportunity to record my appreciation of his predecessor, Brian White, the former Member of Parliament for North-East Milton Keynes, and his parliamentary colleague, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase>, for the tremendous work they have done during previous years and continue to do in promoting the Open university, celebrating its achievements and lobbying the Government for increased investment for part-time undergraduates and those institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.306.0/6">It has been this Government's aspiration to increase access to part-time study. I heard the hon. Gentleman&mdash;as we know, Mr. Amess, these are not necessarily party political debates&mdash;lambasting the Government for a failure to invest. I shall not remind him of the manifesto pledge of his party at the last election to cut &pound;30 billion out of public spending; I suspect that that would not have put a lot more money into part-time undergraduate study. Indeed, before 1998, there was no fee support whatever, under previous Administrations, that was available to part-time undergraduates on low income.</p>
	<p pid="b.306.0/7">In 1998, this Government introduced the first fee waiver schemes and, year-on-year, improvements have led to a statutory fee support of &pound;590 for a student studying part-time at 50 per cent. intensity; there is more for those who study more intensely. There is also a course grant to cover the cost of studying of some &pound;250. That support has been targeted at those students on the lowest incomes, quite rightly. The hon. Gentleman used those figures himself today; two-thirds of all part-timers are in full-time work on typical incomes. One third have their fees fully covered by their employer. In answer to one of the hon. Gentleman's questions about why we make the distinction, it is because a variety of students in part-time study have some of their fees paid for by their employer. If we were to make them equivalent to full-time students, we would be losing out on all that employer investment in their workforce.</p>
	<p pid="b.306.0/8">For students who are earning a full-time wage, and whose fees are fully covered by their employer, the barriers to participation are not so much in covering the costs of the fee, but in ensuring the vocational relevance of provision and the flexibility of provision to fit around daily employment and the way in which they run their lives. We have worked hard to help institutions to work more closely with employers to achieve both those aims.</p>
	<p pid="b.306.0/9">I welcome, in particular, some new work from the Higher Education Academy to extend understanding of the most interesting and innovative practice in work-based learning. I should like to focus today, however, on students with low incomes, and on the announcement that we recently made about those who really need our support, who are often people on benefits.</p>

	<p pid="b.307.0/1">The Government say that 60 per cent. of part-time students have the support of their employers, but do not always focus on the fact that such support can take many different forms. Within that 60 per cent., it may be that employers are only giving part-time students time off work, or perhaps giving them money to buy books. That 60 per cent. figure can be slightly misleading, and I am not convinced that giving the Government credit for it is appropriate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.308.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1512" speakername="Phil Hope" colnum="308"  time="016:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h05.htm#51019h05_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.308.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, but the essence of his question was why cannot part-time undergraduates be treated the same as full-time students. Clearly, the reason is that they are different. Some of them are in full-time work; some of them&mdash;a considerable number, a third&mdash;have their fees fully paid by their employer. To treat full-time students and part-time students as exactly the same, which the hon. Gentleman does, would not recognise the starting point, and would have unintended consequences of reducing the volume of resources available to deliver good-quality undergraduate courses.</p>
	<p pid="b.308.0/2">Let me turn to the issues of the consequences and the inequalities, to which the hon. Gentleman alluded, in the introduction of variable fees for full-time undergraduates in 2006. He asked why the part-time sector was overlooked in Government provision. However, although part-time provision was not addressed in last year's Act, that was a conscious decision. It was not overlooked. We deliberately did not address that issue in the Act. Part-time fees have never been regulated in that way. We had and have no intention of changing that.</p>
	<p pid="b.308.0/3">However&mdash;this is why the debate is timely&mdash;we recognise concerns from the Open university and others that consequences for part-time students may flow from the Act. Some institutions have argued that they are constrained in finding the true market for their provision because, generous as our fee support is, it is capped. This year, the full-time equivalent&mdash;the hon. Gentleman used the figure&mdash;amounts to some &pound;1,180. Other institutions, by contrast, have argued that their geographical position and institutional profile will make it difficult to adjust their current diet of fees. Consequently, our imperative is to protect and sustain part-time provision by two broad means.</p>
	<p pid="b.308.0/4">Yesterday, we announced a 27 per cent. increase in the level of statutory fee grant available to students on low incomes. That is a substantial increase by anybody's standards. The fee support for students studying at half pace will grow from &pound;590 to no less than &pound;750.</p>
	<p pid="b.308.0/5">In addition, from 2006, we will adjust our access to learning fund&mdash;now that full-timers are set to benefit from generous new support&mdash;to provide significantly increased discretionary support for institutions to use to ensure that students on the lowest incomes can access higher education and sustain their participation in it. The allocation of the access to learning fund against part-time numbers will increase fourfold to &pound;12 million by 2006 and will increase still more, spending reviews permitting. We are saying to those universities, &quot;You know best where the financial barriers to participation lie. If they lie in meeting fees, here is a resource that can be used as additional fee support. However, if they lie in general hardship&mdash;for example, in covering the cost of child care&mdash;this is a resource that can be drawn on.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.308.0/6">The combined package represents a step change in the level of fee support. It provides reassurance to institutions that they can feel free to find the market rate for their provision, knowing that the state will support those who need it most. Even that is not the whole story. Institutions also benefit from institutional funding&mdash;funding that goes not to the student, but to the institution&mdash;channelled through the Higher Education Funding Council. That is linked to part-time numbers. Such funding has grown over recent years.</p>
	<p pid="b.308.0/7">Next month the HEFCE board will consider whether it is now appropriate to introduce further changes. That is not a decision that we can prejudge, but, as in the case of the changes to our student support package, it is a measure that will doubtless be given close attention by the officers of the Open university and all our higher education institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.308.0/8">I want to check that I have addressed all the questions that the hon. Gentleman raised. I covered why we see part-time students as different and I have explained that, essentially, they are treated differently for that reason. That relates to the core of his case. The way that we have handled this area in the past has meant that part-time undergraduate study has blossomed in the way that I described earlier. The fees measures that I have outlined today may not be the final word, but they do respond to the points that were raised with us over many months during the assiduous lobbying of the Government by his constituency predecessor and by his parliamentary neighbour.</p>

	<p pid="b.309.0/1">Before the Minister finishes, I want to ask one more question. If I were a part-time student looking at the Higher Education Act, could he explain to me the difference between my word &quot;overlooked&quot; and his word &quot;unaddressed&quot;?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-19b.309.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1512" speakername="Phil Hope" colnum="309"  time="016:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051019/halltext/51019h05.htm#51019h05_spnew4">
	<p pid="b.309.1/1">Yes, but I do not want to get down to a detailed analysis of different words. &quot;Overlooked&quot; implies that we forgot to do something, but &quot;unaddressed&quot; implies that we decided not to do it. We decided not to do it for the reasons that I explained earlier; in other words, because we have a different strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/2">In conclusion, we have dealt with some of the points raised, but there may be more to come. In response to concerns raised in this debate and elsewhere, we have considered the impact of the new full-time regime on part-time providers. We want to deepen our understanding of the nature and composition of the group of people who study part-time to ensure that we are meeting all the different needs. There will be an opportunity further to review part-time provision alongside the full-time package in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/3">It is important to recognise not only part-time students but the Open university. I believe that the hon. Gentleman would agree that it has a proud history. Most of us would agree with the judgment that the OU may have been one of the greatest achievements of Harold Wilson's premiership. Its success as an institution is irrevocably linked to its distinctiveness in offering new routes into higher education for people across the country and overseas by fitting learning into individuals' personal circumstances. We recognise that, because of its distinctiveness, it may be affected by the changes to full-time fees and so on. That is why we are taking a great deal of time and trouble, and engaging in many high-level discussions with the OU, to try fully to understand the consequences and how we best might respond.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/4">The package that we announced yesterday matters greatly. We have had some excellent responses from Birkbeck, the Open university and other UK universities welcoming the announcement of the extra support for part-time undergraduates. There will be a step change in support for low-income students, freeing institutions to set fees as they think best. Institutional resources and freedom to find the best ways to support vulnerable students will grow.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/5">The hon. Gentleman mentioned publicity. What is important about the existing information campaigns is that students are used to getting information in certain ways. Let us use those ways to get this message out to part-time students.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/6">Subject to decisions of the HEFCE board, institutional funding may be greater as well. Taken together, I see a rosy future for part-time undergraduates and the Open university. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be a champion of that institution during the years ahead; perhaps only for four years, but I do not wish to stray into that territory. He can rely on this Government to support institutions such as the Open university and others that work with part-time undergraduates. We will give the greatest support we can and offer the greatest opportunities to part-time students so that they can receive the best possible learning.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/7" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/8" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at eleven minutes past Five o'clock.</p>
