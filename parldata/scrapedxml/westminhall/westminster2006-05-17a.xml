<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-17a.271.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1693" speakername="Gregory Campbell" colnum="271"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060517/halltext/60517h0054.htm#06051786000481">
	<p pid="a.271.2/1">I welcome the opportunity presented by this debate. It gives us the chance not only to examine the potential of Northern Ireland as a tourist destination but to ask why more has not been done to maximise opportunities for tourism. I am sure that the new Minister is quickly coming to terms with her brief, but if she is not already aware of this, she will quickly learn how much Northern Ireland has to offer, both today and thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/2">We have the natural resources to attract people for city breaks, weekend breaks and for longer stays, and it is essential that they know what is on offer, where it is, and how to benefit from it. We have much in the way of natural resources. Northern Ireland may not be the prime target for those seeking a two-week holiday in the sun&mdash; <i>[</i><i>Laughter</i><i>]&mdash;</i>but it is undoubtedly a fantastic place for short, and even not so short stays. I do not know why my colleagues are laughing; anyone would think that it occasionally rained in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/3">Last weekend saw one of the largest and most spectacular outdoor events anywhere in the United Kingdom&mdash;the North West 200 motorbike races. The event lasted five days, and more than 100,000 people were attracted to it. Of course, I would be promoting that event, because it takes place in my constituency, on the north coast. None the less, it was a spectacular event and millions more saw it on satellite television. That is but a small indication of what can be achieved throughout the Province.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/4">Because of our history and geography, our culture and our sport, Northern Ireland can offer attractions that cannot be found elsewhere in the United Kingdom. With a more peaceful environment and greater access to the Province through the better transport links that we now enjoy, we should be able to attract even more visitors, not only from Great Britain but from the Irish Republic, Europe and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/5">Tourism is one sector in which we have lagged behind the others parts of the UK and our neighbours in the Republic, but that is finally beginning to change. Belfast has begun to discover itself as a prime venue for city breaks. Indeed, in the past two weeks both Portrush and the mountains of Mourne have featured in UK-wide competitions as the most desirable places to visit. It could be said that Northern Ireland's tourist time has arrived.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/6">We are home to some of the most scenic areas in the UK. We have nine areas of outstanding natural beauty, and we hope that more will be added to the list. We have some of the finest fishing waters in the British isles, and we have the potential to develop a market catering for those interested in specific activity holidays. The development of such holidays&mdash;especially golfing or fishing&mdash;will spread the benefits of tourism beyond the cities.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/7">I have not yet mentioned the giant's causeway, but despite the famously reported comments of Samuel Johnson, it is worth going to see it. All those assets mean that Northern Ireland has a natural resource base upon which tourism can be promoted. Although the problems of the past 36 years have resulted in us lagging behind historically, I believe that we havethe potential to develop tourism immensely in the foreseeable future.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/8">The job of marketing Northern Ireland falls primarily to the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. I believe that that organisation can do much more to improve the marketing of Northern Ireland, both to those who live close to the product and to those overseas. In any attempt to market a product, even one as excellent as ours, it is important to create a distinct brand identity. I believe that NITB needs to work to carve out that distinct identity&mdash;one showing that we are not just another part of the island of Ireland, to which people may take a day trip while staying in the Republic, but a destination worth coming to in its own right. That time spent will, of course, mean money spent in hotels, shops and restaurants, and ultimately the improvement of the overall economy for everyone in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/9">Part of that distinct identity has to be rooted in the culture and traditions of the Province. It will come as no surprise to anyone that I will mention some cultural events and traditions with which I am familiar, which offer huge potential for tourism. If the Northern Ireland product is marketed solely from an &quot;Irish&quot; perspective, many visitors will, unsurprisingly, see the potential for exploring that Irishness from the Republic of Ireland, and will see little added value to be gained from coming to our country.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/10">In my home city of Londonderry, the Maiden City festival is a very successful sequence of cultural events, held for a week every August to celebrate the relief of the city from the longest siege in British military history. It is a pioneering festival, which has led the way to this kind of tourism. Moreover, it has grown and developed despite a level of funding far below that granted to other events such as the West Belfast festival, although it is the type of event that is cherished and developed by tourism bodies across the globe. That example must be developed and replicated in other parts of Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/11">Throughout July and August, the Orange Institution and other groups have begun to take steps to help develop and market the commemorations and parades that they organise. They hold activities around, them in order better to explain their history and significance,as well as to attract a wider audience. The July commemorations are some of the largest cultural displays seen not just in the British Isles but beyond. They are all organised and held with very little Government support or funding. Indeed, on occasion the NITB treats those events as unavoidable irritants. There is a sense that it includes such cultural events in passing, simply because they are difficult to ignore, but there is no real effort to develop the tourist trade surrounding them. I would like that to change, with the tourist board working in a real partnership with the organisers of those large-scale events to market them and exploit their full economic potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/12">We have a rich history, which has not always been marketed to the wider international audience&mdash;and I now turn to what is known as the Ulster-Scots tradition, sometimes referred to in America as the Scots-Irish tradition. Yet when most Americans think of researching their ancestry and their roots, they more often than not look to the Republic of Ireland, and not to the region that history most definitely pinpoints as the area where they would be better off beginning their search.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/13">I recently posed a parliamentary question asking what links there were between NITB and VisitScotland, to target potential visitors from the United States to both Scotland and Northern Ireland. I was informed that there were no such links, except for the usual meetings that would happen between officials in organisations like that. In recent years we have seen the establishment of Tourism Ireland, which has the remit of promoting the tourist potential in both countries on the island of Ireland. However, as is so often the case with such bodies, there appears to be an automatic assumption that the answer to most issues lies in Northern Ireland looking south. Yet Rabbie Burns country is as close to Larne as it is to Lanarkshire, so the NITB should look east as wellas south.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/14">My party and I have made it clear that we have no objection whatever to north-south co-operation where it is practical and brings a benefit. There will be some issues within tourism where that will obviously be the case. However, for many other aspects, there are east-west links that equal or far outweigh any north-south promotional links. The Government must take that issue seriously and start to put together official structures that recognise those deep cultural and historical links&mdash;in this case, to develop tourism and the wider economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/15">The Northern Ireland Tourist Board should develop a specific Northern Ireland brand, and there needs to be acceptance in Tourism Ireland that Northern Ireland has a clear and distinct culture. That needs to be exemplified even when it comes to a very basic matter such as the commissioning, supply and promotion of mementos and souvenirs that reflect that ethos. If people look through information on the events and activities that Tourism Ireland promotes, they will find much devoted to Irish literature and culture; it is only very recently&mdash;within the last 18 months&mdash;that Ulster-Scots music and culture has featured at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/16">I have made some criticism of the NITB today, but its recent publication of the proposed cultural and heritage tourism action plan is to be welcomed as a step in the right direction. The plan at least recognises some aspects of Ulster-Scots culture and associated aspects such as the plantation. I urge the Minister and the NITB to develop that process and carry forward those ideas, which could help to turn around some of the problems that I have outlined. Those ideas could also be allied with the focus on what Northern Ireland has offered to countries such as the United States, where there is a rich history to be explored and explained to many Americans who are interested in their heritage. That could not only lead to the promotion of tourism links between the United States and Northern Ireland, but aid the economy and help to build economic links between the United States and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/17">With Tourism Ireland, however, we start from a significantly lower base. There must be a cultural change in that organisation so that it recognises the product that it is helping to sell and the uniqueness of that product. Unfortunately, on some occasions, nationalists in Northern Ireland have focused on the political gain that they perceive is made through the establishment of a body such as Tourism Ireland, rather than on the fact that it is failing the area that they should want to be served. I hope that we can all unite in wanting to see a significant improvement today and in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/18">I stress that we have a massive marketing opportunity. It presents itself now, but will not last long. Northern Ireland will be featured next year in the Smithsonian Institution's annual folklife festival in Washington DC. That will be an opportunity for Northern Ireland to present itself on one of the biggest stages in the world. Millions of people go to that festival every July, and next July Northern Ireland will be centre stage. We have the opportunity to express to those millions of people the desire and the hope that they will come to the festival next July. I hope that the opportunity presented by the festival will be used to develop some of the themes that I have outlined, and that it will show the American public in particular what Northern Ireland has contributed to the development of their own nation, as well as building links for the future. The London Olympics in 2012 will also give Northern Ireland a tremendous opportunity to attract those who are visiting the games, as well as offering training for competitors. That applies to the United States and to other nations.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/19">The Government, of course, cannot be held responsible for the weather&mdash;I hesitate to mention the weather again, because it seemed to cause much merriment earlier.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-17a.275.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" speakername="David Anderson" colnum="275"  time="009:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060517/halltext/60517h0054.htm#06051786000486">
	<p pid="a.275.1/1">Absolutely.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/2">Despite the fun that we had, it was a worrying time. Daft things happened. My car had a Great Britain registration; were we in danger? We were stopped at checkpoints and when crossing the border. The sight of watchtowers and of helicopters in the air was not something that we were used to, although over the years I have come to know that my Northern Ireland colleagues had to live with it day in and day out for far too long.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/3">In 1993, I became a member of the national executive committee of the trade union Unison. During my time there, I worked with people in Northern Ireland and had many happy times trying to find a way forward in the peace process for working people over there. One of my happiest memories is of 1996, when we had a conference in Newcastle, County Down at the Slieve Donard hotel. I recommend it to everyone. They should go there, too, before they die.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/4">We also stayed in Kilkeel. We decided to make a holiday of it&mdash;we had gone across there and the union had paid, so we thought we might as well stay. We visited a place called the silent valley. If there is a more appropriately named place on this earth, I do not know what it is. It is for those who want real solitude. We could see the town below us, but we could not hear a thing. I would recommend it to anyone. It is an absolutely fantastic place.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/5">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the lakes in Ireland and the giant's causeway. That is one of Ireland's most visited places. So it should be, and so should other places like it&mdash;but the greatest reason to go to Northern Ireland is the people. They are genuine people, hospitable and warm. It does not matter what part of the country they come from; all of them make people feel welcome. Like me, and like some other people in the House, they come from a tradition of hard times and hard work. They have the attitude, &quot;We don't have very much, but we'll share it with you.&quot; That is one of the greatest reasons to go there.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/6">The place is now completely different from how it was 20 years ago&mdash;thanks in no small part to the people sitting in this room. Northern Ireland is vibrant, buzzing and alive. It has a positive future and our Government will play a major role in that future. There are new opportunities. There is now what I would call the &quot;terrorist trail&quot; in Northern Ireland&mdash;going round and viewing the murals. For people who have never been, that is probably one of the things that they most want to see, but there is so much more than that, and I hope that people will tap into it.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/7">Last week that well-known entrepreneur, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1658" name="Stephen Hepburn">my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Hepburn)</phrase>, organised a tour of the historic pubs of Belfast for us the night before the sitting of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee. The event was purely investigatory&mdash;nothing else&mdash;but it was really interesting. That sort of trip has become an opportunity for people working in the tourist industry in Belfast, and shows visitors a whole new side of the place. The other good thing is that, as we were waiting for the plane at Newcastle airport at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, we noticed that the traffic was two-way. Geordies were going to Belfast and Belfast people were coming across to Newcastle. That is good for ourcountry and for working together, and there is now a lot of hope.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/8">The Committee is conducting an investigation into organised crime, and last week we split into two groups. Some of us flew to Crossmaglen, which is the only way for security staff to get in there. It was worrying to arrive by helicopter, walk out of the front door of the police station, look down the street at a beautiful village square and know that the people in the station would almost certainly not dare to go out there unattended. The good news, however, is that watchtowers are coming down and last year, for first time in 26 years, the police started patrols, albeit in armoured vehicles, from the road to Newtownhamilton, so in a sense things are improving.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/9">After the Committee produces its current report we will begin an investigation into tourism. We hope that what we come out with will promote the good news and builds on the advice, information and evidence that we have seen. We want to do justice to the situation, and as part of that, we are going to Northern Ireland on <phrase class="date" code="">12 July</phrase> to look at cultural activities that many of us have never been involved in before.</p>

	<p pid="a.277.1/1">I am looking forward to that&mdash;and I hope that I can get a hat big enough to wear.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/2">To a certain extent, I have been involved in Irish politics for a long time, and I am not naive enough to believe that what has happened this week is anything more than a tentative start. Colleagues, both those in this Chamber and others in Northern Ireland, have got together to move forward, I hope, but we cannot move forward on terrorism, the peace process or anything else unless we are clear about three things. In our democratic society, there is no room for terrorists, criminals or wreckers. We do not want any of those people. We want to work together and, by using the tourism angle, we have a chance to build a new future not only for the people of Northern Ireland, but for the people of the whole United Kingdom. I hope that the Government play their part in a big way, and that we will be led in this work by the people of Northern Ireland.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-17a.277.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" speakername="Sammy Wilson" colnum="277"  time="009:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060517/halltext/60517h0054.htm#06051786000489">
	<p pid="a.277.2/1">I am pleased to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase>, who has done as good a job as the Northern Ireland Tourist Board has done&mdash;it will probably offer him some commission for the adverts that he has given us today. I noted what he said about the people of Northern Ireland&mdash;but I have to say that if his dad had started singing republican songs in the village legion in Portstewart, he might have had to revise his opinion somewhat.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1693" name="Gregory Campbell">my hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell)</phrase> on securing this important debate. As has been mentioned, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee will investigate tourism and we intend to spend some time sampling some of the tourist delights. It will be hard work, of course, and certainly not a junket or a holiday. We will discover some of the things that the hon. Member for Blaydon mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/3">I want to reinforce the final point that the hon. Gentleman made. If tourism is to be developed in Northern Ireland, it is essential that we put the past of terrorism and criminality behind us. The Government and everyone in the Chamber have an important part to play in pushing those who are reluctant, and still look over their shoulders at their past and want to keep some connections with that past, towards democratic behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/4">Tourism in Northern Ireland has the potential to achieve one of the objectives that the Secretary of State has rightly said is important if the economy of Northern Ireland is to develop. It will help to move Northern Ireland from public sector dependence to a greater emphasis on the private sector. It is significant that tourism is now the fourth largest private sector employer in Northern Ireland, and it has great potential if we use the tools we have at our disposal to help it to grow even more.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/5">The magnet for tourism, of course, is the city of Belfast. Nearly 70 per cent. of those who come to Northern Ireland come through Belfast and stay there at some stage. We have to recognise that if that isthe magnet, attention should be paid to that part of the market. However, I represent a constituency on the edge of Belfast that opens up a different dimension, away from weekend city breaks&mdash;towards the natural heritage of Northern Ireland along the Antrim coast and the glens, the built heritage of Carrickfergus with its historic castle, walls and churches and the associated pageants, or the natural heritage, coastline and wildlife and opportunities for bird watching, walking and so on presented by the Antrim glens.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/6">My hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry pointed out that there is an east-west dimension to tourism. The town of Larne, which I represent, presents the gateway to the western coast of Scotland, through which nearly 600,000 people come every year to Northern Ireland as tourists. That is an important link that needs to be developed. It is significant that the strategic transport plan published recently by the Scottish Parliament does not even mention that gateway and that link. That is one of the reasons why we must emphasise the importance and potential&mdash;not only for us but for Scotland and the north-west of England&mdash;of that gateway and the way in which it can help develop tourism in both parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/7">However, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed, and the first is promotion. Two thirds of the budget spent on promoting tourism goes to Tourism Ireland, which promotes the island as a whole but does not specifically promote Northern Ireland. I have no doubt that there is a need to promote both Northern Ireland and southern Ireland on the international stage and I also accept that many people who come to southern Ireland will eventually come to Northern Ireland. The flaw is that with no specific reference to Northern Ireland in much of the promotional material, on which two thirds of the budget is spent, a huge gap is left. It is significant that if there is to be any specific reference to Northern Ireland in the promotional material, extra money has to be paid. We have not sufficiently grasped that.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/8">The Northern Ireland Tourist Board does its own promotion of Northern Ireland, of course. On top of that, local councils do some promotion. That creates a difficulty, which I find in my constituency with people who have bed and breakfasts, for example, or hotels. Much of the private sector is at the small business end of the economy. Those people do not know who to go to. Which agency should they focus on to promote their product? Should they go to Tourism Ireland, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board or their local council? At what level should they pitch and promote their particular facilities? That needs some attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/9">Of course we need an overall strategy, and I believe that that is best done by the big agencies that operate on a world-wide platform. Once that platform has been created, we must look at ways of outsourcing it so that it is friendly to particular areas in Northern Ireland. The review of public administration and the creation of larger councils offer an opportunity to do that, and I see no reason, other than perhaps job insecurity, why the Northern Ireland Tourist Board should not outsource the promotion of what is available locally to the larger local authorities. That at least would provide a local connection between the small businesses involved in tourism and the local agencies, which are better placed to know what is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/10">As my hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry pointed out, because much of the development and growth of tourism takes place in rural areas, it can be environmentally sensitive. That tends to create difficulties in applying for planning permission. In the last three weeks there have been instances of such difficulties in my constituency. For example, an individual who sells fishing licences&mdash;fishing is a big tourism sector in Northern Ireland&mdash;operates in a small village off the main road, but bureaucracy in the Roads Service prevents him from putting up a sign pointing to where people may get a fishing licence so that they can enjoy that aspect of tourism. For the same reason, bed and breakfasts off the main road are also prevented from highlighting their location.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/11">We have to be sensitive to that. There might be regulations, and we do not want road sides cluttered with a host of signs, but if we are to promote tourism, agencies such as the Roads Service in Northern Ireland need to be more sensitive to the need to promote businesses in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/12">Then we come to planning. Only last week, I spoke to someone who had diversified from farming into holiday cottages, had turned three of the farm outhouses into holiday cottages and was booked up throughout the year&mdash;even in the winter. That person wanted to add another cottage, but because of the area in which it would have been placed, even though it was within the curtilage of the farmyard, they were having to fight the planners. Again, the authorities were applying the planning rules too rigidly rather than considering the potential for further diversification in the countryside, and the further promotion of alternative sources of employment now that farming is in decline, especially in some of the hill areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/13">A major project involving a disused quarry just outside the town of Larne in my constituency is fighting for planning permission. A company plans to build a cycle track of international standing and provide various ancillary and associated activities that could attract thousands of people to the area, but already there are planning difficulties. We need more sensitive planning policies if we are to develop tourism, as well as proper training, especially in the hospitality sector. Without that proper training, we will drive tourists away. Those are some of the issues that need to be addressed. Tourism is an important sector of the economy and it must be allowed to grow. I hope that the Minister will pay attention to some of the points made here today.</p>

	<p pid="a.280.0/1">I join other hon. Members in congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1693" name="Gregory Campbell">the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell)</phrase> on securing this debate. He is my constituency neighbour; indeed, he has the very proud honour of being my constituent. Like me, he lives in a city that should be very attractive as a tourist destination and has great ambitions and aspirations in that regard. It is a city that is well located in a river valley and has much history, some of which the hon. Gentleman touched upon. It is luckily located, with the giant's causeway not very far away on one side, with all that the causeway coast and beyond has to offer, and Donegal and all its riches on the other side. It also has everything that the Sperrins and Erne areas of Fermanagh and Tyrone have to offer. As a tourism region, the north-west of Ireland has much to offer.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/2">In taking forward the opportunities for tourism, we must examine all elements of the tourism industry, including what makes successful tourism experiences in other parts of the world that we visit and in other parts of these islands. As someone who holidays not on the continent but throughout these islands, I am constantly struck when visiting the south-west of England and the south-west of Ireland by the ease of reference from one amenity to another, and by the constant cross-promotion of information on all the different amenities and events. That can be compared with the difficulty that many visitors to Northern Ireland have in finding out even what visitor amenities and attractions are within a 20 or 30-mile radius of where they are staying. There is a lack of integrated information and promotion to give people a good, effective, attractive tourism experience. Too often tourists are left to do much of their own work in finding out what is there.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/3">Councils and others at a local tourism level have been trying to do something about the problem, as have the regional tourism organisations in recent years. They have tried to sell not just one isolated location but a whole region, so that people have plenty to occupy them and a range of experiences over a period of days. Unfortunately, the regional tourism organisations have had their funding cut. They have now been replaced by regional tourism partnerships, which the Government tell us will have a wider brief, but which will also have smaller budgets.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/4">If we are to gear up our tourism and all the sub-regions are to play their part, it is hard to see how they are meant to do so with diminishing Government funding and the loss of some of the European money that has supported tourism projects and initiatives introduced as part of the peace programme, under the heading of seizing the opportunities of peace. There are issues that the Government need to address. It is all very well to produce documents that highlight the room that exists to grow the tourism sector, and show the relatively low tourism figures in Northern Ireland compared with other parts of the UK and the Republic of Ireland, but expansion will not happen unless we invest in it.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/5">The hon. Member for East Londonderry and others raised the role of Tourism Ireland. As one of the people involved in the package of decisions that led to the creation of that company, I stress that it was created not as some sort of political gesture or gimmick but as a marketing company to enhance tourism marketing for the island of Ireland as a whole, and bring more tourists to it. We must all work hard to ensure that tourists who come to the island experience all that it has to offer. It is not just Northern Ireland that believes it sometimes misses out on the tourist traffic that comes to Ireland. Many of the counties in the south, above the Dublin-Galway line, feel that they too miss out, and that not enough of the coach tours take enough of in the whole island. That is not Tourism Ireland's fault; the southern half of the island simply has a well-beaten tourist track and a much more developed tourism infrastructure. That is all the more reason for us to invest more in our infrastructure in the north of the island, and particularly in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="a.285.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,Mr. Martlew. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1693" name="Gregory Campbell">my hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell)</phrase> on securing this important debate, and I join other hon. Members in welcoming the Minister to her new responsibilities. I look forward to working with her.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.2/2">I shall not go over many of the arguments that have been put, but I want to deal briefly with several issues. It is a pleasure to listen to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1589" name="Mark Durkan">the comments made by the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)</phrase>. I was born in the city of Londonderry, so I have a fond attachment to that part of the country. My parents live in County Fermanagh, in Ulster's lakelands, so I have good connections there as well. In respect of the tourism industry in Northern Ireland, I have good connections all over.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.2/3">As a Belfast Member, my prime interest and responsibility relates to the city of Belfast. It has been mentioned that Belfast is the regional driver for tourism in Northern Ireland, and that is very much the case. Visitor numbers have risen between 1995 and 2005. While the number of overnight visitors to Northern Ireland has increased by 19 per cent. during that period, the corresponding figure for Belfast increased by 95 per cent. In those earlier days, Belfast was a byword for troubles, difficulties and all sorts of things, so we are starting from a fairly low base, but those figures show the extent to which it is a major driver in the tourism industry, especially for weekend and overnight visitors who come to the Province.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.2/4">There is enormous potential. In 2005, it was estimated that Northern Ireland's tourist industry was worth &pound;350 million, whereas the Irish Republic's was worth &pound;2.3 billion. That shows the discrepancy that exists, and hon. Members have mentioned some of the reasons for it: the well developed infrastructure and all the rest of it. There is enormous potential for the development of tourism to create jobs and economic regeneration in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.2/5">I understand that Dublin is the third most visited city in Europe, in terms of weekend visits and so on. Belfast is coming up the list, but we should be attracting far more visitors to the city. On that front, I am concerned that the Belfast Visitor and Convention Bureau&mdash;one of the main agencies that can help to attract visitors to the city&mdash;faces a &pound;1 million cut in funding. I would like the Minister to consider that, because clearly that cut will make it more difficult to attract visitors to the city. That needs to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.2/6">For comparison, 4 per cent. of the Republic of Ireland's gross domestic product is tourism; for Scotland the figure is 6 per cent., and for Northern Ireland it is 2 per cent. We need to develop a vision for tourism in Northern Ireland. Reference was made to the debate in the Assembly yesterday, led by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1892" name="David Simpson">my hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson)</phrase>. In that debate, there was mention of the difficulties caused by the large public sector in Northern Ireland, and the challenges that Northern Ireland faces, with the decline in manufacturing industries and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.2/7">Tourism has enormous potential to create the jobs needed in Northern Ireland, but that potential will not be reached unless we create a real vision for tourists, and unless we market and invest in the tourism product in Northern Ireland; that has not been done sufficiently. Colleagues and I recently had a meeting with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. We discussed in detail some of the products that need to be developed, and particularly some of the issues mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry, such as the whole issue of the Ulster-Scots heritage. Frankly, I am extremely disappointed with the approach that has been adopted. Not enough has been done to develop the tourism product, and much more work is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.2/8">On the investment in marketing, reference has been made to Tourism Ireland, and clearly there is a role for the international marketing of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Tourism Ireland markets the island of Ireland abroad, in places such as Australia, America, Japan and the far east, but what causes me concern is the enormous amount of money going into tourism from Northern Ireland. By 2007-08, Northern Ireland will be putting &pound;22 million into Tourism Ireland's budget; that is one third of the overall budget. Two thirds of the budget comes from the Irish Republic, as has been mentioned. By 2007-08, the entire budget for the Northern Ireland Tourist Board will be &pound;11.1 million, yet &pound;22 million is going into funding Tourism Ireland from Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.2/9">I recognise the need for a marketing exercise along the lines that have been described, and the role that Tourism Ireland plays, but given that hon. Members have talked about the need for investment, we need to think about this. We cannot sustain so great an investment in Tourism Ireland while investment is cut in other areas, as the hon. Member for Foyle mentioned. The Belfast Visitor and Convention Bureau is suffering cuts and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board has an insufficient budget. There needs to be more balance, and I appeal to the Minister to look into the issue carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.2/10">The money&mdash;it will be argued&mdash;goes into bringing people to Ireland, and so goes into bringing more people to Northern Ireland, but the fact is that only20 per cent. of people coming to Ireland come to Northern Ireland, and most of that 20 per cent. spend far less time in Northern Ireland than in southern Ireland. I say strongly to the Minister that we need to think again about this. There is a need for investment in marketing the island of Ireland, but in my view things are not properly balanced. There is far too much money going into Tourism Ireland, as opposed to developing the tourist product and the tourism marketing of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.2/11">Finally, 2012 is coming up. The Olympics have been mentioned, but it is also the Titanic anniversary, so it is absolutely vital that the Government get a grip on the issue. Recently, I was at a meeting with the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Social Development, about the return of the Nomadic. I very much welcome the fact that it has been purchased and saved for the city of Belfast, and will be brought back there soon. It is an important part of the Titanic package, which I hope will encourage many visitors to come to Belfast in 2012. A &pound;25 million lottery application for the Titanic project is under way, but I strongly urge the Minister to get a grip on the issue, because at present there is no Government commitment whatever to core funding for that project or indeed for any of the main signature projects that are part of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board's remit. That needs to be grasped, because we have a tremendous opportunity before us.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.2/12">Cities such as Cork and New York are developing strategies to capitalise on the Titanic anniversary, but Belfast should be synonymous with it: it should be the place that people will not leave out of their Titanic itinerary. It has to be marketed, and that needs investment. I appeal to the Minister to consider that very strongly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-17a.287.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1960" speakername="Alan Reid" colnum="287"  time="010:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060517/halltext/60517h0055.htm#06051786000502">
	<p pid="a.287.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1693" name="Gregory Campbell">the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell)</phrase> on securing the debate. He is right to focus on the important issue of tourism, which has the potential to make a significant contribution to Northern Ireland's economy&mdash;perhaps greater than that of any other single industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.2/2">Northern Ireland has a great many tourist attractions and it has a great deal to offer in that respect, from the new Titanic quarter in Belfast to the giant's causeway and the spectacular scenery in between. Heritage and environmental tourism also have great potential. Yet despite those attractions, Northern Ireland has done much less well from tourism than the rest of the United Kingdom or the Republic of Ireland. Given the recent history, it is understandable that tourists have been reluctant to travel to Northern Ireland, but the great progress that has been made in recent years has opened up tremendous potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.2/3">It should not be an unrealistic ambition to increase significantly the number of visitors coming to Northern Ireland each year, thus increasing the revenue produced by the tourism industry from the tourist attractions themselves, and from bed-and-breakfast accommodation, restaurants and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.2/4">We should compare Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland, which has done tremendously well from tourism in recent years, attracting 6.5 million visitors annually. Tourism expenditure in the Republic of Ireland doubled in real terms during the 1990s and visitor numbers increased at twice the world growth rate. Tourism is definitely an area in which north-south co-operation can be strengthened and enhanced, which can only benefit Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.2/5">For tourism to succeed and grow, every opportunity should be taken to attract potential visitors to Northern Ireland. Government have a role to play in publicity and in the education system, which must ensure that the vast range of service providers are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to satisfy the needs of a range of potential visitors from different countries and cultures, with a host of diverse backgrounds and languages.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.2/6">The Government have a role to play, too, in providing transport infrastructure for visitors to get to Northern Ireland and then to travel around. I declare an interest: I represent the constituency on the British mainland that is closest to Northern Ireland. Hon. Members mentioned the links with Scotland, which are extremely important. It is also important for hon. Members and the Government to think not only of the link eastwards from Larne to Stranraer but the link northwards from Antrim to Argyll. There is a shared heritage between Argyll and Northern Ireland&mdash;not only the Ulster Scottish but the Gaelic heritage. Christianity was brought to Argyll by St. Columba sailing from Ireland, so there is a series of common heritages.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.2/7">A ferry service ran between Campbeltown in Argyll and Ballycastle in Northern Ireland for three years between 1997 and 1999. That popular service was operated by a private company under a strange contract awarded during the dying days of the Tory Government. It was strange because the company was given the ship as long as it operated the contract for three years. Of course, the inevitable happened: when the three years were up, the ship sailed away and the company used it elsewhere. It was a publicly owned and publicly paid for vessel, the Claymore, which was formerly operated via the publicly owned Caledonian MacBrayne. That was certainly a lesson in how not to award shipping contracts. They should be awarded on the basis of an annual subsidy, not by saying, &quot;Here's a ship; after the end of the contract you can sail away.&quot; It was a big disappointment when the contract came to an end after three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.2/8">Efforts to restore the service have been made by the Scottish Executive and this Government, and by the Northern Ireland Executive, when they were in existence. They have come very close, but never quite got there. The Scottish Executive have the lead role in that, but I hope that the Minister will be able to inform us of the current position.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.2/9">Although Governments have a role in developing tourism, it is important that it should flourish in the private sector. It is important that there is confidence in the private sector to invest, and that tourists have the confidence in it to come. Both tourists and private sector investors must be confident that Northern Ireland has a peaceful and stable future, and that crime and terrorism are things of the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.2/10">It is also important that we re-establish the Assembly and the Executive, so that Northern Ireland is once more seen by the rest of the world as being in a normal situation. It also goes without saying that a local Minister living in Northern Ireland, elected by the people of Northern Ireland, is far better able to judge what investment is required than any Minister appointed from this House. It is important that Assembly Members ensure, over the next six months, that the Assembly and the Executive are re-established. I am convinced that if the rest of the world sees Northern Ireland as having a stable and peaceful future, tremendous potential from tourism can be realised.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-17a.289.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" speakername="David Lidington" colnum="289"  time="010:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060517/halltext/60517h0055.htm#06051786000503">
	<p pid="a.289.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1693" name="Gregory Campbell">the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell)</phrase> on securing the debate, and welcome the Minister to her new responsibilities. She could have had no better introduction to the very pleasant side of her Northern Ireland Office responsibilities than the description of the delights of all parts of Northern Ireland that hon. Members from Northern Ireland have painted. I expect that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase> will have told her a number of ways in which she can enjoy herself there&mdash;even on the rainiest of days.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/2">Two themes have come through in the debate. First, that tourism offers tremendous opportunities for the Northern Ireland economy, and secondly that both the industry and Government have responsibilities to do their best to turn those opportunities into jobs, investment and prosperity. The industry has clear responsibilities to improve marketing and to seek to drive up standards of service at all times. It strikes me, from my anecdotal experience of travelling, that tourists are becoming more choosy. They want not only to see the best attraction described in a brochure or on a website, but a high standard of service. If it is not delivered to them adequately they will not come back, and they will advise friends and relatives not to visit that destination.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/3">The industry needs to focus on what tourists want from a visit to Northern Ireland. In some cases, it will be opportunities for family breaks, long weekends and so on. Other packages might include an island of Ireland tour, which would probably require thinking in terms of north and south. The reality is that an American or Japanese tour group will have limited time to spend on the island, and that time limit will mean that they will want to scoot around to different destinations as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/4">There may be a future for more golfing and fishing packages that are marketed on a north-south or Scotland-Ireland basis. A Scotland-Ireland distillery tour could well be promoted as a non-seasonal or winter activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/5">There are responsibilities for the industry, but clearly there are also responsibilities for the Government. I shall touch quickly on several issues that I hope the Minister will address as she gets to grips with her new brief.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/6">The first relates to a point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1589" name="Mark Durkan">the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)</phrase> about the need for co-ordination within Government. The Federation of Small Businesses in Northern Ireland recommended that if devolution is restored there should be a junior Minister with specific responsibility for tourism. At present, responsibilities are divided among different Departments and agencies. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment has a target to raise the annual visitor spend in Northern Ireland, but the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, the Roads Service, the Planning Service and the Department of the Environment all have responsibilities, and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has an interest in promoting farm diversification. It is important to co-ordinate not just the budgets of the various Departments and agencies but their forward planning and ways of setting their various priorities, so that tourism does not always slip to fifth or sixth place in each Department's list. There must be a regional focus on the importance of the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/7">Connected with that is a point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" name="Sammy Wilson">the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase>. We must remember that most tourist businesses in Northern Ireland are small, family-run businesses. People do not have time to search through acres of paper or pages on Government websites to find out what needs to be done, so how the Government disseminate best practice in an easily accessible form must be an important part of the strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/8">Improving transport infrastructure is of continuing importance. The point has been well made about the lack of rail links not just from Belfast International airport but from Belfast city. There are no direct rail links into the city centre, and anybody who has been stuck behind a tractor on the road between Dungannon and Enniskillen knows that there are some serious bottlenecks in the Northern Ireland road network that need attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/9">A wealth of projects represented by promoters seeking Government financial support will compete for the Minister's attention. I hope that the Government will be able to push forward the pace of decisions on the proposed international sports venue. There has been a perfectly reasonable debate about the best location for it, but a sports venue that is able to host major international fixtures would be a big tourist asset. The promoters of the Ulster canal regeneration bombard me with letters from time to time, and I suspect that that is another project that will find its way on to the Minister's desk.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/10">There are opportunities, but there have also been warnings in some of the Northern Ireland Audit Office reports. The experience from well-intended projects such as the Navan centre in Armagh, to which many hopes were pinned, is that money can be spent with good intention but customers may not come in. I return to my opening point: every decision that is taken about tourism in Northern Ireland must aim to provide what the customer wants to spend his or her money on.</p>

	<p pid="a.291.0/1">This has been an excellent debate, and a great one with which to start so early in my time as Minister with responsibility for such issues in Northern Ireland. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1693" name="Gregory Campbell">the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell)</phrase> not only on securing the debate&mdash;it is awkward enough to get time for debates in Westminster Hall&mdash;but on putting his points so coherently, forcefully and clearly.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/2">I always try to deal at least with some of the points made by the Member who initiated the debate. Ministers never have enough time to deal with all of the many points that arise in these hour and a half debates, but I undertake to write to Members concerning any points that I omit to address. It is clear to me that most of the Members in the Chamber today are not as new to this as I am, and I have enjoyed hearing from everybody about the many attractions in Northern Ireland that should be pulling in tourists. I have no doubt that Members from all parties, regardless of any divisions, will agree that Northern Ireland has fantastic potential as a tourist destination, and agreement on that is a pretty good place to start.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/3">The fact that we are starting from a low base gives us a chance to move quickly. There is no reason why we cannot start moving toward the position in which Northern Ireland would have been in the absence of past disadvantages and difficulties, and that should be the aim. There is significant potential for further growth, and notwithstanding the success of recent years we should not rest on our laurels. We should go further and faster to translate the potential into reality, because that reality can mean jobs for local people, increased business activity and increased balance between public and private sectors, all of which are tremendously important to the future of Northern Ireland. I see the responsibility for that as one of the most important that I have acquired in my new role, and I shall focus on it a great deal.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/4">In 2005, there were some 2 million out-of-state visitors to Northern Ireland. That is quite a number&mdash;more than the number of inhabitants. It is a landmark that needs to be built on and a significant achievement. Visitor spending from that group topped &pound;354 million, with a further &pound;146 million spent by local people holidaying at home&mdash;it is not only visitors from outside who offer potential. The latest quarterly employment survey showed that more than 51,300 people were employed in the tourism and leisure sector, which represents a significant number of jobs for the local population. There is already improvement, there is great potential, and we should progress a lot further.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/5">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> and several other Members mentioned, if Northern Ireland is to compete effectively in an international and increasingly global travel and tourism market, there must be knowledge of what customers want. We must match what is available in accordance with that principle, so that the available products are marketed as well as possible. Getting the products right and marketing them properly is the key to best performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/6">I was interested to learn that some 69 per cent. of overseas holidaymakers to Northern Ireland use the internet when planning their trip; 65 per cent. actually book their flight or ferry online, and a further 27 per cent. book their accommodation online. We must ensure that we move with the trends in how people book and plan their trips&mdash;it is no good having lousy websites, and products that can be marketed only in the traditional way. We must be up to date, and it is important that Tourism Ireland and other institutions promoting tourism on the island of Ireland seek to achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/7">I want to deal with some of the points raised by the hon. Member for East Londonderry, because this is his debate. He referred to the Smithsonian folk life festival. I am sure that we would all agree that that has enormous potential for showcasing the delights of Northern Ireland. We have until next July to get it right, but we need to get moving sooner than that if we are to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/8">I asked officials to let me know what benefit Scotland had gained, having had the same honour. The results were impressive, and I am glad that officials from the Northern Ireland Departments are talking with their Scottish counterparts to ensure that they learn the lessons that Scotland learned and do not miss any tricks, but exploit the opportunity to the full. Some 10,000 key travel prospects attended lectures on Scottish holidays, 44,000 people logged on to the VisitScotland website for travel information and key members of the international industry attended events in Washington. All of them now know far more about Scotland and visiting Scotland than they knew before. We have to ensure that the activities that we undertake this time next year present Northern Ireland with similar opportunities. We must design what we do to maximise those opportunities, and I intend to ensure that we do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/9">The hon. Gentleman referred to the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, the <phrase class="date" code="">12 July</phrase> celebrations and the Orange Order, and made some points about tricks that might be being missed, and commemorations and cultural displays that are not being properly exploited as products for visitors. I think that he said that the NITB treats some of those events as unavoidable irritants. I hope that he will accept that more links have been made recently in order to improve on what he sees as a poor record. Meetings have taken place between the Orange Order and senior NITB officials to attempt to ensure that the situation improves, so he should in future feel able to say nicer things about the efforts that are being made. Certainly, the main event on <phrase class="date" code="">12 July</phrase> is now on the visitor website. Lots of people decide whether to visit on the basis of websites and what they see online. We hope that there will be improvements in understanding and better links, and therefore better marketing of all appropriate events in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/10">I should like to say a word about the Ulster Scots traditions, on which several hon. Members commented. There were concerns that the tourist potential of those traditions&mdash;part of the culture of Northern Ireland&mdash;is not being exploited to the full, particularly among people in the United States of America seeking information about their family history. I am aware that there have also been a number of parliamentary questions. I have answered some and had a look at others. The Ulster-Scots Agency has made a contribution towards marketing materials that Tourism Ireland and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board have produced specifically to try to market that sector. Again, I will not argue at this early stage that that has been exploited to the full, but I will say to the hon. Gentleman that we clearly recognise that there is an opportunity that has not been exploited, and we are determined to do more in relation to that tradition. I hope that in due course he will be satisfied that things are improving in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/11">Many hon. Members, including the hon. Member for East Londonderry, made the point that Tourism Ireland should be looking east-west rather than just north-south. I heard what was said about money and resources, and about the focus of the institutions, whether Tourism Ireland or the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. Tourism Ireland's targets for growth in visitor numbers and revenue are higher for the north than they are for the south. That might not answer all the points that were made, but it demonstrates that we recognise that the industry is less developed in the north than it is in the south, and that the gap needs to be narrowed. All the institutions, tourist boards and various bits of Government&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.294.1/1">It does not matter which county, town or city of England one chooses, there are beautiful, small, great, sometimes grand churches everywhere, and no two are alike. We see the magnificence of wool churches and the splendour of the perpendicular style, where the perpendicular nave is little more than a stone framework for a gorgeous blaze of colour in stained glass&mdash;a style adapted to a country where the sun is a friend to be welcomed. There are small Saxon churches, grim, solid Norman churches in the style of their heavy-handed conquerors, early English churches and decorated churches. As Jeremy Paxman observed last week:</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/2" class="indent">&quot;Church spires are the great punctuation points of the English countryside. For the religious buildings of this country not only tell where we are geographically, they tell us where we have come from.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/3" class="indent">They are often the only place in the community which has a living, visible connection with the past. They hotwire us into our history.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/4">And as Sir John Betjeman observed:</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/5" class="indent">&quot;From churches blue with incense mist, their reredos' twinkle gold</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/6" class="indent">Chapels of ease by railway lines, and humble streets with smells of gas</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/7" class="indent">I hear your plaintive ting tangs call from many a gabled western wall</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/8" class="indent">To morning prayer or Holy Mass.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/9" class="indent">In country churches old and pale I hear the changes smoothly rung</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/10" class="indent">And watch the coloured sallies fly from rugged hands to rafters high</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/11" class="indent">As round and back the bells are swung.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/12">Our places of worship are frequently places of architectural importance. English Heritage has statutorily listed 14,500 places of worship, many of them mediaeval. I have initiated this debate to support the &quot;Inspired!&quot; campaign by English Heritage, which is supported by many denominations and faith groups&mdash;Anglican, Baptist, Catholic, Jewish and Methodist&mdash;and trusts and organisations such as Friends of Friendless Churches, the Historic Churches Preservation Trust and the Open Churches Trust. In a recent letter to me, the Minister made it clear that he and the Government agreed</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/13" class="indent">&quot;about the importance of church buildings both as a focus for local communities and as an important part of our National Heritage and in vital services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/14">The Minister went on to observe:</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/15" class="indent">&quot;The forthcoming English Heritage 'Inspired!' campaign will be vital in providing information that will help the Government, churches and English Heritage itself in deciding where support would be most effectively targeted.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/16">And he concluded that he was excited by English Heritage's campaign and would certainly be looking carefully at the results.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/17">There is no ambiguity about what English Heritage is saying to the Government. Ministers do not have to wait; the facts are stark. Thousands of churches and other places of worship are crumbling and in danger because of a multi-million pound shortfall in funds needed to keep them standing. In its briefing for the &quot;Inspired!&quot; campaign, subtitled, &quot;Securing a Future for Historic Places of Worship&quot;, English Heritage makes it clear that</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/18" class="indent">&quot;new research which English Heritage has just completedshows that although congregations valiantly managed to raise &pound;67 million each year, the yearly amount actually needed for repair and maintenance is &pound;185 million. That means there is a staggering &pound;118 million annual shortfall which English Heritage and other grant making bodies simply cannot fill.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/19">I recently undertook a survey in just one small part of my constituency, the Deddington deanery. I asked for an estimate of what parishes thought the cost of repairs and maintenance would be over the next five years. Adderbury church, which is a very fine parish church, of which John Piper did a very beautiful picture, will require &pound;250,000. Banbury St. Mary's, which is a grade I listed church in the centre of Banbury, estimates that it will need &pound;220,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/20">I visited St. Mary's last Friday with the vicar, Janet Chapman, and the area dean, Ben Phillips. It is a magnificent church, built in honey-coloured Hornton stone, with a green copper cupola. The difficulty is that the copper on the cupola and the lead that seals the stone expand and wear at differing rates, so leadmen are now on the church roof in Banbury repairing the lead. Of course, with any of those exercises, there are now considerable and understandable associated health and safety costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/21">It is estimated that Bloxham parish church, which Simon Jenkins considers to be architecturally one of the best 1,000 parish churches in England, will need &pound;100,000. Indeed, Bloxham only recently had to spend approximately &pound;85,000 on repairing the spire, which can be seen at 4 o'clock on Sunday in a programme on television about steeplejacks, starring Tony Robinson of &quot;Blackadder&quot; fame.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/22">I shall not take the House through every churchin the Deddington deanery, but the total came to&pound;1.5 million: that is what the community needs to raise over the next five years simply to maintain the fabric of buildings of considerable historic interest in one deanery in one county. English Heritage estimates that the cost of repairing all England's 14,500 statutorily listed places of worship would be &pound;925 million&mdash;almost &pound;1 billion over the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/23">English Heritage is making some extremely modest requests of the Government. The thrust of its campaign is about understanding the problems of the need to repair crumbling churches and taking action before crisis is reached. That crisis is approaching&mdash;it will strike, perhaps not this year or next year, but certainly in the near future. English Heritage has a five-point plan, which I commend to the Minister and invite the Government to support.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/24">English Heritage wants to make places of worship fit for purpose in the 21st century by reforming heritage protection legislation. It is asking the Government for a one-off payment of &pound;2.52 million to allow it to rewrite outdated list descriptions for all grade I listed places of worship. The Government's own planning policy guidance observes:</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/25" class="indent">&quot;Generally the best way of securing the upkeep of historic buildings and areas is to keep them in active use. &quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/26">The best way to secure the future of churches of historic and architectural significance is to ensure that they remain, if possible, living buildings at the heart of communities&mdash;visited, valued and enjoyed by all. As with any other listed building, a balance must be struck between changing patterns of use and the protection of the special architectural and historical interest for which the building has been listed. St. Mary's in Banbury, for example, is at the very heart of the town and is now used for public meetings, concerts and exhibitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/27">Sensibly, English Heritage wants to develop partnerships between everyone concerned, to encourage planning ahead and a positive rather than reactive approach to the management of church buildings. English Heritage is asking the Government for &pound;8 million a year for three years for various purposes. Those purposes include helping congregations to help themselves by appointing advisers in denominations who can offer support and expertise, helping communities and congregations to understand the repair priorities, and then helping individual congregations to make the most of their buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/28">Another use for the funding would be to create a maintenance grant scheme to shrink repair bills in the longer term. English Heritage wants to start a new maintenance grants programme to help the congregations that are least able to fund maintenance themselves. For example, the diocese of London is undertaking a private study in the City of London of the benefits of a centralised gutter clearance service, so that the gutters on all churches in the diocese, as well as vicarages and church halls, can be cleared twice a year. The diocese employs a contractor to clear the gutters and downpipes and check the drains, and while on the roof the contractor also undertakes emergency repair work such as fixing slipped slates. A simple checklist and digital photographs are used to show the condition of the roof and gutters and even hard-to-reach places, providing good information about what repairs are required. That is sensible &quot;a stitch in time saves nine&quot; work.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/29">The funding could also be used to maintain a joint English Heritage and Heritage Lottery Fund repair grant scheme and augment it with a small grant scheme. The joint English Heritage and Heritage Lottery Fund repair grants for places of worship scheme is the largest single source of funds for repairs to listed places of worship in England. It gives out&pound;25 million a year, but it is 100 per cent. over-subscribed. Government funding for English Heritage has remained static and, as a consequence, so have its grants schemes. The allocations from the lottery to the Heritage Lottery Fund have also declined, and although it continues to help places of worship with other grant schemes, English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund help fewer congregations each year. English Heritage is therefore modestly asking the Government for an extra &pound;4 million a year for three years, to start a grant scheme to help those congregations that are most in need to carry out smaller repairs. With that extra &pound;4 million, they will be able to double the number of repair projects that English Heritage can support each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/30">Lastly, English Heritage wants to make sure that safety nets are in place for redundant places of worship. It is an inescapable fact that, although four out of five people express a religious affiliation, the number of active worshippers has fallen. That, together with demographic changes, means that some areas have more places of worship than the remaining community can support. Some of those buildings are conveyed to the Churches Conservation Trust. Yet, since 2001, the trust's funds have been frozen, while, in the same period, it has been given responsibility for another 12 churches, most with big repair bills. The Friends of Friendless Churches, a small charity set up to save disused places of worship of architectural and historic interest from demolition, has already helped to save 100 churches and chapels in England and Wales. Not unreasonably, English Heritage is calling on the Government to reinflate funding of the Churches Conservation Trust as the main safety net for redundant Church of England buildings that are too architecturally and historically important to be deconsecrated.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/31">In all, English Heritage is asking the Governmentfor the incredibly modest sum of slightly more than&pound;26 million over the next three years. I hope that the Minister will not consider me churlish if I put that sum into context by pointing out that it is almost exactly the same amount as the Home Office squandered and threw away on the costs of the preparatory work of building an asylum centre in my constituency, where no actual work was done&mdash;not a single sod turned, not a stone erected. The sum that English Heritage is requesting is modest indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/32">In fairness, I acknowledge that the Government have recently demonstrated their concern about historic places of worship. In the 2006 Budget, the Chancellor decided to extend further the scheme that means that churches are, in effect, spared the cost of VAT on repairs. I think that everyone who is concerned about a future for historic places of worship would thank the Chancellor for extending the scheme that refunds VAT to those important buildings. However, as English Heritage research has shown, much more needs to be done to avert a crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/33">The Government do not need any further information. In a letter to me in March, the Minister said that the</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/34" class="indent">&quot;forthcoming English Heritage 'Inspired!' campaign will fill some of the gaps in our current knowledge of the extent of the problem and enable Church and Government to plan effectively for the future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/35">Well, there is no ambiguity in English Heritage's briefing. It is asking for a modest amount. I hope that the Ministers will shortly be able to confirm that the Government will support English Heritage's campaign in full, but even if the Government do everything that English Heritage wants, more will still need to bedone. There will be work for congregations and for communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/36">In my village of Bloxham, for example, we have set up the Friends of St. Mary's&mdash;a group of local people who recognise the considerable importance of the church as a building of significance in the life and landscape of the village. In the past three years, ithas raised approximately &pound;30,000 for the repair, maintenance and fabric of St. Mary's church. As Simon Jenkins observes:</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/37" class="indent">&quot;Bloxham is a steeple, a window and a chapel. The steeple is a work of art in itself, early 14th century and the finest in Oxfordshire. The octagon and spire rise 200 ft. almost sheer from the road. Every surface of the tower is carved! Below the parapet is a frieze of men and beasts. The West doorway arch has carvings of the apostles in small niches. The masons seem to have usurped all conventions and set free their imagination.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/38">He further observes that Bloxham, like many churches, has had things of beauty added over the centuries so that</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/39" class="indent">&quot;the last phase of Bloxham's development came with Street's restoration and employment of Morris &amp; Co. to the glass. The chancel and interior is largely Street, as are the pulpit, choir stalls and marble reredos. The chancel window glass is an early masterpiece by Morris, Burne-Jones and Webb. It depicts saints, angels and King Alfred set before the heavenly city. The colours are bold and the effect dramatic. Even more lovely is the vividly coloured window of St. Christopher in the South wall of the chancel which was executed in 1920 to a Burne-Jones design.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/40">The debate is not simply about English churches. The issue should be of concern to every Member of the House whether they represent city, suburb or countryside. English Heritage launched its &quot;Inspired!&quot; campaign in St. Mary Magdalene, Paddington, which is regarded as an exceptional grade I example of high Victorian gothic. Perhaps because of its proximity to the Grand Union canal, incoming waters threaten the church's internal decoration.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/41">Colleagues do not have to wander far from the House to find London churches that are breathtaking in their beauty. We can see the galleries at St. Martin-in-the-Fields, which are a normal feature in Georgian churches; the lavish asphodel sanctuary of St. James the Less in Pimlico; the heavy Norman piers of St. Bartholomew-the-Great; Inigo Jones's St. Paul's in Covent Garden;St. Augustine's in Kilburn, which is one of the most important Victorian churches in London; All Saints, Margaret street in Marylebone, which has breathtaking panel painting of Victorian polychrome; as well as St. Alfege in Greenwich, St. Giles in Camberwell, St. Barnabas in Dulwich, St. Mary in Rotherhithe, St. Anne in Limehouse and Christchurch in Spitalfields. Every town and city has churches of significance and value. Those should not be crumbling; they should be a real asset to the community in which they are found. We have a collective duty to save our historic churches from rot and ruin.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/42">Not surprisingly, in an article in <i>The Guardian</i> last Friday, Simon Jenkins observed that</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/43" class="indent">&quot;the English parish church nationwide&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/44">is a</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/45" class="indent">&quot;dispersed museum of history, art and architecture&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/46">Everyone who cares for England and for our heritage should consider paying a small amount for the upkeep of a local church or making a donation to a national charity that cares for places of worship. Even if one is not in a position to make a monetary contribution, many hundreds of people contribute to the upkeep of churches of historic significance by helping with fundraising, mowing the grass or simply keeping the furniture dusted and the churches polished. Our churches and places of worship&mdash;whether church, mosque or synagogue&mdash;are a shared treasure, a shared heritage and a shared challenge. I am sure that the churches and communities can rise to that challenge. It would be good if the Government could lead the way.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/47">I conclude with a poem written by Andrew Motion, in support of English Heritage's &quot;Inspired!&quot; campaign:</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/48" class="indent">&quot;In the mind's eye, in the memory-store, for now</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/49" class="indent">The church sets sail but stays where it was built,</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/50" class="indent">Its anchor hooked into the parish-heart.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/51" class="indent">In the green yard, in the deep grass, for now</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/52" class="indent">Each summer-tide swells up and leaves the dead</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/53" class="indent">Untouched inside their plots of tilted earth.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/54" class="indent">In the flint nave, in the window-shafts, for now</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/55" class="indent">The glassy saints grow limber with the sun</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/56" class="indent">That ripples through their robes and walk again.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/57" class="indent">In the blind vault, in the dry hush, for now</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/58" class="indent">The coffins hoard their argosies of dust</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/59" class="indent">And darkness gleams as definite as light.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/60" class="indent">In the slow years, in the centuries, for now</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/61" class="indent">The villagers arrive to load the ark</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/62" class="indent">That saves their lives and settles here as home.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/63">If, as a nation, we do not respect and preserve our past, what is our future? It is through the churches of England that we learn who we were and thus who we are and who we might become. If we lose that learning, we lose the collective memory that is the essence ofus all.</p>

	<p pid="a.299.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> for securing this debate. It is not often that we hear the poet laureate quoted in full in the hallowed corridors of Westminster, and we are all grateful. This is, as the hon. Gentleman will know, an issue of great importance to me, both as the Minister with responsibility for culture and on a personal level.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/2">Let me start by making it clear that the Government fully recognise the importance of our historic churches. Historic places of worship are an invaluable part of this nation's heritage. They represent the finest of our historic buildings and are showpieces of the most accomplished design and workmanship. From Canterbury cathedral, to the Shah Jehan mosque in Woking, or the historic Cheltenham synagogue, they help to tell the story of this country in a way that no other group of buildings can, and they are a vital part of teaching us about who we are and where wecome from.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/3">Beyond that, historic places of worship host an array of vital services that are often forgotten, ranging from nursery groups and lunch clubs for the elderly in our communities, to many sporting activities after school and on weekends for our young people. They can only do that thanks to the armies of volunteers attached to churches. The Church of England alone constitutes the largest voluntary organisation in the country and is present in every part of England. With that importance in mind, the Government have in place a range of policies and funding designed to support our historic places of worship.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/4">We ensure the protection of historic churches through the listing system. More than 45 per cent. of grade I listed buildings are churches. The heritage protection reforms that we intend to introduce in the coming years will make that protection system work more effectively for owners, managers and users of those buildings. We provide substantial funding to contribute to the upkeep of historic places of worship. Funding already in place from Government and lottery sources will total around &pound;60 million this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/5">As the hon. Gentleman knows, congregations carry the large burden of dealing with the repair bills of our parish churches for leaky roofs, broken windows, repointing and so on. That is why we created a unique scheme to tackle the problem: the listed places of worship grant scheme. A unique scheme within the heritage sector funding system, it returns the VAT paid on repairs to listed places of worship. Approximately 8,000 churches have benefited and more than&pound;43 million has been paid out since 2001 to those churches. The scheme provides an average of &pound;1 million a month to support those churches and it is important that that is on the record. In the Budget, the Chancellor announced that the scheme would continue until 2011 and would be extended to cover professional fees and repairs to clocks, pews, bells and organs. That extension and extensions to the linked memorials grant scheme mean that &pound;70 million of new money has been committed.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/6">Alongside that targeted help on VAT, another major part of the funding that is already in place is the joint repair scheme for places of worship operated by English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund. That scheme is worth around &pound;25 million this year, and with this year's grant has paid almost &pound;90 million since it began. This year, the repair scheme will, for example, enable St. Mary's, Tunstead in Norfolk to repair its magnificent 15th century arch-braced roof: &pound;136,000 has been offered as a grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/7">In addition, my Department provides &pound;3 million a year to support the Churches Conservation Trust, which looks after the finest of the churches that are no longer needed for regular worship. The trust does an excellent job of conserving the 335 historic churches in its care and is increasingly giving consideration to how its churches can be opened up for greater use by local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/8">English Heritage gives &pound;1 million a year for cathedral repairs. The &pound;40 million given under the scheme since 2001 has seen a major backlog of repairs in our cathedrals all but eradicated. In addition, the Heritage Lottery Fund puts more money into churches for repairs, new works, conservation, treasures and events. Including its contribution to the joint scheme, the HLF has put &pound;300 million into church and cathedral buildings since 1994. Approximately 9 per cent. of all the money given by the HLF goes to our historic churches and faith buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/9">Our support for historic places of worship is not only about the heritage protection system and direct funding. It is about trying to reflect the needs of those buildings in wider Government policy making. That is why my colleagues in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have been looking at the contribution that faith buildings make to community cohesion in rural areas. Funding such as the &pound;12.5 million faith communities capacity funding is in place to support churches and to empower local people. All of that will help to keep those buildings alive and in use.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/10">I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that, by any analysis, that is a substantial package of support and one of which the Government should be proud. Of course, there is always more to be done and the hon. Gentleman highlighted English Heritage's &quot;Inspired!&quot; campaign that was launched last week. English Heritage's research is extremely valuable and improves our knowledge of the state of repair of our national church buildings. The hon. Gentleman will have seen, for example, that the diocese of Oxford has been shown to have a large number of churches in need, although that diocese also has the most churches of all the dioceses in England. That information is enormously helpful and we would like that sort of approach to be taken with a wider range of historic buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/11">We also welcome the English Heritage pilot studies and capacity-building activities, both planned and ongoing, which will help to inform debate in the coming years and show whether funding is appropriately targeted. As English Heritage's work makes clear, we need an effective partnership between Government, church denominations, heritage specialists and the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/12">The challenge facing us is not small. Church buildings' estimated repair need is considerable. As I said, we are helping the churches to meet that challenge through a comprehensive package of funding; but we to move forward and we must do so together. Our assistance can only be partly about money. It is also about giving church organisations access to support networks and advice at national, regional and local levels. The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that too many congregations remain isolated from that information and advice. We need to improve our knowledge of what works to keep churches in use, and consider innovative ways to keep churches as living buildings in their communities. &quot;Inspired!&quot; will help towards that.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/13">It is clear that although some dioceses and parishes are able to spread good practice and move forward, to maintain their buildings and move forward, and to apply for grants from English Heritage or the Heritage Lottery Fund and move forward, others remain more isolated, have less capacity, and are less able to do that. We must tackle that problem together.</p>

	<p pid="a.302.0/1">English Heritage has asked for&pound;26 million. We are just about to start another spending round, and bids will be made to the Treasury.

	<p pid="a.302.1/1">As any Minister would say, one does not give funding commitments when one is entering the spending round. Now is the time for dialogue and discussion about what are the significant issues. By any analysis, the &pound;130 million that we give English Heritage as a non-departmental public body is a large sum. The organisation has been able to find efficiency savings to put back into the front line, it has responded to a quinquennial review, and a peer review is approaching. The Government will certainly take that work forward as we enter into the spending round.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.1/2">As English Heritage has pointed out, and as the Bishop of London recognised when he spoke at Synod in February, the work not for the Government alone. The churches face major challenge to galvanise further support. We are told that 89 per cent. of the population visited a place of worship during the past year, and we know that even non-churchgoers have an affiliation and affection for the village church. Churches need to capture and capitalise on that support.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.1/3">I know that hard-pressed volunteers work miracles when it comes to fundraising, as well as undertaking vital community services. We need to consider whether church buildings can be enjoyed in new ways&mdash;as visitor attractions, educational resources, or centres of community activity&mdash;all of which open up alternative routes for funding. We need to discover whether existing community services and new alterative uses for churches can attract new sources of funding, and we must ensure that they get that funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.1/4">We in Government will continue to listen to and work with the denominations and faith communities, as we seek to secure a sustainable future for our historic churches. I look forward to working with the hon. Gentleman on that in the coming years.</p>

	<p pid="a.306.0/1">I concur. The Poles fought in Arnhem with the British and played a leading part under British command at Monte Cassino in liberating that bastion along the spine of Italy, which ultimately led to the downfall of the Mussolini regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/2">I am extremely proud of that; that is why I have kept my very difficult to pronounce surname. As I said in my maiden speech, when I was in business many people said to me, &quot;You must be mad if you think you're going to get into the House of Commons with a surname like that. You should change it and anglicise it. Dump that name and get an English one.&quot; I refused to do that. I feel extremely proud of my beloved grandfather and the many Poles who fought with the British during the war. It goes to show the sort of people the British are that they are prepared to elect someone with a totally unpronounceable surname as their MP. I am proud of my Polish background, and that is why I have keptmy name.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/3">Forgive me, Mrs. Anderson, for that slight deviation. As I said, the British empire came to Poland's aid in 1939. Unfortunately, after the war, communism descended on Poland. As Winston Churchill said, the iron curtain descended in Europe from Szczecin in the north to Trieste, and those countries were sealed up and locked away from the rest of us for more than50 years under communist tyranny and dictatorship.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/4">Solidarity was crushed in 1981 when General Jaruzelski imposed martial law. There were tanks on the streets in Warsaw in December 1981. People were repressed and the full communist apparatus swung into action to destroy the uprising that was initiated by Lech Walesa and thousands of brave Poles on the streets of Warsaw. I was a child at a school in Surrey and we collected food parcels of coffee, tea, tinned fruit and all the little luxuries that the Poles did not have because there was martial law, the borders were sealed and the economy had collapsed.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/5">That happened not only in my school in Surrey, but throughout the country. School children and parents gathered food to send to Poland to help the Poles during martial law. That is another amazing example of how Brits want to help Polish people. During those communist days it was illegal to listen to the BBC World Service in Poland. Anyone caught doing so would be punished severely by the authorities. Yet many Poles in the quiet of their homes, late at night and with the curtains drawn, tuned in to the World Service. It was a great comfort to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.308.1/1">I shall try my very best, although I have my personal views.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/2">I have spoken warm words, but I want to hook the Poles with a fishing line into our orbit and our sphere of influence. That is why I wish to come to the nub of what I want to communicate to the Minister. I was very disappointed with the Poles over the recent European Union rebate.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/3">In my estimation, Britain has never, ever let the Poles down, yet on the critical issue of the United Kingdom rebate, which Mrs. Thatcher fought so hard to secure in 1984 from President Mitterrand and others, the Poles let us down badly, despite all the support that we have given them. I say that as someone of Polish origin. They were so determined to get hold of extra investments from the European Union that they fell for the French and German interpretation and decided that the best way to do so would be to get rid of the UK rebate.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/4">I am disappointed with the Poles on that score. Rather than sacrificing the UK rebate and demanding more money from Great Britain, which is one of only two net contributors to the EU budget, there are many other ways to increase funding for eastern European states: for example, greater efficiency in respect of the money that the EU already spends, less corruption within the EU and greater management of its resources</p>

	<p pid="a.309.2/1">I must tell the Minister, however, that the raw emotions persist, and they need to be understood. Recently, the Polish Minister of Defence, Mr. Sikorski, referred to the pipeline and said, &quot;We are very sensitive about German-Russian pacts.&quot; That is not surprising, because the last one was the Molotov-Ribbentrop, the pact that carved up Poland. It is important for British Ministers to understand the sensitivities and emotions involved, because they exist and they are raw. As long as there are people still alive who lived under German occupation, or grandchildren of such people&mdash;like me&mdash;nobody should forget what happened back in 1939.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.2/2">Germany intends to build a pipeline from St. Petersburg to Germany, which will bypass Poland and the Baltic states. That is outrageous. When I went to Warsaw, Minister after Minister mentioned it to me. They said categorically, &quot;We are in the European Union, and the EU is all about a cohesive uniform strategy.&quot; Even the EU energy commissioner has lambasted the Germans over the proposals. We are living in sensitive times when the Russians are turning off gas supplies, and when there is great sensitivity over energy resources generally. In that context, it is outrageous that the Germans can somehow ignore their neighbours and build a huge pipeline under the Baltic sea to provide themselves directly with gas and oil from Russia, despite being part of a EU that is trying to cobble together a pan-European policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.2/3">That proposal goes against the spirit of the EU and against the interests of Germany's neighbours, and Polish Ministers feel extremely strongly about it. When the Minister speaks, I hope that he will assure me that he will use his office and prestige in Europe, not to mention the respect within which he is held in Europe, to rebut Germany's position on the pipeline and present a critique of it. If a country like the UK is prepared to stand up for Poland and say to Angela Merkel, &quot;No, we are not prepared for you to go against the spirit of the EU in this way&quot;, that would resonate hugely, not only in Warsaw but in capitals throughout eastern and central Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.2/4">I have spoken for some time, so I shall come to my second and final issue, which is the Katyn forest. This is the anti-Russian bit.</p>

	<p pid="a.311.1/1">Thank you, Mrs. Anderson. Before I make much of the truncated version of what I would have liked to have said <i>[Interruption.]</i>&mdash;I mean no criticism of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase>&mdash;I tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the Chamber that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase> would certainly have wanted to be here this afternoon, but his mother died last week. I am sure that, as one of our few Members of Polish origin, he would have wanted to be present, and that, were he here, he would have had the sympathy of us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/2">I sincerely congratulate the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham on securing the debate. He towers above many of his contemporaries, both physically and intellectually. I knew him well when he fought&mdash;extremely well&mdash;a neighbouring seat to mine in Ealing. His reputation followed him to Shrewsbury and Atcham, where it blossomed into the achievement that we see today.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/3">The hon. Gentleman described, in effect, three Polands, the first of which is the Poland of the heart, which has always existed, even in the period of more than 100 years in which there was no such physical entity. At that time, there was no geography of Poland, yet Polish language, culture, tradition and literature thrived, flourished and endured. In every part of the world in which freedom was fought for&mdash;from south America to the Paris commune to the Caribbean&mdash;there were the Poles. Every war of independence and freedom throughout the 19th century saw a Polish presence. That says much of the Poland of the heart, which endures even in the dark days.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/4">The hon. Gentleman talked about the period of military rule under General Jaruzelski, when a man such as Father Jerzy Popieluszko, God rest and keep him, could be taken out and murdered by thugs at the behest of the state, his body dumped in a river, and it was hoped that that murder could be covered up. Despite all that, the Poland of the heart thrived, endured and flourished.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/5">The hon. Gentleman also described the Poland of a few years ago&mdash;of the heroes of RAF Northolt and the invisible community with which I grew up. I saw people every Sunday in my church community in west London, yet had no idea that they were Polish. It was not until 1966 that Father Kazimierz, one of the first Polish priests in London who the hon. Gentleman will remember well, was part of the Polish millennium celebrations, which coincided with the world cup.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/6">I recall that in those days, many of my Polish friends anglicised their names, and I give so much credit to the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham for refusing to do that. There were so many Pawels who became Pauls, Jans who became Johns and Krystynas who became Christines. I give the hon. Gentleman much credit for his pride in his name. At that time, many of my friends started to wear Union jacks. I said to them, &quot;It's marvellous that you are all supporting England in the world cup&quot;, and they said to me quietly, &quot;Well, yes, but actually we don't really want Germany to win&quot;. That was honest.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/7">The Polish community was one of the hardest working, most decent, almost crime free communities that I have ever known. That community is a credit, and not only to our country or the major areas of settlement&mdash;one thinks of the huge Polish community in Scotland that has settled in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Inverness. In fact, I think that four people of Polish origin have played football for the Scottish national team, although not with conspicuous success, but perhaps that was because of the other seven players in the team.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/8">In my part of the world&mdash;west London&mdash;we have been blessed by the size of the Polish community in terms of urban concentration. We like to say, &quot;After Warszawa and Chicago stands Ealing&quot;. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1759" name="Stewart Jackson">The hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson)</phrase> was formerly a distinguished councillor in the London borough of Ealing&mdash;a political opponent of mine, morning, noon and night&mdash;but a man whose respect for the Polish community will take second place to no man. He is here to endorse that. There is a risk of us being slightly sentimental about the Poland of that period, but justifiably so because no one who saw the occurrences at the Lenin shipyard and the birth of Solidarity, can be anything other than emotional.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/9">The important thing that we need to discuss is the Poland of today and tomorrow&mdash;the current Poland. The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham referred to the 350,000 Poles who have come here and the 204,895 who have registered to work. Not everyone is delighted with that; a number of my constituents have complained vociferously about it. A number of plumbers and bricklayers who I know have said, &quot;This is outrageous; these people turn up on time; they work all day; they finish when they are meant to; their vans never break down on the north circular; they never have suddenly to leave for a family bereavement; and they finish the work on time and on contract. How can the honest British workman hope to compete against that?&quot; I like to think that the spur of the Polish workers will actually raise standards throughout the work force of west London.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/10">May I address a stereotype? The new figure&mdash;the Bob the builder of the day&mdash;is Pawel the plumber. People speak of Pawel the plumber as if Poles come to this country to work in manual trades only. For every Pawel the plumber, there is an Anna the architect, or a Krystyna the cardiologist. There are Poles at every level, including dentists, as has been said. That is absolutely right. We think of Dr. Jan Mokrzycki, who is president of the Federation of Poles in Great Britain. He is a distinguished dentist who took one look at my teeth and refused me an appointment.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/11">We must recognise that Polish people have brought skills of all levels. However, it is important that the House recognises that there are tensions between some in the older settled Polish community and some of the incomers. On Sunday, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of Our Lady Mother of the Church on Windsor street in Ealing&mdash;a Polish church opened in 1986. It was a packed church which now has seven masses on Sunday and has been run marvellously by the Marian Fathers over the past 20 years. The conversation there has been very much about the new and the old Poles. I like to think that Poles are Poles, whether they are new, third or fourth generation. It is important that we place on record in this place our appreciation of and respect for our allies who have been with us, shoulder to shoulder, over the generations and centuries. It is intensely important to mention that.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/12">We have some difficulty in that one of my constituents, Mrs. Gill Rodican, has recently complained to the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis about notices printed only in Polish asking for witnesses to report crimes in Ealing. That is an example, I think, of insensitivity rather than of an inherent problem. I appreciate that it is not in the remit of my hon. Friend the Minister, but I shall certainly raise the matter with the commissioner, because if Polish on Polish crime exists and we need witnesses, those signs should be bilingual. They should not be only in Polish, because of the feeling of difference and strangeness generated, with which some people have problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/13">Overall, Poland is now a major emerging trading partner with the United Kingdom. I pay credit to the economic and commercial department of the embassy of the Republic of Poland, particularly the Minister Counsellor Krzysztof Trepczynski, for the work that has been done, and to the Polish information and foreign investment agency which encourages that bilateral trade between us.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/14">The UK and Poland are natural partners. We have a long history; we are family. We should be closer trading partners. I shall not follow the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham entirely down his road, which leads to an alternative to the Franco-German axis. I like to think of a European axis, involving all the countries. However, I understand entirely where he is coming from, and appreciate and respect his view. However, talk of new and old Europe is not helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/15">I like to think of Poland as Poland&mdash;it has emerged from the permafrost and the dark overcast skies of the communist era and is only now stretching its sinews and feeling the strength in its muscles, and giving voice to the huge creative urge that sustained it during the decades when there was no geographical Poland. Now in every aspect of its life&mdash;industry, the arts and commercial activities&mdash;a new Poland is emerging. The hon. Gentleman referred to British shops in Warsaw, Crakow and Gdansk, and even in L&oacute;dz. They are to be found throughout over Poland. That is the relationship of the future; it is a relationship of equals, which was forged in the heat of war and has been tested by adversity, but ultimately it is a relationship between two nations, based, I hope and trust, on mutual respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/16">I shall not entirely endorse the comments that the hon. Gentleman made about the pipeline, because I am not sufficiently well versed in that subject. However, I look to my hon. Friend the Minister to continue to support and endorse the activities of the British chamber of commerce in Warsaw and the British commercial interests in Poland now, and to make life a little easier for the bilateral trade and commercial relationship between the two countries, with which there are still problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/17">Above all, I do not think that it is unfair to ask my hon. Friend, at this time, so close to the anniversary of the Warsaw rising, to go&mdash;if he has any doubts as to the awful reality of what happened at Katyn&mdash;to Gunnersbury park in west London and stare up, as I know he has, at that great black granite obelisk that lists the names of the cream of a country's culture, slaughtered and stuffed in the ground. He will think, as I did, of two things: first, how Poland can never die. Where one Pole lives, Poland lives. No matter how many are slaughtered, that will never kill Poland. Secondly, he will think of the sheer length and breadth of that memorial column and the names and occupations listed.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/18">I do not believe in debts of honour overriding everything, but if ever a country owed a debt of honour to its comrades this country owed one to Poland. Poland has suffered greatly. The United Kingdom and Poland can work side by side, shoulder to shoulder for a new, emerging, strong, commercially successful Poland, which will finally achieve the potential that every one of us knows lies deep within that rich soil.</p>

	<p pid="a.314.0/1">It is a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" name="Stephen Pound">the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound)</phrase>, whose powerful speech touched this House. I also pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> for what was a most impressive and wide-ranging speech. I shall be brief, and touch on only two issues. One is a general matter, and the other is a constituency matter relating to Poland.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.0/2">I pay tribute to the members of the Polish community in Wellingborough. They live in the heart of Wellingborough, they are a most important section of our community, and they have their own Don Polski club, to which I am kindly invited now and again.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.0/3">I sit somewhere between the two Members whohave spoken on the European Union issue. Of the&pound;100 billion that British taxpayers have paid to the EU since this Government have been in power, only a small proportion is relevant to the expansion of the EU. I think that all parties welcome the EU's expansion.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.0/4">We have, in Poland, an ally. We always talk about our special relationship with America, but we also have a special relationship with Poland. That is partly because of history, going back to the second world war, and partly because they share the same ideals and principles as us as a nation. They are hard-working, they believe in enterprise and they have a strong belief in their own national identity. However, they look outward on the rest of the world, they believe in free trade and they reject protectionism, and there is nothing that the so-called Franco-German axis can do about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.0/5">The European Union is waking up to the idea that we should have a EU based on what the countries of the EU want, which is a single market and free trade, not protectionism and the protection of French farmers so that Africans lose out. We have common purpose with the Polish community and Poland.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.0/6">The constituency situation that I want to raise is extraordinary, and I hope that the Minister will be able to help. I have not been able to find an answer to it through my inquiries with the Government so far. As we have heard, Polish people are allowed to work in this country. They have free access, and we were one of the few countries that granted it. In my constituency, most dentists, for whatever reason, have gone private. I have received a huge postbag from people complaining about it, but if one wants to find an NHS dentist in Wellingborough, one is sent outside the county. There is none available in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.0/7">A Dr. Chan, who is a leading dentist in Rushden, which is an important part of my constituency, rang me a while ago to say that he had a Polish dentist&mdash;fully qualified, with perfect English, so there was no problem on that ground&mdash;who wanted to work in Rushden under the NHS. It would have been of great benefit to my constituency, because a considerable number of people would have been able to get the NHS dentist treatment that they cannot get now. The primary care trust has refused to employ that dentist. I guess that it has done so on the ground of funding, but if all other NHS dentists have gone private, is there some way in which the Government can direct the PCT to employ a Polish dentist? It would help ease the dentistry burden in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.0/8">It seems that the rhetoric, which was discussed earlier, is not being realised in my constituency. There is a real issue, and I wonder whether the Minister could give any advice or help in his winding-up speech. In conclusion, it has been a great pleasure to sit in the Chamber under your chairmanship, Mrs. Anderson, and listen to two most powerful speeches.</p>

	<p pid="a.315.0/1">I cannot follow the powerful speeches that we have heard this afternoon, but it has been a great pleasure to listen to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">them, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> on securing the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/2">In addition to the sentiments expressed this afternoon about the United Kingdom's historical relationship with Poland, and about how Poland has changed its face with astonishing success&mdash;being first on one side of Europe and then the other after the fall of communism&mdash;I wish to speak about our present and future relations with Poland. First, however, I shall reflect briefly on the extraordinary journey that Poland has made, and the terrible events that have happened there, as has been underlined in two powerful speeches. Indeed, despite the UK's experience of war during the 20th century, we would find it difficult fully to comprehend what happened in Poland.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/3">My mother in law will later this year be the embodiment of the Polish congratulations song &quot;Sto Lat!&quot;&mdash;she will be 100 years old in the summer. She was born as a Russian subject, and she lived under occupation for the first part of the century. She became a Polish citizen in adulthood, and then again lived for seven or eight years under occupation. She arrived in the UK, having left Poland during the chaotic period immediately following the end of the second world war. She was welcomed to the UK as someone who had played a substantial role in her family and community, and she built a new life in the UK. She is now a UK citizen. Perhaps one person can encapsulate Poland's experience; it is a personal reflection of the events about which we have heard this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/4">Thinking of past relations between the UK and Poland and about how Poles, at crucial junctures in UK history, have given freely of their lives with courage and commitment can assist us in putting that relationship into context, I was pleased to see Poland join the European Union in 2004. I attended a meeting in Wroclaw shortly after Poland joined the EU to discuss a number of issues about Poland's future in Europe, and the lack of realisation among Poles about their country's significance as an EU player surprised me. In fact, its weighted EU votes give Poland the same significance as Spain. It is a significant and large player.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/5">Although I do not entirely go along with the suggestions of the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham about the Franco-German axis, the way in which matters are discussed within the EU is changing rapidly, and one result of Poland's accession is that those discussion and alliances will inevitably be different. Having a strong friend within those discussions and alliances will be important to us in making our way within the EU. Indeed, Poland is to start talks on joining the eurozone in 2009, so it might not only become the significant player that I have described, but join the eurozone before the UK. One might perhaps reflect on that for future reference.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/6">It is also important for our relations with Poland to understand where it now sits in the EU. After all, Poland will potentially be a great asset when Europe comes to determine what happens next for the European countries beyond Poland's borders. Of course, Poland has unique issues in terms of its borders, because it not only borders several other countries that joined the EU in 2004, but has a long border with Belarus, which is, to put it kindly, one of the most enigmatic countries in eastern Europe. It also borders Ukraine. In addition, there is also the border with Kaliningrad, which will continue to give rise to complicated relationships and arrangements, and there is the question of how that will work its way through relationships with the EU. As an EU border state, therefore, Poland faces several significant issues, and it is important that we support Poland strongly in that role and understand those issues so that we can clarify them together. At the same time, the relationships that Poland can form with countries immediately outside the EU will be of great benefit to the EU and to us in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/7">As has been mentioned, Poland is the UK's sixth largest investment market. The emergence of British shops and companies in Poland is not only significant, but has been greatly welcomed by Polish citizens. Poland is also this country's largest trading partner in central Europe. There are therefore real and serious issues in terms of trade and mutually beneficial bilateral arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/8">As has also been mentioned, many Poles have come to the UK to work, following Poland's accession to the EU. Many of them have come to my constituency, although there has always been a large Polish community in the Southampton and Eastleigh area, and it continues to be of great benefit and assistance to the area. The community that is now emerging in my constituency and the wider Southampton area is industrious and, despite having been here only a short time, it is becoming increasingly coherent and is determined to make a positive contribution to the UK's economy. Although there are concerns about housing and services in the Southampton area&mdash;the same applies elsewhere&mdash;the contribution that the Polish community can make to the economy of our city and to the life of Southampton is overwhelmingly positive, and we should view it in that light.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/9">My final thought is to welcome the further influxof Poles to Southampton through the doors of Southampton football club. Our club manager has recruited Bartosz Bialkowski and Grzegorz Rasiak as leading players, and he recently saw what I believe was a scintillating encounter between Wisla Krakow and a team whose name I cannot pronounce, so I anticipate that further players will come forward. The contribution of Poles to the UK economy, and the drive of Southampton football club to retain its premiership status next season&mdash;[<i>Interruption.</i>] Next season. It will be there for all to see. I remain firmly committed to ensuring that relations between Poland and the UK, warm as they are, continue to grow. I will strive to ensure that that relationship continues to be as good and positive in the future as it has been in the past.</p>

	<p pid="a.317.1/1">I start, as is obligatory, but in this case highly appropriate, by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> on having secured the debate. I have heard the main town in his constituency pronounced at least two different ways, and his surname many more ways than that, and I have yet to receive a satisfactory answer as to what it is. Perhaps he can put me right afterwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.1/2">As has been said in previous contributions, the most evident sign of Anglo-Polish relations is the large influx of people from Poland who live and work in the United Kingdom; that is a testimony to the success of EU enlargement. There is a lot of opportunity in this House to make speeches and other interventions that are critical of the European Union, and I agree with some, but certainly not all, of those criticisms. However, many regard the enlargement from 15 to 25 member states as having been, in most regards, a considerable success. It was enlightened of our country to embrace it in the spirit in which it was intended. Large sectors of our economy&mdash;one thinks of things such as fruit-picking and packaging&mdash;would collapse without the influx of labour that we enjoy, particularly that from eastern Europe,. In my constituency&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.318.1/1">I strongly concur, and I was going to make precisely that point. It is not just the lower-skilled seasonal industries that are affected. In my constituency, Poles work in everything from slaughterhouses to dentistry&mdash;some people might think that those are not that far apart, but my intention was to convey a range of businesses&mdash;and perform tasks that would otherwise not be done, or not done to the same standard. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's assessment of the success of the experiment. Hundreds of thousands of Poles have come to live here. What can we learn from that in relation to Bulgarian and Romanian accession in the years ahead?</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/2">Poland's economy is growing. It is not growing as much as those of other countries in that part of Europe, so we should not regard it as an unqualified success. None the less, it is growing, albeit with an unsustainably high level of unemployment, which in part explains why so many Poles have come to live here. There are still considerable problems with its infrastructure and the heavy degree of bureaucracy of its public sector. I hope that those issues will be addressed by the Government of Poland in co-operation with other countries in the European Union, including Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/3">I should also be interested to hear what the Minister's thoughts are on the supply of energy to and through Poland, a particular topical subject, which is obviously relevant to the people of that country but also concerns people here and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/4">I concur with some of the comments made earlier about the opportunity for alliances with Poland and other countries in eastern European. Britain has displayed a progressive and enlightened approach to the new member states of the European Union. I hope and believe that that will serve us well, not only because it was the right thing to do but because the people from that part of Europe will see Britain as a potential ally, as those countries emerge and grow more confident in their democracies and their economies.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/5">The current Polish Government, however, give cause for concern to most people who are democrats. There are some extraordinary characters in the Polish Government, including people with narrow, nationalistic views and, in some cases, deeply illiberal viewson personal freedom. I do not wish to quote<i>The Economist</i> magazine as though it were the Bible, although most people regard it as a fairly authoritative journal. Of the Law and Justice party, which I understand is, overwhelmingly, the largest party in the Polish coalition Government, it says:</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Law and Justice, and particularly its populist allies, delight in picking fights with gays, feminists, secularists, liberals, the media, ex-communists, uppity foreigners (especially in Brussels) and anyone else who crosses their path.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.321.0/1">As ever, it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Anderson. I am sure that you will not mind me congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> on securing the debate. I am responding to it on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe, who is serving this country valiantly at this very moment in Strasbourg. He has responsibility for Poland in the Foreign and Commonwealth office.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/2">I acknowledge the keen interest of the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham in the land of at least some of his ancestors. He spoke with great authority and passion and, most importantly from my point of view, I enjoyed his speech immensely; it was very insightful. I welcome the opportunity to debate the United Kingdom's relations with Poland. For most of our lifetime, as we have heard, Europe has been cruelly and unnaturally divided. Those divisions have ended, thanks not least to Poland's determination, courage and fortitude. I remember well its fights. In 2004, Poland took a momentous step when it joined the European Union, and no Government were more delighted than ours to see the Poles take their place at the European table.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/3">We have heard a great deal about hon. Members' personal connections, and I shall tell the Chamber about some of mine because such connections are important. I grew up with a lot of kids who were the sons and daughters of Polish coal miners who came to my valley, the Cynon valley in Aberdare, at the end of the second world war and became an important part of our community. My father was an aircraftman in the second world war and fought alongside Polish pilots. He grew to feel warmly about them, but he always warned me that they were both the bravest and the craziest people that he had ever met. I rediscovered that fact in the 1960s when I began climbing in the Alps. In those days, there were standards routes to Alpine peaks, north face routes, north face directs and routes that we used to call &quot;Polish routes&quot; because they were suicidal. That said a great deal.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/4">There was a lot of laughter earlier about how Poles expressed themselves at that time, when the dead hand of communism kept their country away from its orientation towards being a great European base of culture and creativity. I remember meeting Polish climbers for whom climbing was important as a way of escaping. They could look healthy, patriotic and Polish, and they were allowed to go to the Alps. They were mad, but it was wonderful. They were all crazy about jazz, which has always been the music of rebellion. They were great painters, poets and novelists. Polish novelists won Nobel prizes. The greatest thing about being in Poland now is that one can rediscover, as in the case of Czech and particularly Hungarian writers, a great heartland of European literature. People are once again free to move across frontiers, which is a wonderful achievement.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" name="Stephen Pound">My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound)</phrase>, in his inimitable style, gave us details of the community relationships that are so important. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">The hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase> also reminded us of them. While he was speaking I remembered being taken to a Polish club&mdash;I shall not tell the Chamber in which town it was&mdash;and being shown into a large room where there were groups of some elderly men, some not so elderly, but no women. I tried to move across from one group to another and was warned, &quot;Don't do that, they haven't spoken to each other for 25 years.&quot; It reminded me of Wales, actually. They are great people for sectarian fights.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/6">I cannot give an answer to the point that the hon. Member for Wellingborough made. I know that in some areas people have gone out and recruited Polish dentists. I will ask about the matter&mdash;it is worth a try in this place&mdash;but I suspect that the hon. Gentleman will probably get a more informative answer from the Department of Health.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" name="Alan Whitehead">My hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead)</phrase> congratulated his mother in law on her great longevity. Her life encapsulates the history of modern Poland, which is an amazing story. My hon. Friend reminded us that Poland's influence within the EU is already equal to that of Spain, which reinforces what the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham said. We must take our alliance with Poland very seriously. The balance of power is shifting and will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/8">I have just returned from Bulgaria and Romania, and they have mighty problems. However, I remember the Poland of the 1970s, when my friends from Solidarity would come over and tell me what was going on. I did not believe them. I did not believe that helicopters were shooting in the street demonstrators who were trying to create democratic and trade union rights for themselves. We had no idea of the severity of that oppression. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman mentioned it, because the situation has changed dramatically, and we must take it seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/9">I am sure that everyone who has spoken and listened will pay tribute to the contributions that emphasised the great part that Polish people have played not only in this country's history, but are playing now for our economy. This point is quite right: we were, along with Ireland and Sweden, the only countries that offered Polish workers free passage to move and work. Now, I notice that a great queue of European countries is trying to do the same, because if there is one thing that we have begun to understand, it is that if we are to compete in the world economy, we must have the skills to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.322.0/1">My hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham and I have a long-standing invitation to visit POSK, the Polish cultural centre in King street. It is a fantastic institution that may offer some pointers towards integration, because it offers services not only about Polish culture, but to Polish immigrants and migrant workers in order to teach them about England and Britain.

	<p pid="a.323.0/1">It is a kind and generous offer. I may have to pass it on to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe. He is in Strasbourg, but I shall make him aware of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/2">The hon. Gentleman makes a very important point, and there is a great deal of discussion about integration. It was no easier to integrate in 1945-46 than it is or is not now. We should have these discussions, but we should not become obsessed with the integration of one ethnic group or one people. We should consider the best examples that we have, and the Polish workers have provided us with some of the very best examples.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/3">Importantly, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" name="Jeremy Browne">the hon. Member for Taunton(Mr. Browne)</phrase> highlighted the fact that many workers are over here because unemployment is so high in Poland. It is at 18 per cent. It is scandalously high for young boys and girls at 40 per cent.&mdash;40 per cent. youth unemployment. It is no wonder that they are flocking to this country. The hon. Gentleman is right. We must help in whatever way we can to try to let the Poles know that alongside liberalising the economy and slimming the bureaucracy, the high levels of taxation and unemployment have got to go if Poland is to, as it will, flex its muscles as a great economic power. It should do so in that crucial geographical position in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/4">We have not talked much about the following important subject, because we have not had a great deal of time. However, Poland is the EU's eastern frontier. We must help the Poles with it, because it is leaky. The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham did not get a chance to talk much about it, but we must understand that many of our problems, whether with organised crime, drug smuggling, people smuggling or arms smuggling, are caused because everybody wants to get into the EU from that eastern direction. The Poles live in a tough neighbourhood and they always have done. We have drugs liaison officers working on the frontier, and people trying to help with the border crossings to systemise the way in which vehicles are checked. It is an important subject, and I am glad that the hon. Gentleman raised it.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/5">I am rather grateful that I have no time to talk about the pipeline. It is really a matter for the Germans and Russians. If I were a German or Russian, I would probably build it along the Baltic sea floor myself.</p>

	<p pid="a.324.1/1">It is a pleasure to have secured a debate under your chairmanship this afternoon, Mrs. Anderson, to discuss the case of my constituent Mrs. Sarah Ann Paice. It is with some reluctance that I raise the case of an individual constituent, but its history has been so profoundly frustrating for her, her family and the workers in my constituency office that I thought it appropriate to bring it to the Minister's attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/2">Since I secured the debate I have been contacted by representatives of the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and an organisation called One Parent Families, who have highlighted issues that echo strongly in the facts of the case. I hope that the Minister will therefore find the present discussion helpful in the context of the Henshaw review. I should like to thank personally Mrs. Janet Allberson of One Parent Families and David Tinline of the CAB for briefing me.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/3">Let me make it clear at the outset that I fully support the principles that lie behind the present child support system. Those of us who are parents have a responsibility, both moral and financial, to our children and that responsibility should continue regardless of whether or not a marriage or a partnership continues. As a former practising solicitorI am also aware that the court system that the child support system replaced was cumbersome, and often extremely slow and unresponsive to all parties involved. There is always a danger of seeing the grass as greener on the other side of the fence, but my limited experience of matrimonial courts in the days before the Child Support Agency was that they were themselves a source of great frustration. The involvement of the courts does not always help; that said, however, the case of Mrs. Paice illustrates the failures of the current system.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/4">My constituent Mrs. Paice separated from her husband David Paice in September 1999; at that time, they had three teenage children. From that time until September 2002, Mr. Paice paid the mortgage for the matrimonial home in lieu of child support. Without notice, he stopped doing so because, as Mrs. Paice subsequently discovered, he remarried around that time. In May 2003, Mrs. Paice received a letter telling her that Mr. Paice should pay &pound;4,267.49 for the period <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-09">9 July 2002</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-26">26 May 2003</phrase>, which is now almost three years ago. That payment was not made and, as the House will hear, approximately that sum is stillowed today.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/5">By February 2004, Mrs. Paice was informed that the arrears of child maintenance had increased to &pound;5,397.95. However, a monthly payment of &pound;440.92, was specified to be paid by Mr. Paice. During that period Mrs. Paice made numerous calls to the Child Support Agency and the case was shifted from the Belfast office to the Birkenhead office to the Nottingham office and then back to Belfast again. None of Mrs. Paice's efforts resulted in payment of the money that was owed to her. In February 2004&mdash;more than two years ago&mdash;she first approached me for help.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/6">It seems to be characteristic of the CSA that orders are made and communicated to the parents who are looking after children, but are not enforced. As a result, parents such as Mrs. Paice who have the obligation&mdash;a heavy one, as those of us who are parents know&mdash;to bring up teenage children, with all the pressures that that imposes, frequently manage without any of the money that has been awarded to them. The real source of frustration for someone who is under financial pressure is that they are presented with a piece of paper that states that they are entitled to thousands of pounds, but they do not receive the money. That must cause anger to such individuals. It is vital that orders are enforced, at least in part, and in most cases in full.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/7">In Mrs. Paice's case, an original order was delivered to her. It appeared to be helpful, but it was not enforced. She received further communications before payments were made, and the order was changed&mdash;in fact, the payment was reduced&mdash;but still she received no payment. The figure was then reduced further. By March 2004, Mrs. Paice had received a notice from the CSA indicating that &pound;77.98 per week was to be paid. Again, the amount had been reduced without the previous sums owing being paid. By that time, the arrears had increased to &pound;5,107.80&mdash;a very large sum indeed. Mrs. Paice still had financial obligations and was coming under more and more financial pressure but she was not receiving the arrears that were owedto her.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/8">By April 2004, a deduction from earnings request had been served on Mr. Paice's then employer, the British Army, to collect &pound;411.19 per month from him, comprising &pound;387.36 for regular maintenance and &pound;23.83 to pay the arrears, which had increased still further to &pound;5,548.72. Assurances were given that the money would be paid into Mrs. Paice's account. The money began to come in but, in July 2004, the amount was reduced to &pound;361.83 without any notice being given to her. Later, she was given an explanation and the matter continued to some extent satisfactorily until May 2005, when Mr. Paice left the Army. As a consequence, Mrs. Paice stopped receiving payments in April 2005. The money that she had been relying on since the previous year stopped, again without any notice.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/9">To Mrs. Paice, the CSA appeared throughout to be more responsive to the payer than the payee. One can well understand her feelings. When the payer's circumstances changed, something happened immediately, but there was no suitable response when Mrs. Paice came under increasing pressure.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/10">A further review of Mr. Paice's position was completed in July 2005. It indicated that he should pay just &pound;66.19 per week&mdash;a substantial reduction. To rub salt into Mrs. Paice's wounds, she became aware that a lump sum payment that Mr. Paice had received from the Army when he left had not been taken into account to discharge the substantial arrears that were owing from the period two or three years earlier. Still worse, a further assessment of Mr. Paice in November 2005 indicated that his liability was nil.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/11">In a letter in January 2006, the CSA concluded:</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/12" class="indent">&quot;We do not feel there is evidence of delays or errors which can be attributed to the Agency.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/13">By <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-16">16 January 2006</phrase>, arrears stood at &pound;4,007.15.Mr. Pace agreed to pay them off at &pound;5.70 per week. On that basis, by my rough calculation, full payment will take 13 years, by which time Mrs. Pace's youngest child will be 26.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/14">Mrs. Pace is very angry about the way in which her case has been dealt with. She feels that she has not made progress and that she has not received satisfactory responses from the Child Support Agency. She believes that a substantial sum remains to be paid, close to the amount of arrears that existed in 2003. I know that the Minister is not the person responsible for the circumstances of the particular case, but sincehe has had an opportunity to consider it, I askhim whether he believes that there has been maladministration.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/15">Why was the lump sum payment that appears to have been paid to Mr. Paice not used to pay off the arrears owed from 2003&mdash;arrears that should have been used for the benefit of the children, who were growing up in that period? Does the Minister really believe that it is appropriate for an award to be made for payment of arrears over a 13-year period?</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/16">I have one final but important point concerning a recommendation made by One Parent Families that, in certain limited circumstances, when a resident parent believes that the Child Support Agency has not dealt satisfactorily with a case, there should be an opportunity to apply to the court to raise the matter there. In my experience it can sometimes be beneficial to secure court attendance by an individual&mdash;or in this case two parties&mdash;to clarify the circumstances of a case and to try to secure an effective order. I believe that that proposal is worth considering. Both in this case and in others that I have dealt with involving the Child Support Agency, there is far too much evidence of orders being made, sent out, never acted on, never enforced and, above all, never paid.</p>

	<p pid="a.326.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1947" name="Ian Lucas">my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas)</phrase> on securing the debate. Obviously, the subject matter is of concern to him and is extremely important to his constituent, Mrs. Paice, whom he has served well by bringing the matter to my attention in this manner. I welcome the opportunity that the debate gives me to try to help in this particular case, subject naturally to some constraints on what I am able to say. If there is time, I shall also comment on some wider child support issues, and set out some of the steps that the Government hope to take to deal with the more substantive points illustrated by Mrs. Paice's case.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/2">The case underlines the reasons for the Government's conclusion that the current operation of the CSA is inadequate. That is why we have agreed to put an improvement plan in place immediately, and why we have asked Sir David Henshaw to review how we might deal with child support issues in the longer term. I shall talk about that review, if time permits.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/3">My hon. Friend has raised questions about the policy for implementing deduction from earnings orders against people in the armed forces. To make policy work, child support legislation must link with other legislation, and that applies in relation to those who serve in or have served in the armed forces. To support the Child Support Act 1991, amendments were required to the Army Act 1955, the Air Force Act 1955, the Naval Forces (Enforcement of Maintenance Liabilities) Act 1947 and the Merchant Shipping Act 1970. In effect, the agency was given provision to recover maintenance through deductions from the pay of soldiers, airmen, sailors and merchant seamen.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/4">The agency does not issue deduction from earnings orders against armed forces personnel because pay or allowances made to a non-resident parent as a member of Her Majesty's forces are not defined as earnings for the purposes of child support legislation. Instead, the agency can request that the armed forces make deductions for child maintenance under armed forces law. That is known as a deduction from earnings request.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/5">The order and the request are designed to work in precisely the same way and to treat service personnel and civilians equally. In cases in which full maintenance is not paid, the non-resident parent remains liable for any arrears, the money owed is not written off and the agency can either pursue the non-resident parent through other appropriate enforcement measures once it has a liability order to secure the debt, or it can impose a deduction from earnings order if the non-resident parent subsequently obtains civilian employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/6">The agency is bound by forces regulations. If, in exceptional circumstances, armed forces personnel decide not to action the agency's request to deduct the maintenance, it cannot impose the deduction from earnings request. However, as the individual remains liable for the maintenance and any arrears, the agency still has a range of other collection and enforcement powers to secure payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/7">In the case that my hon. Friend has raised, the non-resident parent spent some time in the armed forces and paid child maintenance regularly, through a deduction from earnings request, until he left the armed forces last year. Regrettably, the deduction from earnings request was initially issued to the wrong forces payroll and had to be reissued. The relevant service then deferred its implementation for six weeks to give the non-resident parent the opportunity to pay voluntarily. All that resulted in cumulative delays of three months, but regular payments were then maintained by the non-resident parent.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/8">Five months after he left the armed forces, the agency was able to trace him to a new civilian employer, and a deduction from earnings order was then imposed. Since he was reassessed as having a nil assessment, based on his reported low income, he has made regular contributions to his arrears through a deduction from earnings order. The agency is taking steps to improve its ability to trace non-resident parents in similar circumstances to those I describe, for example, by increasing its use of information held by the Inland Revenue.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/9">I understand that my hon. Friend has specific concerns about the arrears owed to Mrs. Paice and the amount that is regularly paid by the non-resident parent. I am also aware that Mrs. Paice believes that the non-resident parent might have sufficient means to pay some of those arrears in a lump sum. Current legislation does not enable the agency to access any lump sum payments to non-resident parents until the payments are in their possession, and only then with the authority of a court.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/10">The current deduction from earnings order has been calculated based on the information provided to the agency by the non-resident parent. However, the agency realises that the arrears arrangement will not recover the debt over a reasonable period. The agency will now ask the non-resident parent to increase the amount that he is paying towards the arrears. If that request is refused, given that the agency has already obtained a liability order for the arrears, it will swiftly explore the options for further enforcement action, such as the use of bailiffs.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/11">In the light of recent cases in which deduction from earnings orders were not effective in recovering large sums over a reasonable period, the agency to revise its internal guidance to make it clear that further enforcement action should be considered if arrears cannot be recouped sufficiently swiftly through a deduction from earnings order. The agency has been taking action to improve enforcement; for example, during 2005-06, 10,300 liability orders were granted, an increase from 7,200 in the previous year. The agency intends to build on that and deliver further improvements in line with the operational improvement plan announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-09">9 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/12">To return to the case that my hon. Friend has raised, I understand that there has been some uncertainty about the agency ceasing to pursue the non-resident parent for regular maintenance. The agency records show that on <phrase class="date" code="">4 October</phrase> last year, Mrs. Paice asked the agency to stop pursuing regular maintenance effective from <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-03">3 July 2005</phrase>, the date that one of the qualifying children went to live with the non-resident parent. Written confirmation of that closure was sent toMrs. Paice and the non-resident parent on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-08">8 November 2005</phrase>. The correspondence made it clear that that decision would cease action to pursue maintenance in respect of both the qualifying children.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/13">My hon. Friend's letter to the agency on <phrase class="date" code="">6 December</phrase> stated that Mrs. Paice did not want the case to be closed. The agency subsequently telephoned Mrs. Paice on <phrase class="date" code="">13 December</phrase> to discuss her concerns and to let her know that it would look at her case to decide whether there were sufficient grounds for a revision of the closure decision. On <phrase class="date" code="">19 December</phrase> the agency wrote to Mrs. Paice to inform her that there were not sufficient grounds for a revision, and therefore the case would remain closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/14">I asked the agency to look at the matter again and as a result it has determined to overturn the original decision to close the case. In the agency's view, upon re-examination, the records of the original telephone conversation with Mrs. Paice do not provide sufficient detail to determine whether she was invited to carry on her case in respect of her youngest child. The case will now continue as if it had never been closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/15">My hon. Friend also asked whether I think that the case has been poorly handled. I have to say that I do&mdash;I agree with him. The case has not been handled in the manner that the agency's clients should expect. The agency is currently moving from a process of complaint handling to one of client resolution. In line with that approach, and having acknowledged the errors that it has committed in respect of the case, the agency will do three things for my hon. Friend's constituent.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/16">First, it will consider whether Mrs. Paice has suffered a financial loss due to the delay in first contacting the non-resident parent after Mrs. Paice applied. If so, the agency will pay her redress to meet that loss. Secondly, in recognition of the poor handling of the case, the agency will award her a consolatory payment. Thirdly, and finally, the agency will identify the arrears that have built up as a result of its own errors and delays and will award Mrs. Paice an advance payment of those arrears.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/17">I will be happy to meet my hon. Friend and an appropriate representative of the agency to go into further detail on the personal aspects of the case. Other matters that he has raised are probably better dealt in that way rather than in a public forum. I happily extend that invitation to my hon. Friend and to others whom it would be relevant to include.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/18">The bigger question is what we should do about child support generally. This case has highlighted some possible procedural issues involving the agency, and the difficult and sensitive nature of child support. Following the review carried out by the chief executive of the agency, Stephen Geraghty, we concluded that the present child support system is incapable of delivering the outcomes that we desire for child support. The problems are not only in the operations of the agency; they are in the legislative framework that supports it&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.330.0/1">I shall begin to conclude again,Mrs. Anderson.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/2">We announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-09">9 February</phrase> that we have askedSir David Henshaw to consider the redesign of the whole child support system. In his speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham mentioned the suggestion from One Parent Families. I know that the organisation has met with Sir David, and I hope that it has put that idea to him, because it is certainly interesting. Sir David is gathering a range of ideas and will report to us later in the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/3">Stephen Geraghty's review into the operations of the agency also identified a number of areas where improvements can be made in the short to medium term. That has formed the basis of the agency's operational improvement plan, which sets out how performance in client service will be improved over the next few years. We are investing an additional&pound;120 million over the next three years to implement the plan. Of that, &pound;90 million will support the recruitment of more staff and the deployment of more agency people to client-facing processing work and enforcement activity. We will also work to improve the agency's ability to trace non-resident parents through the use of data from credit reference agencies and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. We have also set aside &pound;30 million of the investment to allow private debt collection agencies to recover over &pound;100 million more of historic debt during the period of the plan. Work has already begun to introduce the improvements, and it will continue while Sir David constructs his redesign.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/4">We know that there are problems with the child support system, but it is now time to learn the lessons from the past and to create a new system to ensure that parents meet their responsibilities to support their children and do not have to endure the shortfallof service that my hon. Friend's constituent has experienced. As we have frequently said, relationships may end, but responsibilities do not.</p>

	<p pid="a.334.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath(Mr. Foster)</phrase> on gaining this debate. As chair of the all party-jazz appreciation group, I would wish to talk to him for longer. It is clear that he does not mix with jazz musicians, because he does not understand the problems of people such as Tommy Whittle from my constituency. Now in his seventies, he still leads a group, but he was mainly known as a sideman and he relies on a constant flow of income from old recordings with the BBC orchestras and other jazz big bands to sustain him and his wife, who was a singer, in theirold age.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.0/2">I take the point that the hon. Gentleman made about culture. Many people believe that we should focus on the artist, but nothing in what he says about charging companies for an extension would encourage them to re-release. If we do not have an extension to 95 years, other companies may release and not pay the artist who made the original recording. Unless we can square that circle, Tommy Whittle, and others such as Jack Emblow, who has played in many films but has never recorded in a band of his own, and even Kathy Stobart, who played for many years and who won the parliamentary award for services to jazz last year, will receive an income from their recordings after 50 years have passed. We must consider such people, who are not the Cliff Richards of their age; they are not megastars. It is not the big companies that will suffer if the hon. Gentleman's proposal is adopted. It is the people that I have mentioned who will not continued to be paid under the extension, and they will therefore receive no money under the copyright law.</p>

	<p pid="a.334.2/1">I think that I must declare a registrable interest as a member of the Musicians' Union and PPL, although in the environment in which I trade I do not have a financial interest in the subject of the debate, because our interest in the music copyright&mdash;not the dots, but the sound recording&mdash;is time limited to five or 10 years. The interest to the musicians is the key matter. Does my hon. Friend's interesting suggestion take account of technological changes and the fact that much distribution now happens via download?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-17a.336.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1918" speakername="John Healey" speakeroffice="The Financial Secretary to the Treasury"  colnum="336"  time="017:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060517/halltext/60517h0061.htm#06051786000558">
	<p pid="a.336.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> on securing this debate. Although it is a short Adjournment debate, there is a remarkable level of interest in it, as shown by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1999" name="Michael Connarty">the interventions of my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty)</phrase>, who was unable to stay to the end of the debate, and the hon. Members for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming) and for East Devon (Mr. Swire).</p>
	<p pid="a.336.0/2">My office has not had any representations fromCliff Richard, although I hesitate to mention that because I do not want to tempt fate. If I do receive representations, I shall pass them swiftly to Andrew Gowers who will, I am sure, give them due consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.0/3">The debate has illustrated not only that there is a high and active level of interest in the subject, but that the issues at stake are extremely complex and the interests and interest groups are many and varied. In considering the issues in depth Andrew Gowers is providing an important service for the Government and the House generally, and we look forward tohis report.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.0/4">It is important to bear in mind, notwithstanding the focus of the hon. Member for Bath in his opening speech, that intellectual property rights are no longer a narrow niche issue, but an essential facet of any successful modern economy, particularly as economies are increasingly based on the quality and breadth of knowledge that they contain. Within that broader field, it is important to debate the role of copyright in the 21st century. On the broader front, our UK economy is increasingly driven by knowledge-based, intellectual property-reliant industries. The creative industries alone accounted for 7.8 per cent. of value added in the United Kingdom in 2003 and grew by 6 per cent. per annum between 1997 and 2003, which was twice the rate of growth of the economy as a whole. Overall, the creative industries were worth &pound;11.9 billion in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.0/5">In this age of a modern knowledge-based economy, the need to reward creativity while continuing to encourage the free flow of ideas is more important than ever. That is the essential balance that must be struck in policy terms. The intellectual property framework must incentivise innovation while ensuring that the public have access to that innovation. However, the world is changing rapidly&mdash;the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley alluded to this&mdash;and the existing framework is being tested by two trends.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.0/6">First, globalisation has broken down the boundaries between markets, giving rise to enforcement challenges. Secondly, digitisation has radically altered the way in which knowledge is created, disseminated and shared. Those are the principal reasons why, just before Christmas, the Chancellor invited Andrew Gowers to conduct an independent review of our intellectual property system to ensure that it is fashioned for the purposes that we require of it in this century. I am not sure that I would go as far as the hon. Member for Bath and describe parts of it as being out of touch with the modern world, but it is clear that, depending on what Andrew Gowers recommends, now is the time for a proper review of whether some aspects of it need to be overhauled.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.0/7">The roots of our concern do not lie only in the changes in the modern economy and the reasonable representations that the Government have received from a number of quarters. In our manifesto at the last election, the Labour party included a commitment to</p>
	<p pid="a.336.0/8" class="indent">&quot;modernise copyright and other forms of intellectual property so that they are appropriate for the digital age.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.336.0/9">That is the importance of the Gowers review to the Government. The call for evidence for the review prompted more than 500 responses from a wide range of interest groups, as hon. Members might have anticipated. Those carrying out the review are now analysing those responses and undertaking further research before making what we expect to be precise, practical policy recommendations. The review will report in the autumn to the Chancellor and to the Secretaries of State for Trade and Industry and for Culture, Media and Sport. I know that culture, media and sport is a policy area that the hon. Members for Bath and for East Devon follow closely from their respective Front-Bench positions.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.0/10">Today, the hon. Member for Bath has focused on one of the issues being examined in the review: the term of protection on sound recordings. As he knows, protection is harmonised across the EU and, as such, is to some extent an area of EU competence. I think that the hon. Member for East Devon made that point. Any changes in the length of protection must therefore be made through the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.0/11">The Gowers review is independent and was set up to make recommendations to the Government. As the hon. Member for Bath would expect, I am not in a position to anticipate or pre-empt what Gowers might report. The hon. Gentleman said that he hoped the report would be based on solid evidence. The Treasury is supporting the Gowers review, and in the best traditions of the Treasury we will do our best to ensure, as will Andrew Gowers, who is a distinguished journalist, that his recommendations are indeed solidly based on the evidence that he is gathering.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.0/12">The question of the length of copyright on sound recordings turns on what impact adjusting the length would have on investment, on performers and on other affected interest groups. As the hon. Member for Bath made clear, it is an extremely complex area of debate. There are conflicting needs, claims and counter-claims, which are precisely what Andrew Gowers is considering.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.0/13">The broader intellectual property system is not one of rewards or, as the hon. Gentleman put it, a pension fund for old musicians. It is one of incentives to invest and innovate; that is its importance to the economy. It must encourage new innovators to create and generate ideas in the knowledge that they will be remunerated for their endeavour. We must ensure that creators continue to be incentivised to contribute and innovate in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.0/14">It is not only the length of the copyright term that affects the remuneration of artists, but the scope of that term. In the EU, while the term is 50 years, artists also receive royalties every time their song is played in a bar, restaurant or hairdresser's. In the US, under the bars and grills exception, few such royalty payments are made. The definition of &quot;public&quot; and therefore the scope of protection of sound recordings is far broader in the EU than in the United States. The Gowers review will consider the impact of changing the length of term not only on artists and their immediate industry, buton industries that use sound recordings, such as broadcasting, tourism and internet service providers. It is vital to say again that the intellectual property system stimulates innovation and creates value across the whole economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.0/15">The crux of the debate, as the hon. Gentleman made clear in his speech, is how to strike a balance. Andrew Gowers is considering the areas that the hon. Gentleman touched upon, and I undertake to ensure that he gets a copy of this afternoon's debate. I know that he will take seriously the points that all hon. Members have made as part of his deliberations.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.0/16">Digitisation and globalisation create challenges and opportunities for our copyright regime. We need to ensure that the UK responds in the right way and the right areas. By doing so, we can sustain the success that our economy enjoys in the globalising and increasingly knowledge-based economy. It is not just the Chancellor and I who are looking forward to the recommendations of the Gowers review; the level of House interest in this short debate this afternoon demonstrates that the recommendations that Andrew Gowers comes up with will be keenly awaited and, I am sure, keenly debated when he publishes them.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.0/17">I hope that we will be able to return to this debate, because in many parts of the House, there is clearly an interest in doing so. I had expected a contribution representing the views of the Musicians Union, but I did not expect that we would also hear the views of the all-party jazz appreciation group. Clearly, a number of Members with interests in the area will also be looking forward to Andrew Gowers' report when we finally publish it.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.0/18" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.0/19" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at eleven minutes past Five o'clock.</p>
