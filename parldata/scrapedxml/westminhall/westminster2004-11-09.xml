	<p pid=".173.3/1">During October, we witnessed another successful breast cancer awareness month. That campaign, which is now in its 11th year, raises at least &pound;10 million annually, and it has helped many of those suffering from breast cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".173.3/2">As a joint chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on breast cancer, I am delighted to have the opportunity this morning to initiate a debate on the primary prevention of breast cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".173.3/3">The latest figures from Cancer Research UK indicate that a woman's lifetime risk of suffering breast cancer rose between 1995 and 2001 from one in 12 to one in nine. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK; there has been a steady rise in new cases per year&mdash;from 21,446 new cases in 1979, to 34,824 in 1998 and 40,989 in 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".173.4/1">I thank the hon. Lady for allowing us to debate such an important issue; the work being done on breast cancer is similar to   that on many other cancers. However, it is an international problem. In the United States, 192,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer were diagnosed in 2001, and about 50,000 women died of the disease in that year. It is a serious problem. Does the hon. Lady agree that we could play a leading role in an international movement to tackle the disease?</p>

	<p pid=".173.5/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. He is right to say that it is a worldwide problem, and I fully agree that the United Kingdom could take a lead in the fight against this terrible disease.</p>
	<p pid=".173.5/2">Breast cancer is currently the most common cancer among women in the UK. Unfortunately, more than 40,000 women are diagnosed with this devastating disease each year, and more than 1,000 women die from it every month. The incidence of breast cancer in the UK continues to rise year on year. However, we should remember that better detection of the disease through the NHS breast screening programme and better breast awareness among women has contributed to that rise.</p>

	<p pid=".173.6/1">I, too, congratulate the hon. Lady on gaining this debate. We obviously welcome the extension of screening to older women, but when I raised the issue last year, I mentioned the need to reduce the age limit from 45, perhaps to 40, to allow the screening of younger women. There is an increase in the number of younger women suffering from the disease, and earlier screening might allow for more successful treatment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.173.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1197" speakername="Marion Roe" colnum="173"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h01.htm#41109h01_spnew4">
	<p pid=".173.7/1">More and more younger women are being diagnosed with breast cancer. The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, and I am sure that the Minister will have noted it.</p>
	<p pid=".173.7/2">Breast cancer is a complex disease, and we do not yet fully understand what causes it. Scientific evidence indicates that breast cancer is caused by a complex mixture of factors, some to do with lifestyle, some to do with environmental factors, and some genetic&mdash;in   other words, inherited. Those factors act at many different stages of life, probably starting before birth   and continuing to the menopause and beyond. Unfortunately, we do not yet know how to prevent breast cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".173.7/3">Professor Jack Cuzick, the head of Cancer Research UK's epidemiology, mathematics and statistics department at the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine in London, has stated:</p>
	<p pid=".173.7/4" class="indent">&quot;We need to do more to understand the risk factors and develop preventative strategies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".173.7/5">Several established risk factors have been identified, including age, gender and pregnancy. The biggest risk factor for women is age, and as a woman gets older, her risk of getting breast cancer increases. More than 80 per cent. of all breast cancer cases in the UK involve women over the age of 50. Unfortunately, most of the established risk factors, such as age, are outside our control.</p>
	<p pid=".173.7/6">However, women could do something about other risk factors, such as alcohol intake. In a recent survey carried out for Breakthrough Breast Cancer, for example, only 7 per cent. of the women surveyed were aware of any link between alcohol and breast cancer. However, an intake of 1 unit of alcohol daily is estimated to result in one extra case of breast cancer among every 100 women who drink, compared with 100   women who do not drink at all. Based on that information, more than half the women surveyed by Breakthrough Breast Cancer said that they would be willing to limit their alcohol intake or to stop drinking completely to reduce their risk of breast cancer. That example highlights the importance of public education and public awareness of breast cancer risk factors. Based on such information, women can make informed choices about their lifestyles.</p>
	<p pid=".173.7/7">If breast cancer is to be prevented, its causes must be found. Studies are currently taking place to investigate some of those causes. The Breakthrough Generations study, for example, was launched in September. It will investigate the causes of breast cancer, and in particular gain information about those causes that might be prevented. It will be the largest study of its kind in the world and will cover more than 100,000 women in the UK. It will continue to give information for the next 40 to 50 years, although the first results will be available within the first few years of the study. Similarly, the Long Island breast cancer study project is a multi-study effort to investigate whether environmental factors are responsible for breast cancer in particular areas of America.</p>
	<p pid=".173.7/8">Every day, we are all exposed to many different chemicals through our diet, our lifestyle and the environment. Before we can conclusively determine what factors, other than better detection, are contributing to the increasing incidence of breast cancer, we must carry out further in-depth and robust research. The National Cancer Research Institute analysis of cancer research funding in the UK revealed that only 2 per cent. is spent on prevention.</p>
	<p pid=".173.7/9">Although the incidence of breast cancer is increasing, the good news is that the number of people dying from   the disease is decreasing, and more women are surviving than ever before. That is partly due to the NHS breast screening programme. As we do not know how to prevent breast cancer, it is important that all women between the ages of 50 and 69 attend their appointments. Most cancers picked up by screening are at an early stage, with five-year survival rates of more than 90 per cent. The World Health Organisation's International Agency for Research on Cancer recently identified a 35 per cent. reduction in mortality from breast cancer among screened women aged between 50 and 69, which may go some way to explaining the dramatic 22 per cent. fall in breast cancer mortality rates in the United Kingdom in the 10 years between 1990 and 1999. More than 1 million women are screened every year in the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".175.0/1">I agree with the hon. Lady that early detection is important for the prevention and successful treatment of breast cancer. Does she feel that the breast-screening programme for women between 50 and 60 can be impeded by the acknowledged shortage of radiologists, which has delayed screening programmes around the country?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.175.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1197" speakername="Marion Roe" colnum="175"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h01.htm#41109h01_spnew6">
	<p pid=".175.1/1">I again take the hon. Gentleman's point and I am sure that the Minister has listened to his important contribution.</p>
	<p pid=".175.1/2">Bearing in mind the importance of the NHS screening programme and the fundamental role that it plays in early diagnosis and, therefore, better prognosis, we should be concerned that not all women are attending their screening appointments. The recent report by the all-party group on breast cancer, entitled &quot;Early Detection Saves Lives: Tackling Inequalities in Breast Screening&quot;, found that one in six women not attending screening said that it was because the appointment given to them was not convenient. They cancelled and never rearranged another time. Indeed, in some areas of the country, the uptake of screening falls far short of the programme's 70 per cent. target. For example, in one part of London, the take-up rate was only 51 per cent.&mdash;19 per cent. below the target rate.</p>
	<p pid=".175.1/3">As a result of the all-party group's report, we are calling on the Secretary of State for Health to encourage screening services to make local changes and increase the choice of when and where women can be screened, including considering the possibility of screening women in units outside their local breast-screening service catchment area&mdash;for example, nearer to their place of work. We also call on the Secretary of State to put renewed efforts and resources into public education to promote the importance of attending breast-screening appointments, and to help make people more aware of the common signs and symptoms of cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".175.1/4">At the moment, we do not have enough information or the means to prevent breast cancer. However, our growing knowledge of breast cancer risk factors means that we may be able to reduce the risk of developing the disease. More research and better public education about the risk factors are needed. In the meantime, since we do not know how to prevent breast cancer, it is important that women over 50 years of age attend their screening appointments and that women of all ages are breast aware. Being breast aware and having regular mammograms will not prevent women developing breast cancer, but may help them to find it early when it is more likely to be successfully treated.</p>
	<p pid=".175.1/5">I want to raise another preventive measure. Last night, many parliamentary colleagues and I attended a reception in the House of Commons organised by Macmillan Cancer Relief to promote its campaign to obtain a better deal for people with cancer&mdash;that is to say, to prevent cancer spreading to people's finances. Macmillan claims that cancer patients tell it that they suffer financial hardship as a result of having cancer. More than three quarters of people that it surveyed said that they ran up extra bills, and, for most people affected by cancer, money worries are second only to pain as a cause of stress. However, the disability living allowance and attendance allowance, which should ease the burden for many patients, are designed for long-term conditions. We all know that cancer is different, because the debilitating effects of treatment are frequently immediate and drastic. The sudden extra costs, such as travel for treatment, hospital car parking and heating, can be equally drastic, and generate an urgent need for benefit support.</p>
	<p pid=".175.1/6">What action is being taken to arrest the rising incidence of breast cancer in the United Kingdom? What action is being taken to identify the various risk factors for breast cancer and to understand how they affect the risk of breast cancer? What support are the    Government giving to breast cancer research, particularly to the causes and possible prevention of breast cancer? Will the forthcoming public health White Paper specifically address the issue of breast cancer incidence and risk? What public health policies do the Government propose to adopt to address the rising incidence of breast cancer and to improve public education about and awareness of breast cancer and its risks?</p>
	<p pid=".175.1/7">As many of the risk factors, such as age, are not within the control of any woman, does the Minister agree that it is particularly important that we educate women about risk factors such as alcohol intake and post-menopausal obesity that are within their control so that they can do something about them? How do the Government propose to improve public understanding of those risk factors? What action have the Government taken to increase the uptake of the NHS breast-screening programme, particularly in areas of low uptake and in social groups, such as minority ethnic groups, in which uptake is below the average? What are the Government doing to promote a co-ordinated and joined-up approach to breast cancer research and prevention that involves all relevant agencies, and what are they doing to ensure that every cancer patient is offered specialist benefits advice when diagnosed? Finally, what are the Government doing to improve cancer patients' access to the disability living allowance and attendance allowance? I look forward to the Minister's replies.</p>

	<p pid=".177.1/1">Order. Before I call <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/911" name="Ian Gibson">the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase>, I advise the Chamber that the hon. Gentleman has told me that he will have to leave the debate early. We all understand why.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.177.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/911" speakername="Ian Gibson" colnum="177"  time="09:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h01.htm#41109h01_spnew9">
	<p pid=".177.2/1">I apologise for having to leave the debate early, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but I have a constituency appointment at 10 am.</p>
	<p pid=".177.2/2">It is a delight to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1197" name="Marion Roe">the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Dame Marion Roe)</phrase> and her erudite exposition of the risk factors of breast cancer and what we should be doing about them. I congratulate her particularly on highlighting the Macmillan campaign event, which I had the pleasure of hosting last night. It was a brilliant event attended by many people, and is another great initiative in our development of cancer services, which have been improving in this country since 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".177.2/3">We all realise that the work never stops. We must continue to make improvements until we eliminate the   sad incidence of breast cancer, which continues to   increase, unlike death rates, many of which the Government have brilliantly turned around. I will not quote the figures, but I will say that I spend a fair bit of time talking to people about breast cancer on Capitol Hill. They are a fearsome bunch. It must be like playing against Thierry Henry of Arsenal. They are brilliant at advancing their arguments, and the breast cancer lobby groups in this country&mdash;the hon. Lady is a member of a prominent one in this place&mdash;have played a major part and have moved the debate forward. The Government have reacted to that in many ways.</p>
	<p pid=".177.2/4">It is agreed in the United States that it should be the goal of medicine to detect breast cancer early and to provide a possible cure. Breast cancer prevention strategies in this country and the States have been developed recently to include a comprehensive breast cancer screening programme, which I agree we should broaden to include risk assessment as well as breast examination and screening mammography. This is a new concept. The hon. Lady described all the risk factors of various degrees. There is a nine-point programme in the States now and one could argue that perhaps every woman, of whatever age, should have this risk assessment.</p>
	<p pid=".177.2/5">There is a high incidence of breast cancers caused by genetic factors&mdash;some 10 per cent, possibly more. As more genes are discovered we may find that it is more complicated and that genes form the basis. Risk assessment is a way to decide whether better scrutiny, such as every six months or every year, is needed. We need to grasp this nettle. It is a new concept that the Americans have taken on strongly because of the lobby and the interest it has generated.</p>
	<p pid=".177.2/6">Incidentally, men get breast cancer too. It is a low incidence, but because men do not present as well as   women to the medical profession, many are not diagnosed until a late stage. We should remember that. Men must not feel that they are immune. It happens to a reasonable number of men. Who knows what causes it. Very little work has been done on this. The breast cancer screening guidelines can be applied to the population in general, but patients at this increased risk should be identified through risk assessment.</p>
	<p pid=".177.2/7">For those at risk, screening, mammography and proven prevention strategies can be individualised according to the level of risk. There is the most intense debate about how screening should be done, when and how often. I would not like to count the number of times that I have been at conferences debating the issue. Results often conflict. It is difficult to get information. The Swedes say, &quot;Yes, if you do it here it works.&quot; Someone else in Britain will say, &quot;No, it does not work.&quot; We have to find this out. We know that we do not know all the answers, but we certainly know how to handle some of the problems that we have at this stage.</p>
	<p pid=".177.2/8">There will be really big technological developments and advancements in digital mammography. The Government have put in many scanning machines. The technology is moving almost faster than the machines can be put into the district hospitals. We have to encourage that. It will improve the accuracy of the screening method and, I think, reduce breast cancer mortality. The implementation and further development of breast cancer prevention strategies give us hope that the reduction in the incidence of breast cancer may be within reach and may happen within some of our lifetimes. We should be heartened by the political dimension and its interest, but we must continue to press   on this issue and keep it high on the agenda in medical practice. I finish by congratulating the hon. Lady once again.</p>

	<p pid=".178.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1197" name="Marion Roe">the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Dame Marion Roe)</phrase> on securing this important debate. It is just over a year since the last debate. Sadly, there are not quite so many people here today as I would have hoped, but it is first thing in the morning and the morning after a significant event for my party&mdash;our annual dinner.</p>
	<p pid=".178.0/2">The hon. Lady has once again established the seriousness of this issue. Were it not so serious, one would think it amazing that more money was not being spent on research into the prevention of breast cancer. She said that 2 per cent. of the research money is spent on prevention. This is something that affects 40,000 women and 300 men a year. We are talking about a large section of the population, because families and friends are affected too. This is a scourge on modern life. We do not know enough about it to understand why it happens.</p>
	<p pid=".178.0/3">I imagine that few people do not have direct experience of breast cancer in their family or their circle of close friends. Those of us with such experience want our children and grandchildren to know what to do to avoid the very high risk that exists currently.</p>
	<p pid=".178.0/4">I want to dwell specifically on prevention. The primary prevention of breast cancer depends on two things&mdash;a real knowledge of the associated risk factors, based on hard evidence and research and, as the hon. Lady said, education so that young and old have the information necessary to make rational choices about the factors that they can change. We know that breast cancer occurs as a result of complex interactions between genes, lifestyle and environmental factors, but we are finding it difficult to separate those   issues out, because we simply do not have the body of research evidence that will give us the necessary information.</p>
	<p pid=".178.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/911" name="Ian Gibson">The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> reported that Cancer Research UK has said that we must do more to establish the risk factors. That is absolutely right; 2 per cent. as a proportion of what is spent on research is simply not enough.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.179.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/911" speakername="Ian Gibson" colnum="179"  time="09:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h01.htm#41109h01_spnew11">
	<p pid=".179.0/1">Does the hon. Lady agree with me that the Americans are taking knowledge about cancer to the next level? The National Cancer Institute has developed a risk assessment tool, which is on a website. Using nine factors, it can estimate for anyone the risk of developing breast cancer over five years or a lifetime. Whatever the risk factors are currently, we should plug that information into the equation, which would enable us to see that some people are more at risk than others. That tool seems to provide an accurate reflection of what happens, and we should pick it up. It is great in America; it is possible to find everything to do with cancer on websites there. We should develop that risk assessment technology now.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.179.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/776" speakername="Patsy Calton" colnum="179"  time="09:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h01.htm#41109h01_spnew12">
	<p pid=".179.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, because I was about to mention that risk assessment tool. It is one of a battery of tools that can be used to assess someone's risk at, say, age 20, 15 or whatever age. Once people have some knowledge of   their risk, they can modify the factors that might contribute to it. Obviously, I am talking about the things that they can alter. Clearly, as we have said, age and gender cannot be altered. Those things are part of us and we have to accept that. However, it is very important that people have information about the risks to which they are exposed and that they can do whatever it is possible to do to minimise those risks, if they choose to do so. Personal choice comes into this; people will make their own decisions.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/2">We have heard that one unit of alcohol a day increases the risk of breast cancer by 6 per cent. and 2 units a day increases the risk by 12 per cent. It would be pretty rare for people in our society to say, &quot;Well, that means I   won't drink at all.&quot; If people wanted to remove the risk, they would be talking about not drinking at all. People will make individual choices about what they intend to do, based on the risk factors that they know about. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we need the risk assessment tool as one of an armoury of tools, but it will not replace the need for fundamental research. The needs have been identified and the money needs to be spent.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/3">We have talked about age. As the hon. Member for Broxbourne said, the one thing that we can do about age   is to attend screening. However, some groups are difficult to reach and do not, for whatever reason, attend screening. The all-party breast cancer group's report clearly pointed out that a high number of women said that it was not convenient to attend screening. There has been passing comment on some women's concern that they will experience pain when they have the test. It would be wrong for us to assume that women's fear of   the pain involved is irrational, as some women undoubtedly experience pain. It would be useful if the Minister reflected on what could be done to minimise the pain that some women definitely experience with mammography through a change in technique, and to find out whether pain is caused by the technique or by something in the woman concerned, for example her cycle.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/4">It is fairly common among the women to whom I   spoke to experience pain&mdash;sometimes severe&mdash;when the mammogram is taken. That sort of information passes around women like a piece of folklore. It is not good enough simply to say that it does not happen, or that it need not be taken into account; it should seriously be taken into account. Some women may say that it is inconvenient to go for a mammogram, and may not give   it top priority, when really they are worried about experiencing pain. It would be interesting to see   how many women will not return for a second mammogram&mdash;not when something has been found to be wrong, but in the normal course of events&mdash;if they experienced considerable discomfort the first time. That problem needs to be addressed. It is not enough simply to pass it off as one of those things. Some women experience quite severe pain.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/5">We have discussed the gender issue. We have not talked much about family history. We know that small numbers of breast cancer cases run in families, and we think that about 5 per cent. of cases are due to changes in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. It is possible that cancer generally, breast cancer included, is caused by other genetic problems, and that some families' and people's immune systems have an inability to deal with cancer. General research in that area may give the most benefit, because if we can identify why some families experience cancer more often, we may be able to find some way of preventing it, or of boosting the immune system so that cancers do not take hold.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/6">There is little that anyone can do about early periods or late menopause&mdash;they happen in the natural course of things&mdash;but there is some indication that they are associated with increased rates of breast cancer, probably due to an increased lifetime exposure to oestrogen. However, there is an issue with early periods, because they occur in girls who are heavier than average. If work can be done to prevent young women from becoming obese in their early years, there is a strong possibility that the onset of their periods will be held off for a little longer.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/7">The association with height is also complex, but women over 5 ft 9 in are more likely to get breast cancer. That seems a bit unfortunate, and there is little that they can do about it, but there is a range of established risk factors about which something can be done. Pregnancy is one such factor. In this society, we generally frown upon and are concerned about early pregnancy, particularly teenage pregnancy. Most of us want our children, and other children, to wait until their 20s before their first pregnancy, but a pregnancy before the age of 20 seems to be protective. That is an indication that sometimes such matters are not as black and white   as society believes. Perhaps we should be more careful about being so condemnatory of people who have children at a younger age&mdash;they may save the country a great deal of money, if they do not get breast cancer at a later stage.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/8">The other worry is that women have an increased risk if they have their first child at over 30 or if they do not have children. That is a matter for women to take into consideration when they are looking at their range of risk factors. Perhaps if women applied the risk factors mentioned by the hon. Member for Norwich, North, they would not delay having children until they were in their 40s or late 30s. Women need to be able to take those issues into consideration. Many women and their families have not had that information, and so have not been able to take those issues into account.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/9">We know that breast feeding for more than a year in total reduces risk. I know that the Government have done considerable work, particularly through the Sure Start programme, in trying to encourage breast feeding. We know that breast feeding is best for children, but society still has a tendency to regard it as unnatural and to imply that it should not take place. We need to do a great deal more to educate the public that breast feeding is good not only for babies but for mothers, and that mothers who breast feed for at least a year in their lives reduce their risk of breast cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/10">The Million Women study reported recently on the effects of hormone replacement therapy. We now know that there is an increased risk of breast cancer with HRT, particularly with the combined oestrogen and progesterone drug, and if the drug is taken over long periods. GPs and their patients are talking about that matter in a considered way, to try to minimise women's risk. There is an indication that once women come off HRT, their risk is lowered within a few years. However, it is important that women are aware, before they engage in HRT, of the effects that it might have.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/11">Similarly, we know that there is a slightly increased risk for women who take the pill. We are told that 10 years after stopping taking the pill, that risk disappears. Women need to know that they increase their risk if they take the pill. Those factors all build up.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/12">Women's weight is a major issue. Women who are overweight, particularly after the menopause, are more likely to get breast cancer. It is thought that that happens because fat tissue is the primary source of oestrogen after the menopause. Therefore, the more fat women carry, the more oestrogen they will produce, and the greater risk they will have of getting breast cancer. If weight gain can be minimised, women have more chance, in those circumstances, of reducing their breast cancer risk.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/13">There is another issue. We cannot isolate breast cancer from everything else. Breast cancer is linked to a    range of other diseases. Obesity appears to be associated with a variety of health problems, including heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis and several other cancers. Persuading women to reduce their weight or to keep it within normal bounds will reduce their risk not only of contracting breast cancer but of developing a variety of other health problems. Women who are high risk for breast cancer or who have breast cancer, possibly because they are overweight, are also high risk for those other factors. That needs to be taken into consideration.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/14">The alcohol issue is very important indeed. As an aside, whenever my younger daughter tells me that she is going out for the evening, my standard text message back to her&mdash;we text each other, as mothers and daughters do these days&mdash;is &quot;Think of your long-term health.&quot; She sends a text message back to me saying, &quot;Yes, all right, don't worry.&quot; I ask her to be aware that she needs to minimise her alcohol intake and should not go along with the craze for binge drinking, which appears almost to be the norm.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/15">I have recently been concerned about local papers in my area showing pictures of young people who are clearly under the influence of alcohol enjoying themselves. There is nothing wrong with people enjoying themselves, but it is worrying when newspapers make it look as if being over the limit in alcohol and indulging in what most of us would call binge drinking is the norm. Society needs to do more about reducing the tolerance of binge drinking.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/16">We know that radiotherapy can increase the risk of breast cancer. There are some treatments for which a balance of risk factors has to be taken into account. Hodgkin's lymphoma treatment leads to increased risk of breast cancer, because of the site of the radiation therapy. However, if people did not have that radiation therapy, they would be at greater risk from Hodgkin's lymphoma. Those things have to be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/17">There are strong suspicions that diet and exercise are inextricably linked with the risk of breast cancer, but we simply do not know enough yet about how they affect it. More work needs to be done on that. Work has been done on diet and exercise separately; indeed, I myself was a subject in a study of diet. There is no clear link between diet and exercise and breast cancer. However, because the issue is complicated and because modifying behaviour seems a likely avenue if the two are in fact implicated, it is important that more research should be done, so that we can iron out some of the conflicts in the existing research.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/18">We are absolutely certain for other reasons, however, that eating a healthy diet rich in fruit, vegetables and whole grains, is good for a range of other things, particularly maintaining lower body weight. Although it is difficult to separate diet and exercise, we know that controlling diet and exercising are important for other health reasons. People are likely to be leaner if they exercise regularly. As somebody who exercises regularly and struggles hugely with her weight, I sometimes think about such things with a wry smile and ask myself, &quot;How much do I have to do to get my weight down?&quot; Well, I can tell the Chamber that it is necessary to do enough training for the London marathon. Weight goes down once exercise gets up to about 25 miles a week; below that, it does not go down particularly.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/19">A further factor, which has not had enough exploration, is exposure to low-dose radiation. Cancer Research UK is doing a great deal of work on mapping the incidence of cancer across the country. I would like research to be done into the effects of low-dose radiation in those areas of the country where background radiation is higher than average. I am thinking of parts of the south-west, where the main rock is granite, a relatively new rock that gives off more radiation. It would be useful to know whether there was a higher incidence of breast cancer in those areas. It is difficult to know precisely what anyone would do about it, but it would be useful to have an understanding of whether high radiation levels cause that difficulty.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/20">We do not know about telecommunications masts yet, or about in vitro fertilisation treatment&mdash;although studies so far show that that there is no increased risk. We do not know about the impact of stress, although if one talks to people who have had breast cancer they often identify a major stress event in the previous two years, either in their family or affecting them personally. A major stress event could involve the death of someone close, or something else that is really serious; it does not refer to general levels of stress. I think that most of the work that has been done has looked at the background stress that most of us feel as we go about our day-to-day lives; I am talking about the major life events that cause massive stress. We could do with more work on those.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/21">There is some research into exposure to light at night. People who sleep with the light on, it is thought, produce rather less melatonin, and because of that they are more likely to end up with cancers. That is the theory. We need more research into that, because it would be very simple to ensure that one never slept with the light on. That would be something that every one of us could do. Melatonin, we believe, may suppress the growth of breast cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/22">We do not know enough yet about childhood risk factors. The hon. Member for Broxbourne made quite a lot of comments about concerns that breast cancer may start in childhood or even earlier, in the womb. Some research indicates that factors in the womb have an effect.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/23">We do not know enough about ethnicity yet. We know that breast cancer is a worldwide problem and that it affects some populations more than others, but we do not know enough about that.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/24">I make a plea that the newspapers and media are a little more responsible when it comes to parading some of the risk factors. I sometimes wonder where they pluck them from. They suggest that underwired bras could increase the risk, which does not seem to have any research foundation, or that bumps or bruises to the breast, breast implants, abortions, deodorants and anti-perspirants could do so. Research does not show that, but sometimes the media get hold of a piece of research, parade a great headline and frighten people with issues that have not been shown definitively to cause an increased risk.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/25">We do not know about smoking&mdash;there have been differences of view about that&mdash;or about chemicals that people come into contact with in their environment. We do not know about pesticides. There is a tendency to think that because everybody is exposed to so many chemicals and trace chemicals, we can do nothing about it. I do not agree with that. I was a chemistry teacher. I   taught in a school in which, within a fairly short period, something like half the women had a breast lump&mdash;a breast cancer&mdash;that had to be removed. Clearly, that may just have been an isolated cluster. When people asked me what my occupation was, I did not write just &quot;teacher&quot;, but &quot;chemistry teacher&quot;, because a chemistry teacher will have a very different exposure to chemicals. It is important that such issues are looked into.</p>
	<p pid=".179.1/26">Once again, I congratulate the hon. Lady. She has again brought this important issue to the attention of the Chamber. I do not think that   it will go away in the immediate future. I hope that we will see a turnaround in the dreadful figures of 40,000 women and 300 men affected every year, and that that work will be done with some speed. I look forward to the public health White Paper, because I hope that it will address some of those issues in the round, perhaps not just for breast cancer but for women's health&mdash;and men's health&mdash;in general.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.184.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/715" speakername="John Baron" colnum="184"  time="10:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h01.htm#41109h01_spnew13">
	<p pid=".184.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1197" name="Marion Roe">my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne (Dame Marion Roe)</phrase> on yet again securing an important debate on this issue; I thank her for doing so, and for all her work on the matter, which is recognised by hon. Members on both sides of the House. I thank other hon. Members, too, for their interesting contributions.</p>
	<p pid=".184.0/2">The importance of the debate can be clearly illustrated by the statistics. One in nine women will, as we have heard, develop breast cancer at some point in their lives, and 41,000 cases are diagnosed each year according to the latest figures, and that includes 300 men. Something like 13,000 deaths a year are caused by breast cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".184.0/3">It is unusual in some respects to talk about primary prevention strategies in the context of breast cancer. All the major risk factors, such as age, genetic code, endogenous hormone levels, late age at menopause and late age at first pregnancy, are not in any way modifiable through traditional intervention strategies. Meanwhile, drugs that have proved to prevent breast cancer or to have some effect are also of limited use, given their side-effect profile. It has been clearly shown, for example, that tamoxifen reduces the incidence of breast cancer by something like 6 to 8 per cent., but it produces bad side effects, which rules it out of a responsible prevention strategy.</p>

	<p pid=".184.1/1">Perhaps we should mention that although tamoxifen is useful for women with the potential for oestrogen-positive tumours, or who have had such tumours, it is not of value for anyone whose tumour is not of that kind.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.184.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/715" speakername="John Baron" colnum="184"  time="10:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h01.htm#41109h01_spnew15">
	<p pid=".184.2/1">I accept that, but it is still relevant to the issue of breast cancer generally, and breast cancer prevention; as I have said, side effects have ruled it out of any responsible prevention strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/2">Several factors are modifiable through intervention, as my hon. Friend mentioned. One of those is diet. The NHS cancer plan rightly focuses on tackling cancer by reducing the number of people who smoke and promoting a healthier diet through initiatives such as the five-a-day programme. There is strong evidence to suggest that because people have taken more care with their diet over time and have become more knowledgeable about cancer in general, cancer death rates have fallen.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/3">The Government make great claims about the 10 per cent. fall in cancer mortality rates since 1997&mdash;which is right&mdash;but those declines are part of a longer-term trend not only in this country but on the continent, for example. Under Conservative Governments, between 1990 and 1997, cancer mortality rates also declined by 10 per cent. It is important to recognise that those welcome figures are part of longer-term declines.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/4">There is no doubt that initiatives such as five-a-day are a step in the right direction, but the Government's record on matters such as obesity and drinking has been   quite poor overall. Figures from the Health Committee's report on obesity this year found that between 2000 and 2002 the proportion of women who were obese or morbidly obese increased by 7 per cent. I am sure that the Minister will be aware that if present trends continue, one quarter of the population will be obese by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/5">The biggest failure in tackling obesity&mdash;this is relevant to all developed countries, not just this one&mdash;is the absence of a co-ordinated programme accommodating individual and public health approaches to the problem. The net effect of the anti-obesity drive, whether in this country or other developed countries, has been the introduction of a wide variety of individual treatment and prevention programmes, the published success rates of which have been disappointing overall.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/6">Those concerns are reflected in current Government policy. As the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1000" name="Melanie Johnson">the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Miss Johnson)</phrase> told the <i>Health Service Journal</i> last year:</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/7" class="indent">&quot;We have a 'five-a-day' programme, the schools' fruit scheme. I'm not sure you need a strategy because we are talking about some very simple messages&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/8">I suggest that that approach is wrong. Indeed, the Health Committee's report highlighted the naivety of approaching obesity in such a simplistic manner. It said:</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/9" class="indent">&quot;The causes of obesity are diverse, complex and, in the main, underpinned by what are now entrenched societal norms. They are problems for which . . . no one simple solution exists.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/10">Drinking is another matter on which the Government's record could be better. It is a shocking trend that the number of women drinking above recommended guidelines&mdash;35 units a week&mdash;has risen by more than half during the last 15 years, although I accept that that has taken place not only in very recent years. Breakthrough Breast Cancer believes that, as my hon. Friend mentioned, drinking on average one extra unit of alcohol a day increases a woman's risk of breast cancer by about 6 per cent. and the risk increases by a further 6 per cent. for each additional unit of alcohol consumed on a daily basis.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/11">The important message is that the Government must do far more to make people aware of how many units they drink and that they should drink in moderation. What is needed from the Government, as a matter of urgency, is the implementation of an integrated and co-ordinated wide-ranging programme of solutions to tackle these issues.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/12">We hope that the White Paper on public health, which will be published next week, although it was due in the summer, will tackle these matters. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us an early indication of   what is in that White Paper, because the approach to   the issue so far has been disappointing&mdash;indeed, its   approach has been described as &quot;dilatory and disgracefully complacent&quot; and a &quot;calamity&quot; by the BMA as recently as last month.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/13">The Government's failures on obesity and alcohol illustrate perfectly why public health should rest not in the hands of a junior Minister but with the Secretary of State. Public health challenges need to be recognised and tackled at the highest levels across Government, through a broad, population-based programme that aims to change behaviour at a collective environmental level. My colleague Lord Foster's HIV/AIDS campaign is an example of how public health challenges should be tackled.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/14">The Minister should consider our proposal to establish a public health commission&mdash;an independent body with a similar role in public health to that of the National Audit Office. Its functions would be to gather evidence, publish reports and make recommendations to Government and Parliament. The commission would ensure that there was a research-effective, evidence-based approach to the matter, which would help to form public health policies.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/15">Meanwhile, we would establish public health directors to work at city or county levels, as there is evidence to suggest that PCTs are too small to carry out population-based interventions to safeguard public health. In addition, we would instruct the National Institute for Clinical Excellence to include in its future work programme reviews of public health measures&mdash;for example, in the provision of alcohol clinics and drug therapies for the morbidly obese.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/16">I look forward to hearing from the Minister how the Government will improve their performance on the issue, as there is little doubt that there is a lack of a co-ordinated approach to public health. We sincerely hope that the White Paper will focus on the necessary answers.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/17">Other hon. Members have rightly focused on the importance of screening. As we still know so little about the causes of breast cancer, it is vital that the UK has adequate screening and surveillance programmes in place to aid early detection, which we know saves lives. I hope that the NHS breast-screening programme will continue to be rolled out; NICE guidance published this year recommended that women between the ages of 40 and 49 with a high family risk of breast cancer should be screened annually. I would welcome the Minister's assessment of the extent to which that guidance has been implemented nationally.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/18">As my hon. Friend said, research published last month by Breakthrough Breast Cancer and the all-party group on breast cancer found that, in some areas only about half the women who should be screened were going for screening&mdash;20 per cent. below the 70 per cent. target among that group. The report also revealed that one in six women who did not take up their breast screening appointment said that that was because it was not convenient. In addition, as the Minister will be aware, the National Audit Office found this year that women from lower socio-economic groups and ethnic minorities were less likely to attend screening appointments.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/19">The Conservative party fully supports the all-party group and Breakthrough in calling on the Health Secretary to investigate ways of making the screening service more flexible and accessible to the women it was set up to serve and to put renewed effort into promoting public education and the importance of attending appointments and making people more aware of the common signs and symptoms of breast cancer. We all know that making women more aware of the importance of screening is, in a way, primary prevention and that the earlier breast cancer is detected, the better the chances of survival. I therefore look forward to hearing what the Government propose to do to address the action points raised by the all-party group and Breakthrough on this important issue.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/20">I want to leave the Minister plenty of time to wind up, so let me briefly add a few words to those of my hon. Friend and other hon. Members about the Macmillan reception yesterday evening. The event tried to focus on something that is almost a crime&mdash;the fact that many cancer patients are simply not accessing the disability living allowance or attendance allowance to which they are entitled. Something like half of all cancer patients who die&mdash;I think this statistic is accurate&mdash;did not receive DLA or AA, to which they were entitled. I would therefore endorse a good number of Macmillan's recommendations, including that all cancer patients should be made aware at diagnosis of the benefits to which they are entitled. That would be a useful way of ensuring that they access those benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/21">At the moment, about &pound;126 million of benefits are unclaimed, and I ask the Minister to address the issue, because there appears to be a lack of co-ordination between the various Departments. Many cancer patients are falling between Departments and suffering as a result. As my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne said, people at such a crucial time in their lives, who are having to deal with cancer, should not have to contend with financial stresses.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/22">We all want to improve the primary prevention of breast cancer and the treatment of cancer patients generally. I would be the first to acknowledge&mdash;it would be churlish not to&mdash;that the Government have made improvements in the provision of cancer services and treatment. However, given the money that has been invested in the NHS, not enough of those improvements have shown up in front-line services&mdash;a lot of the money simply is not reaching them.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/23">Many services need urgent attention. There is strong evidence that radiotherapy waiting times are deteriorating badly, and the situation is not helped by &quot;Agenda for Change&quot;, which has alienated many radiographers, who will be meeting this Saturday to express their opposition to the changes proposed under it.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/24">We know of the referral lottery, which has, to a certain extent, been created by the Government and    their two-week target, under which nearly 10,000 women are routinely referred and subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer. That places GPs in a difficult position, because they are not necessarily best placed to decide what is a routine and what is an urgent referral. We also know about the postcode lottery, which leads to wide disparities across the country in terms of access to cancer drugs such as Herceptin. That is another failing that must be addressed.</p>
	<p pid=".184.2/25">Having pointed out those failures, it would be wrong not to return to this morning's discussion and focus on the Government's failures with regard to primary prevention and care. The Government are failing to provide a comprehensive and co-ordinated public health agenda. They are failing to get across the importance of screening and to create a more flexible system of appointments. They are also failing to make sure that benefits are available to cancer sufferers who are entitled to them. I ask the Minister to address those issues in his response.</p>

	<p pid=".188.0/1">May I join others in warmly congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1197" name="Marion Roe">the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Dame Marion Roe)</phrase> on calling for this debate and drawing the attention of the House to what we all accept is an important issue affecting tens of thousands of women and many families in this country? All hon. Members who have spoken have made thoughtful and balanced contributions. The focus has been on prevention and I shall deal with that in my remarks.</p>
	<p pid=".188.0/2">It is a fact of life that many issues divide this House along party political lines. We are all grown up and we accept that&mdash;it is partly why we are here. However, breast cancer should not be such an issue. We all have a perspective and we share the general view that we must continue to improve the range of services deployed in the national health service to help tackle and get on top of this serious problem.</p>
	<p pid=".188.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/715" name="John Baron">The hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron)</phrase>, as a party spokesperson, introduced a more party political tone into <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/911" name="Ian Gibson">the debate than the hon.

Member for Cheadle (Mrs. Calton)</phrase>, who made no party political points whatever. It is part of my job as a Minister to respond to some of the party political attacks that have been made. I shall do that briefly, but I do not want to get into a party political debate because the issue is much more important than that.</p>
	<p pid=".188.0/4">If more of my hon. Friends were present today, we would all have been slightly puzzled to hear the hon. Member for Billericay complaining about postcode lotteries and insufficient investment, because his party voted against the additional investment that we are giving to the NHS, without which it would have been difficult to sustain the progress that we are making.</p>

	<p pid=".188.2/1">No, not yet. The hon. Gentleman also claimed that the Government were not doing enough to tackle the problems of obesity and excess alcohol consumption. I cannot recall a single suggestion that he made about how he would deal with those two problems, other than establishing a public health commission to advise Ministers.</p>

	<p pid=".188.4/1">I will in a moment. The hon. Gentleman criticised the Government for setting up arm's-length bodies&mdash;he would use the term quangos&mdash;yet his suggestion was that we needed another quango to deal with those problems. He also said that it was not proper for a junior Minister to deal with this issue and that it    should be the responsibility of the Secretary of State.   Everything in the Department of Health is the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, so I do not understand his point. He wants me to give way, and I am happy to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".189.0/1">I want to raise two quick issues. The Minister said that I suggested that there had been a cut in investment. I did not. I am the first to admit that there has been an increase in investment, and we would match Labour's planned increase in investment over coming years to the tune of about &pound;34 billion. My point was that, bearing in mind the amount of investment in the NHS, much of the money is not reaching front-line services, of which breast cancer care is, unfortunately, an example. That is not a party political point. We are all trying to improve services for those suffering from breast cancer and it is a perfectly valid point to make.</p>
	<p pid=".189.0/2">As for the co-ordinated approach, I suggested to the Minister that we had a well-thought-through policy for dealing with obesity and drinking. We would introduce a much more co-ordinated approach on public health generally&mdash;and the HIV campaign co-ordinated by Lord Foster shows what such an approach can achieve. Those are concrete proposals, and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.189.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/987" speakername="John Hutton" colnum="189"  time="10:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h01.htm#41109h01_spnew21">
	<p pid=".189.1/1">I really do not want to continue with this; it is a familiar merry-go-round, and it would be rather dispiriting to get bogged down in these issues. The hon. Gentleman says that we need a more co-ordinated approach. With the greatest respect, that is not a specific policy. It is a generalisation. I hoped that he would make some concrete suggestions today, but he may be holding them back for another occasion.</p>
	<p pid=".189.1/2">I was not arguing that the hon. Gentleman wanted to reduce expenditure on the NHS, although some of his policies would have that effect. I was simply saying that it is a matter of historical record&mdash;it is not contestable, and I do not want spend more time on it&mdash;that the present Leader of the Opposition described the increase in expenditure that we announced in 2001 as reckless and irresponsible. It is obviously of interest, therefore, to hear that it is now proper, responsible and the right thing to do. But that is opposition politics.</p>

	<p pid=".189.3/1">Let us leave all that to one side. I did not intervene on the hon. Gentleman; and the hon. Member for Broxbourne deserves the courtesy of a proper response to the nine specific questions that she asked me.</p>
	<p pid=".189.3/2">The hon. Lady referred to the convenience of a booking system for local screening services, as did the hon. Members for Billericay and for Cheadle. That is an important point. The hon. Lady will be aware of the work that we are doing to move to a system of booked appointments across the NHS, particularly for referrals by GPs for hospital-based appointments for secondary care. People using the NHS will not have to wait for someone to tell them when they can be seen; at the beginning, they will agree with the clinician or the referral service when they are to be seen; they will be able to negotiate the time and place. The system will be built around people's needs, not the convenience of the provider who is running the service.</p>
	<p pid=".189.3/3">Exactly the same logic applies to breast cancer screening as applies to booking appointments for secondary care. The hon. Lady was right to raise the issue. I and my ministerial colleagues will reflect on what more can be done to improve the convenience of booking systems for breast cancer screening. However, I am sure that she will understand that it is a local issue. The local primary care trusts and providers are responsible for putting the service in place, and I would expect them to organise similar access arrangements for breast screening services as we hope to achieve with booking appointments for secondary care. There is plenty of food for thought; we need to reflect on what more can be done to promote that sort of approach for local screening services.</p>
	<p pid=".189.3/4">The hon. Lady asked us to renew our efforts to promote the importance of breast cancer screening and the need for people to attend appointments. We need to do more on that, and I shall write to the hon. Lady and set out in more detail some of our thoughts on the subject.</p>
	<p pid=".189.3/5">Like all who spoke in the debate, the hon. Lady raised the question of access to benefits. In our work as constituency Members, we all have to deal with terminally ill patients who know that benefits are unlikely to arrive in time to provide any measure of comfort to their families. However, we are realistic and know that if a member of the family is terminally ill, it will have an effect on the family's finances. There is no question about it. However, the state's job is to ensure that the maximum amount of help is delivered promptly in such circumstances. I shall refer the hon. Lady's comments to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. I shall ensure that she receives a proper response to the points that she raised, particularly about how disability living allowance can be paid conveniently in order to allow for the needs of people with terminal illnesses.</p>

	<p pid=".190.0/1">Will the Minister specifically consider the Macmillan suggestion that cancer patients should be made aware of benefits, perhaps as early as on diagnosis, in order that they receive the benefits to which they are entitled?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.190.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/987" speakername="John Hutton" colnum="190"  time="10:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h01.htm#41109h01_spnew25">
	<p pid=".190.1/1">Yes, they should be told; that issue does not come between us. The question is who is best placed to provide that advice. I suspect that health care professionals are probably not well placed to provide proper benefits advice. An interesting trend in many primary care locations is that work is being done to ensure that patients have access to proper welfare benefits advice. I am aware of GPs who work with benefits advice agencies and sometimes with the local authority to provide drop-in clinics at GPs' surgeries so that patients can receive more convenient advice. That is entirely sensible. We have tried to encourage that development, and will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/2">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that people should have access to the right advice on which to base the decisions that they need to take to get their lives in order. That is particularly true of benefits advice, which is especially important at a moment of undoubted crisis when someone is told that they have cancer and it could be terminal. There is obviously some common ground between the hon. Gentleman and me on that point, at least.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/3">Many statistics have been used in the debate, and I do not take issue with any of them. It is salutary to think that breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women in Britain today. More than 34,000 new cases are diagnosed each year in our country, and as the hon. Lady rightly said, the incidence of breast cancer is also rising. Between 1996 and 2001, for example, it rose by more than 10 per cent. Those statistics are one reason why preventing cancer and improving services for those who develop the disease should rightly be a top priority for the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/4">We have made significant progress in reducing deaths from breast cancer. As the hon. Gentleman said, despite the increase in the incidence of breast cancer, mortality in England dropped by more than 10 per cent. between 1997 and 2002. In the past decade, England has seen the greatest decrease in the number of deaths from breast cancer than anywhere else in the world.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/5">Survival rates are improving. A women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1986 and 1990 would have had only a 67 per cent. chance of being alive after five years. A woman diagnosed with the same disease between 1996 and 1999 now has an 80 per cent. chance of being alive five years later. I argue very strongly that the progress that we have been making has been made possible at least partly by the increased investment in the   NHS. That has allowed the NHS to employ an extra 1,182 cancer consultants, as well as an additional 2,800 consultants who spend a significant amount of their time caring for cancer patients.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/6">The hon. Gentleman referred to radiography. It is certainly not my argument today that we have enough consultants or radiographers. I am unsure that we will ever be in that position. I do, however, argue that we have significantly more consultants and radiographers than we have ever had. The number of therapeutic radiographers has increased by almost 20 per cent. since we took office, and we also have doubled the number of therapeutic radiography training places.</p>

	<p pid=".191.0/1">I thank the Minister for his generosity. In a totally non-party political way, may I ask him to explain why, if there is such an increase in numbers, radiotherapy waiting times have deteriorated so badly? There is no dispute about that when one sees the figures.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.191.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/987" speakername="John Hutton" colnum="191"  time="10:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h01.htm#41109h01_spnew27">
	<p pid=".191.1/1">I probably would want to reflect on what the hon. Gentleman has said, as he has said several times that the figures for radiotherapy waiting times are deteriorating. I want to see the evidence for that, so perhaps he can provide it.</p>
	<p pid=".191.1/2">We intend to measure, in a way previous Governments have not, the entire waiting time for patients at various stages on the various care pathways along which they need to go. For the first time, that will include waiting for diagnosis, treatment and therapy.</p>
	<p pid=".191.1/3">More diagnostic radiographers and therapeutic radiographers are working in the NHS than ever before. I have not tried to claim today for a second that that is anywhere near enough, but it is worth pointing out that vacancy rates are starting to move in the right direction for radiographers from a peak of more than 10 per cent. last year to 8.8 per cent. this year. I accept that that is not enough, but we are making significant headway.</p>
	<p pid=".191.1/4">We are therefore increasing the fiscal capacity of the NHS as well as the human resources that are available to it. Significant investment has been made in new MRI scanners, CT scanners, linear accelerators and breast cancer screening equipment, which have all become available to the NHS since April 2000. That is part of a &pound;520 million capital investment programme. Those investments have helped us to get to the point at which 99 per cent. of women with suspected breast cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks of being urgently referred by their GP. More than 97 per cent. of women receive treatment within two months of GP referral and 97 per cent. receive it within one month of diagnosis. By 2008, patients will experience a maximum one-month wait from urgent referral to treatment for all cancers, including breast cancer. I hope that hon. Members will welcome those objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".191.1/5">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence has also been playing its part in ensuring that the latest drug treatments are made available more quickly to NHS patients. NICE has to date approved for use 15 new cancer drugs, five of which are for use against breast cancer. That is one of the ways we are trying to tackle the problem of variation in access to such treatments.</p>

	<p pid=".192.2/1">I really am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I have listened carefully to what he has said. He has spoken a great deal about work that is being done on improving treatments, and those of us who have been personally involved are grateful for that. However, the debate is about the prevention of breast cancer. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1197" name="Marion Roe">The point that the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Dame Marion Roe)</phrase> made, and which I reinforced, was that only 2 per cent. of research is currently on prevention. What are the Government planning to do to change the balance of research, so that we look at prevention rather than simply treatment?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.192.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/987" speakername="John Hutton" colnum="192"  time="10:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h01.htm#41109h01_spnew31">
	<p pid=".192.3/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady, who anticipates what I want to say later about prevention. She is quite right; I have been focusing on treatment. Perhaps I should have started with prevention, but no speech of mine is ever perfect, so we are where we are.</p>
	<p pid=".192.3/2">On the subject of NICE, I feel rather depressed now, because I was about to make my party political point, but I think that I shall move on, except to say in passing that the hon. Member for Billericay and his lot voted against the creation of NICE in the first place.</p>
	<p pid=".192.3/3">There is a great deal that we can feel represents good progress, but I do not want to give anyone the sense that we are complacent or make anyone feel that we can rest on our laurels. That would not be right. Many hon. Members still have concerns about breast cancer services, many of which have been raised this morning.</p>
	<p pid=".192.3/4">The national cancer director, Mike Richards, published a report earlier this year that showed that not   all eligible breast cancer patients had access to Herceptin, for example. The differences in take-up around the country are simply not acceptable. The Department is taking action to improve information on prescribing and ensure that clinicians all over the country are made aware of the benefits of drugs that have been positively appraised by NICE. We are also working with strategic health authorities where particular problems have been identified.</p>
	<p pid=".192.3/5">We are also trying to make better use of staff through new skill-mix programmes, allowing qualified professional staff to focus on the tasks that need their input, by training others to perform the more routine functions. A practical example of that is the introduction of new roles in radiography, which allows radiographers to extend their roles into some of the tasks previously undertaken by oncologists and radiologists, such as reporting on X-rays. In turn, assistant practitioners are being trained to take on roles traditionally performed by   radiographers, and can now perform plain film radiography and diagnostic imaging examinations.</p>
	<p pid=".192.3/6">All of us will be concerned about the rise in the incidence of breast cancer. I do not think that there is a single explanation for that, and I am sure that other hon. Members share that belief. However, we know that exposure to increased amounts of oestrogen can increase the risk of breast cancer. The hon. Member for Broxbourne referred to that.</p>
	<p pid=".192.3/7">We also know that some synthetic chemicals, including some organochlorine insecticides, may have a   very weak ability to act as oestrogens in the body. That   has led some people to make a connection between organochlorine insecticides and breast cancer. However, there is no evidence at all that such chemicals cause breast cancer. An independent committee that recently published a review on the issue concluded that individuals exposed through air, water or food to environmental levels of DDT, betalindane and lindane insecticides were not at risk of developing breast cancer due to exposure to those chemicals. The committee could not reach a definitive conclusion about dieldrin because of a lack of epidemiology.</p>
	<p pid=".192.3/8">It is not permitted to add chemicals that are known to cause cancer by interacting with DNA or chromosomes to food or to use them in food production. We are aware that some environmental contaminants may be present at low levels in food and that others may be formed during cooking, but they have not been linked to breast cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".192.3/9">We are firmly of the belief that in the long term the best and most efficient way of beating cancer is prevention, both for individuals and in terms of NHS resources. We know that diet plays a role in about a quarter of cancer deaths in this country, and are taking action to tackle that problem. We are encouraging people to eat more fruit and vegetables through programmes such as the five-a-day initiative, to which the hon. Gentleman referred&mdash;I am glad that he supports them&mdash;to increase access to fruit and vegetables. We are also testing different ways of increasing physical activity.</p>
	<p pid=".192.3/10">The hon. Gentleman invited me to say a few words about the White Paper, as did the hon. Members for Broxbourne and for Cheadle. It was a nice try; obviously, I cannot say anything today about its   content, but it will become apparent quite soon. However, I can say that it will set out how we can do more on diet and nutrition, physical activity and obesity, all of which can help to reduce cancers, including breast cancer. It will also have more to say about how we can tackle behaviour that increases the risk of developing cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".192.3/11">Of course, even with the best prevention services in the world we would not be able to prevent every case of breast cancer. Early identification and intervention must remain central to our plans, beginning with the overriding importance of teaching women to be breast aware, as 90 per cent. of breast cancer is found by women themselves. We have some of the best national screening programmes in the world. The national computerised call and recall system for breast screening was introduced by the previous Conservative Government in 1988, and was the first such programme in the EU. They made the right decision, and as a result thousands of women are alive today who might otherwise have died. Our predecessors deserve to be congratulated on that.</p>
	<p pid=".192.3/12">For our part, we constantly encourage women to attend the NHS breast-screening programme, through which nearly 10,000 cancers were detected in 2002&ndash;03&mdash;a 13 per cent. increase on the previous year. We have extended the coverage of the screening programme to those aged 65 to 70. Over 250,000 extra women in that age group have been invited to attend since the extension began in April 2001. That number will rise to 400,000 a year when screening is fully established by the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid=".192.3/13">However, we can do more. That is why we are working with GPs to help them to identify those patients most likely to have cancer, so that they can receive fast, efficient and targeted specialist investigation. Guidelines are currently being reviewed by NICE, and are due to be published in March next year.</p>
	<p pid=".192.3/14">The hon. Members for Broxbourne and for Cheadle asked about research. I accept that we must always look at what more we can do to promote research into the   causes, treatment and prevention of breast cancer. The Department provides about &pound;80 million a year for cancer research. Over the past three years we have dramatically increased our ability to do clinical trials of the latest cancer drugs and treatments. The percentage of cancer patients in trials in the UK is twice that in the United States. Breast cancer trials also constitute the highest proportion of trials within the National Cancer Research Network.</p>
	<p pid=".192.3/15">To mention just two such trials, Cancer Research UK is trialling a new chemotherapy regime to test whether it improves survival for women who have had surgery for early-stage breast cancer, and NCRN is providing NHS infrastructure support for a major Cancer Research breast cancer prevention trial called IBIS II. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Broxbourne is aware of that, but I will send her details of it. That trial is an international multi-centre study of Anastrozole&mdash;I am sure that someone can help me with the pronunciation: I had it last night, but it has gone today&mdash;versus a placebo in post-menopausal women who have an increased risk of breast cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".192.3/16">As has rightly been acknowledged, the voluntary sector plays a huge and important role in this area. We are committed to working in partnership with bodies in that sector to improve and deliver cancer services. For example, we are working with Macmillan Cancer Relief to develop local cancer user-involvement work, and with the Royal College of Surgeons in its work to develop training for sentinel node biopsy training. The Department funds 19 cancer charities through its section 64 grants scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".192.3/17">Breast cancer is a major issue for our country. The action that the Government have taken confirms the priority that we attach to it, and we are seeing progress as a result. Such progress has been made possible first and foremost by the hard work of NHS staff, and is dependent on our maintaining the right level of investment, and continuing to work with patient groups and the voluntary sector so that we can build a proper national consensus on the best way forward.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.196.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/777" speakername="David Cameron" colnum="196"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h02.htm#41109h02_spnew0">
	<p pid=".196.1/1">I am grateful for this opportunity, because although the rights of mobile home or park home residents have been discussed and amended recently, I want to highlight a constituency case that shows some of the major problems. I shall talk    about the problems at a mobile home park called   Thameside Court, near Northmoor in West Oxfordshire, referring also to Kings Court in Carterton; I shall relate those cases to the general state of the law and put some questions to the Minister about how we can ensure that the people involved have meaningful rights and proper security.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/2">A Mr. Tom Hartley bought Thameside Court, which has 60 residents, on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-08">8 September 2003</phrase>. After receiving a number of complaints from residents, I organised a meeting with the residents at Northmoor village hall this September. The hall was packed. Former residents as well as current ones and their families attended. Many of the people living in Thameside Court have limited means and are worried by the cost of getting proper legal advice, and they are worried about who will look out for their interests. The residents' association is doing a great job, but it is newly constituted and feels, quite understandably, that is up against a highly experienced park owner. It was incredibly moving to hear people's powerful testimony about the way they have been treated and their determination to ensure that others do not suffer in the same way. Why are those people so concerned? There are two issues. The first is about the way in which park rules can be changed. The second is about the rights owners have when selling their homes.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/3">In October 2003, shortly after buying the site, the owner wrote to the residents suggesting a change in the park rules. Some 90 per cent. of residents objected to the   new rules and a meeting was requested with the owner. Under his membership of the British Holiday and Home Parks Association he should grant such a meeting, but up to now he has refused to do so, even though a residents' association has now been formed and the request has been made several times, including through me. I am delighted to say that, following letters from me to the BHHPA and other action&mdash;possibly including the announcement of this debate&mdash;a meeting has now been granted. None the less, the saga of the rules is interesting.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/4">Initially, the site owner refused to respond to a number of letters sent by the residents' association about the issue. When he did, it became very clear that he was not willing to hold a public meeting and would deal only with individual residents. In a letter that the site owner eventually sent to the residents on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-07">7 June 2004</phrase>, referring to the residents' association he said:</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/5" class="indent">&quot;It is a fact that I am not obliged to recognise any association.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/6">When I wrote to him, the site owner responded stating his belief that</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/7" class="indent">&quot;It is only a few residents who have nothing better to do with their time who are trying to cause a problem.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/8">It should be remembered that 90 per cent. objected to the new rules. He ended his letter:</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/9" class="indent">&quot;I would advise you to spend more of your precious time dealing with more important issues.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/10">As I have said, a meeting will now, I hope, take place.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/11">In her letter to me, Ros Pritchard, director general of the BHHPA, referred to Mr Hartley's &quot;proposed rule changes&quot;. I am glad that the word &quot;proposed&quot; was used, because in a letter to the residents on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase>, the site owner said:</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/12" class="indent">&quot;Please be advised that the Park Rules which are displayed on the notice board are now fully effective.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/13">I hope that this reflects a genuine change of approach and that a more reasonable dialogue can now be established.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/14">I said that the saga was interesting. It throws up two questions for the Minister. First, does he think that we   need proper rights of recognition for residents' associations? Secondly, should the BHHPA guidelines about rule changes and consultation be written into the law? Let me be clear: some of the proposed rules are very significant. One example is: &quot;Strictly no children.&quot; A second is:</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/15" class="indent">&quot;No one to reside in the park under the age of 50.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/16">Vitally, one rule change reads:</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/17" class="indent">&quot;The tenant/owner of mobile shall not be allowed any kind of advertisement, promotion or for sale sign notice to be attached or exhibited on the outside or any part of the premises.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/18">The situation at Kings Court in Carterton is a little different. The owner there wanted to develop the land to provide housing and applied for planning permission, but there were and are issues about rule changes and rent charges. Residents have worked together and presented quite a united front, which has clearly had an impact.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/19">To return to Thameside Court, I said that the second concern expressed at the public meeting at Northmoor was about the right of owners to sell their homes. The rule changes are, I believe, directly linked to that issue. If we think about the proposed changes&mdash;no kids, no one under the age of 50, no one allowed to put up for sale signs&mdash;we can see the connection. Some residents felt that they were under pressure to leave because of the rule changes, but even for those people, it was becoming more difficult to sell homes, because they could not put up for sale signs and the like.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/20">Let me read the testimony of one person who felt enormous pressure to sell their home. The quote is quite long, but I hope that hon. Members will indulge me. That person said:</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/21" class="indent">&quot;My house was up for sale at the time and I had moved into other accommodation in Witney. Hartley could contact me through my park home estate agents, Seekers, but chose not to. Instead, he called my neighbour.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/22" class="indent">I did call him and he told he that I had no choice but to sell to him at his price as he had a file on me and that as I was not living in my park home any more, I was breaking the terms of the agreement. He threatened to remove my home from the park if I did not comply immediately. At this time he also informed me that he was in possession of my new address. As my house was officially up for sale, he actually had no grounds to do this and I was acting within my rights. Hartley demanded that I meet him later that day at the park to formalise the sale for &pound;25,000. My house was up for sale for &pound;36,000.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/23" class="indent">When I met him at the park, he inspected my home and declared that it was older than the age stated on my park home agreement by eleven years and that he was not going to tolerate such an old house on the park. He said that he would probably have it taken off anyway as it would take a lot to do up. He said he would pay me &pound;20,000 and no more. I had no choice but to accept in the end as I felt that my family could be at risk and I no longer had the funds to use a solicitor to fight him even though I was in the right. Hartley spent around &pound;5,000 to &pound;7,000 doing up my home and it is now for sale for &pound;89,500.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/24">One resident alleged that the site owner refused to accept the display of notices inside or outside a mobile home advertising it for sale. After it was pointed out to the owner that he was required, as a member of the BHHPA, to permit one for sale notice to be displayed in the window of a home for sale, provided that it does not exceed A4 size, he amended the rules.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/25">There have been a number of accusations of improper behaviour, and I know that the Government recognise the problem of harassment. A press release from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-24">24 February</phrase> states:</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/26" class="indent">&quot;According to residents' associations, one of the most common complaints is the harassment of park owners when they want to sell their home. This often results in properties being sold at low prices to the site owner.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/27">I congratulate the Government on recognising the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/28">When another couple informed the site owner that they intended to sell their home because it was no longer their main residence, he said&mdash;this will become familiar&mdash;that he could not allow them to do that as the unit was &quot;too old and worthless&quot;. He did not want old units on the park and intended to remove their home and burn it. That elderly couple told the residents' association that they were then subjected to threats. The site owner warned them that if they discussed their situation with anyone else, he would leave them with no money at all. In the end, he gave them a cheque for about &pound;5,000 and the unit was carefully dismantled and removed on transporters. The same methods were used with another elderly couple, who had hoped to sell their unit for &pound;70,000. In the end, they sold it to the site owner for &pound;20,000. It is being resold for &pound;90,000. I accept that work has been carried out on those units, but the fact is that people have not been given a fair deal.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/29">What is happening seems fairly straightforward. Owners recognise that the value of these sites is now great, particularly in areas of high housing demand such as West Oxfordshire, and particularly if new units can be erected. On occasion, improper pressure is put on people to sell at a low price or to leave because of other rule changes. The case histories that I heard at the public meeting, some of which I have shared today, are pretty clear. There are cases in which what has happened can be done within the law because, for example, the owner in question has another home, but due process should be followed, and judging by what I have seen and heard, that has not happened in every case.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/30">To give credit where credit is due, the Government have taken action. The press release from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-24">24 February</phrase> explained a number of amendments, including the following provisions:</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/31" class="indent">&quot;To remove 'age' of a home as a criterion for ending an agreement, and to give discretion to courts to adjourn termination proceedings on the grounds of the condition of a park home to allow for repairs to be carried out&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/32">However, some important questions remain for the Minister to answer.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/33">First, what more can be done to stop the abuse of the   rules and the exercise of market power? Secondly, what additional role could the local authorities, or even trading standards departments, play in ensuring that owners of mobile units get a fair deal? The Mobile Homes Act 1983 potentially provides people with extensive rights and the Government's amendments to the Housing Bill will extend that provision. However, those rights are mainly enforceable through the civil courts, which means that people must pursue the action themselves, usually with the assistance of a solicitor. In the case in question, West Oxfordshire district council has been extremely supportive, as has the citizens advice bureau, but the council finds it difficult to intervene directly on a resident's behalf because it can deal only with issues relevant to the site licence conditions, or accusations of harassment if they are properly made and put to the council. My constituents often have neither the funds nor the inclination to drag the matter through the courts, especially because of their shortage of funds, and because they fear the consequences of taking that sort of action.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/34">I welcome the recent Government amendments to the Housing Bill, which sought to address the serious concern about park home owners' rights. However, it is essential that the changes are effective in reality, on the ground, when residents either feel too intimidated to take their case to court, or simply prefer the option to leave, selling their property to the site owner at a very low price. There are many good parks that operate fairly, but I suspect that the type of harassment that I have described is common. One of the main reasons why mobile home residents do not assert their rights under the Mobile Homes Act is that they are often vulnerable and elderly, and many lack the means to take their case to court.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/35">I have spoken about residents' rights, but park owners have rights too. I respect the fact that they are running a business, not a charity or a public service, and I understand that they must be able to take steps to ensure the quality of their parks, to protect their investment and to run an efficient and effective operation. Because up to now Mr. Hartley has not had a meeting with residents, I accept that I have not fully heard his side of the story, although I have called him on   the telephone and corresponded with him, as the Minister knows. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say. I have become involved only because the residents were distraught and felt that they had nowhere else to go. The stories they told me, especially about trying to sell their homes, are quite chilling. Some people have lost their life savings; they are bitter about that and I am angry on their behalf.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/36">My conclusions are as follows: first, we need a system whereby local authorities and citizens advice bureaux can offer more support. Local councils may need to be given specific powers in that respect and I hope that the Minister will keep an open mind on the issue. Secondly, information for mobile home residents must be clear, concise and specific, telling them about their rights and how to exercise them. It should tell them what to do if they feel they are being mistreated or worse, or ripped off. It should also tell them when not to do something, but to consult the residents' association and seek the advice of a solicitor if they are concerned about what they are being asked to do.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/37">Thirdly, the Government need to keep under review whether more needs to be done about how park rules can be changed and whether a clearer role could be set    out for residents' associations. Fourthly, the Government need to examine carefully the rights of owners to sell their mobile homes in a reasonable market and at a fair price. Fifthly, and lastly, residents need to work together: on their own they are likely to be picked off and disadvantaged if faced by an unscrupulous owner, whereas together they can stand up for each other, seek the backing of the law and ensure that their rights are upheld.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/38">At the meeting in Northmoor, there was strong agreement on the following points. First, no one should agree to action set out by the owner without first consulting the residents' association. Secondly, the request for a meeting between the residents' association and the owner should be made again. Thirdly, the residents' association needed to take legal advice about the position with regard to the proposed rule changes and what has happened about the sale of certain homes. I hope that the Minister agrees that that is the right advice. Hon. Members are often put in a difficult position in such situations, because they come between owner and residents. However, I hope that that was reasonable advice to give to park home residents, to ensure that their rights were protected.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/39">I know that the Minister has been examining the issue for some time, and that he is therefore almost certainly more expert than I. However, I hope that I have crystallised some of the issues by raising a constituency case that throws light on the matter, and put forward some thoughts for future consideration. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>

	<p pid=".200.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/777" name="David Cameron">the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> on securing the debate and on his speech. I welcome the opportunity to debate mobile home parks&mdash;in fact, similar matters were raised in the House only a fortnight ago, at ODPM oral questions.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/2">I am extremely sorry to hear of the problems that the hon. Gentleman has so graphically described&mdash;a sorry saga indeed. I hope that, as a result of his intervention, some progress is now being made. The problems that he describes are unacceptable and a response is needed, although I hope that he understands that I cannot speak about individual cases. I shall use this opportunity to outline how current provisions and ongoing reforms in respect of park homes will help not only those residents but others throughout the country who may be experiencing similar difficulties. Certainly, the issue has not had the prominence that it deserves, given the nature of the exploitation by unscrupulous site owners in the past.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/3">I pay tribute to others who have been considering the issue for some time. My noble Friend Lord Graham of Edmonton and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/849" name="Hilton Dawson">my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson)</phrase> have campaigned on those matters. I also refer the hon. Gentleman to the all-party group on park home owners, which has worked hard on the issue for a number of years.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/4">The Government set up the park homes working party in 1998 in response to the views of many residents that some park owners were behaving in the way described by the hon. Gentleman&mdash;pressurising and harassing residents. The working party's aim was to consider the operation of existing controls on residential park homes and to make recommendations on what changes, if any, would constitute a fair and workable solution that struck the right balance between the needs and interests of park owners and home owners. The working party's report on the options it considered was published in July 2000. It made 30 recommendations covering a wide range of issues, including changes to the rules on the sale of homes, the provision of written statements, the ending of agreements, harassment, site   licensing and the rates of commission and pitch fee    available. The Government accepted 25 of the 30 recommendations and, as the hon. Gentleman said, a number of those have been included in the Housing Bill. Those provisions will strengthen the rights of residents of mobile home parks and, at the same time, ensure that the industry's regulatory framework helps to meet the growing need for quality, affordable housing. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that, when such parks are well run, they provide a good opportunity for people to find affordable places to live.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/5">Turning to the specific points that the hon. Gentleman made, he mentioned the problems of harassment that some residents have experienced. Harassment is one of the most disturbing of the many issues that the hon. Gentleman raised today. Let me make it clear that harassment of any kind has no place on park home sites, or anywhere else. There should be strict enforcement by local authorities, which have clear powers to deal with it. Although, as the hon. Gentleman said, residents can be   frightened in such situations, the local authority needs   statements from residents who experience such difficulties. Residents must come forward and make statements so that a local authority can bring a prosecution.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/6">Local authorities, in addition to their power to prosecute, can be helpful in offering informal advice and   guidance to residents. It appears that the hon. Gentleman, as their Member of Parliament, has also been offering such guidance, which is very helpful to residents. We have issued best practice guidance to local authorities on this subject, following the publication of a report entitled &quot;Harassment and unlawful eviction of private rented sector tenants and park home residents&quot;; there is thus guidance for local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/7">We have increased the protection for occupiers of park homes against harassment and illegal eviction. The Housing Bill amends the Caravan Sites Act 1968 to mirror the protection under the Protection From Eviction Act 1977, which governs the protection for occupiers with other types of tenure, including tenants of conventional housing, against unlawful eviction and harassment. Importantly, the wording, which refers to a site owner doing</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/8" class="indent">&quot;acts calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/9">of the occupier that cause him to abandon his home has been amended to refer to &quot;acts likely to interfere&quot; with the occupier's peace or comfort, which is obviously an easier test to satisfy in the courts. In addition, a new offence has been introduced, which does not require intent to be shown with respect to the harassment. It will be sufficient if the site owner or agent knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, that his conduct is likely to result in an occupier abandoning occupation. That therefore increases the protection available to occupiers and the chance of successful prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/10">The Bill also creates a power whereby the Secretary of State can add additional terms to be implied into the    agreement between the site owner and occupier governing the occupation of the site, and to repeal and vary those in the Mobile Homes Act 1983. Because existing agreements are of infinite duration, it is necessary for the Secretary of State to be able to amend the statutory implied terms for existing agreements, where these are clearly inadequate. Provision has therefore been made for the first exercise of the power to   have retrospective effect&mdash;that is a very powerful measure. Future exercises of the power will be non-retrospective. That was discussed during the consultation on &quot;Park Home Statutory Instruments: Consultation on Implied Terms and Written Statement&quot;, which we closed on <phrase class="date" code="">22 October</phrase>. We propose to insert a right of quiet enjoyment of the pitch into all contracts. We are aware that many site owners enter the pitch with a view to harassing residents, so we propose to require site owners to give 24 hours' written notice before they are allowed entry to the pitch.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/11">I shall now speak to some of the other issues that the hon. Gentleman raised, including allegations of illegal eviction. The current written statement that residents receive makes it clear that the specific grounds on which a contract can be terminated by the site owner include a court's being satisfied that a term of the agreement has been breached, that notice to remedy the breach has not been complied with in a reasonable time, and that termination is reasonable. Another ground is that the site owner has applied to a court to terminate an agreement because an occupier is not using the home as their only or main residence. Also, at present, a site owner can apply to a court to terminate an agreement at the end of the current five-year period on the basis that the age and condition of a home is having a detrimental effect on the amenity of the site, or that it is likely to have a detrimental effect before the end of the next five-year period.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/12">In the Housing Bill we have provided that the age of a home should be removed as a relevant criterion for ending an agreement. The amendment will remove the reference to age from the Mobile Homes Act, as we consider that only the condition of the home, not its age, should determine whether it is having a detrimental effect on the amenity of the site. The amendment will also enable courts to consider the condition of the unit and to allow time for appropriate repairs if reasonably practicable, and if the occupier indicates that he intends to carry out those repairs. That would deal with some of the instances that the hon. Gentleman mentioned.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/13">We are examining a number of issues in the implied terms consultation paper on protection from eviction. We aim to remove mention of the relevant five-year period so that the current condition is the only reason for which a site owner can apply to have a home removed. We also propose that a court can evict someone on the basis that their home is no longer their only or main residence only if a court considers it reasonable to do so. That will protect people who have prolonged absences from their home, such as lengthy hospital stays, or to care for a sick relative elsewhere in the country, from an abuse of those circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/14">The Housing Bill will also improve the transparency of transactions and ensure that the resident has more information on the transaction at the time of purchase. At present, written statements setting out the terms of the agreement between site owner and occupier governing occupation of the site by the occupier may be given up to three months after the agreement has commenced. It is quite amazing that that is the current position. I am pleased to say that the Bill requires a written statement of terms to be given to a prospective occupier 28 days before any agreement for the sale of the mobile home is made; or, if there is no   such agreement, not later than 28 days before the occupation agreement is entered into. To clarify, the parties will be able to agree a shorter period than 28 days between themselves, but the prospective occupier must indicate their consent in writing to the specified shorter time scale. That provision is designed to ensure that potential park home occupiers are made aware of the terms under which they will occupy the site before&mdash;not three months after&mdash;coming on to the site.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/15">The hon. Gentleman gave some examples of restrictions on sales. I cannot talk about specific cases, but will talk about the issue in general. At present, a simple failure to give timely approval to a purchaser, as opposed to the active withdrawing of approval, is a method used by some site owners who wish to force occupiers of older-style homes into selling back to them. If the delays are too long, potential purchasers lose interest and it becomes difficult in practice to sell the home and assign the agreement to anyone. In that way, sale to the site owner becomes the only practicable option. The site owner can then replace the old home with a new model, or do it up, to sell on at considerable profit. The Housing Bill introduces a contractual duty for the site owner to give approval to a prospective purchaser within a time limit of 28 days unless it is reasonable not to do so. If the site owner does not issue a decision within 28 days, or withholds approval unreasonably, the occupier can apply to the court and seek damages for breach of contract. The occupier can also seek an order from the court declaring that the prospective purchaser is approved.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/16">The consultation paper for secondary legislation proposed further changes to aid the transparency of the transaction. The Bill will help to deter site owners from behaving in an unreasonable manner, by making them explain the reasons for withholding consent. However, the process could be made more transparent by the resident already knowing possible reasons for consent being withheld. The consultation paper asks site owners to specify criteria, which, although not exhaustive, would provide a useful checklist of standard criteria applicable in all cases for residents. We propose that it be made available to residents with the written statement.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/17">The hon. Gentleman also raised a number of issues about the amendment of the park rules. That subject is   well covered by the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999, which provide that a term may be unfair if it has the object or effect of enabling the seller or supplier to alter the terms of the contract without a valid reason specified in the contract. Where park rules or other obligations are incorporated into the contract made between a park owner and a park resident, the Office of Fair Trading is likely to object to any term that allows the park owner to make substantial alterations that change the balance of advantage under the contract. The OFT takes the view that any such change should be made only with the genuine agreement of the park residents. The OFT is also likely to object to a term that enables the park owner, without a valid reason, to alter important characteristics of the way in which the service will be provided. Unfair contract terms are unlawful and the OFT will look into such matters and take action if necessary. Park residents are legally entitled to receive the service that they agreed to purchase, not one that is merely analogous or similar.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/18">We are shortly to consult on some more recommendations from the park homes working party that deal with site licensing and the recognition of residents' associations. In January next year, we will consider the recognition of residents' associations in park homes; that will an important area for the hon. Gentleman to look at when we publish our consultations in a few months time. We will also consider the reform of the payment regime&mdash;the 10 per cent. commission&mdash;early next year. Those recommendations will help us to take forward the measures that we have already put in place.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/19">As the hon. Gentleman said, we should not allow the obvious and well-known problems, which are so distressing for individuals, to affect the reputation of all operators, because we know that there are good operators who run parks effectively and we do not want to do them an injustice. Park home living is attractive to many people: it offers a freedom that other forms of occupancy do not, and it provides a livelihood for many responsible site owners who care for their sites and for the residents of the homes on such sites. We have no will to curtail park home provision, and indeed we are happy to encourage more.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/20">I hope that I have answered most of the questions raised by the hon. Gentleman. We are making significant progress and I congratulate him on bringing this debate to the Chamber. It is an important one, and I hope that the measures that we are introducing will be an important first step. We shall press ahead with secondary legislation at the earliest opportunity.</p>

	<p pid=".205.2/2">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important issue on behalf of the large group of Members who have expressed concern about the tonnage tax and seafarers' employment. I should mention that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/851" name="John Denham">my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase> is currently chairing a Select Committee, so he cannot be with us. However, he wants me to mention his support for the debate and for our proposals on reforming the tonnage tax. I should also declare an interest as the chairman of the RMT&mdash;National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers&mdash;parliamentary group.</p>
	<p pid=".205.2/3">It is important that we are debating this issue today, because the various Government reviews of the tonnage tax have reached a key stage. We hope that the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/995" name="David Jamieson">my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson)</phrase> will listen, as he always does, before taking away with him some of our messages about overall reform.</p>
	<p pid=".205.2/4">The United Kingdom is an island nation and is heavily dependent on ships for its trade, but the number of seafarers has declined dramatically in the past few years. The number of UK seafarer ratings has fallen from 30,000 in 1980 to fewer than 10,000 today. Furthermore, hon. Members on both sides of the House were recently shocked to hear the latest announcement by P&amp;O, which intends to dismiss 1,200 UK seafarers as part of a wide-ranging review of its business. That will involve closing several key ferry routes.</p>

	<p pid=".205.3/1">Is my hon. Friend aware that the present proposal for 1,200 redundancies in Dover and Portsmouth comes on top of 800 redundancies at P&amp;O less than 12 months ago?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.205.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" speakername="John McDonnell" colnum="205"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h03.htm#41109h03_spnew3">
	<p pid=".205.4/1">I am aware of the overall figures and I am sure that my hon. Friend will want to comment later on the impact of those redundancies on his and other Members' constituencies. What all of us find   shocking, however, including the Leader of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/974" name="Michael Howard">the Opposition, the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase>, who has made representations on this matter, is the nature of the announced job losses. Rationalisation might be going on in the company, but many of us felt that at least there was an agreed process for taking it forward and that the company could be maintained in profit. We may return to that point.</p>
	<p pid=".205.4/2">In December 1998, in response to the fall in the number of seafarers, the Government published a policy document entitled &quot;British Shipping: Charting a new course&quot;, which outlined a series of policy measures to address the decline in UK shipping. One of the key objectives that the Government set themselves was to increase the training and employment of UK seafarers. The centrepiece of their measures was the UK tonnage tax, which was eventually broadly welcomed by all parties, all sections of the industry and all organisations representing seafarers. So, we had an agreed way forward.</p>
	<p pid=".205.4/3">Currently, the Inland Revenue and the Department for Transport are conducting a review of the tonnage tax. One of the matters being examined is whether there should be a firm link between the tax concession and the training and employment of UK seafarers.</p>
	<p pid=".205.4/4">The tonnage tax is a special form of taxation that has been introduced for the UK shipping industry. Several other countries have also introduced tax concessions for their shipping industry in recognition of the competitive nature of the maritime sector. Indeed, the British tonnage tax evolved as a result of the evidence provided to the Government about what other European countries were doing to support their industry. Again, employers and employee representatives' organisations alike provided that information and lobbied on the basis of it.</p>
	<p pid=".205.4/5">The tonnage tax is a significant concession to the industry and is worth about &pound;35 million a year. Initially, the Chamber of Shipping said that the cost would be between &pound;10 million and &pound;15 million a year. The RMT believed that it would be considerably more, as did the   Government, who believed that it might cost between &pound;45 million and &pound;50 million. In fact, it has cost &pound;35 million.</p>
	<p pid=".205.4/6">Shipping companies that enter the tonnage tax regime pay a notional tax levy according to the size of the company fleet, as opposed to the usual form of taxation, which is based on company profits. In addition to the lower tax burden, companies have far greater financial certainty, as they can plan in advance for the amount of tax that they will be required to pay at the end of the financial year.</p>
	<p pid=".205.4/7">When the tonnage tax was introduced, everyone believed that there was a real prospect of a win-win situation in which the industry would be made more competitive and tax efficient and that employment would increase. For many years, the UK shipping industry was in decline. That is not a new phenomenon: indeed, the Government deserve credit for taking time to consult industry representatives and formulating proposals to tackle the crisis in the industry.</p>
	<p pid=".205.4/8">As I said, the proposed policy measures were outlined in the policy document &quot;Charting a new course&quot;, which pointed out that many ships deserted the UK flag throughout the 1980s and 90s and that thousands of UK seafarer jobs were lost. Estimates for 1980 put the number of UK seafarer ratings at 30,000. That figure has now fallen to less than 10,000. The Government and independent organisations have been trying to produce best estimates of how low that number could go. Many fear that a fall on the scale of that of the past two decades could mean that by the end of the next decade we would be left with no UK seafarers at all on British ships and elsewhere in the industry. That is a dismal prospect for a country, much of whose wealth was founded on the maritime trade.</p>

	<p pid=".207.0/1">My constituency has a proud maritime history that dates back centuries. May I give my hon. Friend an example of the decline of our ship and seafaring industry since 1984? About 1,800 seafarers used to sail from the port of Harwich, but the number has now fallen to about 60. Is not that a sign that we must do something to retain what we have left and improve those numbers?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.207.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" speakername="John McDonnell" colnum="207"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h03.htm#41109h03_spnew5">
	<p pid=".207.1/1">Figures such as those shocked the Government into action and should motivate us to recognise that there is cross-party concern that the matter should be addressed. Cross-party work must follow the decision to retain a maritime industry. We must recognise that we are an island and thus do not want to become dependent on an industry that is controlled from other countries or other states. We must plan for the maintenance and development of a seafaring sector in this country.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/2">Such figures have brought about today's debate. We can no longer stand by and watch the whole industry decline, observing its effect on particular constituencies and communities. Our experience relates very much to what is happening in the coal mining industry and the destruction of whole coal mining communities.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/3">&quot;Charting a new course&quot; outlined a series of measures, but it is quite clear that the tonnage tax measure was very much the centrepiece of the programme to reverse the dramatic decline in numbers. There is little doubt that the tax has contributed to the   reversal of fortunes on the UK register, and the maritime unions of course welcome the increase in the number of ships on the register. However, those ships must also provide employment opportunities for UK seafarers. We have a paradox: there is an increasing number of ships on the UK register, but no increase in employment overall. Unfortunately, the majority of the new companies on the register fail to employ UK seafarers.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/4">Before I move on to the substantive issue for debate, I want to mention that the increase in the number of   ships on the register is by no means as great as we expected. Between January 2000 and June 2004, the increase in the number of UK direct-owned and registered ships of 500 gross tonnes or more was just 57&mdash;from 241 to 298&mdash;which is hardly a dramatic return for the amount of money that is being invested in the tonnage tax.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/5">Unfortunately, it is not a condition of entry to the scheme that shipowners register their ships under the UK flag, and current figures indicate that only 35 per cent. of UK-owned tonnage flies the red ensign. So entry to the tonnage tax scheme does not involve a requirement to register, although we accept that there is some incentive for it.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/6">When the scheme was introduced, the seafarer unions pressed for a firm training and employment link for UK seafarers. The Government formulated a minimum training obligation, which required shipping companies to train one cadet for every 15 deck and engine officer posts in companies' effective officer complement. In certain circumstances shipping companies can avoid that requirement by making pilot payments in lieu of training to the Maritime Training Trust. That provision was intended for use only in exceptional circumstances, but unfortunately in practice some shipping companies have entered the scheme without training a single UK seafarer. That is contrary to the overall spirit of the charter for change and the introduction of the tonnage tax.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/7">There is no compulsory commitment for seafarer ratings with respect to training or employment. The ratings' union, RMT, has pressed for a firm guarantee from the owners for a training and employment commitment, but that was not forthcoming. Instead, the minimum training obligation for ratings merely states that companies must review the feasibility of employing or training more UK ratings.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/8">I want to correct a statement that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister made on the Floor of the House of Commons. In response to a question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1173" name="Gwyn Prosser">my hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Mr. Prosser)</phrase> he replied:</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/9" class="indent">&quot;There has indeed been extra training for them&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/10">that is ratings&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/11" class="indent">&quot;but I was disappointed that my union at the time, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, did not take up the training arrangements for all British crew members aboard the ships.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-09">9 June 2004</phrase>; Vol. 422, c. 268.]</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/12">I am sure that my right hon. Friend did not want to mislead the House, but that was not an accurate statement, and the union's general secretary, Bob Crow, has written to the Deputy Prime Minister to say that at every opportunity the union has pressed the employers to seek training for ratings, and employment opportunities.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/13">Far from training arrangements not being taken up   by the union, the truth is that they have not been forthcoming from the employers' side. That can be discussed elsewhere, and we can go through the details of the offers that have not been made and the opportunities that have been missed; but it is certainly not for want of the union pressing for offers or wanting to take them up.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/14">It is still hoped that the Government's firm policy commitment, which it was estimated would bring about millions of pounds in subsidies to shipowners and a much improved environment for UK shipping, will be enough to generate increased employment for UK seafarer ratings and officers. However, it is quite clear from the practice of recent years that without any firm training obligation companies have simply ignored ratings training and employment&mdash;with the sole exception of ratings-to-officers training schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/15">Latest figures from the Department for Transport for decisions to opt into the tonnage tax regime show a total of 758 vessels. Of that total, 408 are on the UK register. The number of companies attracted by the financial benefits of the scheme has increased from an initial 15 in 2001&ndash;02 to a current total of 67 companies with ships entered in the scheme for 2003&ndash;04. Unfortunately, the number of UK seafarers employed has declined in the last two years. That decline has been witnessed in both officers and ratings, and runs completely counter to the Government's four key objectives on shipping policy, one of which was increasing employment overall for UK seafarers.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/16">Although the Minister will no doubt tell me that training places for cadets have increased as a result of the tonnage tax, it is also true that the yearly increase is modest. Last year's intake of cadets was only 622 and this year's figure is expected to be no more favourable. Indeed, the requirements for the UK economy that were outlined by the university of Cardiff in 1996 and confirmed in later studies indicate that current cadet recruitment is only about half that required for sufficient seafaring skills to be available on shore. Even with the narrow gain from the tonnage tax, its overall impact on employment has been remarkably limited.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/17">For UK seafaring ratings the picture is without doubt grim. Employment continues to fall, and UK seafarers are being replaced by low-cost foreign nationals. The number of UK ratings in the tonnage tax scheme has also declined. In addition, the number of UK ratings being trained has fallen to an historic low of about 50 per annum. In 1998, the number was about 200 per annum, so current numbers are completely inadequate. The fact that the Chamber of Shipping has failed to honour previous commitments to increase training for ratings and officers by 25 per cent. year on year also graphically illustrates the depth of the crisis that the industry faces.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/18">It is also of profound regret that in the last few years the standards under the UK flag have declined. Increasingly, maritime unions are uncovering instances of appalling low pay on board ships registered in the UK. For example, the International Transport Workers Federation&mdash;the ITF&mdash;recently uncovered the case of Lapthorn Shipping, which operates UK-registered freight vessels between British ports and Ireland and Rotterdam, and pays Filipino crews less than &pound;2 an hour. The crewing agent pays the seafarers $775 a month, which is not only less than recognised ITF minimums, but less than the minimum standards stipulated by the International Labour Organisation.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/19">The Minister will be aware of the continued discrimination against low-cost foreign national seafarers under the amended Race Relations Act 1976. The low standards of employment that are evident under the UK flag are largely a result of the discrimination against foreign-national seafarers that is specifically allowed for under that legislation, which we have discussed in previous Adjournment debates.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/20">The Minister will recall that when the Government recently reviewed the legislation, discrimination against seafarers on the basis of colour, ethnic origin or race was removed. However, discrimination on the ground of nationality has been allowed to continue. In fact, the removal of the other grounds for discrimination has made no difference whatever, as shipowners can continue to discriminate against foreign-national seafarers recruited abroad, through low pay and worse conditions.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/21">Due to the increasing difficulties experienced by seafarers on UK-flagged vessels, the UK maritime unions have taken the unprecedented step of passing policy that allows for the declaration of a flag of convenience on certain UK-registered vessels, which was confirmed in July 2004 at a meeting of the ITF fair practices committee in Singapore. Never before in our history have British ships been identified under flags of convenience. That is a step back in employment and training practices of almost a century. I sincerely hope that the Minister agrees that standards on the UK flag should continue to be a concern and that taxpayers have every right to question the substantial sums of money that the Treasury has allowed the industry, in the form of the tonnage tax.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/22">The concession has been worth more than &pound;100 million since its introduction in 2000. I believe that concession can be justified, but only if we can demonstrate that there will be sufficient all-round benefits to the UK economy. The generation of employment opportunities for UK seafaring ratings and officers is obviously foremost among those.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/23">When the Government published &quot;Charting a new    course&quot;, additional training and employment opportunities for UK seafarers was one of the four key objectives set out in the document. It had been preceded by the White Paper on the future of transport in July 1998, which set out four aims for an integrated shipping policy, one of which was to increase employment for UK seafarers.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/24">The urgency of the training commitment is also illustrated by the increasing age profile of UK seafaring ratings. The last available analysis was provided by the Chamber of Shipping in its manpower survey published in June 2002. It informed us that the average age for UK deck ratings is 43, and for engine room personnel, it is 43.3. That is broadly in line with similar research presented by London Metropolitan university in 2002 in the UK seafarers analysis. The London Metropolitan analysis found that 65 per cent. of UK deck ratings were over 40, and the figure was 62 per cent. for engine room ratings. Given that the level of training for seafaring rating positions has declined since 2000, the age profile will further deteriorate unless corrective action is urgently taken by the industry. It is not an industry in which we want an ageing population.</p>
	<p pid=".207.1/25">In the light of those developments, the RMT has submitted a detailed proposal seeking an employment and training link for UK seafaring ratings. An early-day motion signed by a significant number of Members has been submitted in support of the proposal for such a link. At the moment, shipping companies are enjoying the benefits of the financial concessions without delivering training and employment opportunities for UK ratings.</p>

	<p pid=".210.1/1">As in the earlier debates about the development of the tonnage tax, it is a matter of getting the balance right. I suggest that the RMT proposal, which I shall outline shortly, gets that balance right. We need a firmer commitment for UK seafaring ratings and all cadets. We should not impede or overload the industry with financial burdens, but we should get some return from the &pound;100 million that we are investing in it through the tax concession.</p>

Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight)</phrase> was used for many years as a reason for not introducing tonnage tax to encourage the employment of British seafarers. Is the right hon. Gentleman aware of the comments made by one Chamber of Shipping member, Lord Sterling, when the Government introduced tonnage tax? He said that this Government had done more for shipping than any other. Respect should be shown to the shipping industry by returning British seafarers to ships, as the Government have done by giving those concessions and introducing the tonnage tax.</p>

	<p pid=".211.0/1">I understand my hon. Friend's concerns about previous statements that have not been matched by company actions. In this debate particularly, I want us to demonstrate our willingness to work in partnership with shipowners. However, partnership is a two-way street. We lobbied together for the tonnage tax and won that argument, admittedly with a sympathetic Government, but in return we expect what was originally envisaged as part of achieving those objectives for the industry. In reviewing the tonnage tax, it is not too much to ask for some return in terms of UK seafaring ratings jobs.</p>

	<p pid=".211.1/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that some of the statements made by the Chamber of Shipping are not helpful, especially the idea that the seafarers' unions aim for an absolute connection between the tonnage tax and British seafarers' jobs? They have never sought that. No one is saying that each ship that has tonnage tax facilities should employ only British seafarers; we say only that it should be a fair proportion.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.211.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" speakername="John McDonnell" colnum="211"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h03.htm#41109h03_spnew11">
	<p pid=".211.2/1">It is true to say that the unions, particularly the RMT, are asking for an approach that recognises the long-term development needs of the industry. The industry is not just about delivering profits for shipowners; it is also about delivering employment, and forming a stable sector of the UK economy in the long term. It is not much to ask, in return for taxpayers' money, that shipowners should deliver their side of the bargain, at least with regard to employment initiatives. We want to return to that partnership approach. It is hardly revolutionary; nor is it a flagrant attack on the Chamber of Shipping.</p>
	<p pid=".211.2/2">The RMT seeks to introduce two separate commitments&mdash;one for training, and one for employment. Both the experience of NUMAST&mdash;the      National Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers&mdash;and the figures on officers' employment demonstrate that the training commitment is not sufficient on its own. That is especially the case for ratings, when we consider that their training schemes are of much shorter duration than those of officers.</p>
	<p pid=".211.2/3">The RMT would include in the scheme a training and   employment link for UK ratings and seeks a commitment from companies training UK ratings that at least one in 15 of the total ratings employed will be from the UK. That is hardly revolutionary; nor is it an overwhelmingly costly demand. It is remarkably conservative. In fact, I am beginning to worry that Bob Crow is softening up&mdash;no; I take that back, in case he is listening. However, it is a remarkably conservative gesture; the proposal would be practical in the short term and could be built upon in the long term.</p>
	<p pid=".211.2/4">The training commitment is followed by an employment commitment. It is calculated on the same   basis as the training commitment&mdash;one in 15. Companies would be required to maintain the training commitment for at least the first three years of entry to   the scheme, and to continue training as and when required in order to ensure compliance with the minimum employment requirement. Again, the concept is training and topping up as required; it would show a spirit of good will, and a joint commitment to ensure UK employment.</p>
	<p pid=".211.2/5">I know from discussions that I have already held with the Minister that he is concerned that changes to the scheme should not place in jeopardy the gains made in respect of the increased number of vessels on the UK register. That is why the RMT proposals are extremely modest and reasonable&mdash;and extremely pragmatic and practical. Ideally, the RMT and NUMAST, and perhaps the Minister, would like all ships to be crewed entirely with UK seafarers. Why not? However, the proposal asks only for a minimum of one in 15 UK ratings. That is not unreasonable when we consider the generosity of the taxpayers' provision.</p>
	<p pid=".211.2/6">The Government deserve credit for introducing a number of measures that have boosted UK shipping, but they must recognise that more needs to be done to increase UK seafarers' employment, especially for ratings. So far, 165 MPs have signed the early-day motion calling for a firm link between the tonnage tax concession and increased employment for UK seafarers, ratings and officers. I hope that the Minister can advise us that, following his review, he will introduce such a link.</p>
	<p pid=".211.2/7">We look forward to the outcome of the review, and we hope that today's debate, which takes place as the review is coming to an end, will influence it in a practical way and that it will promote the development of UK seafaring and the stable long-term employment of UK   seafarers, which will provide benefits to many of our constituencies and to the UK economy.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.212.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1173" speakername="Gwyn Prosser" colnum="212"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h03.htm#41109h03_spnew14">
	<p pid=".212.2/1">I should start by declaring a number of non-pecuniary interests. I am a member of NUMAST, the merchant navy officers' union. I am also a member of the GMB, which is trying to save jobs in Dover along with the other seafaring unions, and a long-time friend of the RMT and its predecessors.</p>
	<p pid=".212.2/2">The seafarers' union campaign has gone on for more than a generation. For 25 years it has tried to revitalise the British merchant navy. During my 20-odd years in the service, in which I sailed deep sea, coastal and cross   channel, I have been pleased to be part of that campaign. I remember during those difficult days wondering, along with the trade unions, whether any British merchant fleet would be left within a few years. We worried that the numbers of ships and the amount of British shipping activity would decline so much that it would drop over the edge and cease to exist. That would have been a sad story for a nation with such a proud history and proud heritage of ruling the waves and trading by sea.</p>
	<p pid=".212.2/3">We keep reminding ourselves in these debates that more than 90 per cent. of our trade still travels by sea. Some of us would like to see a lot more of the internal domestic trade carried by sea. There is much potential and lots to do, but we want to do it with a few more local jobs and a few more British seafarers' jobs.</p>
	<p pid=".212.2/4">During the 18 years of Tory Government, the merchant navy fleet was in continuous decline. The number of ships had fallen to just 226 by 1997. It was famously described as being on the point of oblivion. In the first years of this Government, the Chamber of Shipping and the trade unions lobbied hard for the introduction of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" name="John McDonnell">the tonnage tax. My hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> referred to that in his speech. We wanted to arrest the decline of the fleet. We wanted to have more British registered ships and, we hoped, more ships under the red ensign, but we also wanted more British seafarers' jobs.</p>
	<p pid=".212.2/5">I was pleased to be part of the lobby that went to see Transport Ministers and Treasury Ministers. We spent a brief time with my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer trying to put across the idea that a little help for the industry could see a large return for British shipping and a few British seafarers' jobs. It was not a massive manifesto, but a modest request. At the time, we were convinced that if the Ministers agreed and the tonnage tax came into place, the decline in British seafarers' jobs would also be arrested and we could start building up our seafaring numbers again. That was not simply a matter of employing more British seafarers. Although I am partial in these matters, they are considered the best seafarers&mdash;be they officers or ratings&mdash;in the world. Everyone wants British seafarers, but I suppose that the Minister would say, &quot;If they can afford them.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".212.2/6">I have described the background to my involvement, and we also had some useful meetings in my ports committee to which we invited members of the Chamber of Shipping and the seafarers' unions. It was a joint campaign. We all wanted the same thing, and I felt that we all expected to get the same or similar benefits from it.</p>
	<p pid=".212.2/7">My hon. Friend described the rapid turn around in the size of the fleet that resulted from those changes and the sad fact that the reversal in the fortunes of the fleet has not been matched by a reversal in the fortune of British seafarers. He also referred to early-day motion 880 in my name and that of other hon. Members present. It contrasts the huge difference in the reversal in fortunes of British shipping and the industry itself with the pretty abysmal results for British seafarers' jobs.</p>
	<p pid=".212.2/8">There has been a bit of an advance in training places for officers, but even that is set at a low limit. The legislation states that there should be one training job for every 15 British seafarers employed on a particular vessel. That is pretty small beer, but such modest stuff is appreciated as it has had an effect. However, it does not guarantee employment for the cadet or trainee at the end of their training, and there are many anecdotal stories about people who have gone through the scheme and who were looking forward to a career in the merchant navy.</p>
	<p pid=".212.2/9">We should remember the background to the debate: the trades unions and the Chamber of Shipping&mdash;both sides of the argument&mdash;have been putting resources into gaining young people's interest in a career at sea, because within seven or 10 years there will be a serious skill shortage as the average age of the British seafarer is over 40. They are coming to the age at which they will retire and there is no fresh blood coming in. There is thus a paradox: both the industry and the Government recognise the need for new entrants to fill the gaps and the add-on value that can be generated by British seafarers who are reaching the end of their seagoing careers. Whether they are officers or ratings, they are a versatile group who have transferable skills and can turn their hands to other things. Their work is diverse, from running Lloyd's of London to supporting the fish market up the road. Training seafarers adds value, as one can see from the insurance market and sea and ship broking. It is not by chance that the shipping sector in the City is full of people with former seagoing experience. There are many good reasons for bringing back a link between the tonnage tax and taking on British seafarers and providing more berths for cadets.</p>
	<p pid=".212.2/10">I want to re-emphasise the issue of proportionality. No one would suggest that every ship that comes back into the tonnage regime as part of the registry will take on only British seafarers. That would not be sustainable; it would not happen. However, there should be some feedback, at least, and a quid pro quo.</p>
	<p pid=".212.2/11">We have heard about the dramatic drop in the number of seafarers, and I want to re-state the figures in terms of the proportion of UK seafarers on tonnage tax vessels in the past few years. Tonnage tax was first introduced in 2000&ndash;01, when UK seafarers at rating level were 49 per cent. of the total; the latest figures, for   2003&ndash;04 show that only 28 per cent. are British. I contrast the rising fortunes of Lord Sterling and the profitable sectors of the industry with the reducing fortunes of seafarers.</p>
	<p pid=".212.2/12">The story is not much better for officers: in 2000&ndash;01, 80 per cent. were UK seafarers, and by 2003&ndash;04 the figure had fallen to under 50 per cent. Those are pretty stark figures and we should note that the tonnage tax has not necessarily generated additional jobs for UK seafarers, because many positions already existed in shipping companies prior to the change in the regime.</p>
	<p pid=".212.2/13">At the Labour party conference this year&mdash;you will have missed that, I suppose, Mr. Deputy Speaker&mdash;the Chamber of Shipping put on a fringe meeting. I have made a point of going to every one of those fringe meetings since the Chamber of Shipping started coming to the Labour party conference. It has not always done that, but I have gone to every one at which it has had a   stand, and I have been joined by some of my colleagues here.</p>
	<p pid=".212.2/14"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/953" name="Ivan Henderson">My hon. Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr.   Henderson)</phrase> mentioned Lord Sterling's famous intervention, which I remember. His words&mdash; paraphrased, but almost to the letter&mdash;were that the Labour Government have done more in the past 18    months for British shipping than the last Government had done in the previous 18 years. That was the background to the introduction of tonnage tax, and why we expected some benefit for the trade unions and their members.</p>
	<p pid=".212.2/15">At this year's Labour party conference, the Chamber of Shipping entitled its meeting &quot;Tonnage tax and the creation of British seafarers' jobs&quot;. I suppose it labelled it that way to try to pull a few more members into the audience. Given the facts and figures outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington, such a title would be pretty ironic at any time. However, that meeting took place at the same time as P&amp;O was announcing the sacking of 1,200 British seafarers, on top of the 800 British seafarers that it had sacked 12   months ago. That background made the meeting even more inappropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".212.2/16">Strong views were expressed on the floor of the meeting by officers, sailing ratings and members of the trade unions who had come along to see whether any good news could be related on the back of tonnage tax. From the floor we received stark evidence and stark views of the effect that tonnage tax has had on British jobs. It has been negative, not positive, and that is pretty certain.</p>
	<p pid=".212.2/17">I have been fortunate enough to follow my hon. Friend, who set out everything in clear terms. We have had the privilege of meeting the Minister about this very subject and have had correspondence on all the matters. The responses are all confined to a narrow channel, which concerns the wish to be flexible, to have a shipping industry that is open and receptive and can expand and grow, and for there to be no barriers to that. We do not want barriers; we want common sense and proportionality.</p>
	<p pid=".212.2/18">My hon. Friend referred to the ITF, which said that we would soon be at the stage at which the British flag&mdash;the red ensign of which we have all been so proud for so many years&mdash;will be described as a flag of convenience. A large proportion of the vessels that are shipping into the tonnage tax regime, but not under the red ensign, come from what I would describe as some of the saddest registries in the world. If someone registers a ship in such areas, they may get cheap registration, but they also get poor inspection and low safety standards, and that results in a poor safety record.</p>
	<p pid=".212.2/19">It is easy to correlate a ship's registry with the number of accidents occurring on those vessels. I had a quick look through the list today, and saw flags from countries such as Antigua, St. Vincent, Liberia, Panama and the Marshall Islands. When I was sailing on the deep seas under the red ensign, we would look at vessels from such registries and literally give them a wide berth. We would wonder whether anyone on the bridge knew where they were going or anyone in the engine room knew what they were doing.If we are not careful, we are in danger of being so flexible, open and receptive that we will allow the standards in our registry and those applying to the ships registered under the tonnage tax regime to reduce until we come to almost the lowest common denominator and have to share the low standards that I have described and that pertain under other flags of registry.</p>
	<p pid=".212.2/20">We look forward to the results of the Inland Revenue review. We want to continue the dialogue to find not a structure that straps all tonnage tax ships into 100 per cent. British employment, but a formula that recognises that if they are, in effect, receiving benefits from British taxpayers, British taxpayers such as British seafarers should enjoy some of the benefits too.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.216.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/953" speakername="Ivan Henderson" colnum="216"  time="14:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h03.htm#41109h03_spnew15">
	<p pid=".216.0/1">I did not intend to speak, but I think that it is worth while to give an example of how a town has been decimated by the loss of the seafaring industry. We are proud of the history of the maritime industry in my constituency. This year, we are celebrating 400 years of the royal charter, and most of the celebrations have centred on the maritime industry, which has had a part to play in the Harwich area for centuries.</p>
	<p pid=".216.0/2">Let me give some background. It was so important to have people training for the seafaring industry that my secondary school&mdash;it was then the Sir Anthony Dean school but is now the Harwich secondary school&mdash;provided seamanship training as part of the curriculum. For most people, there was a natural progression from school to sea, whether they worked on the catering side, on deck or as officers. They would go to the Gravesend training school in Kent. People could also work locally for Trinity House.</p>
	<p pid=".216.0/3">The problem that we suffered started in 1984, when the previous Government privatised Sealink. At that time, 13 British-flagged ships were travelling out of Harwich; now there are only two. As I said earlier, at   that time, we had 1,800 seafarers; now, there are just   over 60 left, going out of, I imagine, Harwich International port.</p>
	<p pid=".216.0/4">Until a few weeks ago, the company Stena Line, which now operates out of Harwich International, was threatening to get rid of more British seafarers and replace them with cheaper foreign labour. Fortunately, I managed to talk to the director of Stena Line and he has now stepped back from that and has said that there will be another two years of replacing seafarer with seafarer on one ship and another five years on another, so we have a breathing space. Perhaps other shipping companies will take that on board and do exactly the same. Let us have a breathing space and leave the existing seafarers on the ships, so that we see how we get on with regard to training issues and the employment of more seafarers.</p>
	<p pid=".216.0/5">In Harwich, there is the possible massive development of a major port if the proposal goes through <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1173" name="Gwyn Prosser">the public inquiry. My hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Mr. Prosser)</phrase> pointed out that many seafaring jobs are important for the future of shore jobs. Let us consider the experience in the dock industry. Most people employed on the docks have had seafaring time and some are ex-captains of ships. Indeed, the chief executive of Harwich Haven Authority is an ex-captain of a ship. We need the seafaring skills to continue, so that they can come ashore in future.</p>
	<p pid=".216.0/6">It is also important that we give future younger generations the opportunity to experience and enjoy a maritime career. We do not do that currently. We do not go into schools and offer seafaring as a career any more; that has not been an option because of the decline in the industry.</p>
	<p pid=".216.0/7">A few weeks ago, I took part in a scheme called &quot;Get into maritime&quot;. It was headed by the Prince's Trust, which was working in partnership with Jobcentre Plus, Stena Line, DFDS Seaways, Trinity House and a maritime company in Ipswich called Fox's Marina. They all sponsored the scheme, which gave young people six days' experience of going to sea before putting them in the maritime industry for two weeks' work experience and giving them a taste of what the industry is all about. I met those young people after their six days spent tasting the adventures of going to sea, and they were really upbeat and wanted to go further in the industry. So, when the industry comes to us saying, &quot;You want us to take on more seafarers, but they're not there,&quot; that is not true. Seafaring has not been offered in schools as a career for a long time; if it were, young people would come forward to get a taste of the industry.</p>
	<p pid=".216.0/8">As I said, I was not going to speak, and I shall not speak for much longer. Let me say on behalf of my constituency, however, that if the maritime industry were a building, it would be listed. Our country's maritime industry has a proud history; we can read all about it in the history books and see the famous people who have been involved in the industry over the years. It would be a disgrace for any Government to allow the industry to deteriorate and vanish from this country. The ships in my port have been given a temporary stay of execution for a number of years, but we need to ensure&mdash;with the help of the Government and the Chamber of Shipping&mdash;that the remaining jobs in my port are kept for future years. In that way, we can give other young people the opportunity to get a taste of what people have done in the maritime industry over the years.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.217.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1280" speakername="John Thurso" colnum="217"  time="14:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h03.htm#41109h03_spnew16">
	<p pid=".217.0/1">May I begin by expressing <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" name="John McDonnell">the hope that the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> enjoys a speedy recovery to full health? I thank him for having stuck to his last and for being here to introduce the debate, because he did so exceptionally well. I appreciated the measured way in which he put the case and the fact that he made it clear that we are seeking a    balanced approach on which we can work in partnership. Had someone else introduced the debate, they may have demanded 100 per cent. British nationals on every vessel in the British fleet, which would have made it difficult for us to offer our full support. However, the measured way in which the hon. Gentleman put his argument allows us to support it fairly strongly. Indeed, I should say at the outset that I signed early-day motion 880 and encouraged as many of my colleagues as I could to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".217.0/2">In <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/953" name="Ivan Henderson">his closing remarks, the hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Henderson)</phrase> mentioned the proud history of the British merchant fleet, and we should bear that in mind. Three or four years ago, I had the singular honour of being asked to become the founder patron of the Caithness branch of the Merchant Navy Association. In preparation for the debate, I went to the association's website this afternoon and clicked on Scotland, only to discover that Caithness remains the only branch there. However, when I speak to some of the old sailors whom I meet and hear their tales about what they and their predecessors underwent in peacetime and in two world wars, I learn quite a lot. It is worth remembering that   36,000 seamen were killed in two world wars, which certainly puts the current number of about 30,000   ratings into perspective. With Remembrance day approaching, that should be at the back, if not the front, of our minds during the debate.</p>
	<p pid=".217.0/3">It is self-evident that the UK, as an island, needs a merchant fleet. The maritime industry will remain of the utmost importance. As has been mentioned, more than 90 per cent. of our freight by weight comes into the country by sea. A huge number of people are employed on passenger ships, which not only go across to the continent, but serve the northern and western isles and other parts of the United Kingdom. It is a matter of great regret that some of those jobs are now being threatened.</p>
	<p pid=".217.0/4">As has already been mentioned, we also have a coastal shipping industry, and I believe that that should be helped not only to continue but to expand. To those who are, like me, keen on the environment, using our coastal assets and resources for moving freight is important. There is much to be said for maintaining a sound merchant navy. That means making sure that British seamen and officers crew it. For those reasons, the Government were right to consider in 1997 what they could do to support the maritime industry. Without a shadow of a doubt the tonnage tax measures introduced in the Finance Act 2000 have made a significant contribution to rescuing the industry, and, certainly, to reversing its decline.</p>
	<p pid=".217.0/5">I was interested to note that the UK-based fleet has   increased to 15 million deadweight tonnes from 7.2   million in 2000 and that the flag tonnage has risen to 10 million from 2.4 million over the same period. If those figures are expressed as ratios, one third was flagged in 2000, whereas now two thirds are flagged. There has been some movement to flag, which is important.</p>
	<p pid=".217.0/6">With the introduction of the tonnage tax, the principle of a link between employment and the tax concession has already been made. Placing the training requirement in that context has already established the principle that there should be a return, and some link to employment. Therefore, the argument is not, to my mind, about the introduction of a new principle but about how far the principle should extend.</p>
	<p pid=".217.0/7">It is clear that there has not, in the relevant period, been a corresponding increase in employment of UK nationals in the fleet. The number of officers and ratings has been in decline, and projections about further decline have been made. However, unless something can be done, decline is predicted. There is a clear consensus in this Chamber and probably throughout the House that it is desirable to reverse that trend. The question is how to achieve that. In particular, would further links between the tonnage tax and employment increase employment or decrease the prospects for British shipping overall? As I have said, I have already signed early-day motion 880, so I clearly take the view that further links with employment will not damage the British shipping industry&mdash;particularly if they are introduced in the balanced and moderate way that is being espoused in the Chamber this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid=".217.0/8">The key issues include the employment of senior UK officers but not junior officers. The average age of officers in the merchant navy is 44, but 40 per cent. are over 50. Clearly, the moment is rapidly approaching when the number of senior British officers will diminish as those currently employed at sea either find shore jobs or retire. Finding employment for junior officers is also an issue. Cadet places are available and the training scheme has clearly increased the number of cadets undergoing training, but a lack of junior officer places for them to take up on finishing their training is a matter of concern.</p>
	<p pid=".217.0/9">It is a curious imbalance at a time when the world shipping industry is highlighting a worldwide lack of officers that, in this country, we cannot provide places for the junior officers who are being trained. That sends out the message to people who might be interested in entering the industry, &quot;Yes, you can get trained but, no, we can't employ you at the end of the training.&quot; A cadet came to see me at a surgery in Invergordon about precisely that worry. He was employed but very unsure of his prospects, and he was certain that he would have to go abroad for much of the early part of his career to gain employment.</p>
	<p pid=".217.0/10">There is an imbalance between the training of officers and the training of ratings. In that regard, the training requirement has not been successful. We need measures that increase the training possibilities for ratings. The one-in-15 proposal made by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington is very conservative; that is the word that he used, but I never thought that I would find myself taking part in a debate in which the RMT's Bob Crow would be described as conservative.</p>
	<p pid=".217.0/11">Clearly, it is important that we find training for ratings; there is genuine consensus regarding objectives, but the problem is working out how to achieve them. Further links would strengthen employment without detracting from the ability of the shipping industry to act in a cost-effective manner. Let us consider, for example, the one-in-15 proposal for ratings. I believe that the rate for a deck hand from a foreign country may be as little as &pound;2 an hour. Let us say, for the sake of argument, that a UK national in training is paid &pound;5 an hour&mdash;there is a &pound;3 an hour differential. If one took the cost of one in 15 at &pound;3 an hour and came to a total cost for a voyage and compared it to the total profit generated through the tonnage tax concession, I suspect that one would find it a remarkably small percentage. It is a small return to ask for from a reasonably large concession, which has been effective.</p>
	<p pid=".217.0/12">I am reminded of debates that I attended in another place in which we discussed the minimum wage. That would have been in 1997 or 1998, when I was surrounded by employers who said that the minimum wage would decimate my industry&mdash;the hospitality and catering industry&mdash;and have appalling consequences. I was told that we would all be out of business within a   year or two. In fact, the reverse was true. The fact that    we introduced more reasonable conditions enabled more people to come into the industry, and allowed better employment conditions. For that reason, I supported the minimum wage as an employer and chief executive. I see the same long-term issue here. In the short-term, employers can say, &quot;Oh dear, look at this cost that has come on us,&quot; but the industry should be looking at long-term trends and how we will get the necessary people into the industry in 10 years' time.</p>
	<p pid=".217.0/13">The hon. Gentleman will know from my comments that I stand fairly much in support of what he said so eloquently at the start of the debate. It would be impossible to have a British fleet that is manned 100 per cent. by British nationals. No one is asking for that. The balanced approach that is being asked for is a way forward, and I hope that the Government will consider it seriously. A British merchant navy consisting of no British merchant seamen is wholly unthinkable. We owe it to the proud tradition of which I spoke earlier to ensure that there is a proud future.</p>

	<p pid=".220.0/1">I    congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" name="John McDonnell">the hon.

Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)</phrase> in wishing him a speedy recovery. One would not know from his speech today that he is ill. He put his case very well, and spoke with eloquence and passion, as did the other Labour Members who spoke.</p>
	<p pid=".220.0/2">The shipping industry plays an important role in the economy of our island nation, especially with ever-increasing global trade. The case for a tonnage tax was first made in earnest back in 1997 by the Chamber of Shipping, and later by the Select Committee. I agree with the comment in the Treasury report that considered the possibility of a tonnage tax. It said:</p>
	<p pid=".220.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Our shipping industry and the skills of our seafarers have long been part of our success as a trading nation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".220.0/4">Opposition Members certainly want the shipping industry to go from strength to strength. We supported the introduction of the tonnage tax and continue to support it&mdash;I believe that the decision on that matter was right.</p>
	<p pid=".220.0/5">The hon. Members for Dover (Mr. Prosser) and for Harwich (Mr. Henderson) made great play of the fact that this Labour Government introduced the tonnage tax. That is technically correct. However, I have no doubt that, had we been in office in 2000, when the case for a tonnage tax was focused and well made, we would have done the same thing.</p>

	<p pid=".220.2/1">I think that the case developed. As it became focused and clear that worldwide pressures meant that the tonnage tax was a fair way to proceed, I have no doubt that a Conservative Government&mdash;had we still been in office&mdash;would have accepted that case.</p>

	<p pid=".220.5/1">The right hon. Gentleman probably would not remember the fact that, in my port, seafarers were replaced by Dutch seafarers on some of the main ships. That was because, in Holland, an incentive for ship companies to employ Dutch nationals had already been introduced. The previous UK Government, however, ignored the calls to go down the same road in helping our shipping industry to retain British seafarers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.221.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1026" speakername="Greg Knight" colnum="221"  time="15:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h03.htm#41109h03_spnew23">
	<p pid=".221.0/1">I do not accept that point, because I had a conversation with the hon. Gentleman's predecessor just before I visited his constituency, and that issue was   raised. The issue was actively discussed in the Conservative party at the time.</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/2">I was pleased to hear that NUMAST and others who are concerned with the industry met at this year's Labour party conference. May I invite them to attend next year's Conservative party conference, when we will be the party of government? I will be happy to welcome them to our proceedings.</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/3">Today's debate has focused on the question of employment, but it is also appropriate to acknowledge the economic benefits that tax concessions have brought.</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/4">There has been a huge increase in seaborne trade over the past few decades. The number of tonnes transported more than doubled between 1970 and the end of the last century. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank predict that world seaborne trade will rise   to 45,000 billion tonne-miles by 2012. As the hon. Member for Dover correctly said, international shipping is responsible for the carriage of 90 per cent. of world trade. It is therefore not surprising that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development estimates that merchant shipping generates an annual income of more than $380 billion in the global economy.</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/5">Despite the success of the shipping industry and its importance to world trade, the number of seafarers has   been decreasing. It is understandable, therefore, that groups such as the RMT and NUMAST are campaigning to protect their members' interests. Indeed, NUMAST's campaign literature states that it is</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/6" class="indent">&quot;working to develop a new national awareness of our Merchant Navy and to create the conditions in which the industry will flourish and prosper on the back of a core of skilled and experienced professional personnel.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/7">Those are laudable aims.</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/8">Figures published by London Metropolitan university show that the number of UK seafarers fell from 30,000 in 1997 to 25,000 in 2001&mdash;the year after the tonnage tax was first announced&mdash;but that, by 2003, the number had increased to 28,000.</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/9">The campaigns being run by the RMT and NUMAST have been successful in raising the profile of the issue. I am sure that many hon. Members on both sides of the    House will have received postcards and other correspondence from constituents who are concerned about that matter. We know that representatives from NUMAST have met Ministers and I hope that when the Minister replies to the debate, he will be able to tell us what conclusions he drew from those discussions. NUMAST's principal concern, and that of hon. Members who have spoken today, is that although tonnage tax has led to an increase in British shipping, it has not led to a corresponding increase in employment opportunities for British seafarers. I understand from parliamentary questions tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/795" name="Christopher Chope">my hon. Friend the    Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)</phrase> that 12,500   seafarers are employed on ships in the tonnage tax scheme. Some 39 per cent. of all seafarers and almost 50 per cent. of the officers are UK nationals.</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/10">The White Paper, &quot;Future of Transport&quot;, which was published in 1998, stated that two of the aims of an integrated shipping policy were:</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/11" class="indent">&quot;To promote the employment and training of British seafarers in order to keep open a wide range of job opportunities for young people and to maintain a supply of skills and experience vital to the economy&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/12">and</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/13" class="indent">&quot;To encourage UK ship registration, to increase ship owners identification with the UK, to improve our regulatory control of shipping using UK ports and waters and to maintain the availability of assets and personnel that may be needed in time of war.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/14">The Government have been partly successful in delivering some of those aims, but there are questions still to be answered. Documents published by the RMT on the tonnage tax state that when the RMT expressed support for the idea, following the publication of the Department for Transport's policy paper &quot;Charting a new course&quot;, it was expecting more than 200 new ratings to be trained under the new scheme each year. The RMT recently stated:</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/15" class="indent">&quot;Latest figures on ratings trainees disclosed at the shipping task force would seem to indicate that approximately 50 new ratings trainees are being trained every year.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/16">That is well short of the figure for which it was hoping. It continued:</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/17" class="indent">&quot;This is less than the number of ratings who were being trained at the time of the discussions on the tonnage tax.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/18">It is not hard to understand its frustration.</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/19">It is important for us to recognise that global competition remains tight despite the growth of the worldwide shipping industry, and continues to force costs down. The Select Committee on Transport found that crew wages amount to as much as 70 per cent. of the cost of running a ship. It is therefore unsurprising that operators want to minimise those costs, although I am sure that we would all agree that cost savings must never be allowed to compromise safety. I know that many hon. Members have continuing concerns about that.</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/20">I believe that British officers and ratings are among the best trained in the world, and I agree with the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington that it is important that we encourage shipowners to offer them opportunities. However, it is also important to remember that the president of the Chamber of Shipping, when giving evidence to the Transport Committee, said that</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/21" class="indent">&quot;many ship owners have the intention of training British seafarers but that any compulsion to do more might frighten companies away from Britain.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/22">I am sure that none of us wants that outcome.</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/23">The Chamber of Shipping went further in its press release of <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-26">26 August</phrase> this year, in which it said:</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/24" class="indent">&quot;A mandatory linkage as proposed by the seafarers unions would deter companies from opting for the tonnage tax or from basing a shipping business in the UK . . . This would be likely to threaten rather than support jobs . . . The tonnage tax is not a subsidy; it is an internationally competitive tax arrangement. The UK is but one of many countries to have adopted a tonnage tax; indeed the only thing unique about the tax here is that it has a training link.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/25">The Opposition do not want shipping business to go overseas, with the consequent loss of related support jobs. I suspect that the Minister does not want that either. I wonder whether introducing a rigid link that tied tonnage tax to the employment of British personnel would be lawful under EU law. Will the Minister say whether he has considered that?</p>
	<p pid=".221.0/26">I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say on this important issue. I hope that what he does say will give heart to officers and ratings. More importantly, I hope that it will not frighten away from these shores the job providers and wealth creators&mdash;the shipowners.</p>

	<p pid=".223.1/1">Thank you, Mr.   Deputy Speaker for the promotion. Alas, I am still the Under-Secretary, but I jolly well ought to have a higher rank. I must declare an interest. As well as being Under-Secretary, I am a member of the GMB.</p>
	<p pid=".223.1/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" name="John McDonnell">my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> on securing this debate. I form the third part of a three-pointed parliamentary cross-party accord by wishing him an early release from his illness.</p>
	<p pid=".223.1/3">I am pleased to say that much of the public discussion on these issues has been promoted by the maritime trades unions, and I congratulate them on doing so. My hon. Friend asked me to take away his comments and consider them; I assure him that I shall consider carefully not only his comments but those of other hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid=".223.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1280" name="John Thurso">The hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)</phrase> reminded us that it will be Remembrance Sunday this weekend. I shall be in my constituency on that day. I shall remember not only those from the armed services who gave their lives but, at the huge memorial on Plymouth Hoe, the many merchant seamen who died. The latter gave their lives in large numbers on the Atlantic convoys and in other parts of the world, but I think particularly of those who died on the Arctic convoys. They lived through the most appalling conditions and died in the most dreadful circumstances. We must remember their contribution to our nation's liberation.</p>
	<p pid=".223.1/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1173" name="Gwyn Prosser">My hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Mr. Prosser)</phrase> and others reminded us that, by weight, about 96 per cent. of all goods are imported and exported by sea. We have one of the longest coastlines in Europe&mdash;second only to that of Greece&mdash;and it is a sensitive coastline. We have to look after the environment, but it is also important to keep the safety of seafarers at heart. We share with the French one of the most dangerous and hazardous sea lanes in the world&mdash;the channel.</p>
	<p pid=".223.1/6">The issue is being discussed at two o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1026" name="Greg Knight">ther forums. The right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight)</phrase> referred to the Transport Committee inquiry into tonnage tax; I gave evidence to the Committee in June, and we await the report with interest. The Inland Revenue's post-implementation review into the tonnage tax drew to a close in September, and I look forward to the Paymaster General speaking on that matter shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".223.1/7">A number of hon. Members, particularly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/953" name="Ivan Henderson">my hon. Friends the Members for Harwich (Mr. Henderson)</phrase> and for Dover, have strong constituency links with the sea, and so do I. I am instinctively attracted to the idea that   we should do everything possible to attract and retain UK seafarers on UK ships. We have a long and honourable seafaring tradition. The Government continue to take pride in all that has been achieved since 1997 in trying to reverse the fortunes of the UK fleet. The White Paper &quot;British Shipping: Charting a new course&quot; set out a comprehensive strategy to reverse the long decline of the UK shipping industry that occurred during the previous two decades.</p>
	<p pid=".223.1/8">In answer to a point made by the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire about protecting jobs, within the context of our membership of the European Union, those jobs would be available to people in the European economic area, not to UK residents only.</p>
	<p pid=".223.1/9">We now have a thriving and high-quality shipping register. I reject the idea that our register, either by flag or by tonnage tax, is a flag of convenience. It is not. The UK-registered fleet, with our flag, is the sixth largest in the world; and we are at the top of the Paris memorandum of understanding white list. That enables us to punch above our weight in the maritime world. Last week, I had the pleasure of attending the ministerial conference on port state control in Vancouver. I am pleased to report that the United Kingdom is held in extremely high regard on maritime matters. I do not know what sort of accolade it is, but I think that I am now one of the longest serving maritime Ministers in the world. That probably says more about how short a time the others serve than about how long I have served.</p>
	<p pid=".223.1/10">In considering whether to introduce an employment link into the UK tonnage tax regime, we must be aware that the issue is finely balanced. My hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington alluded to that. We want to improve opportunities for employment for seafarers, but we must be careful that, in doing that, we do not jeopardise the progress that we have made in reviving the UK merchant fleet. Increasingly, other countries are introducing tonnage tax regimes. The reduction of the relative competitiveness of the UK tonnage tax scheme might result in shipping companies electing to enter schemes in other countries or leave the UK flag. That would ultimately further reduce employment opportunities for UK seafarers and the shore-based staff who are so important, and, equally important, reduce our control over safety and standards. While we have a fleet of some size, we have some control over the quality of not only the ships themselves, but the employment conditions on board them.</p>
	<p pid=".223.1/11">From 2000, when the tonnage tax regime was introduced, to the end of June 2004, deadweight tonnage increased from 5.2 million tonnes to 12.3   million. There has also been a healthy trend in the profile of the register, towards larger and younger ships. Although the number of ships on the register might not be so large, some are very big vessels indeed, and carry a lot of goods and employ a considerable number of people.</p>
	<p pid=".223.1/12">Although the tonnage tax has undoubtedly played an important part in the increase of the UK merchant fleet, it is only one of a package of measures. Other factors have also helped to create a highly favourable environment for UK shipping, including the registration reforms that the Maritime and Coastguard Agency instituted. We cannot say that there is a direct causal link between the tonnage tax and the growth of the register, but 54 per cent. of the ships in the scheme are UK-flagged, and the UK-registered fleet is the sixth largest in the world.</p>
	<p pid=".223.1/13">I should like to say a few words about the importance of the tonnage tax to the UK economy. London is the world's largest provider of maritime services. The UK is an attractive base for overseas ship managers, with the well known assets of the time zone, the language, stability and the culture. Overseas owners with agencies here sustain more than 4,500 jobs, contributing around &pound;1 billion in overseas earnings and bringing work to City firms that specialise in services related to shipping. The introduction of the tonnage tax is important because of the support that it provides for our shore-based industries.</p>
	<p pid=".223.1/14">My hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington talked about shipping companies avoiding paying and the taxpayer making an investment. If we have given tax relief, it is taxation forgone, rather than an investment that the Government have made. If the tonnage tax regime was not attractive to a company, it could easily switch to somewhere else or decide not to come under our regime. That is why we have been so careful to ensure that coming under our tax regime is attractive to companies.</p>

	<p pid=".225.0/1">What will attract companies to remain and to engage with the tonnage tax, and therefore to employ UK seafarers, is clearly a matter of balance. However, when Lord Alexander made the last independent assessment of the issue in 1999, he made clear his concern at the inadequacy of the commitment to the link between what we gain from the tonnage tax and the employment of UK seafarer ratings. We need to take heed of that independent assessment, because it has proved accurate.</p>

	<p pid=".225.1/1">If we can make that link in a way that ensures that we carry on getting ships on to our flag and under our tonnage tax regime but that does not damage our prospects, we will do just that.</p>
	<p pid=".225.1/2">Flags of convenience are usually for ships that will find a country where the inspection level is poor or little regard is given to it. If a ship comes on to our flag, it is given the most rigorous inspection by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, and it would not be allowed to fly the UK flag if it did not meet those high standards. An assessment is made by the Inland Revenue as part of the process of identifying vessels and companies that qualify for tonnage tax.</p>
	<p pid=".225.1/3">The International Transport Workers Federation made an allegation about ships operated by Lapthorn, saying that they do not comply with parts of International Labour Organisation conventions 147 and 178. Those allegations were investigated by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, which found that, with the exception of a few minor issues relating to ILO convention 178, the vessel was well maintained and had an apparently contented, motivated and industrious crew. If there is any evidence to suggest otherwise, I will be pleased to receive it and will pass it on to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to ensure that a further inspection takes place.</p>

	<p pid=".226.0/1">Is it not the case that a company currently registered in, say, the Marshall Islands&mdash;wherever they are&mdash;which elects to come under the tonnage tax regime rather than the registry and the flag, can maintain its standards under the original registry, which we all agree are second class?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid=".226.1/1">But also, to come on to tonnage tax, the company would have to demonstrate that a large part was run from the United Kingdom. It could not simply come under our tonnage tax regime.</p>
	<p pid=".226.1/2">My hon. Friend made a sensible and pragmatic contribution to the debate, particularly in mentioning the one in 15 training commitment for officers. After three years, three lots of one in 15 make one fifth. So once a company has been under the tonnage tax regime for more than three years, the training commitment is more than one in 15. The challenge is finding jobs for those trainees.</p>
	<p pid=".226.1/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Harwich, as always a strong advocate for his constituency on maritime issues, made the powerful case for employing young people and set out the desperate need to replace some of the older generation working shore side. Young people need experience at sea if they are to be the best people to work shore side in the future. It is important to get people to sea so that they have the relevant experience to maintain the shore side industry, which is equally as important.</p>
	<p pid=".226.1/4">We have also seen an encouraging increase in seafarer training. The support for maritime training scheme&mdash;SMarT&mdash;has been running since 1998. It provides support for the training of officers and ratings, and has a budget of &pound;9.4 million a year. There were 621 new starters during 2003&ndash;04. That is not enough, but it was an 11 per cent. increase on the previous year. We are doing all that we can to increase training, but we have started from a low base.</p>
	<p pid=".226.1/5">I am sympathetic to the idea of improving our flag and getting more vessels on to tonnage tax. I am also attracted by the idea of getting more UK people on board ships and working either as officers or ratings. It is not only vital for the merchant fleet, but for jobs on shore. We will look carefully to see how we can create an employment link that does not deter new ships from coming on to the tax or our flag.</p>

	Police (Arrest and Charging Times)

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.227.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/695" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="227"  time="15:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h04.htm#41109h04_spnew0">
	<p pid=".227.1/1">It is my view that we could effectively increase the amount of time that police officers currently spend on the street by 25 or 30 per cent., and today I should like to explain how. First, I pay tribute to the people who work as police officers and prosecutors for the Nottinghamshire constabulary and the Crown Prosecution Service. They do an excellent job and I am indebted to them for their advice in briefing me on this speech; any mistakes and the policy I am about to articulate remain entirely my own.</p>
	<p pid=".227.1/2">I come to the subject as the result of a specific incident. As part of my police parliamentary scheme, I did a shift&mdash;7 am to 4 pm&mdash;in a Nottinghamshire police response car. During the day, which I understand was typical, we dealt with just two cases. The first was a minor neighbours' altercation, which I was surprised to see given the priority of a response vehicle visit. However, the second case was responding to an emergency call to arrest an 18-year-old who had smashed a window in a hostel. The officer located the youth on the street and with great skill calmed him down, persuaded him not to run, and put him in the car under arrest. The arrest was made at 11.43 am. That was the end of the officer's day on the street. He spent the rest of his day until he finished his shift at 4 pm processing the arrest.</p>
	<p pid=".227.1/3">Surely the role of an expensively trained, experienced response officer using a costly vehicle&mdash;I understand that it is &pound;38,000-worth of Volvo plus all the kit&mdash;should be to arrest the individual, bring him to the custody section and give a full statement relevant to his specific involvement. The prisoner and the consequent development of a prosecution file should then be handed over to an appropriate responsible individual so that the front-line officer can within no more than an hour or so be back on the street, using his skills and equipment to do the job we all expect of him or her.</p>
	<p pid=".227.1/4">Instead, in this instance, the officer had to do the following&mdash;I accompanied him every step of the way, so   this is a first-hand account. First, he presented the prisoner to the custody section, helped to fill out the appropriate forms, removed possessions and put the offender in a cell. Secondly, he requested a colleague to get a statement from the people at the scene of the offence. He later had to chase this up and, at the request of other individuals in the chain, require further details on the colleague's statement. Thirdly, he had to type up   his own statement. No copy typist is employed. At one point, three fellow response officers, out of four on duty in the division that day, were doing similar tasks in the police station&mdash;one-fingered typing while their vehicles remained parked inside the police station. An experienced copy typist, picking up procedural niceties as they went, could retrieve hours of street time for officers.</p>
	<p pid=".227.1/5">The statement, which was now one of several pieces of paper beginning to form a prosecution file, then had to be checked by the largely civilian case progression office. Those working in that office do not take responsibility for a case; they critique the paperwork, requesting additions and changes. That necessitated the officer in this instance revisiting the prisoner downstairs in custody and contacting colleagues to collect and collate further information&mdash;including, remarkably, being asked to provide the precise dimensions of the window that had been smashed. We then had to visit the arrest investigation team, which is composed of police officers. They, too, requested the officer to undertake various actions.</p>
	<p pid=".227.1/6">I was never given a convincing explanation of why a separate CPO and AIT were needed, especially since neither relieved the officer of responsibility for the case. The officer then had to wait in a queue of other officers, who no doubt could have been better employed, to present the file to the Crown Prosecution Service. At that point, the shift ended. I am therefore not sure whether further work was requested by the CPS on another day, or whether there were additional links in the chain that we were yet to reach, because we all went off duty at 4 o'clock.</p>
	<p pid=".227.1/7">Police officers have told me that that was a typical experience&mdash;indeed, most cases are far more time consuming than that one, which was a very straightforward case, in which the individual had admitted his guilt on arrest and there were no time-consuming care or medical issues. I shall write to the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety about the care and medical issues rather than delay the hon. Members by detailing them today.</p>
	<p pid=".227.1/8">When my colleagues and I say to the public that we have more police officers in Nottinghamshire than ever before, which is absolutely true, the public respond, equally correctly, by asking, &quot;Well where are they?&quot; Perhaps the case I have outlined provides part of the answer. It also raises a number of questions.</p>
	<p pid=".227.1/9">First, let me say that CPS charging in stations is a very welcome development. No one was satisfied with the previous charging regime, in which the preparation of case papers was often sloppy, many cases were lost when they went to court, and an incredible amount of time of officers, prosecutors, witnesses and others, including victims, was wasted. However, in putting the process right, we must be careful that the pendulum does not swing too far the other way. Why do the police have to complete such a full file in cases such as the one I described? Do regulations need to be made more flexible so that the CPS is empowered or instructed to do   a minimal fast-track file in such cases? Lengthy processes might mean fewer arrests and fewer cases going to court. If only those cases with a 70 per cent., rather than a 50 per cent., chance of winning go ahead, the objective of a higher percentage of cases being successful in court will, of course, be achieved; but if that Government target is achieved at a cost of fewer criminals going in front of the courts and of taking more police off the streets, it will be too high a price to pay.</p>
	<p pid=".227.1/10">Secondly, what is the Home Office's expectation of front-line officers? Should we, as one senior police officer told me, expect arresting officers normally to be their own case progression officer? If so, we should be frank with those officers and the public and stop pretending that more officers mean more visible and active street policing, when it does not mean that.</p>
	<p pid=".227.1/11">Thirdly, what is the cost of police time? Let us suppose that every officer uses half of his or her time in the way that I described&mdash;I was told that the case was typical. If so, of Nottinghamshire police's &pound;168 million budget, how many millions go on getting case papers &quot;CPS ready&quot;, as the jargon goes&mdash;&pound;20 million, &pound;30 million? Perhaps the Minister can tell us how much it actually costs in Nottinghamshire. I am sure that she will write to me if she does not have the figure to hand. Should the CPS be billed for such work or continue to get a massive hidden subsidy from the police budget, suffering no financial cost and therefore having no incentive to speed up or shorten the process when appropriate, as some police officers contend it does. Let us face up to and allocate the real financial costs as well as the operational costs of running the system as we do, so that we can at least make honest judgments about whether it should be done like that, whether it happens by accident, or whether there is a better way to do it if we intend to release the time of front-line police officers.</p>
	<p pid=".227.1/12">When the constabulary asks for yet more officers, it seeks public support by implying that extra personnel would be out there on the estates, tackling antisocial behaviour or arresting villains. If, in fact, half of any   additional officers' time is to be spent on file preparation, we should be told; otherwise such a claim could be portrayed as an inadvertent manipulation of the local press. If, however, we expect police station managers to get arresting officers back out on to the streets at the earliest opportunity, the Home Office and the Department for Constitutional Affairs need to be very clear about who takes responsibility for case progression once an arresting officer has made his statement and put the offender in custody. Should that responsible person be a civilian, a retired police officer, or some sort of specialist police case progresser?</p>
	<p pid=".227.1/13">No national blueprint has been developed for how to do the administrative support work in the custody suite, so all forces have to invent their own wheel. Most of the work does not need police officers, but chief constables are severely constrained from reducing the number of police officers to pay for more people to work in that field. A specialist grade of professional investigator seems to be an obvious solution. Alternatively, might the CPS itself take on the task after arrest and be directly, honestly and openly funded to employ its own staff for case progression?</p>
	<p pid=".227.1/14">Before any of the more radical solutions are considered, the Home Office and the Department for Constitutional Affairs must now demand that better informal liaison be created between local police officers and local CPS prosecutors. Both sets of people whom I   encountered were working incredibly hard and are   deeply committed to their jobs, yet the degree of misunderstanding between them is massive. Although much can be done at county and divisional level, real progress will be achieved by informal interaction in the canteen and the corridor, which must be generated and promoted.</p>
	<p pid=".227.1/15">My attempts to facilitate that at local level have drawn the response that this is &quot;political interference.&quot; However, the consequences of failures in the criminal justice system are simply too important to my constituents to be allowed to escape effective scrutiny and accountability, not least by Members of Parliament. The criminal justice system is not some private club of professionals who hide behind professional or judicial independence whenever a question is asked, instead of   confidently engaging in dialogue and explanation. Recently, the criminal justice system has been most successful where it has a human face: beat officers, the   drug abuse resistance education project and community-nominated work for young offenders have all been fought for or developed locally, all have a human face, and all involve someone who is known to the public. The least successful aspects of the criminal justice system are those where public interface is shunned or resented. However, public involvement and consultation will fail if they are centrally imposed targets&mdash;boxes to be ticked rather than deeply felt and systematic local engagement.</p>
	<p pid=".227.1/16">All those involved in the criminal justice system are facing massive cultural change. It is often deeply uncomfortable, but at least we are trying at local level. I commend the efforts of all those on the local criminal justice board, the Crown prosecutor in Nottingham, the chief constable of Nottinghamshire and many others who are at least trying to come to terms with the problems. I wonder if the centre can say the same. The criminal justice system must be re-united with the public whom it is meant to serve, just as police officers must be enabled to do the job that we expect of them.</p>

	<p pid=".230.0/1">I join <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/695" name="Graham Allen">my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> in thanking his local police, Crown prosecutors and the whole team who keep the community that he represents safe. My colleagues and I welcome his efforts to shed the light of public opinion on community safety and to form and build relationships between partners in community safety.</p>
	<p pid=".230.0/2">I am very glad that my hon. Friend secured this important debate on the day that the Home Secretary announced the White Paper on police reform, in which we make clear our commitment to spreading effective neighbourhood policing. That type of policing engages not only the officers but the community and community support officers&mdash;some of whom, as my hon. Friend knows, I met in Beeston police station&mdash;in providing a service that is focused on the needs of us, their customers. We also make clear our determination to modernise the work force&mdash;my hon. Friend made some proposals in that respect&mdash;and our recognition of the fact that we need greater involvement of communities and the public in holding the police to account. My hon. Friend has described his efforts to obtain that, and I hope that he will be reassured that that is a clear and substantial part of our ambition set out in the White Paper announced today in the House.</p>
	<p pid=".230.0/3">Part of my hon. Friend's concern is about administrative burdens&mdash;the paperwork and inefficient working practices that keep police officers away from their fundamental job. Although we must emphasise that keeping records is an essential safeguard in the criminal justice system, providing protection for practitioners and the public, we must consider how we can ensure that process-driven requirements place the minimum burden on our police officers. That is why we are establishing a strategic framework to enable police officers to focus on their key role of tackling crime and providing reassurance to the public.</p>
	<p pid=".230.0/4">My hon. Friend raised several important points about the statutory charging scheme. The first phase of a new scheme that requires Crown prosecutors to make the charging decision in all but the most minor cases is in many places beginning to replicate the significant benefits achieved in the pilot scheme. According to the latest data from the Crown Prosecution Service, the scheme is demonstrating the potential to bring a further 30,000 additional offences to justice each year. I know that my hon. Friend is concerned that that might not happen in his area. I am citing national data, but we need to make sure that we achieve our ambitions in every area.</p>
	<p pid=".230.0/5">Charging is just the first step in the new prosecution team approach being adopted by the police and the CPS. The prosecution team ethos means a joint approach by both agencies to improving performance and bringing more offenders to justice. The shadow scheme, under which CPS duty prosecutors have provided advice to police officers on how an offender should be charged, has been judged a success. Measures introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 mean that it is now a legal requirement for the CPS duty prosecutors to make those decisions as police force areas migrate to the statutory scheme. My hon. Friend's area is at a relatively early stage of that migration.</p>
	<p pid=".230.0/6">Police have generally welcomed the opportunity to work with the CPS at the early stage of investigations. They see the value of the development of a prosecution team approach with colleagues in that service to ensure that they have the strongest possible cases to present to them. However, I recognise that the processes and the way they work are the real test of whether every area is delivering value. The aim is to establish processes for referral to senior managers in both police and the CPS in the event of disagreement, and those processes are designed to work speedily, but the key consideration is ensuring either that offenders are brought to justice, or that the appropriate method of disposal is achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".230.0/7">The aim of early consultation with the CPS is to add value to the charging process. My hon. Friend rightly raised his concerns about the engagement of police officers in what he referred to as getting case papers &quot;CPS-ready&quot;, but I would like to think that we have introduced an important structure of closer working for the benefit of the criminal justice system. Its aim is to improve efficiency and effectiveness and, crucially&mdash;I know that my hon. Friend and the police and the CPS in his area share this ambition&mdash;to bring offenders to justice. I   acknowledge that my hon. Friend has constructive proposals on local case handling, involving clarity of responsibility between police and the CPS, case progress support, and specifying a defined point at which cases should be handed to the CPS. Those are important views, which support the concept of team working that I know he welcomes.</p>
	<p pid=".230.0/8">My hon. Friend sort of asked us to produce a blueprint for how the system should work everywhere; he is frustrated that police areas sometimes feel as though they are reinventing the wheel. However, one of the things that pilot schemes have shown is that one size does not fit all. We need to ensure that the impact that charging has made on performance is developed area by area. We want every area to increase the number of cases in which detection leads to successful prosecution. We do not want things to fall off the trail or cases not to be pursued. We want to make it easier to achieve success: from the moment that a police officer engages with a criminal, we want to move as fast as possible from detection to successful prosecution and sentencing.</p>
	<p pid=".230.0/9">Like me, in 1997 my hon. Friend put through many of the doors in his constituency a pledge card committing us to bring offenders to justice more speedily. We have made significant progress on that pledge. The scheme has the capacity to make much more progress, but we must be sure that it works in detail. In my hon. Friend's area, there will be an assessment of the data in January 2005 to determine the impact of statutory charging on sanction detection rates&mdash;that is, what number of cases are successfully prosecuted.</p>
	<p pid=".230.0/10">My hon. Friend made a number of proposals about work force modernisation. Our prisoner processing units aim to provide an appropriate level of expertise in dealing with arrests, including specialist prisoner handling staff who can be assigned to receive prisoners from uniformed officers, who will then be free to return to normal patrol or to conduct specific enquiries regarding the suspect. In some cases&mdash;for example in the Wiltshire constabulary, which piloted the scheme&mdash;the increase in officer availability through their not having to deal with so many detainees reveals that the time spent on preventive street patrols was increased from 22   per cent. to 27 per cent. When well handled, it can work. I understand that my hon. Friend is concerned that it has not worked well enough. However, while I was in his area, I met a number of CSOs. One powerful feature of that team was that they are not withdrawn from the street. While we are getting the process right, we are ensuring that street patrols are being delivered in his area.</p>
	<p pid=".230.0/11">We are committed to reducing unnecessary paperwork of the sort that keeps police off the streets. As I have indicated today, that is being taken forward in a number of ways. We are looking at ways in which officers can remain on the street and deal effectively with offenders, including the introduction of fixed penalty notices to allow the officer to get back on to the street more quickly.</p>
	<p pid=".230.0/12">In Nottinghamshire, the police and the CPS went live with the new charging arrangements in July. The new arrangements represent a significant cultural shift for    both organisations. The charging programme board remains fully engaged with each of the statutory charging police forces and CPS areas, and is engaged in post-implementation reviews in each area. As my hon. Friend knows, when we met officers last week, we found that many of them thought that the CPS was prosecuting only those cases with a realistic prospect of conviction, and that much of the officers' time was spent queuing up for CPS consideration. On that latter point, Beeston and a number of other stations in the Nottingham area use the central Bridewell court. That results in officers travelling from their station to the Bridewell court from several locations, and there are delays while waiting to discuss their case with the prosecutor. It is an accommodation problem that has resource implications in terms of the number of prosecutors available, but I know that the police and the CPS are looking closely at how to resolve it. The CPS is considering making visits to outlying police stations, but we must ensure that it does that regularly enough so that it can provide the accessibility that the officers require.</p>
	<p pid=".230.0/13">The second and crucial concern is that the CPS is being overselective in the choice of cases to proceed to charge and that further inquiries being made at the request of the CPS are on behalf of that agency. I have mentioned the assessment process that will be conducted in January 2005 to consider the impact, both positive and negative, in different parts of the country. We know that new arrangements can result in more efficient use of police and prosecution time and that they can increase the number of offenders brought to justice. We must work together on the board, all of whose members are committed to the process, to ensure that that happens in Nottinghamshire. The issues that my hon. Friend raised, which I know are prevalent in Nottinghamshire, will be considered by the policing bureaucracy steering group on <phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase>. There are burdens associated with the charging scheme. That is why the steering group will, with the police, the CPS and the courts, examine how best to deal with those issues.</p>
	<p pid=".230.0/14">I galloped through those points because I wanted to make it clear to my hon. Friend that his voice, and that of the people who spoke to me and other Home Office Ministers while we were in Nottingham, play a substantial role in ensuring that we engineer the detail of our ambitious programme to bring more people to justice and get more police on the beat in a way that fits the situation on the ground. My hon. Friend suggested that clearer central guidance might help to achieve that. I suggest that an approach that focuses on key themes and clear central relationships being built up and that draws on the experience on the street, which he so clearly described, is genuinely the best way to deliver the efficiency and effectiveness that we want.</p>
	<p pid=".230.0/15">We have ensured that there are more police than ever before in Nottinghamshire. We have added to their number CSOs. We have created a structure that brings together the police, the Crown prosecutors and other aspects of the criminal justice system more closely than previously. We are in the early stages of some new parts of that relationship and it will not always go wonderfully in every respect. However, we know from the pilots that they can produce radical change that means more offenders being brought to justice and more police having more time on the streets. That is what we are seeking to achieve. Our visit to the east midlands proved my next point more powerfully than all the speeches that Ministers can make: it is from the bottom up, by testing new procedures, that we can guarantee that our ambitious plans are delivered in practice. Creating a single central blueprint creates the risk of not policing individual communities properly.</p>

	<p pid=".234.0/1">The Minister is being generous in her reply. I know that she is not suggesting this, but it would be perverse if we had less well trained CSOs on the front line because trained police officers were tied up with duties in police stations. Might it not be a good idea to have relatively untrained officers doing the investigation in stations on behalf of the CPS, and fully fledged, well trained officers out on the ground, where we have paid them to be?</p>

	<p pid=".234.1/1">There is a team approach. On work force modernisation, I accept my hon. Friend's point that civilians could take over some roles that are currently undertaken by police officers. We have made substantial improvements in civilianisation, but we should not reduce the value of CSOs, who have a special relationship with the neighbourhoods that they serve.</p>

	<p pid=".235.1/1">I   welcome the opportunity to have this debate and I appreciate the fact that the Minister met my colleagues and me earlier this year to discuss some of the issues. There are at least two areas on which we certainly agree, and one on which I hope to be able to persuade the Minister to agree with me.</p>
	<p pid=".235.1/2">The first area on which we agree is that there are outstanding staff in the national health service, not least   in Cornwall. They do an extremely good job in conditions that have traditionally been difficult, and that work is appreciated both across parties and across Cornwall. I get a lot of letters from people expressing their appreciation for the work of staff, particularly at Royal Cornwall hospital, and their concerns about the pressures under which staff work. The second area on which the Minister and I agree, is the Government decision, since the last general election, to raise taxes to increase investment in the NHS. The Liberal Democrats argued for that, so we welcome it and acknowledge that investment in the NHS has increased as a result. It is important to put that on the record; otherwise it might sound as though I do not acknowledge that when I voice my concerns.</p>
	<p pid=".235.1/3">The area on which I wish to concentrate&mdash;I informed the Minister's office of this in advance&mdash;is the concern in Cornwall and Devon about two coming changes in the way in which the Government propose to fund the NHS in future. They are, first, the combination of changes to the market forces factor that have been introduced over the past couple of years and, secondly, the implications for formal NHS funding for the future, particularly once it is formalised into the new tariff system, if it is done in the way that is currently planned.</p>
	<p pid=".235.1/4">The market forces factor has been in place for many years. It dates back to 1976. The great majority of its purpose is to adjust funding to allow for the realities of differing local costs in delivering health services in different parts of the country. Some 70 per cent. of it   relates to an adjustment to take into account local wage rates, but that adjustment has, until recently, been modified in two respects. First, there was a dampening, so that areas of high wages did not get the full implied benefit in extra funding, and areas of low wages did not get the full implied disbenefit, in recognition of the fact that people in the NHS operate on national pay scales, so, although there may some link to local earnings outside the NHS, it is far from a complete one.</p>
	<p pid=".235.1/5">Secondly, and perhaps more significantly from our point of view as MPs representing the poorest county in England, the lowest 47 of the 117 wage zones based around counties, unitary authorities and metropolitan authority areas counted as one block, so, as the poorest, Cornwall was, in effect, raised 47 places in the assessment, the result of which was that the notional funding impact on the NHS in Cornwall was much less than it would have been had there been a direct link to   local wages outside the NHS. Although everyone might have argued about it, no one disagreed with the fundamental principle that there should be adjustments to reflect local costs. However, I am not aware of anyone arguing that the NHS costs should directly reflect local wage rates.</p>
	<p pid=".235.1/6">Under the old system, the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS trust was assumed to be able to operate at 4 per cent. below the national average in funding terms&mdash;indeed, it was regarded as efficient because it was operating slightly more cost-efficiently than that. However, a year or so ago, a new system was introduced in relation to the market forces factor. That system introduced a direct 1:1 ratio in respect local wages, with no dampening for low or high-wage areas and, perhaps even more significantly, taking into account all 117 wage zones. In effect, Cornwall dropped 47 places and then got no help in acknowledgement of the fact that the impact of those low wages would not directly transfer into NHS costs.</p>
	<p pid=".235.1/7">The result of the introduction of that new system was a huge increase in the range between the highest and the lowest, with the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS trust, for example, which is in the lowest-pay county, being at   minus 12 per cent. of the level at which it could notionally operate compared with national average funding needs, and the highest hospital in London being at plus 28 per cent. That is a full 40 per cent. range in the levels of costs at which hospitals were assumed to operate, despite the fact that they continued to work on the basis of national pay scales. That change in reference costs meant that, in one year, the RCHT moved from being patted on the back for being relatively efficient against the reference costs, to being told that it was performing very badly, despite the fact that its actual costs had not changed at all.</p>
	<p pid=".235.1/8">The basis of the change is questionable. It is hard to see how it can be assumed that the difficulties of recruitment and retention in high-wage areas and the costs of extra agency nurses, and the ease of recruitment and retention in low-wage areas because of the NHS being relatively well paid compared with those outside, could lead to the costs in the NHS being directly related to average wages. It would be a bit of a coincidence if there were a 1:1 link. It is hard to see how there could be.</p>
	<p pid=".235.1/9">When I asked where the notional link came from, the first answer that I received was that it was based on research data from Warwick university. However, the university applies only the wage data; it has not done any research that indicates what effect that has on NHS   costs. I then asked who had done such research. However, as far as I can determine, there is no independent academic research that verifies the link, nor has there been any internal, Department of Health research that verifies it. It seems to be no more than a theory.</p>
	<p pid=".235.1/10">That theory would not matter too much, if it did not relate to the funding that our hospitals will receive in future. However, with the introduction of the system of tariffs, funding will be adjusted over time&mdash;it will not happen overnight&mdash;to bring the amount that hospitals get for each operation in line with the tariff, and it seems that the tariff is to be directly in line with the notional link between wages outside the NHS and inside it, despite the fact that in my area, we have the lowest wages in the UK outside the NHS, whereas inside the NHS we operate on national pay scales.</p>
	<p pid=".235.1/11">As that system is brought in, other areas will receive funding increases, but we will not share equally in the increase, because the aim is to bring the tariff into line with the idea that hospitals' costs are linked to local wages. Cornwall's will then fall gradually to become the worst-funded health service in the UK because, outside the NHS, we have the lowest wages anywhere in the country, and Devon will not be far behind us. The new system assumes a direct 1:1 link between local wages and NHS costs despite national NHS pay scales. The full impact will be a downward adjustment of Devon and Cornwall funding of &pound;102.3 million in 2003&ndash;04. As I said at the start, I am not saying that there should be no adjustment to take account of local costs, but it is hard to understand why it is believed that there should be a direct link with our very low local wage levels.</p>

	<p pid=".237.1/1">Since 1976, when the last detailed academic research took place, we have operated on the system that I described, which would result in a much smaller adjustment. That is what happened before. In those circumstances, the RCHT was operating at lower costs than expected; now, it is argued that its costs are higher than expected, but the difference for the trust is the difference in funding from a 4 per cent. negative to a 12 per cent. negative compared with the national average. I would certainly prefer the old system&mdash;I might argue that even that was ungenerous, given the other costs of operating in a wide geographic dispersed area, the cost of tourism, and so on.</p>
	<p pid=".237.1/2">The question for the Minister is why the Government have decided to change from a system that existed until a couple of years ago at the very moment that they are introducing a tariff system that will have a maximum impact on our hospitals. I hope that the hon. Lady will join the Liberal Democrats, who are opposing what, if implemented, will be a huge smash-and-grab raid on Cornwall NHS funding.</p>

	<p pid=".237.2/1">Is my hon.

Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton)</phrase>, in June this year? He acknowledged that Cornwall's NHS funding was below national averages and that in the review of formula the intention was to bring Cornwall's funding closer to national parity, because he thought that Cornwall was being underfunded.

Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson)</phrase>, intervened to keep the cottage hospitals open, he promised that we would get a review of funding that would result in increased funding. He did so precisely because he accepted that the problem in maintaining hospital services in the county was caused by fair money not being made available. However, he was replaced and we heard no more about the change. We now face radical change in the opposite direction, which will mean that Cornwall's NHS will get the worst funding in the country under the Labour Government, because we have the lowest wages outside the NHS. To be frank, that is hard for people to understand and accept. It is particularly hard to accept from a Labour Government who, in many other Departments, are trying their best to improve the situation in Cornwall and to put in increased investment precisely because of our poverty.</p>
	<p pid=".237.3/2">In Education questions the other day, I asked the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1296" name="Stephen Twigg">the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Twigg)</phrase>, whether there were plans to introduce the same crazy system in education, where there is a broad area cost adjustment, and therefore more money for high-wage areas than for the rest of the country, but nothing that ties funding directly to local wages. He ruled it out. It is hard to see why it does not apply in education, but does apply in the NHS. That shows a lack of joined-up government&mdash;at least I hope that that is the explanation; if not, the implication is that we will see the same trend in police funding, education funding and local government funding. It is hard to see why the Government would not do that if they believed that it was right for the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".237.3/3">The crucial point is that the final decisions have not been made. The Government have said that they will apply a market forces factor and that the principle of that is not open for negotiation. As I have said, we are not arguing that it should not apply. It has for many years been accepted in broad terms across the parties that some kind of adjustment needs to be made. The issues still up for decision are how great the impact will be on individual trusts and whether it will be fair to individual trusts, which I take to mean that the link to very small-scale changes in wages will go all the way through the system so that Cornwall will get the least help of any area. I hope that I can persuade the Minister to go to her colleagues and argue that that cannot possibly be right.</p>
	<p pid=".237.3/4">I have some specific questions for the Minister, of which I have notified her. First, I would like an answer   to my question about the academic research underpinning the theory. I cannot establish that there is any. If the Minister says that there is, I hope that she will place it in the House of Commons Library so that hon. Members can see it&mdash;after all, Cornwall is not the only area affected by such issues, even if it is the worst affected. Secondly, if we are going to base figures on local wage rates, even if only partially, what is the date of the pay survey currently being used and how often will it be updated? Wages can change rapidly, and the anecdotal evidence suggests that they are changing rapidly in Cornwall; public sector employers such as the county council and the hospitals used to find it easy to recruit administrative staff, for example, on relatively low local government and NHS pay grades, but they are now finding it very difficult to recruit or retain staff because private sector salaries are rising. That is a sign of the success of policies such as objective 1 funding in improving the economy, but it suggests that if out-of-date figures are adopted, the results will be very unfair.</p>
	<p pid=".237.3/5">I understand that Devon and Cornwall will be the areas worst hit by the change. That would be quite out of line with the effects in most areas. Can the Minister confirm that? When will the final decision on tariffs be taken? <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1297" name="Paul Tyler">My hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler)</phrase> wrote to request a meeting through the Secretary of State for Health with one of the departmental team, and we would still appreciate such a meeting. Although I would be grateful to hear from the Minister what was said, we would like to talk the matter through in detail before a final decision is taken.</p>
	<p pid=".237.3/6">To be blunt, it is extremely unfair of the Government, and wrong in principle, to assume that there is a direct link between local wages in the poorest parts of the country and the ability to deliver health services in an NHS that still operates on national pay scales. I hope that the Minister can see that, and that although she may not be able to give a final verdict on the decision, she will agree to take the issue back to her colleagues.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-09.239.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1332" speakername="Rosie Winterton" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health"  colnum="239"  time="16:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/halltext/41109h05.htm#41109h05_spmin0">
	<p pid=".239.0/1">First, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1274" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> on securing the debate. He and other hon. Members with constituencies in the south-west peninsula have raised the topic in the House on several occasions. Before I    speak to the specific issues, I thank the hon. Gentleman for drawing attention to the very good work that is being done by NHS staff throughout the peninsula and the fact that they are delivering good-quality services. I join him in paying tribute to all the staff, who are dedicated and committed to the process. Ministers from the Department of Health spent a day in the area recently; unfortunately, due to parliamentary business, I could not go, but I know that my colleagues were most impressed by the range of projects and facilities that have been developed across the peninsula. They saw for themselves the commitment of NHS staff in the area.</p>
	<p pid=".239.0/2">I thank the hon. Gentleman for acknowledging the   Government's increased spending in the NHS. He   described concerns about funding, but between 2003 and 2008, in addition to the increased expenditure in the NHS, it will be improved even further, by about &pound;36 billion. That means that NHS organisations in the   south-west peninsula are receiving record funding increases. Altogether, primary care trusts in the peninsula will receive a cash increase of nearly &pound;390 million over the three-year period. The three PCTs in Cornwall will receive an increase in funding of more than &pound;125 million&mdash;a cash increase of 30 per cent. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman agrees that funding has increased that that it reaching the local level. Some real changes are resulting: waiting times are falling; patients with suspected cancer are seen by a specialist very quickly; 96 per cent. of patients are in and out of accident and emergency within four hours; and new buildings and new facilities are coming on stream .</p>
	<p pid=".239.0/3">The hon. Gentleman touched on some of the problems that the area faces in achieving financial balance. Obviously, I am sure that all hon. Members agree that the annual expenditure of the NHS must remain within the resources allocated by Parliament. NHS organisations, including those in Cornwall, receive a fair share of resources and have a corresponding responsibility to manage them effectively. If they do not do that and we have to wipe the slate clean in one area, the money has to come from another area within the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".239.0/4">That is not to say that I do not recognise some of the challenges facing the south-west peninsula. The strategic health authority and the Department's recovery and support unit are working closely: the unit meets the SHA monthly to discuss its progress against key requirements and performance targets. Following representations from local Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/702" name="Candy Atherton">my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton )</phrase>, about the problems sorting out the deficit within the one-year target that was set, we advised the South West Peninsula SHA that we would allow it a maximum of two years to repay the debt and return to recurrent financial balance. That means that the SHA as a whole is working to a maximum deficit control of &pound;15   million for the current year, but must deliver recurrent balance by the end of next year. The latest information from the SHA shows that it is working toward delivery of that control total. Regular meetings take place and we are giving all the central support that we can.</p>
	<p pid=".239.0/5">In the past, the weighted capitation formula was criticised for failing to get health services to the areas of greatest health need. We therefore undertook a wide-ranging review of the formula before the latest allocations round. The new formula provides a better measure of health need in all areas. In calculating health needs in rural areas, it takes account of the effects of access, transport and poverty. It also uses better measures of deprivation, which are capable of being updated regularly.</p>
	<p pid=".239.0/6">I turn now to the concerns that the hon. Gentleman raised about the workings of the market forces factor. Again, as he acknowledged, the market forces factor is not a new concept. All versions of the allocations formula in the past 20 years have had a market forces factor weighting to recognise the different costs of labour and land across the country. The need for that was identified by the resource allocation working party in 1976 in recognition of the fact that the costs of care may vary from place to place. The current approach has been in place since 1996 and is based on wage rates in the external labour market that are adjusted for occupation, so that they are on a like-for-like basis. They are not based on whether an area is poor or well off: for example, the more deprived areas in central London have some of the highest market forces factors.</p>
	<p pid=".239.0/7">There is substantial academic research to support the   market forces factor. The current approach was adopted following a 1996 report by academics at the university of Warwick, which was reviewed in 2001. That research is in the public domain and a link was placed on the Department of Health website when the reports were published. However, if the Library does not have copies of the report, I undertake to ensure that it is given them.</p>

	<p pid=".240.0/1">I appreciate that, but will the Minister confirm, first, that the full 1:1 link has been made in assessments of local expenditure only in the last couple of years, and that only when the tariff system is introduced will the full impact on the moneys received be seen? Secondly, can she confirm that the Warwick work is an analysis of the distribution of pay on the basis that she described, not an analysis of the way in which that has an impact on NHS costs? The latter is purely a theory, not something that is backed up by academic research.</p>

	<p pid=".241.0/1">Two changes were made to the market forces factor for the last allocations, which were based on recommendations made by the advisory committee on resource allocation. The 1:1 factor and payment by results will not have an impact on how much funding is directed into an area by the market forces factor, because that is already used as a mechanism to set the general allocations for PCTs.</p>
	<p pid=".241.0/2">To answer the hon. Gentleman's question about where the latest evidence comes from, it is based on the last three years of the new earnings survey, so for the 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06 allocations the relevant years are 1999, 2000 and 2001. The hon. Gentleman asked when the data would be updated. I can confirm that we will do that as and when we need to. As I said, we have received advice and recommendations from the advisory committee for the forthcoming allocations round. Although the hon. Gentleman would like us to confirm today what those allocations are, I am afraid that that announcement will have to wait.</p>
	<p pid=".241.0/3">I end by saying that I would be more than happy to meet hon. Members from Cornwall and, I hope, discuss even more of the issues that have been raised today. NHS resources are increasing, but there are financial challenges. My Department is working closely with the SHA and others to ensure both that the difficulties being faced do not cause problems for services, and that financial balance is achieved in the local health economy.</p>
	<p pid=".241.0/4" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid=".241.0/5" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at half-past Four o'clock.</p>
