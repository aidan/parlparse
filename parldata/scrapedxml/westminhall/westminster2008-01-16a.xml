	<p pid="a.257.2/1">I am grateful to you, Mr. Cummings, for chairing this important debate, and to right hon. and hon. Members who have come to participate in it.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.2/2">In July 2006, there was an all-party review on the important matter of services for children with disabilities, which I chaired and which reported to the Treasury and the then Department for Education and Skills. We were assisted hugely by the Every Disabled Child Matters consortium, and we took evidence from 308 parents, professionals, disabled people and organisations across the United Kingdom. I thank Members of Parliament, including Ministers, who regarded the matter as serious and made a contribution. My colleagues would expect me to mention the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2013" name="Anne McGuire">the Member for Stirling (Mrs. McGuire)</phrase>, who has responsibility for disability issues and was pro-active throughout our discussions and since, and the Minister for Europe, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2010" name="Jim Murphy">the Member for East Renfrewshire (Mr. Murphy)</phrase>, who was then at the Department for Work and Pensions and attended several of our sessions and showed how interested he was, particularly in what parents and children told us.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.2/3">During the summer recess of 2006, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase>&mdash;I am delighted that she is here this morning, and we all know that she showed wonderful leadership&mdash;and I visited families all over the United Kingdom who had children with disabilities. We visited them in our constituencies, and we went to places such as Greater Manchester and London boroughs such as Tower Hamlets.</p>

	<p pid="a.260.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on raising this important subject. Does he share my concern that when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1964" name="Alex Salmond">the right hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond)</phrase>, who is First Minister, was specifically asked about it at First Minister's Question Time in the Scottish Parliament last month, he merely referred to the concordat with Scottish local authorities and</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/2" class="indent">&quot;a commitment to progress to an extra 10,000 respite weeks per year&quot;?&mdash;[<i>Scottish Parliament Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-13">13 December 2007</phrase>; c. 4429.]</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/3">Those 10,000 weeks include every area of social care, such as care for the elderly and disabled adults, as well as children. My hon. Friend makes an important point, and I take it that he believes that that money can be used by the voluntary sector, as well as by the Government and local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.260.2/1">The right hon. Gentleman, who speaks on disability issues with an authority unrivalled in the House referred to the role of the health service, as well as to local government's important responsibilities. Will he take it from me that one group of very needy children and young people are those who require alternative or augmented technology to communicate, and that a problem that bedevils that sector is the great network or panoply of agencies with which they or their carers must deal? We must crack that problem so that the bureaucratic table tennis that denies them necessary equipment or delays its arrival is brought to an end.</p>

	<p pid="a.261.2/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who has shown a deep and genuine interest in these issues over a long time. I acknowledge his point about the patchy approach, which applies in all sorts of areas, including lack of co-ordination between agencies, particularly in terms of delivery and consultation. That view is shared by those who were on the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/2">The hon. Gentleman should not worry about his views on Scotland, because I think that they will be adequately expressed during the debate, but I thank him for his interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/3">I return to the analysis that I was trying to make about what has happened in the constituent parts of the United Kingdom since the additional funding was announced. The Department of Health, consistent with our recommendations, has made its contribution, too. Disabled children are the new priority for primary care trusts in the new NHS operating framework and they have new baseline funding to improve services. The Every Disabled Child Matters consortium wants a specific amount identified for each primary care trust to ensure transparency and accountability to local families. I wholeheartedly agree with that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/4">In Wales and Northern Ireland, discussions are ongoing, but positive indications have been made, especially with regard to child poverty and early intervention, with an already confirmed extra &pound;1 million for that purpose in Wales. However, to turn to the issue that my hon. Friends have been raising, I regret to say that in Scotland there is huge concern about the destination of the &pound;34 million to which Scotland is entitled under the Barnett formula. All parties acknowledge that the money has come to Scotland thanks to the reviews, but now it seems that it might not be spent on the purpose for which it was clearly intended. Its purpose is for disabled children and their families. Families across the UK contributed to our thinking. It would be a tragedy if only the views of the people of Scotland&mdash;Scotland alone&mdash;were ignored. Those from Scotland who gave evidence to us could feel that their views had been apparently dismissed. Lest it be thought that some of us are being over-parochial, we are simply representing our constituents, who feel passionately, as we all do.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/5">As I always try to be objective in these matters, I turn now to the views of my right hon. Friend the Member for Normanton, who, in fairness, was the man largely responsible for everything that took place. The Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, as he now is, said in the main Chamber on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-11">11 December</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/6" class="indent">&quot;When we conducted our review of the life chances of disabled children and their families, and allocated extra money for respite care and other services, we consulted across the country. Welsh and Scottish MPs were active in those consultations...There was widespread expectation that the money would be spent not only in England but elsewhere, and that the Barnett consequentials would be spent on disabled children in other parts of the United Kingdom. That is happening in Wales but, to my knowledge, it has not happened in Scotland, where the funds have been diverted to cut council tax. I am very disappointed indeed that the needs of disabled children and their families are not a priority for the Scottish Executive.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-12-11.174"><i>Official Report</i>, 11 December 2007; Vol. 469, c. 174</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/7">It is for hon. Members to make a judgement about the views of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, who has done so much in this field. However, I have to say that if representations to me from Scotland show, as I believe they do, the strong views of the Scottish people&mdash;particularly those who speak for disabled families and their children&mdash;what my right hon. Friend said in the House reflects those strong views.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/8">There are people who argue that ring-fencing is inappropriate&mdash;it is important that I come to that issue at this point&mdash;and they are entitled to their view. As an ex-president of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, I know where they are coming from. However, that need not be the issue. In the review that I chaired, supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood, we offered options in terms of accountability. We said, in an important part of our review:</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/9" class="indent">&quot;If Government is not persuaded to ring fence additional resources for disabled children (and their families) released through the comprehensive spending review, Ministers must be able to convince parents and professionals that alternative mechanisms exist to ensure that the resources reach the children who need them.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/10">That is all we ask. In Scotland, as elsewhere, that is what we want. Disabled children and their families deserve no less. Why? We gave the reasons in the priorities that we set, which apparently persuaded the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.262.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that it is important that any Executive or Government with control of those funds must properly, openly and transparently account for how they have spent them and report to their respective Parliaments&mdash;or to the Assembly in Wales&mdash;on how the money has been spent, so that the families of disabled children can clearly see where the money has been spent and what the benefit of the expenditure has been?</p>

	<p pid="a.263.1/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his generosity in giving way to me again.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.1/2">There may be satisfactory alternatives in this context to ring-fenced budgets, although I have not encountered them. The compelling argument for ring-fencing in this field of policy is that although parents of children with disabilities are, thankfully, gradually becoming more demanding, vociferous and articulate, the reality remains that in political terms they are often not that powerful; therefore, we need a discipline that will hold in check the ambitions and the sometimes misguided priorities that would otherwise obtain in local authorities of whichever stripe.</p>

	<p pid="a.263.2/1">Yet again the hon. Gentleman puts it perfectly. When I supported devolution I took the view that all democratically elected institutions should be accountable not just to the powerful, but also to those who experience poverty. His argument is correct.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/2">In summary, the priorities we set in our original review, which were applicable to the whole of the United Kingdom, were as follows: early intervention, with swift diagnosis and recognition of the child's needs; family support, such as vital short breaks; transition care, which is the period when a disabled person leaves the education system and often enters a confusing world; and additional funding to promote parent participation in improving services.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/3">Last week, in the excellent debate on fuel poverty in this Chamber secured by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase>, I gave the information that</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/4" class="indent">&quot;two thirds of families with disabled children struggle to pay their fuel bills each winter. One family of every 10 families with disabled children has had its gas and electricity supply cut off.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2008-01-08.11"><i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 8 January 2008; Vol. 470, c. 11WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/5">One of our report's recommendations, which was not taken up by the &quot;Aiming high for disabled children: better support for families&quot; review, was to extend the winter fuel payment to families with disabled children. That payment would help them immensely, especially with the recently announced increases in fuel prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/6">Another concern addressed by the report was the worrying lack of data. When allocating funding, one must know the extent of a problem to act appropriately. I know that the &quot;Aiming high&quot; review referred to data collection, so I invite my hon. Friend the Minister to comment on where we are now in that respect. Although we are talking about statistics&mdash;where it is important that we have the correct information&mdash;all the discussion, and all the reports that have been written, fundamentally deal with people. In common with other Members, I realise that we are dealing with people with very specific needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/7">Like other Members, I regularly visit people in my constituency, as I did last weekend. I am watching the clock carefully because I know that others want to speak, but I want to share with Members some of the discussions that I had with two admirable families. Although they acknowledged that they were receiving excellent support from the local social work department, they indicated that there were problems, reflected in the problems that we identified in our report and that appeared in the Government's response.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/8">The first family I visited was the Davidson family. Leonie Davidson, a charming young woman, is 17. She has been diagnosed with Hallervorden-Spatz disease, which is a genetic, degenerative condition. Her mum, Angela, is an admirable woman and a lone parent. Leonie has a brother, Barney, who is nine. Angela takes the view that direct payments are most suited to her family's needs. In fact, she said that they were fabulous and were good for her family. She felt, and I think that she was right, that she was entitled to continue working as a management accountant, and that with proper support and resources there was no reason why she could not exercise the right choices for her family. I think we would all endorse that.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/9">When local authorities have the resources to agree to direct payments, it means that there is access to benefits from the independent living fund, which is very important to Angela and her family. Although she had to spend &pound;3,000 topping up her grant, what was important to her was the right to choose and the right to recognise her daughter, Leonie, as a person in her own right.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/10">I also want to talk about the family of 16-year-old Stephen Campbell. Stephen has been diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis. A stroke at 12 worsened his condition. His parents are Catherine and Alex, and he has an 11-year-old brother, David. Catherine has experienced epilepsy for most of her life. Although the family acknowledge the work and contribution of North Lanarkshire social work department, there is a problem. Having gone through the education system, Stephen is in need of some form of transitional arrangement and although there is an excellent centre for respite care&mdash;Ferrie house&mdash;Stephen is unfortunately not able to go there because the local authority, which I am not criticising, has decided that the resources will not be available until he reaches the age of 18. Other young people go to the centre, which is only two miles from where Stephen lives, but he has to travel 12 miles a day.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/11">There is an impact on Stephen's respite care, too. His parents have seven days' respite care a year from the centre that he currently attends; Ferrie house would provide 14 days. Such things are very important to people who are trying to cope in the circumstances that I have described.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/12">I do not want to dwell on those cases too much because I am watching the clock, but I am delighted at the response from hon. and right hon. Members because I am describing what people have to cope with day in, day out. I want to thank both families for the help they gave me. In the argument about resources, they acknowledged that much has been done by the Government, by the devolved Government and local government, but there is no doubt that additional resources would be of assistance to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.0/1">Before the right hon. Gentleman finishes, will he allow me to ride one of my little hobby horses? He is right to highlight the existence of a whole spectrum of need, and the fact that parents and carers probably know best how to meet it. Does he share the view that some children are best served by mainstream schools and some are well cared for in the wonderful special learning difficulties schools? However, some children are well cared for in moderate learning difficulties schools, which seem to be under threat of closure in certain local authorities. Does the right hon. Gentleman believe that we should maintain those wonderful, caring schools so that parents can have a choice if their children fit into that particular category?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-16a.265.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="265"  time="010:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080116/halltext/80116h0002.htm#08011692000453">
	<p pid="a.265.2/1">It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cummings. First, I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> for securing this debate. As he mentioned in his remarks, he and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase> have chaired a series of parliamentary hearings for the Secretary of State when he was at the Treasury. Those hearings and the efforts of the Every Disabled Child Matters campaign and of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" name="Gary Streeter">the Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)</phrase>, whose private Member's Bill helped to raise this issue to prominence, secured the funding that the hon. Gentleman mentioned in his remarks. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> is chairing another review for the Government. If the Government want to be even-handed about it, I hope that my hon. Friend's review is successful in securing an equivalent amount of funding for the area of policy that he is examining. We will know the results of that in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/2">Given the significant contribution from Scottish Members and the issues that they raised, it is worth mentioning that this issue and, indeed, health policy have been devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The issues that they raised are perfectly reasonable, but frankly, they are issues to be debated in the Scottish Parliament, because they are devolved&mdash;a policy that the Labour party supported and implemented&mdash;and this Parliament has no control over them. The right hon. Gentleman is right to say that extra funding has been allocated under the Barnett formula, but it is up to Members of the Scottish Parliament, who are accountable to their constituents on these issues, to have the debate. The right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have no say over these policy areas in Scotland as a result of the devolution settlement implemented by the Government whom they support.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/3">Opposition Members welcome the Government's funding for short breaks, which resulted from the inquiry that the right hon. Gentleman held and the other campaigning work that took place. Just this week&mdash;I think that he drew attention to this in his speech&mdash;the Government reannounced the funding, together with the breakdown by local authorities, spread over the next three years. I was pleased to note that my local authority, Gloucestershire, is one of the pathfinder authorities and has been allocated the money slightly earlier in the process. We will receive a more significant share of funding in the early part of those three years as some significant plans are rolled out.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/4">I have spoken to one of my colleagues, Councillor Jackie Hall, the cabinet member for children's services on the county council, who confirmed to me that she and her colleagues are working closely with parents to develop provision that will suit their needs, rather than considering what would suit the local authority. I am very pleased that they have taken that approach. It is very much in the spirit of the inquiry chaired by the right hon. Gentleman. They are considering what parents need to support their families. One matter that Gloucestershire is examining is the extent to which its plans can include an element of choice, so that families can choose, from a range of options, the support and short breaks that best suit their family structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/5">It would be helpful if the Minister could comment on the following issue. The right hon. Gentleman will know that the settlement announced in the comprehensive spending review is for the three-year period. I have concerns about this. The funding going to Gloucestershire rolls forward in 2009-10 and 2010-11 at just under &pound;1.6 million a year. The concern that families will have is that if the county council puts together a package of short breaks that they find incredibly valuable and that helps to keep families together and support them, what will happen after the three-year period?</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/6">Most local authorities&mdash;this came out from the comments about Scotland&mdash;are cash-strapped. My local authority, particularly due to the severe flooding that we had last year and, sadly, the flooding that we may be experiencing this week, is very cash-strapped. It had to deal with a big expense last year as a result of flooding. We do not want the funding from the Government to cease after the three years and local authorities throughout the country simply to be unable to continue funding the package. There would be no crueller measure than to have rolled out the package of short breaks for families, have those families come to depend on those breaks and get used to them, and then snatch them away simply because there is no funding. Therefore, it would be helpful if the Minister could say what the Government's thoughts are about rolling the funding into a more permanent settlement for local authorities, so that they can have confidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/7">Pathfinder authorities are receiving the money fairly early on, but the situation is different for many other authorities. If we look at the totals&mdash;obviously, these are figures for England&mdash;we see that the funding is very weighted towards the back end of the process, with &pound;15 million in the 2008-09 financial year, &pound;76 million the following year and &pound;178 million in the final year of the process. Therefore, a number of local authorities will only just have rolled out their programmes and there will be no confidence that they will continue. It is important to give some guidance about what the Government thought would happen subsequently.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/8">Given that the bulk of the money is rolled out throughout the country in years 2 and 3, it would be helpful to know what process the Department will follow in using the experience of the pathfinder authorities to roll out best practice to other authorities. In relation to the money being spent in the first year, we can see what works. Clearly, it would not be appropriate centrally to direct local authorities on how to spend the money, but it would be helpful to ensure that authorities receiving the bulk of their funding in years 2 and 3 have good access to the lessons of what has worked in the pathfinder authorities. Surely that is one purpose of a pathfinder programme: to spend the money better in the subsequent years of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/9">The final point on the funding that the Government have agreed is that the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" name="Ivan Lewis">the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis)</phrase>, who is responsible for care services, committed that the money that would come from the Department of Health would match what was coming from this Minister's Department. I did not find the statement terribly transparent. The Health Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/10" class="indent">&quot;Substantial new growth funding has been included in PCT allocations...to enable them to work with local authorities to...increase the range and number of short breaks.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/11">This Minister will know that all PCTs in England were this year given a 5 per cent. increase in their funding. I have not been able to disentangle how much extra funding was given to PCTs to account for that pledge to match the funding for short breaks. Given that all PCTs were given a flat increase, it would be interesting to know whether the money for short breaks in the health funding has been equally distributed throughout the country, or whether it matches the money that has gone to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/12">Can we assume in Gloucestershire that the extra money that Gloucestershire PCT will have received in its funding settlement will match the &pound;500,000, &pound;1.5 million and &pound;1.5 million that the county council receives in those three years? I know that those who run Gloucestershire PCT would find it very helpful to know what extra amount of money it has been given to fund those essential services.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/13">I will try to keep my remarks brief so that the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood has an opportunity to speak before those on the Front Benches, but I want to say a few words about autism. The ten-minute Bill of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1651" name="Lee Scott">the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Scott)</phrase> will be presented today after Prime Minister's questions. That would make provision for the education and training of children with autism and Asperger's syndrome, and for a number of connected measures. I am very pleased that my hon. Friend will have the opportunity to present the Bill to the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/14">I was fortunate just yesterday to visit TreeHouse&mdash;both the trust and the school&mdash;in north London. They are experts at dealing with autism. Indeed, I am very pleased with their slogan &quot;Ambitious about Autism&quot;, which is about ensuring that children who are on the autistic spectrum are successful. That school was founded by parents of children with autism, who found that provision was lacking, and it has been very successful. It has an evidence-based process. It uses applied behaviour analysis and was the first school in the UK to use such analysis to teach children with autism. It has a very good evidence base of success.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/15">Yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet not only the staff of both trust and school but a number of parents and to listen to them talk about their experience. I mention that because there is very good evidence on the issue from the Foundation for People with Learning Disabilities, funded by the Shirley Foundation. The evidence was gathered in the late 1990s and has recently been updated. It relates to the costs associated with health and social care support for people on the autistic spectrum. Apart from the significant number of people on the spectrum&mdash;433,000 adults and 107,000 children; obviously, children are the focus of this debate&mdash;the estimate made by the organisation is that the lifetime cost for someone with an autistic spectrum disorder and a learning disability is &pound;4.7 million. It is &pound;2.9 million for someone with a high-functioning autistic spectrum disorder. For children, if they are living in residential care or are in a foster placement, the annual costs can range from &pound;16,000 to &pound;62,000. The costs are considerably lower if they live at home.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/16">I mention that because there is good evidence, particularly with autism, that early interventions are extremely valuable. Given the lifetime cost, the tragedy I discovered when listening to two of the parents yesterday was, first, the delay that they experienced in getting a diagnosis and, secondly, the battle that they had with the local authority to get appropriate funding. Often, parents must go all the way through to a tribunal, which means that the child will not get the appropriate support in the critical early years unless the parents themselves can provide it. Obviously, that option is available only to those parents who have the appropriate resources. By not investing early, society must bare the significant costs through the lifetime of the child. Will the Minister say what work the Government are doing on lifetime costs and the extent to which early interventions make sense not only from a financial perspective, but from a human and family perspective, even if they are quite expensive?</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/17">I shall make only one more brief point on direct payments having seen your signal, Mr. Cummings, to keep an eye on the clock. The right hon. Gentleman mentioned direct payments. Many disabled people and their families welcomed the payments because they put control in their hands. The payments mean that people do not have to go to a local authority to receive services; rather, the people themselves control the services and can fit them around their individual experience. Will the Minister comment on the extent to which direct payments are being taken up? In a written answer on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-07">7 January</phrase>, the Minister for Schools and Learners said:</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/18" class="indent">&quot;The most recent data available are for <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>, and show that 649 children and 4,170 carers were receiving these payments&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-01-07.205"><i>Official Report</i>, 7 January 2008; Vol. 470, c. 205W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/19">Given the scale of the number of people whom we know are receiving social care, those are small numbers. It would be helpful to know what the Government are planning to do to make direct payments more easily accessible, not only for the parents and carers of disabled children but, in due course, to those disabled young people themselves, to give them power and control over their own lives.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-16a.269.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" speakername="Joan Humble" colnum="269"  time="010:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080116/halltext/80116h0003.htm#08011692000454">
	<p pid="a.269.0/1">My special thanks go to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> for securing this important debate. As we heard in his eloquent introduction, he cares passionately about the issue and, from the attendance, we can see that many other colleagues care likewise.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/2">As my right hon. Friend said in his introduction, we were honoured to be invited by our right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families and our noble Friend Lord Adonis to lead what were groundbreaking and unique parliamentary hearings on the concerns of families with children with disability. In so doing, we heard some heart-rending testimony from the families, and from professionals who cared for the children. Interestingly, in the body of the report produced after those hearings, there is polling evidence that, unusually, the views of service recipients match those of service deliverers. Both families and social care professionals, and some health professionals, felt that an inadequate service was being delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/3">We knew that something needed to be done. We argued for additional resources but, more importantly in a way, we argued for administrative changes and changes of attitude toward children with disability. Until we change society's attitudes and those of the professionals who support families, we will not effect change. Simply putting money into the system will not work unless it is backed by changes in procedures and attitudes.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/4">If nothing else, the report provided an evidence base on which the Government could act&mdash;I was pleased by their response&mdash;but we also put the needs of children with disability on centre stage in Parliament. The charities that supported the hearings came together to set up the consortium whose Every Disabled Child Matters campaign is going out into the country. No Member of Parliament is unaware of that, and local authorities and health authorities know about it&mdash;everybody in the country knows of the campaign. We put the issue on the top of the agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/5">We raised many hopes and expectations, so it was rewarding to get the cheque at the end of the day, by which I mean that the Government allocated money to short breaks. One of the key matters identified in our report was that having some respite was the difference between families who coped and those who collapsed. In giving &pound;340 million to short breaks, the Government recognised that they are a key and essential part of the needs of families with disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/6">I wish to talk about some of the key issues on which we need to see progress that the report identified, but I first wish to pick up on the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase>. He made some serious and important remarks, and I share many of his views, especially on the pilot. We need assurance that the Government learn from the pilots that they set up, and that they ensure their sustainability. Our inquiry identified good practice in the early support pilots, especially on the development of a key worker system. My right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill and the hon. Gentleman are concerned about early intervention, but, actually, improvements on that took place through the early support programme. Under the programme, local government works with health services in a much more co-ordinated manner, so that when a child with complex needs is born, there is early intervention and a key worker to support the family. A wide variety of professionals may still be involved, but instead of the parents having to cope with those different professionals, they can ring up just one person, who then sorts out and advises the professionals before the key meetings that the families must attend to determine their child's future.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/7">We recommended that lessons needed to be learned from the early support pilots and the development of key workers. In fact, we wanted key workers to be part of the system throughout a child's life, rather than only in those early years. That is not to say that every family needs a key worker&mdash;clearly, they do not. Some children do not need a key worker, but those with complex, multiple needs may need one. We need to ensure that advice is available. If I can make one plea to the Minister this morning, it is that we ensure that the changes that the Government are introducing are properly embedded in the system, and that the availability of financial resources and the administrative changes are sustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/8">Many such changes are taking place, especially in local government, and they offer huge opportunities. The development of children's trusts and the coming together of local authority children's departments with health professionals and other statutory and voluntary agencies&mdash;multi-disciplinary working&mdash;offers the way forward for providing a much simpler system for parents to work their way through. We need to ensure that that happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/9">I gave my apologies this morning to the Work and Pensions Committee, of which I am a member, but I want briefly to refer to the Committee's work. We have undertaken an inquiry into child poverty and social mobility. We have not yet produced a report, but we heard a huge amount of evidence about the poverty suffered by families that have children with disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/10">I know that it is not part of the Minister's remit, but I hope that when our report is published he will consider it, working with his colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions to see what can be done to support those families, especially the changes proposed to the Government's welfare to work programme that will require lone parents to move from income support to jobseeker's allowance when their children reach the age of 10, and then at seven. For many families that have disabled children, that is not practical, because child care and other support is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/11">I know that the Department for Children, Schools and Families, under the excellent Childcare Act 2006, is developing and enhancing child care provision. The legislation contains a specific reference to children with disability. However, the Government have a lot of balls up in the air. I want to ensure that they are all caught in the right sequence. It is a juggling act. The Minister must ensure that as changes are made in one area they do not have an adverse impact on other areas, and that all the improvements come into place at the same time in order to ensure that families, especially families with children with disability, can benefit from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/12">I conclude with a positive statement. I had intended to talk a little more about the Select Committee report and other outstanding issues, but I want to emphasise the fact that our responsibility is to ensure one thing. Although families with children with disability can suffer problems, and we can help them overcome those problems, we should remember that a child with disability can also bring great joy to the family. When I visit special schools&mdash;I usually visit mainstream schools&mdash;I have huge fun with the children, because they are often the ones to ask the most difficult questions. I was intrigued by a report recently published by the Every Disabled Child Matters campaign. Parents were asked what they wanted, and parents obviously wanted more support. Disabled children were then asked what they wanted&mdash;more fun things to do was the answer. They are children. They may have a disability, but we must not forget that they are children. Let us make sure that they have more fun things to do so that they can enjoy their childhood, as should all children. I hope that the Minister will consider what we have said about the needs of the parents and the families, but it is the needs of the child that should come first. They want to be children, and to be treated as children.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-16a.271.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" speakername="John Barrett" colnum="271"  time="010:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080116/halltext/80116h0003.htm#08011692000455">
	<p pid="a.271.0/1">I am delighted to be able to sum up on behalf of the Liberal Democrats; I have just been appointed the party's disability spokesman, and this is my first debate in post.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/2">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> for triggering the debate, and for his well-thought-out introduction. I also thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> and for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) for their excellent contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/3">I have had many discussions over the years with the right hon. Gentleman about international development issues, and I suspect that we might have a few more in the years to come about disability issues. We know that both subjects affect the lives of the most vulnerable children, in this country and elsewhere in the world. After many years on my party's international development team, I have witnessed at first hand children suffering from the most horrendous disabilities&mdash;some man-made, others easily avoided. Before I consider the issue closer to home, I would like to say a few words about the wider problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/4">We must not forget the millions of children who will never have access to the services that we aspire to in this country. I think of those young children whom I met in Sierra Leone with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase>, children whose limbs had been macheted off deliberately to disable them and to burden their families. I think also of others who have lost their sight because of river blindness, despite the fact that the annual cost of protecting one person against that disease is only 12p.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/5">Although we are discussing services for children with disabilities in this country, we must continue to press for improvements for those living in the developing world, who can only dream of the level of service that we have here at present&mdash;children whose lives are already difficult enough. However, there is much to be done, and many issues need to be addressed here at home.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/6">This should not be a party political issue, as the welfare and provision of services for children with disabilities is something that no party would not wish to improve. I look forward to working with the Minister, and with the Minister with responsibility for disabled people, in a constructive way. Indeed, it was at Capability Scotland in my constituency that the leader of the Conservative party launched a major statement on his party's commitment to the issue late in 2006. I have seen at first hand the excellent work done by that organisation&mdash;for the avoidance of doubt, I mean Capability Scotland&mdash;as it works with children and parents to bring out the potential of those children receiving its support.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/7">Much good work is being done by many excellent organisations throughout the country. However, when the services for disabled children and their families are described as a national scandal, as they were by the Children's Commissioner for England, something is clearly wrong, and no stone should be left unturned in the search for ways to improve those services. I will not repeat the concerns raised on five or six occasions about the situation in Scotland; I simply ask the Minister and his colleague to make representations to the Secretary of State for Scotland to stress the point to the First Minister at the earliest possible opportunity. It is a serious concern north of the border.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/8">The scale of the problem is huge, and the numbers of children requiring support services is growing. In the United Kingdom, there are more than half a million disabled children under the age of 16; 98 per cent. of disabled children live at home and are supported by their families; and 55 per cent. of disabled children grow up in, or at the margins of, poverty. Disabled children are 13 times more likely to be excluded from school. More recently, we have become much more aware of those who are bullied at school, and the support they need to cope&mdash;and to stop it happening in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/9">Working with a disabled child can not only be exhausting: it can also be the most rewarding experience imaginable. I pay tribute to the many often unsung heroes in that field&mdash;the parents and the workers who make the difference. Often, they provide the most basic service, but it can transform a life, providing the love and care that develops the dignity that should be experienced by us all, and not only by the able-bodied.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/10">The support offered should say that we are all equal, even if moving towards that will be a real struggle for many. Sometimes that struggle will be physical, at others emotional, and it can also be a financial struggle. The facts are stark. The income of families with disabled children is 23 per cent. below the UK average, yet it costs up to three times as much to raise a disabled child as it does to raise a child without disabilities. Families with disabled children spend approximately 10 times as much on loan repayments a week compared with the UK average. Caring for a disabled child can cause many other problems; stress, depression and lack of sleep are commonly experienced by parents and carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/11">Accessing the support available from Departments&mdash;the benefits, the local authority services and negotiating the maze of paperwork and bureaucracy involved&mdash;is hard enough for most people, but for those with a disabled child the problems multiply. Half of the appeals against disability living allowance awards are upheld, which shows how many mistakes are made. That is why some time ago I produced a special needs pack for those of my constituents who are parents of children with disabilities. It was intended to make it as simple as possible to access everything to which they were entitled to in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/12">I therefore urge the Minister and the Minister with responsibility for disabled people to develop such a pack, making it available to all mothers who have the experience of giving birth to a disabled child. From day one, they should have the support to which they are entitled rather than finding out, sometimes years after the child is born, that they have been unaware of help that could have changed their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/13">For disabled children to have a future, many will require work when they become adults. It is therefore a real concern that although many disabled adults are ready, able and willing to work, half of them are not in employment. I look forward to hearing from the Minister what the Government will do to work with groups, organisations, business and the community to ensure that disabled children have a future to look forward to&mdash;one in which many of them can play a full part and which includes having access to a reasonable income that they have earned.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/14">In a Mencap survey, eight out of 10 families with severely disabled children described themselves as being at breaking point. Improving the situation for parents with disabled children must therefore be a priority, so I was delighted when the children's plan, which was mentioned earlier, was published. Crucially, it was published alongside a commitment to make an extra &pound;90 million available to help local authorities provide accessible short breaks. Like other hon. Members, I was encouraged by the Prime Minister's words about carers early last week and I would appreciate any indication from the Minister as to the likely impact on those caring for children with disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/15">The Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families described the aiming high commitments as a down payment on change. Today's debate has highlighted some of the changes that I and others would like to see, and I look forward to hearing from the Minister how we can work together to deliver them.</p>

	<p pid="a.274.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, although it is hardly necessary to do so, because his reputation on this issue goes before him. I congratulate him not only on securing the debate, but on all the work that he and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase> have done, which he and other hon. Members mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/2">This has been a good debate, and we have had some interesting and well-informed contributions, although hon. Members may be forgiven for thinking that they had stumbled into a debate not only about services for children with disabilities, but about services for children with disabilities in Scotland and the responsibilities of the Scottish Administration under the leadership of the Scottish National party and its First Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1964" name="Alex Salmond">the right hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond)</phrase>, who is turning out to be a bit of a stinker on disability issues, allegedly.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/3">Notwithstanding that, there have been some interesting contributions from south of the border. There is a panoply of talent, not least among my hon. Friends, including my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase>, who speaks on disability issues for the Conservative party. I was glad that he mentioned the way in which his local council is working with parents to devise a service that they want and need, rather that one that it is convenient for the council to provide. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase>, who has just left the Chamber, has a long-standing interest in this issue, and I am glad that he was here for most of the debate. We look forward to the responses to the review that he is undertaking. The work of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" name="Gary Streeter">the Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)</phrase> on this issue is also well known, and he made a good point about the patchy provision&mdash;the postcode lottery&mdash;that often characterises services for children with disabilities. The hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood made an important point about juggling balls&mdash;whatever those balls might be. She mentioned the short breaks scheme, which is very important, and we welcome the resources that the Government have provided for it. As she said, it can make the difference between families with disabled children coping or collapsing, and the scheme's sustainability is crucial, as my hon. Friends, too, noted. As I said, we have had some excellent contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/4">This is an important subject. There are 777,000 disabled children in this country, which is about 7 per cent. of the child population. Thanks to the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill and other hon. Members, the issue has moved up the political agenda. I certainly applaud and endorse the sentiment and commitment that the Government have shown in providing extra resources and in responding to the review led by the right hon. Gentleman with the measures in &quot;Aiming high&quot;. It behoves us to applaud families and carers of children with disabilities for their enormous dedication and the enormous amount of work that they do. Without them, the job of the state would be enormously greater and more expensive for us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/5">In the few minutes that I have, I want to touch on a number of issues, including the important issue of respite care. The Council for Disabled Children has noted that the cost of providing 100,000 children with respite care is equivalent to the cost of providing residential care for 1,000 children. Only one in 13 families of disabled children benefit from any kind of support service. It is a false economy not to provide families with preventive support services that could make the difference between coping and collapsing, as the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood said.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/6">We should make the job of families easier, not put obstacles in their way, but the benefits system remains too complicated for people with disabled children. The Child Poverty Action Group has made several recommendations, and noted that the lack of information about the disability living allowance</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/7" class="indent">&quot;prevents families getting the support they need to care for their child.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/8">It adds that we need a</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/9" class="indent">&quot;holistic, family-friendly, co-ordinated approach to service delivery&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/10">It says that the benefit system must be improved and that the administration must be simplified. Finally, it says that there must be more information and that we must use national and local statistics. We know the exact extent of the problem, and Conservative Members want a single assessment process so that we can improve access to the wide variety of benefits and social, health, education and respite services that are available.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/11">Several hon. Members mentioned the link between disability and poverty, and I do not intend to repeat the figures. However, an enormous number of families live in unbearable poverty because they have to care for family members. Half of those families have no savings. Families of children with disabilities suffer major discrimination in the education system, too, and children with disabilities are more than twice as likely as able-bodied children to have no qualifications. They are at least twice as likely to be bullied in school and eight times as likely to be excluded. As for the benefits system, 85 per cent. of parents of disabled children want to work full-time or part-time, but despite those aspirations, only 16 per cent. of mothers of disabled children are in work, compared with more than 60 per cent. of all mothers.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/12">Notwithstanding the Childcare Act 2006&mdash;I served on the Committee that considered that measure&mdash;provisions and care for disabled children still do not go far enough. The Act did not do enough to improve the quality and appropriateness of the services available to families with disabled children, so more needs to be done on that. The problem is the patchiness or the postcode lottery mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon. My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham will deal in his review with the statementing system, which is still not fair or independent enough. Too many parents have to battle to get a diagnosis and an assessment, often at great personal expense to themselves and great financial expense to the local authority they are battling against. Once they have a ruling in their favour, they have to battle yet further to get the support services to go with it. The system is a constant battle for too many people, and we should give those most in need as much help as possible by removing those hurdles.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/13">I want to touch on two other issues. We have spoken a lot about physical disabilities, but we must not forget learning and communication disabilities. I CAN is a leading charity in that field: I pay tribute to its excellent work and welcome its input into the review by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham. I CAN notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/14" class="indent">&quot;One in ten children...in the UK has communication problems that require specialist help. This represents approximately three children in every classroom...In some parts of the UK as many as 50 per cent. of five year olds are arriving at school without the speech and language they need to fully participate and achieve their potential at school. This figure rises to 80 per cent. in areas of high unemployment and poor housing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/15">It is therefore a false economy not to intervene early to ensure that children have the communication skills to enable them fully to take advantage of the education system and to integrate into it. I CAN goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/16" class="indent">&quot;46.3 per cent. of children with a statement of SEN have identified speech, language and/or communication difficulties...Between 50 per cent. and 90 per cent. of people with learning disabilities have communication difficulties&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/17">I CAN raises a few questions, which I want to leave with the Minister. First, it wants to know whether the children's plan will ensure that children's communication needs are given high priority. It notes that joint working, supporting parents and early intervention are important and it wants to know what the Government are doing to improve services for children with a communication disability. It also asks:</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/18" class="indent">&quot;Has the Minister made any assessment as to how effectively Local Authorities and PCTs are able to commission services for children with speech and language difficulties and what are...the principles of effective commissioning in this area?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/19">Many hon. Members would recognise from surgery cases a &quot;vicious triangle&quot; of passing the buck between the education authority, the PCT and perhaps children's services and social services. The question of who should pick up the problem stems from the difficulty of assessing whether the child has a physical or a learning disability. Finally, Whizz-Kidz, a charity that does excellent work on child disability issues&mdash;it is particularly concerned with mobility and the 70,000 disabled children in the UK who need a wheelchair&mdash;has pointed out that there is an enormous postcode lottery for access to the specialised wheelchair provision on which many children rely. It has spent &pound;2 million of charitable money on providing support services. I hope that the Minister will, in the short time available, provide some words of comfort about how seriously the Government take the problem of specialised wheelchair provision, particularly for the many disabled children throughout the country. Perhaps he would like to write to me in detail about that, because he has only 10 minutes in which to respond to the debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.276.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" name="Tim Loughton">the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)</phrase> for allowing me at least some time to respond to this important debate. Like other hon. Members, I offer my thanks and congratulations to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, for his work and commitment over the years in this important area, and the passion and dedication with which he pursues the matters in question. Contributions to the debate were made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase>, and the hon. Members for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett), and for East Worthing and Shoreham. There were interventions from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1961" name="Sandra Osborne">the Member for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock (Sandra Osborne)</phrase>, the hon. Members for Buckingham (John Bercow), for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter) and for Castle Point (Bob Spink), and my hon. Friends the Members for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown), for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz), for Glasgow, North (Ann McKechin), and for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan). All of them made important points, and I shall try as best I can in the short time available to deal with as many of them as possible before moving on, if I have time, to the set remarks that I had intended to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/2">My right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill raised the matter of money from &quot;Aiming high for disabled children&quot;, the Barnett consequential and the actions of the Scottish Executive in that regard. It is of course absolutely a matter for the Scottish Executive and Scottish Parliament to determine how much of the money generated from any Barnett consequential is used in any particular way; but in thinking that it is absolutely right for my right hon. Friend to press the matter in the UK Parliament perhaps I disagree with what some Members have hinted at during the debate. It is absolutely the duty of MPs from all parts of the UK to point out issues, if they think that there is an injustice, or that a wrong decision has been made by a local authority, a devolved Administration or another body. The needs of disabled children and their families are the same wherever they are in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.277.1/1">I could not put the matter better, so I shall put it to rest at this point. My hon. Friend has clarified the point I wanted to make in my comments on the speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/2">Members raised the issue of patchy performance, and we shall shortly begin a tendering process for a national support body to support authorities with difficulties in implementing short-break services and to support our commitment to parent forums in all areas. For the first time there will be an indicator of parents' experience of services for their disabled children. Parents will be surveyed locally on what they think. We will expect areas that perform poorly in that context to include the indicator in their local area agreements, stretch themselves and set out clearly how they will improve. There is a mechanism in place to try to do something about patchy performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/3">Data collection was mentioned in the debate. Data collection and improving data is a key strand of &quot;Aiming high&quot;. We are setting up a working group with the Department of Health, local authorities and primary care trusts to consider how to improve local data on disabled populations, and how they are used. We are also commissioning research on why there is such variation between local authorities in the quality of data, to inform future work and improve the responsiveness of services. The children's plan sets out a commitment to improve special educational needs data in schools, so there will be some overlap with respect to outcomes for disabled children.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/4">The hon. Member for Forest of Dean mentioned Gloucestershire and the financial situation there. He also mentioned the flooding in the region last summer. I visited Gloucestershire after the floods, and was happy to increase the grant from the Department for Children, Schools and Families from &pound;600,000 to &pound;1 million, which I know was welcomed in the county. The hon. Gentleman asked about pathfinder areas and how we would learn the lessons from pathfinder areas such as Gloucestershire in relation to &quot;Aiming high for disabled children&quot;. Pathfinder areas must demonstrate their readiness ahead of receiving funding. That has happened, which is why they have been chosen.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/5">Areas must demonstrate that the intention is to bring about a system change in the way they provide short breaks locally. The national support body will work with local authorities to make that happen, and ensure that best practice is shared and rolled out nationally. Following the pathfinder applications process, Capita is evaluating the information received from the applicants, which will inform the work of the support body in trying to learn the lessons.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood&mdash;she tells me that one must always remember the Fleetwood bit in references to her constituency&mdash;mentioned early intervention and integration. The need for early intervention in our services is a strong theme of the children's plan, and I know that the Secretary of State is personally committed to it, as is shown by the work that he did on &quot;Aiming high for disabled children&quot;. We are very aware of the need for sustainability in relation to those services. I certainly make a commitment to look at the Select Committee report, as departmental colleagues will also want to do, in relation to disabled children's issues, and I shall certainly ensure that Ministers look at it. My hon. Friend said that we have rather a lot of balls in the air at the moment; it is an analogy that we do not tend to use in front of the Secretary of State&mdash;plate spinning might perhaps be a better image.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/7">On PCT funding, disabled children are a welcome priority in the new NHS operating framework, which was announced recently. As is usual with national health service funding, the additional funding for short breaks is not separately identified, but my colleagues in the Department of Health and Lord Adonis in the Department for Children, Schools and Families have written to all PCTs emphasising the importance that we attach to joint working between local authorities and PCTs on improving short breaks.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/8">Direct payments were mentioned in the debate. We recognise that they are not right for every family or child, and I think that families and hon. Members share that view. Budgets supported by a broker are another way of trying to handle the issue of improving flexibility for disabled children and their families. We are developing a major communication strategy with the Council for Disabled Children to inform parents of the options available to them, both by way of direct payments and the use of a broker. I am keen that there should be opportunities to increase the uptake of disability payments where they are suitable for families and children.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/9">The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham raised the issue of speech, language and communications, and he will be very much aware of the review that is being undertaken by the hon. Member for Buckingham to address those questions. The hon. Gentleman will produce an interim report in March and a final report in the summer, which I hope will provide more detailed answers to the questions that have been raised in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/10">We have had a useful and productive debate. Children are the Government's highest priority. With health, security and a good education, a child can achieve all that they are capable of, but without those things, they cannot do so. The Government have a duty to remove every barrier to success, particularly for disabled children.</p>

	<p pid="a.280.1/1">It is a pleasure and a privilege to debate this important subject under your guiding hand, Mr. Cummings, and I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.1/2">There are good public health reasons why the activities of companies marketing breast-milk substitutes should be controlled, including the safety and health of new-born babies. Powdered formula is not sterile, so care needs to be taken over preparation in order to avoid contamination. Furthermore, the activities of companies should be controlled so as not to undermine efforts to promote breastfeeding.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.1/3">The international standard for such control is the World Health Organisation's international code on the marketing of breast-milk substitutes. The WHO is an organisation of member states, 118 of which, including the United Kingdom, voted to adopt the code as long ago as 1981; the United States of America was the only nation to vote against it. Ever since, we have been signed up to the WHO code and I dare say that Ministers have visited other countries and recommended it to them. However, our domestic law has not yet implemented the code and even though an opportunity to implement it has now arisen, the Minister has not proposed that we should do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.1/4">I shall use the debate, therefore, to make representations to the Minister. It is not too late for us to be bolder and to implement fully the WHO code. We have a law to control the marketing activities of companies that make and sell infant formula, but it is widely recognised that it is not sufficiently effective. The debate comes at a time when the Minister is seeking to tighten that law to make it more effective. At present, I do not think that her proposal for changing the law takes us as far as it should, particularly towards full implementation of the WHO code. My purpose in this short debate is to urge her to go further.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.1/5">My interest in the matter stems from my involvement in the public health arguments in favour of breastfeeding. Those arguments include a number of powerful facts. For example, babies breastfed for at least three months are at less risk of gastroenteritis; during the first six months of life, breastfed babies are five times less likely than formula-fed children to suffer from urinary tract infections; there is evidence that breastfeeding protects children from obesity in later years, and there is now extremely strong evidence that breastfeeding protects mothers against breast cancer and babies against excess weight gain, which is linked to an increased risk of cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.1/6">Such facts are common knowledge among health professionals and help to explain why the WHO and the Department of Health recommend that babies be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of their lives, yet in the UK only about 2 per cent. of babies are exclusively breastfed at six months. Breastfeeding is the healthiest and cheapest way to feed a baby, yet, at the other end of the equation, the UK has one of the lowest initial rates of breastfeeding in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.1/7">I am no absolutist in my promotion of breastfeeding. I recognise that some parents rely on infant formula, because breastfeeding is not possible for a physical, psychological or broader social reason. I would go further: this is a free country, so I accept that some parents will choose formula over breastfeeding for other reasons. Indeed, the WHO code recognises that there is a legitimate market for infant formula. However, it does not trust companies with a commercial interest in promoting their products to give out objective public health messages on matters of such importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.1/8">Whether the issue is taking care not to undermine breastfeeding or ensuring the health and well-being of babies fed infant formula, the WHO says that the responsibility lies with Governments. Parents should be protected from partisan claims and should receive impartial advice and guidance, which is why I am a founding member of, and a parliamentary champion for, the Breastfeeding Manifesto Coalition. It is an alliance of 39 organisations, including five royal colleges, trade unions, such as Unison, Unite and the Community Practitioners' and Health Visitors' Association, and hugely respected groups, such as the Baby Feeding Law Group, La Leche League, the National Childbirth Trust, Save the Children and UNICEF. The coalition also has broad support among all political parties in the House and another place. I am pleased to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> in the Chamber; she is one of the parliamentary supporters of the manifesto.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.1/9">In my parliamentary experience of more than 10 years, I have always felt that although the arguments about breastfeeding and public health matters are strong, they have not resonated as strongly in decision making as they ought to have done. I think that is because the organisations that I have just named have not spoken with one voice. The development of the coalition, therefore, is significant in the promotion of arguments in favour of breastfeeding, and I hope that the Minister and her Department will benefit from knowing the views of those who share the Government's ambitions in promoting a healthy start to life for all children.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.1/10">Those of us who support the manifesto look forward to living in a society where women feel enabled to initiate and continue breastfeeding for as long as they wish; where parents are supported in making informed choices about feeding their babies, and where everyone is aware of the significant benefits associated with breastfeeding. One of the manifesto's seven key objectives is for our country to adopt the WHO international code on the marketing of breast-milk substitutes and subsequent relevant resolutions. The code acknowledges that manufacturers and distributors of breast-milk substitutes have an important and constructive role to play in infant feeding. Nevertheless, it states that Governments should have a responsibility to ensure that parents receive objective and consistent information on both breastfeeding and the safe and appropriate use of formula. The code specifically states that advertising and promotion by manufacturers and distributors should not be allowed.</p>

	<p pid="a.282.0/1">The hon. Lady puts her finger on possibly the most important issue that I wanted to raise, and makes a suggestion to the Minister that I hope we can pursue later in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/2">Since 1995, the UK has had a law intended to protect parents from the promotion of formula milk. However, the law is not working; parents say that they constantly see adverts for formula milk. Companies' promotional activities have simply become cleverer and more aggressive since 1995. In particular, they have realised, as the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole said, that they can legally advertise what they call follow-on formula for babies over the age of six months. They have cottoned on to a strategy of advertising that product that also promotes infant formula for younger babies, which is supposed to be illegal.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/3">I have brought with me some examples of the type of adverts that the hon. Lady has just referred to, which were placed in magazines. I do not know if the Minister is shown such adverts by her advisers when she is making policy decisions on the subject, but they are clear examples of that strategy in action. In one example there are two adverts on the page, side by side. One advert goes into journals for professionals and promotes formula, which is not illegal. The other advert goes to magazines that parents would typically read and ostensibly it promotes the follow-on formula for babies over the age of six months. However, to look at the two adverts side by side is quite instructive, because, to the untrained eye, they are both the same and they are both promoting the same thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/4">The current law, which is intended to protect the parent's right to receive objective and accurate information about feeding their baby, is not working. Commercial pressure remains a factor in how parents decide to feed their children. After all, the market is big money for the companies. The UK market in formula milk nearly trebled from &pound;119 million in 1995 to &pound;329 million in 2006. It is during the increase in commercial pressure over that decade and more that parents have been increasingly influenced, as polls of women taken last year showed. For example, 60 per cent. of women polled said they had seen adverts that are supposed to be illegal and 89 per cent. said that they associated SMA with infant formula.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/5">UNICEF says that two main loopholes in the current law allow such advertising to happen. The first loophole is that advertising formula for babies under six months is banned, but advertising it for babies over six months is allowed. By ensuring that their milks for younger and older babies are almost identical, manufacturers also ensure that an advert for one automatically promotes the other. Secondly, to prevent information materials for parents from being used to promote specific products, the current law prohibits companies from putting formula milk brand names on information that they give to mothers. However, they are allowed to put their company logo on it. By changing their logos and milk brand names to be near-identical, companies have ensured that their information materials can continue to promote their milks. As that means that names and logos on information materials have become both legal and illegal at the same time, it has become impossible for trading standards to enforce the current law.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/6">Those weaknesses have been recognised at European Union level and in 2006 a directive was passed&mdash;directive 2006/141/EC&mdash;to tighten European-wide law. Of course, the Minister's new regulations will transpose that tightening of the law into our domestic law. The regulations, along with new guidance that she proposes to publish, aim to tighten our law in respect of the labelling and advertising of infant formula. In addition to those regulations and the guidance, the Minister promises a review of how the changes are operating 12 months later. It is in respect of that review that the point raised by the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole becomes relevant.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/7">Before I explain why I am arguing that the Minister is not going far enough, let me acknowledge and welcome all that is being done in other ways to improve our country's breastfeeding rates. For example, the Department of Health is demonstrating a good, strong commitment to delivering widely education and information that is necessary to help parents make an informed choice in favour of breastfeeding their children. Examples include greater engagement with the relevant stakeholders, support for the national breastfeeding week in May and the Department's stated intention of making its national breastfeeding week promotions year-round. Another example is the new National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance on antenatal and post-natal care, which is very positive about the role of breastfeeding. That is underpinned by the national service framework for children and maternity services and aided by the UNICEF baby friendly initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/8">The Government have given the Department of Health a public service agreement target for improving child health and well-being, which is very welcome, and there is now an indicator regarding the prevalence of breastfeeding at six to eight weeks. Also, regarding the wider Government position, consultation on the single equality law has shown a welcome determination to protect parents who feed their babies in public places from discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/9">With that background of good work, it is a pity that the new regulations fall short of implementing the World Health Organisation code. Many argue that failing to do so will mean that mothers' and children's health will continue to be put at risk. I ask Members to consider this: follow-on formula is suitable only for babies over the age of six months, say the manufacturers and distributors, but the confusion caused by the marketing ploys that I have described creates the risk of babies under six months being inappropriately fed follow-on milk. Fourteen per cent. of parents say that they have given babies under six months of age follow-on formula, which is dangerous and can cause serious infections.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/10">It is for those reasons that the Minister recently received an open letter from the relevant royal colleges describing &quot;serious shortcomings&quot; in her proposed approach. I believe that her own scientific advice, from the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, and advice from local authorities, which are responsible for upholding and enforcing the law through trading standards, is calling for stronger and more straightforward measures. For those reasons, I urge the Minister to go further than the regulations currently propose and implement in full the WHO code.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/11">I gather that the trade body representing some of the manufacturers and distributors has sought to challenge the new regulations by way of a judicial review application. I believe that I am right in saying that the introduction of the proposed regulations has been suspended. Naturally, we cannot discuss the court case, because the matter is sub judice, but does the Minister accept that this new development would give her time to consider the arguments that I and many others are putting forward for an altogether more robust change in the law? Furthermore, will she agree to meet me and representatives of the Breastfeeding Manifesto Coalition to discuss the case for a tougher approach?</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/12">It is trite for politicians to claim that it is the measure of a society's compassion, reasonableness or good sense that it treats one particular group of society better; Winston Churchill said that the measure of our society is how we treat prisoners, for example. However, there is no stronger test of a Government's mettle than how we as a society take care of the well-being of our children&mdash;youngsters who, because of their age and lack of maturity, are unable to speak up for themselves and defend their own interests. They are the people we need to invest in as tomorrow's generation of decision makers, wealth creators, upholders of the law and so on. It is, therefore, a good test of the Government's resolve that we do all we can to ensure that children are safe and protected at the most vulnerable time of their lives, when they have just been born and are gaining weight and the knowledge and health that will secure their development throughout their childhood and probably influence the whole of their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/13">I hope that those points are well made to the Minister and I look forward to hearing her response to them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-16a.284.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health"  colnum="284"  time="011:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080116/halltext/80116h0005.htm#08011692000463">
	<p pid="a.284.0/1">. May I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> on securing this important debate, thus giving me an opportunity to clarify the Government's position and explain why I do not agree with the points he made about a lack of resolve on the Government's part? I absolutely congratulate him on his fantastic work in Parliament as a champion of the breastfeeding manifesto coalition, and I concur entirely with the points that he made about the importance of supporting, encouraging, protecting and promoting breastfeeding, in the interests of giving all infants the very best start in life. I will not go over the many eloquent points that he made about the important contribution that that makes to children's development.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.0/2">My hon. Friend acknowledged that not all mothers choose to, or are able to, breastfeed, and that it is vital both that bottle-fed babies are protected and that mothers are in the best possible position to make informed decisions about feeding choices for their babies. The Government are developing an agenda on two fronts. Our central policy is to encourage, promote, protect and support breastfeeding mothers. We want to ensure that mothers who choose not to breastfeed or who cannot do so, receive the best advice so they can choose what is best for their babies without other people interfering in those decisions or causing confusion. For those reasons, we have placed stricter controls on the promotion, labelling and composition of infant and follow-on formula.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.0/3">The main points made by my hon. Friend and the coalition concerned follow-on formula, and I concur entirely, because parents tell us that the available information is confusing. We recognise that advertisements for follow-on and infant formula may provide confusing advice about what is appropriate for infants and can be misinterpreted by parents. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase>, who has been very active in this campaign, touched on that point. Let me make the position absolutely clear: the Government are determined to take tough action to stamp out those practices and to prevent marketing activity that directly or indirectly undermines breastfeeding. We are acting on evidence suggesting that consumers in the UK cannot clearly differentiate between infant and follow-on formula when purchasing those products.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.0/4">As my hon. Friend pointed out, maternal and infant support groups have brought the issue to our attention. I have had many meetings with different organisations about press and TV adverts on follow-on formula which, they believe, undermine breastfeeding. In the guidance issued alongside the regulations, we have explicitly taken up every example that was put to us and said, &quot;This is not acceptable, and action will be taken.&quot; There have been complaints about the industry seeking to bypass restrictions on the direct advertising of infant formula by the way in which it labels infant and follow-on formula, and advertising follow-on formula in such a way that it is difficult to distinguish between the two. I absolutely agree. On that basis, following extensive consultation with stakeholders, I have agreed a package of measures that will strengthen controls in this area. The package is made up of effective, proportionate and evidence-based controls, and I am confident it will improve consumer protection and give us a robust system can withstand challenges, should they be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.0/5">I gave a further commitment, after looking at everything that I received in representations about advertising, to provide guidance. That guidance is now operational, and it shows how the regulations should be interpreted. I have made a commitment, too, to provide an independently chaired review of the new controls after their first year of operation. As I made absolutely clear to the relevant organisations in our private meetings, the review will play an important role in policy making and in assessing whether the new controls worked as expected. It will assess whether people have found new ways of getting around the rules or whether they are simply not complying with the rules. If the new arrangements are found not to be working, because they have been circumvented or because new methods emerge, the Government will respond proportionately and take the next step of considering further legislative action. We have therefore put robust measures in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.1/1">I can assure my hon. Friend that the review will be every bit as broad as I have suggested. I am sure that he will recognise, both from his parliamentary experience in Parliament and from the work that he did before he was elected, that Governments must always proceed in a proportionate way. Stepping outside that process can bring other complications that slow down progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/2">I am convinced that, with the new regulations, we have put in place a response that is proportionate and will deliver the objectives which were eloquently described by my hon. Friend and with which I agree. I am determined to work with the industry and non-governmental organisations to ensure that that is the outcome, given the need for clear imperatives that he set out. We all want&mdash;it seems like a no-brainer&mdash;the best advice on providing a healthy start for our newborn babies and children in the earliest months and years of their lives, and I am determined to ensure that we provide that advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/3">We support the international code of marketing of breast milk substitutes, and the subsequent amendments made by the World Health Assembly resolutions. My hon. Friend knows that the code makes a broad set of recommendations on labelling, the functioning of health care systems and the corporate responsibility of formula companies, and I can assure him that I am taking all those matters forward. The directive provides increased consumer protection in comparison with previous legislation, but we must ensure that it works, and I shall do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/4">My hon. Friend touched on the Department's present and planned initiatives further to improve breastfeeding rates across England. I have met and corresponded with the relevant non-governmental organisations. Clearly, I would like to be where they are and not where I am, but I am where I am. I have an opportunity to do what I can, and I am doing it as fast as I can. I am trying to deliver all our objectives in a reasonable way, but I am happy to meet them and others to take that work forward. My hon. Friend will be aware that a High Court order has been made, and that there has been a disagreement over the timetable for the provisions to come into force in England and Wales. The order has been suspended until a hearing of the substantive application for judicial review, which is due to take place at the end of February. I am disappointed about that: we will fight the case, because the Government's priority is to ensure that infant and follow-on formula are clearly labelled, so that parents and carers who wish to use those products do so correctly. I am more than happy to continue my meetings with my hon. Friend and others when I know the outcome of the case to discuss the review and the future of the regulations.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-16a.287.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" speakername="Tobias Ellwood" colnum="287"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080116/halltext/80116h0005.htm#08011692000466">
	<p pid="a.287.2/1">It is a pleasure to begin this important and topical debate on Pakistani-based terrorism. Indeed, considering recent events, there is terrorism not only in Pakistan but in the United Kingdom, as well as in other recent attacks across the globe. Unfortunately, we can now see a common denominator in the attacks of 9/11 and 7/7, and those in Madrid and Bali, not to mention the frequent insurgency operations in Afghanistan&mdash;the training camps based in the remote mountains on the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Sadly, we must now add the dreadful assassination of Benazir Bhutto this Christmas with 20 others in Rawalpindi on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-27">27 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.2/2">How did things come to this? Why, six years after the so-called global war on terror, do those camps still exist? What impact does Pakistani-based terrorism have in the UK? Finally, what are we, the Government and the nation, doing about it? Those are the questions that I pose today.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.2/3">For clarity, I declare a personal interest&mdash;I think that the Minister is aware of it&mdash;in that I lost my brother in the explosion that took place in Bali on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-12">12 October</phrase>. It is because I see so little advance in the war on terrorism, if we can call it that, that I am pleased that this subject has been selected for debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.2/4">It is worth reminding ourselves of the background in Pakistan. As countries go, it is a fascinating cocktail of people, religions, languages and customs. If one throws into that a serious boundary dispute with its neighbour, India, a security service&mdash;the ISI&mdash;that is a power unto itself, a military six times the size of ours, a nuclear arsenal, 70 political parties, and the fact that for many years it was on the front line of the cold war, it is easy to see why governance has been such a challenge. Pakistan has 161 million people, it is the sixth most populous country in the world, and it has the second largest Muslim population.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.2/5">Since independence from British India in 1947, Pakistan has been characterised by periods of instability and dispute. Civilian politics during the past few years have been tarnished by corruption and inefficiency. That has been compounded by alternating periods of civilian and military rule, which have not helped the country's stability or long-term prospects.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.2/6">More recently, in October 1999, Pakistan came under military rule once again, when General Musharraf, as he was then, led a bloodless coup to oust the civilian Government. That was widely condemned not only by Britain; it led to Pakistan's suspension from the Commonwealth. Musharraf inherited many of the problems and challenges that have been besetting the country for years. The biggest problem is the increasing polarisation between Islamist militancy and the modernising secular wing of Pakistani politics.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.2/7">The challenge is made all the greater given the mountainous area, 200 miles wide and 1,600 miles long, that contains the Durand line. That poorly marked Afghan-Pakistan border, named after Sir Mortimer Durand in the late 19th century by the Foreign Secretary of the British Indian Government, was a way of concluding what was called the great game&mdash;the conflict between the British and the Russian empires for supremacy in central Asia.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.2/8">It is important to put things into context. Pakistan is four times the area of the UK, but I should point out the extent&mdash;or perhaps the limits&mdash;of Pakistani leaders' influence. State control over a sizeable section of the north-west is, I believe, tenuous, and there are many areas&mdash;for example, in Belucistan and Waziristan&mdash;that are completely autonomous, in which any rule or recognised authority is absent. Indeed, the North-West Frontier Province is known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. They are now the playground for terrorism, and no-go areas for official authorities. In those remote areas, it is easy to take full advantage of the absence of civilised rule with the dominance of tribal power.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.2/9">Until <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>, General Musharraf ignored much of what was happening in the mountains. He turned a blind eye to what was going on, hoping that it would not cause problems. After the 9/11 attacks, however, he clearly had to revisit the situation. He made a quick assessment&mdash;I believe he was influenced by the amount of military hardware promised to him&mdash;deciding that he should change sides and call those people his enemy. He supported the Taliban prior to 2001; only after 9/11 did he join the rest of the world in condemning what they stood for, becoming a key ally of the west.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.2/10">Unfortunately, the fight continues six years on. The assassination of Benazir Bhutto is a potentially crippling blow to Pakistan's hopes of emerging in a state of stability. Placed in context, it is easy to see that such high tensions could bring Pakistan to the verge of imploding, unless action is taken. Certainly that is the case now.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.2/11">However, the seeds of the terrorism were not sown during Musharraf's time but in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, when religious institutions mushroomed under General Zia's rule. His idea was to encourage the funding of madrassas, religious seminaries, in order to create ideological nurseries to motivate people into joining the jihadis and the holy warriors to battle against the Soviets. Of course, once created they could not be closed, particularly because of their location. That led to a multitude of religious scholars. Today, any radicalised youngster who wants to know more about his religion and who is still asking questions about 9/11 will turn to them. It is estimated that there are 13,000 madrassas in the north-west of Pakistan, and more than 1.7 million people have enrolled in them.</p>

I do not wish to take away from the good work that they have tried to undertake, but more needs to be done. It is a difficult task; often, when General Musharraf outlaws a terrorist or religious organisation, they simply change their names, move to another location and start again, which is why he cannot combat the problem alone and requires the west's assistance in order to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.290.3/1">I shall venture into that subject later, if my hon. Friend will be patient. There is a general concern, because the training camps remain and attacks continue&mdash;even in the UK we have had the attack in Glasgow airport last June, as well as the thwarted attacks in London. They were very real and are still happening, so we need to work harder to ensure that we combat this problem. The current strategy is not working. Owing to the remote nature of the bases, President Musharraf cannot contain the problem, which is why support from the United States, Great Britain and the west in general is critical.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/2">Some of the characters now linked with Pakistan include names with which we are familiar: Richard Reid, the shoe-bomber, who, on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-22">22 December 2001</phrase>, attempted to hijack the Paris to Miami flight; Mohammad Sidique Khan, who was the leader of the 7/7 bombings, which killed 52 people in London; Hambali and Imam Samudra, who orchestrated the attack on the night clubs in Bali, on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-12">12 October 2002</phrase>, which killed 26 Britons and 202 people in all; less well-known are Jamal Zougam and Emilio Trashorras, who masterminded the terrible Madrid train bombings, which were the biggest attacks in Europe, killing 191 people and injuring more than 1,800, when 10 bombs blew up a series of commuters trains in the capital city; and Mohammad Atta, who flew one of the American airline planes into the north tower of the World Trade Centre. He and the other hijackers, along with the other terrorists who I have just mentioned, all received their training in camps in the Pakistani and Afghan mountains&mdash;camps that are still recruiting. We are not doing enough because those camps are not being closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/3">General Musharraf has begun initiatives, but not completed any actions. Last year, for example, he signed deals with the opposition in Waziristan. He went in with 250 soldiers to try and clean up an area, which was an honourable cause, but unfortunately, without a shot being fired, all 250 soldiers were captured. They were released only because Musharraf traded them for 30 militants whom he had locked-up. I come from a military background and I do not want to question the tactics used, but that suggests that the Government cannot contain the situation, that they do not have a strategy and that they simply do not have the ability to move forward responsibly in combating the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/4">The result has been a laissez-faire attitude on the part of President Musharraf, who appears to think, &quot;Those things happen in the mountainous area, so let us sign deals with the various organisations and tribal units; you stay over there and we will stay over here.&quot; However, that allows those bases to be used by people to punch their way north into Kandahar and Lashkar Gar, and other such places, and to carry out attacks on our troops in Afghanistan. Furthermore, they are continuing their training and exporting their violence, as they have been doing for the last 10 to 15 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/5">What is relevant is how that impacts on the UK, because sadly a number of the people whom I mentioned earlier are, or were, British citizens. This is home-grown terrorism, about which we were in denial until July 2005, when we suddenly realised that British-born citizens were willing to take their lives for the cause of fundamentalism. Those are the questions that I want to pose. I appreciate that the Minister is responsible for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, but I hope the Minister will understand&mdash;I beg for your patience, Mr. Cummings&mdash;that if we are to have a full debate on terrorism in Pakistan, we must include the way in which it impacts on the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/6">I now turn to the controversial part of my speech. On a recent visit to Iraq, I had the pleasure of meeting the Deputy Prime Minister, Dr. Barham Salih. He came to the UK recently, and visited the Lord Chancellor's constituency of Blackburn. When Dr. Salih and I discussed militant behaviour and how to combat terrorism, he told me:</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/7" class="indent">&quot;I am not surprised that you British are facing so many problems with extremists after what I saw in those mosques in Blackburn. What I saw...would not be allowed here in Iraq&mdash;it would be illegal.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/8">That is a shocking indictment of what is going on in some mosques in the UK, and that is why the issue is controversial. Many Muslims in Britain want to live peacefully and happily under the British rule of law, but hearing that from another Muslim, who is a leader from a Muslim country, summed up the situation in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/9">It was interesting to read a recent study by Denis MacEoin, called &quot;The Hijacking of British Islam&quot;, which I recommend, because that specialist, a renowned authority on Islam, has examined some of the literature that is available in mosques throughout the country. He found that one quarter of it is either inflammatory or incites violence, and it is worrying that such material is available, but nothing is being done about it. The publications urge Muslims to segregate themselves from non-Muslims, and for unbelievers to be regarded as second class. Many of those publications come from Saudi Arabia, which is another angle that the Minister must pursue. Is enough being done in Saudi Arabia to prevent the export of such material?</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/10">Related to that issue are the comments by Jonathan Evans, the former MI5 chief, who said last year that in his assessment, 20,000 Muslim people in the UK posed a threat to national security. If you woke up early enough, Mr. Cummings, you will have heard on the &quot;Today&quot; programme, reports from the United States Homeland Security Secretary, Michael Chertoff.</p>

	<p pid="a.293.0/1">The answer is that I do not know. However, they are worrying numbers, which the Minister must digest, and then, I hope, produce a strategy that allows us to better understand what is going in mosques in the UK. We must dare to challenge fundamentalism on our doorstep. It is not a random challenge purely against Islam&mdash;far from it; it is a recognition that extremist behaviour cannot go unchecked. There is a need for a better understanding of what is happening in the 1,350 mosques in the UK, and from the reports that my hon. Friend has read out, and from the study that took place, I do not believe that we do fully understand.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/2">I have seen the amount of legislation that we pass in Parliament. We build barriers&mdash;even around this very building&mdash;to barricade ourselves in and protect ourselves from somebody who decides to put on a suicide jacket and blow themselves up, but we are not doing enough to get into the mindset of the individual to prevent them from going anywhere near that jacket in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/3">This is a sensitive issue, and it was reflected by the nervousness of the police during the demonstrations against the cartoons drawn in Denmark in February 2006. There were demonstrations in this country outside the Danish embassy, and Members might remember the placards there, which said:</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Annihilate those who insult Islam&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/5">and:</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/6" class="indent">&quot;3/11 is on its way&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/7">Not one arrest was made that day&mdash;not one, single arrest. Of course, we must be sensitive in those situations; we absolutely do not want to inflame them. However, in any other environment, much more thorough action would have been taken. We have adopted a soft touch against militant Islam, which is why we are being taken advantage of by those terrorist organisations that now choose London and the UK as a secondary base for their operations. I do not mean their physical operations; I mean their studies, groupings, and most importantly, their recruitment. We do not see that situation in France, Germany or in Iraq; we should not see it in the UK. I appreciate that these are Home Office issues, but I should be glad if the Minister were able to say what extra steps are being taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/8">I come now to what is happening in Pakistan, and how we move forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.294.0/1">Again, my hon. Friend makes a valid point. It is a very difficult line to draw. How far must the punishment go before it is seen to incite more violence and upset more communities? It is a sensitive issue, and I should acknowledge that the Government have taken initiatives. The Muslim Council of Great Britain was an initiative by the previous Prime Minister to try to link thoughts and views and provide a forum for Muslim expression and concerns. One challenge for the Muslim community is that it is so disparate. There are so many facets to the Muslim community, with people either coming from different geographical locations or following different parts or interpretations of the Koran, which is why the issue is difficult. There is no unified leader, no Papal figure, whom one can turn to in order to condemn or condone actions. It is difficult to find a unifying voice, and it is therefore even easier for the corrupt message to get through and go unchallenged.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/2">President Musharraf was prompted by US comments&mdash;I think they were from special advisers to the US President&mdash;that more needed to be done militarily to assist Pakistan in combating terrorism. Unfortunately, the reply did not suggest that President Musharraf had fully grasped the gravity of the situation. He replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Nobody will come here until we ask them...and we haven't asked them. Certainly, if they come without our permission, that's against the sovereignty of Pakistan...There is a perception in the United States as if what our army cannot do, they can do...This is a very wrong perception. I challenge anyone coming into our mountains. They would regret that day.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/4">I am afraid that that is the kind of language that we hear from other dictators and leaders playing to a local audience to try to ensure that they stay in power, rallying anger from outside to ensure that they have support inside. It shows somebody who simply does not recognise what is going on under his nose. America will never wander into Pakistan&mdash;that is not what was being suggested. It was an offering saying &quot;Let's work together&quot;. There must be a more cognitive solution than there is now.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/5">There is not time to pay tribute to all the good work that has been done, and although scores of al-Qaeda operatives have been arrested in Pakistan, the threat continues, and Benazir Bhutto's assassination suggests that more needs to be done. Our concerns about Pakistan lie in the mountains, but the battle for hearts and minds is here in London, Leicester, Bradford and every town and city. We want to encourage the freedom of religious beliefs, where that religion is harmonised with British society, not hijacked to fight it.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/6">I hope that my speech is not taken out of context and that nobody removes a section of it and uses it to say that I somehow deplore Islam or have a gripe or anger against Pakistan. That is absolutely not the case, and that is exactly what the people who corrupt the Koran in order to recruit are doing. I hope that it is not copied by others. I have a love for Pakistan and Afghanistan. I have spent a lot of time in Afghanistan in the past two years to try to understand it, and if I am trying to prevent westernisation anywhere&mdash;it is unhelpful in a country getting off its knees&mdash;it is in Afghanistan. Understanding local issues such as tribal influences, customs and history is fundamental to moving forward, as globalisation tends to threaten the old cultures as east and west clash in a world of ever-decreasing size.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/7">I am sure that we all want progress that swiftly brings peaceful elections, but Pakistan must put up its hand and acknowledge that it needs international support to rid itself of al-Qaeda's influence. We must put up our hand and say that home-grown terrorism is real and that more can be done to engage with our Muslim community to ensure that the well-trodden path of extremism between Britain and Pakistan is finally closed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-16a.295.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" speakername="Tony Baldry" colnum="295"  time="015:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080116/halltext/80116h0006.htm#08011692000487">
	<p pid="a.295.0/1">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> has more reason than most of us to be concerned about the impact of senseless terrorism. My comments may carry a slightly different nuance from his. There are three words for Pakistan to consider: democracy, democracy and democracy. Tragically, 60 years after partition, India and Pakistan could not be further apart. India is a vibrant democracy and will be a middle-income country by about 2015, having raised millions of people out of poverty. It should never be forgotten that there are more Muslims in India than in Pakistan. On the other side of the border, Pakistan is a faltering state, to employ the Foreign Office's new terminology&mdash;it is something approaching a failing state, I think. It has effectively been a military dictatorship for a number of years.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/2">I was impressed by the Secretary of State's new year message advocating a return to democracy in countries such as Pakistan and Kenya. Bronwyn Maddox, whom we all know from reading <i>The Times</i>, put it well a little while ago in an article, asking,</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/3" class="indent">&quot;is the pursuit of democracy compatible with stability? For eight years President Musharraf said no, justifying his status as military leader by his claim to deliver stability and help in pursuing terrorists. For most of the eight years the US bought that answer; Britain was more equivocal.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/4" class="indent">It did not take the assassination of Benazir Bhutto two weeks ago to shatter that case. The pressure put on Musharraf by the US and Britain to let her return in October signalled frustration with him. It has been clear for years that the military was a cause of serious unrest, not the solution&mdash;appropriating land and large commercial interests, and inflaming tensions between the provinces and different ethnic groups.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/5">Rageh Omaar, whom many of us have seen on television, commented:</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/6" class="indent">&quot;Pakistan is facing a twin crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/7" class="indent">The first is the fact that Pakistanis are fighting Pakistanis, due to the country's integral involvement in the &quot;war on terror&quot;; a campaign whose military successes are, many feel, far outweighed by its social and political failures towards people in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/8" class="indent">The second is that Pakistan has still not found an alternative to military governments.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/9">Of course, it is difficult to find an alternative to military Governments when there is a military dictatorship, not democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/10">Many of us in the House counted Benazir as a friend, and&mdash;I declare an interest&mdash;my chambers represented her for a while in legal proceedings. She moved between London and Dubai for all those years. Which of us can name any other democrats who have been able to rise up the Pakistani political system? Which of us can name more than a couple of leading members of the Pakistan Peoples Party? Of course, such people would not come forward while there was a system in which democrats were undermined and the military prevailed.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/11">It got slightly worse than that, because there was always an incentive for the military to justify itself either in the campaigns in Kashmir or by defining Pakistan as what it was not&mdash;namely, India. If the military created enemies, it could justify its existence. William Dalrymple put it this way:</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The most pressing crisis now facing Pakistan comes in the shape of the country's many armed and dangerous jihadi groups. For 25 years the military and Pakistan's powerful intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) have been the paymasters of myriad mujaheddin groups intended for deployment first in Afghanistan and then Kashmir. While the military may have once believed that it could use jihadis for its own ends, the Islamists have followed their own agendas and have now brought their struggle onto Pakistani streets and into the heart of the country's politics.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/13">I do not think that anyone who has been involved in foreign policy in the past 20 years will be unaware of the many times we have received representations from the Indian Government about armed groups from Pakistan being sent into Kashmir and elsewhere for Pakistan's own purposes. That monster has now turned on Pakistan. The only way in which we will make long-term progress in Pakistan is through a fundamental, resolute and complete return to democracy. We have tried the ends justifying the means for a decade now, and it has not worked.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/14">I accept that other hon. Members will fundamentally disagree with my next point. I do not believe that the international community and the Government of Pakistan will win over the people of the north-west frontier province and tribal areas by creating the impression that those people are the enemies of civilisation. I was introduced to the north-west frontier province in maths lessons at the age of 11. My maths master was Brigadier Picton, whose great-grandfather had commanded the artillery at Waterloo, and Picton himself had commanded a brigade on the north-west frontier. He brought trigonometry very much to life for me by using fire plans for tribal villages, which, I suspect, were somewhere near Peshawar.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/15">I was also taught that the British empire, at the height of its strength, had not succeeded in bringing the north-west frontier province under its control. Indeed, as hon. Members know, all that we sought to do during the whole time that we occupied India, which then included Pakistan, was to keep the road from Peshawar, through Landi Kotal and on to Kandahar, open, and we were helped in that operation by the Khyber Rifles. When one makes that journey, as I am sure that the Minister and many other hon. Members have done, one sees the signs listing the regiments that have sought to keep the road and the railway line open. To be honest, the tribal regions have managed extremely well on that basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/16">Of course, I appreciate that the arrival of Taliban elements and training camps has introduced a new dimension, but giving the impression that the whole region has somehow been taken over by the Taliban and other terrorists does not help. What Pakistan needs is a war on poverty, because as India progresses, Pakistan is going backwards. Rates of illiteracy are also increasing, which means that we have the most terrifying of all faltering states&mdash;an increasingly illiterate nuclear power.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/17">My plea this afternoon is very simple. We should do everything that we can through Parliament, the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and other means to promote democracy in Pakistan. If things get difficult in Pakistan, we should not suggest to Musharraf that the army is the only body that can sort things out or that we will continue to give it support, comfort, succour and funding. The United States has pursued that practice over the past 20 years, while we have rather been sitting on our hands, but it has failed. We now need robust democracy, the rule of law and the encouragement of an independent judiciary and an independent media&mdash;the sorts of practice that other parts of the region take as the norm. Only in that way will we defeat terrorism in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/18">My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East made some perfectly good points regarding concerns about terrorism in the UK. However, we all need to reflect on the fact that some of the suicide bombers in the UK were born and brought up here&mdash;it is not simply a matter of terrorism being imported from overseas. Those who perpetrated the 9/11 atrocities were middle-class and, in particular, affluent young Saudis, so this is not just a matter of poverty. I have a not insignificant Kashmiri community in my constituency. When I visit the mosque or talk to members of that community, I find, as I am sure that other colleagues do, that they are as horrified by the practices that we are discussing as anyone else; they want a peaceful life and to bring up their children here. They also want people in the areas of Pakistan from which their fathers and grandfathers came to have a peaceful life. The issues before us are therefore quite complex.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/19">We will not make progress in Pakistan, however, until the rule of democracy starts to prevail and we see democrats with whom we can interact and engage a dialogue, and whom we can encourage. The longer Pakistan remains a military state under the rule of the army, and the longer it is effectively controlled by the army, the ISI and other groups, the more difficult it will be to resolve the issues to which my hon. Friend has rightly drawn our attention.</p>

	<p pid="a.297.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> on securing this timely debate. He opened it in a thorough and well-informed way and he obviously has some experience of the issues. Not only does he come from a military background, but he has had personal experience of tragedy, given that terrorism has touched the lives of his family, which is particularly poignant and a sober reminder to us all of the gravity of the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/2">We are at a critical point in the history of Pakistan, and events are unfolding quickly. Not long ago, there was talk of the political end game being in sight in the form of a possible power-sharing deal between Benazir Bhutto and Pervez Musharraf. Now, sadly, we are looking to the future with greater uncertainty. In just the past four months, we have seen the return from exile of Ms Bhutto, the imposing and then lifting of a state of emergency, the swearing-in of Mr. Musharraf as a civilian President, the seismic events around Ms Bhutto's assassination and the postponement of the parliamentary elections until February. Today's debate is therefore taking place on shifting ground, and things will remain turbulent for some time to come. Nevertheless, we must continue to discuss and scrutinise Government policy as we pursue the goal of a democratic and stable Pakistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/3">I want to pick up various issues. One is the importance of holding free and fair elections in Pakistan next month. Another is the investigation that is taking place into the death of Benazir Bhutto. I also want to discuss development aid and the training of terrorists in Pakistan, some of whom may be UK citizens, as well as longer-term issues, such as development and good governance.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/4">I am sure that all hon. Members were horrified to hear the news of the assassination of Benazir Bhutto on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-27">27 December</phrase>, while the House was on its Christmas break. My personal thought was that it was just a few months ago, in the autumn, that Benazir Bhutto held a meeting in one of Glasgow's hotels, to which various elected representatives and leaders from the city's Muslim community had been invited. I, too, attended that event and I remember listening to Ms Bhutto's eloquent and confident speech, which had a real note of optimism and hope. At that point, she had not yet gone back to Pakistan, and there was no certainty that she would do so. Listening to her comments, however, I felt that we could be optimistic about the future if things were made to work in that troubled country. It is very shocking to go from attending a civilised and interesting meeting in a Glasgow hotel to seeing on the news just a few short months later the assassination of Benazir Bhutto.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/5">There is clearly uncertainty about the facts of Ms Bhutto's death. One report says that there was a suicide bomber, while another says that there was a gunman, and we even had the strange story about the sunroof. That uncertainty is obviously causing huge concern in Pakistan at this politically sensitive time, and there is suspicion about whether the facts are being covered up. Understandably, Ms Bhutto's husband requested that there should be no post-mortem, but that has not helped the situation, and the hosing-down of the scene just an hour and a half after the attack has certainly not helped to allay suspicions. It is therefore welcome that a team from Scotland Yard is in Pakistan to assist with the investigation. Given the sensitivity of the issue and the need to get the facts straight, however, it is not only the quality of the investigation that is important, although the Scotland Yard detectives will certainly be invaluable in that respect, but also the perception of the investigation; it must be seen to be independent. There are wide calls for a UN investigation into the death of Benazir Bhutto, which would help to give that perception of independence and to give the people of Pakistan some confidence that the real causes will be investigated and not covered up. There is a precedent in the investigation into the death of Rafik Hariri in Lebanon in 2004. I shall be interested to know whether the Minister will indicate Government support for such a UN investigation, and whether we might press for it internationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">The hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> highlighted the importance of &quot;democracy, democracy and democracy&quot; and obviously the most important and pressing issue for the UK is to do everything possible to ensure that the elections next month are free and fair. The short delay in holding the elections is welcome and inevitable. If such events took place in the UK shortly before a general election was scheduled, there would no doubt be a similar delay. Such a postponement is certainly fair enough in a democracy. We can still hope for stable parliamentary elections, which could result in a peaceful and fair result, and a step forward for the country, but the EU monitoring mission will be crucial in ensuring that the elections are conducted properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-07">7 January</phrase> the Foreign Secretary was positive about the number of election monitors who would be going to Pakistan. At the time he may not have had the exact numbers to hand; he said that there might be an increase, up to about 100. Can the Minister give us an update on how many monitors will go from the EU, and what Britain will do to ensure that we support and resource additional monitors, who will surely be needed in the current circumstances of heightened tension?</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/8">Musharraf's suspension and firing of key judges was clearly a great blow to the country's institutions. Because the judiciary has been put in place by Musharraf, it will be a struggle to see the elections as free and fair. I hope that the Government will push Musharraf to reinstate the members of the judiciary who were suspended or fired, so that the rest of the country can be confident that an independent judiciary will be scrutinising the parliamentary elections. I should be interested to hear from the Minister what representations the Government made in November when Musharraf decided to suspend or fire judges, which was clearly a bad omen of what was to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/9">The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East spoke well about training camps, which are indeed a real problem in the country, but he was also right to talk about tackling the problem at home. Indeed, he said that until 2005 we were in denial about the fact that there were British citizens, born, bred and educated in the UK, and immersed in our society, who could do such unspeakable and horrific things. That is something the country needs to grapple with; we need programmes and initiatives to reach out to people who may be disaffected and vulnerable to the types of extremist rhetoric that can lead people down that path.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/10">We need to look, from an intelligence point of view, at the traffic of people between Britain and Pakistan. Obviously hundreds of thousands of British citizens of Pakistani origin live in the UK, and as a result many&mdash;415,000, I think&mdash;go back to Pakistan each year. Only a small minority of them will be lured into the training camps, but it is necessary for the intelligence services to focus on that small minority, so that procedures can be established to halt anything they may plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1443" name="Brooks Newmark">The hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark)</phrase> pointed out that the people concerned are a small minority and that there is great anger in the Muslim community&mdash;that is certainly so in my constituency, and in others too. There is a feeling that the peaceful religion of Islam is being hijacked by people of extreme political views, spouting a version that bears no resemblance to the religion peacefully followed by Muslims in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/12">There are a variety of Government initiatives, including, in the past, 10-point plans, to tackle home-grown terrorism. Changing the mindset of British citizens who do not feel loyalty to our country's values must be a priority. I hope that the Minister can report back on the success so far of the initiatives, and on the lessons learned about what does not work, and what will be changed as a result.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/13">To turn to the question of what can be done in Pakistan, the hon. Member for Banbury was right to focus on poverty and deprivation. We know that both are great breeding grounds for terrorism, and the hon. Gentleman clearly has great knowledge of the country. That is certainly a key to getting to grips with the issue. Pakistan has been a key ally in the war on terror, but the development support we give is crucial to success. The human development of Pakistan is a long-term policy for making the world a safer place: improving education and reducing poverty will also reduce extremism and even, we hope, stabilise the north-west frontier province, where there is the most intense problem with terrorism and al-Qaeda. Of course, reducing conflict and instability there will have a knock-on effect on stability in Afghanistan, where we also have a particular interest, given the presence of our troops. Education must be the cornerstone of the work, especially in stopping people going to madrassahs. I should be interested to know whether the Government have any plans to assist with the expansion of state education in Pakistan, which is not available in many parts of the country. Obviously, when there is no state education, there is a void into which others, who may want to indoctrinate young people, can step.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/14">It is obviously important that Pakistan should have strong political and legal institutions. Those have certainly been undermined by the Musharraf regime; corruption is rife and as we have said members of the judiciary have been suspended. I should be interested to know what the Government are doing to build up those institutions, to help democracy gain a foothold in Pakistan. Free and fair elections will produce stable government only with the back-up of solid institutions, particularly in the longer term. Similarly, there is a need for links with political parties, civil society and even the military, to create the political leverage to get people round a table, working together.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/15">I should like to know how critical the Government may have been, in private, of Musharraf. Sometimes they have been seen not to be as critical as one might like, particularly in cases such as the suspension of members of the judiciary. Although Pakistan has been an ally in the so-called war on terror, if that comes at the expense of our ability strongly to condemn actions likely to destabilise the country, the result will be only to fan the flames of terrorism, which is contrary to the objective.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/16">I have one further concern to flag up with the Minister. News reports of the US response to the situation in Pakistan suggested that CIA activity on the borders has been intensifying, possibly with a view to unilateral US action there. I hope that the Minister will be firm in condemning any such suggestion of unilateral action. We need to learn from previous mistakes in foreign policy and to act as a coherent international community through proper international institutions. I hope that the UK will strongly counsel the US against any such action, and will in no circumstances support it.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/17">In conclusion, there is clearly a volatile and dangerous situation in Pakistan. Given the links to terrorist training camps and organisations in that country, there could be an impact on security in the UK and globally. Free and fair elections are vital to unlocking the problem, and for the sake of the confidence of people in Pakistan the death of Benazir Bhutto must be properly investigated; I argue for a UN investigation. Here at home, the UK must intensify action to prevent home-grown terrorism; and abroad it must consider development aid and support for Pakistani democratic, judicial and educational institutions. Perhaps we shall be able to look forward in hope to peaceful elections on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-18">18 February</phrase>, and a step forward for democracy in Pakistan. The Government must obviously use every effort to influence the various stakeholders internationally to achieve that outcome. It will no doubt be a long process, and I am sure that the House will return to the issue before long.</p>

	<p pid="a.301.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> on securing the debate. Obviously, he has a tragic personal interest in the matter, but he has travelled widely in the area and speaks with a great deal of authority on it. May I also confirm that you, Mr. Cummings, are an early riser and a member of the parliamentary breakfast club, which is the most influential parliamentary organisation after the Whips, and in which reputations are made and frequently destroyed?</p>
	<p pid="a.301.0/2">The subject of the debate is absolutely crucial and serious. We should first consider it in terms of the narrow aspects of Pakistani politics&mdash;on which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> focused&mdash;and our desire to move Pakistan towards democracy and, at least, a civilian Government. However, that alone will not necessarily be the answer, and it will not be the kind of pure democracy that we associate with the United States, ourselves and the European Union, but it will be a step in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.0/3">Secondly, what happens in Pakistan has an immediate, knock-on effect on what happens in Afghanistan, where we have a substantial military commitment and members of our armed forces are, sadly, dying&mdash;perhaps even as we speak. It also has a blowback effect in the UK and Europe. I take the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East made about the interview with the head of the US Department of Homeland Security yesterday, in which he said that the major terrorist threat now facing the US comes from Europe. He added, in parenthesis, that the threat was not home-grown, in the sense of being traditional, but was deeply connected with the middle east and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.0/4">The first thing that we must do is establish the extent of the terrorist threat. In the past, we have failed to recognise its extent, not only in the numbers of young men and women who are prepared to commit suicide to further their religious, personal and political beliefs, but in the kind of widespread support organisations that are available. That is challenging in a way that we have never seen before. Much of that support is based in Pakistan, and we must remember that much of the threat is aimed not just at the UK and so-called western interests, but at hundreds of members of the Pakistani security forces and the Pakistani political elite&mdash;for example, the recent tragic killing of Benazir Bhutto&mdash;as well as ordinary members of the Pakistan public who get in the way of extremists. We should recognise that it is not an either/or issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.0/5">The next matter to address, given the extent of the terrorist threat, is how we should deal with it. The previous and current Prime Ministers and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> have recognised that this matter will go on, possibly for decades, and it will be a question of using every weapon at our disposal. When I say &quot;weapon,&quot; I am talking in the true, old-fashioned Marxist-Leninist sense to include political, economic, social, military and police weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.0/6">In these kinds of debate, we often fail to recognise that the United Kingdom is not trying to deal with the threat on its own. My hon. Friend the Member for Banbury reminisced about his childhood, when the British empire was at its height. I was a sad person this summer, because I reverted to my real profession of military historian and reread a number of very good studies of previous conflicts on the Pakistan north-west frontier. Four years ago an Australian wrote a very good book about the Waziristan campaign in 1937-38. The circumstances of that campaign were entirely different to those we face at present, but we declared victory at the end of 1938 when it was really a score draw, as we were unable to impose our direct will on the area and we ended up by compromising.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.0/7">That brings me to the main thrust of the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East about what we need to do in Pakistan. Any demonstrable attempt by the US or by the UK and our NATO allies that gives the impression to the Pakistani military&mdash;or, indeed, to public opinion or the democratic parties there&mdash;that we wish to be seen visibly to take over large parts of Pakistani security policy and to deploy even only elements of obviously uniformed military force in the country will be utterly counter-productive. Of course, I do not suggest that my hon. Friend was proposing that.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.0/8">We need to think far more in terms of the lengthy discussions that our military commanders and political advisers have been having in Afghanistan with President Karzai and his Government. I know the Government have been working hard on that. We must attempt to persuade the Pakistanis to do things that are not only in their national interests but in our interests, too, which is not easy. The Pakistani armed forces are the key; it is no good pretending that we can ignore them. I see one possible opportunity in the next few months that might help with the move back to democracy&mdash;the role of the new chief of the general staff in Pakistan, General Kiyani. He has tremendous experience of the west, and is more in the tradition of a military professional. I think that he recognises that the Pakistani army has to get out of politics, not only because he has seen the damage that has been done, but because he believes the Pakistani armed forces have been humiliated by what has happened on the north-west frontier.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.0/9">The crucial question for Ministers is: what action can the British Government take to give political military assistance to the Pakistani authorities&mdash;both the political Government and the military and security services&mdash;to be most effective against terrorism? The Minister must also consider the wider national security problem of coping with the blowback from terrorism in the UK. That is not just about the home-grown, mainly young, British born and bred people who are prepared to be involved in terrorism, but about the kind of moral, cultural and political support they receive, largely, but not exclusively, from Pakistan. There are no quick fixes, but we must, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East said, consider far more seriously the latitude we have given, for example, to some of the Islamic extremists who operate in this country. Indeed, the way in which they behave and operate is the despair of many British Muslims.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.0/10">My final point is that it is wrong for us to believe that we are fighting a uniform, global terrorist organisation. We are not. We are fighting a multi-faced group of organisations and individuals who coalesce, often because it is to their advantage. However, they have their weaknesses, too, and we must be much more political and subtle in dealing with the problem. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising the subject. Although there has been only a limited number of speakers, we have had an informed debate and I look forward, as always, to the Minister's reply.</p>

	<p pid="a.303.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> on securing this important debate. May I also join <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> in wishing that there had been more contributions to the debate? I was surprised by the low turnout, given the centrality of these issues to contemporary politics, as hon. Members have reminded us. I will certainly try in the time that is left to address at least some of the questions that have been raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.0/2">The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East is right to raise this serious problem. In 2007, we calculated that there were some 60 suicide bombings, and it is estimated that 770 people were killed and 1,600 injured by terrorist attacks in that year alone in Pakistan. That is an appalling figure by any reckoning, and given that there were only 15 attacks in the previous four years, the extent of the problem becomes obvious: it is a very urgent one and it is increasing. As the number of shootings and suicide bombing increases, so too does the terrorists' capability, as can be seen, for example, in the double suicide bombings in September and November 2007 against intelligence and military targets in Rawalpindi, which is home to the army headquarters. The town was always regarded as the most secure place in Pakistan, but it was in Rawalpindi, despite the security measures available, that Benazir Bhutto was killed on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-27">27 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.0/3">There is no sign of an early solution. Last Thursday, a suicide bomb in Lahore killed more than 20 policemen, just a day after the Pakistani Government finalised security arrangements in an attempt to combat sectarian violence between Shias and Sunnis during the holy month of Muharram. On Monday, at least nine people were killed in a bomb attack in Karachi. The city constitutes one of the most dangerous postings for Foreign Office consular staff, and it is a very difficult environment in which to operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.0/4">The assassination of Benazir Bhutto, as we have heard, was a senseless attack and a tragedy, both personally and politically. Mrs. Bhutto's undoubted commitment to democracy in Pakistan and her sense of duty towards its people led her to take the risk of returning to the country to campaign for election. The attack on her was an attack on all those committed to democracy in Pakistan, but people who share her commitment will, I am sure, be strengthened in their resolve to fight for a safe, peaceful and democratic Pakistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.0/5">I want to pay tribute to the characteristically thoughtful and insightful contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase>. I was particularly struck by the point that he made about how difficult it is to recognise the nature of the democratic system in Pakistan. I kept trying to think of the right phrase, but it is certainly something to do with the cult of the individual within the parties. He was particularly insightful in reminding us that the election or appointment of a new leader is almost a dynastic passage. It had not struck me before, but it did so forcibly when the hon. Gentleman said it, that the lack of a well-known top echelon of politicians in Pakistan makes the situation difficult, and often leads to people calling on those who have left in the diaspora to come back. One thinks of a talented Prime Minister, Shaukat Aziz, who was brought back from America, I believe, with considerable experience in the banking industry. He began to address the problems that the hon. Member for Banbury highlighted of deficiencies in the economic life of Pakistan and the fact that it compared poorly with India. There have been great successes in Pakistan to which we should pay tribute, and I know that the hon. Gentleman would want us to do so. However, his observation on the nature of politics in Pakistan is something that we should remember.</p>

	<p pid="a.304.1/1">I could not possibly comment on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.1/2">The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East reminded us of the way in which General Zia Islamised&mdash;I hope that that is not a crude way of putting it&mdash;many of Pakistan's institutions. I have seen that myself. Whether one is up in Waziristan, in the north-west frontier province in general, or even in Baluchistan, one hears complaints, especially from the officer class, that the politicisation of the most effective and coherent institution in Pakistan&mdash;the army&mdash;has been to its detriment. There has been a belief around for a long time now&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.306.3/1">We are challenging those ideas and paying an enormous amount of attention to the problem. We have hugely increased the expenditure and resources available to our intelligence services over the past five years. The hon. Gentleman is quite right to raise the issue: the 7/7 bombings in 2005 were a wake-up call for everyone, but they should not have come as a shock. As he said, we should have picked up those messages earlier. We were picking them up earlier, but doing something about them means challenging our own culture as well. We are a very open country.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.3/2">London is sometimes been ridiculed as &quot;Londonistan&quot;, which can be viewed as an accurate description of the way in which we have allowed many groups, including some that are outlawed in their own country, to operate here. That has been the nature of this democracy of ours for a very long time. It is a great shame that the terrorism that we have suffered is sometimes been the consequence of that openness and willingness to welcome people.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.3/3">When I was in Waziristan, I met a colonel from the frontier corps who told me about a battle with some al-Qaeda/Taliban groups. They are a mixed bunch in Waziristan, and some people will shoot at someone simply because they do not know them, and they are an outsider. As I have told the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk before, the colonel told me that his people suffered heavy losses, but when they looked at the bodies of those whom they had killed in the battle, they found that the military commander was Chechen, the armourer and fixer was Uzbek, the moneybags was Saudi and the foot soldiers were mainly Pashtuns from the various tribes in the area. That was how they operated. They had to live off the land. The money and sometimes the guns that they received came from as far away as Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are very much aware of that, which is why we have to maintain good relations with them when it comes to trying to co-ordinate action in Pakistan, which is subject to the attentions of some very unsavoury people. The people involved are not just Pakistanis and expatriate Brits; they are from all over the place. It is a very difficult issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.3/4">Let me address some of the other issues that were raised. The hon. Member for Banbury, quite properly, opened up the subject of the need for education and the tiny amount&mdash;I think that it is less than 2 per cent. of gross domestic product&mdash;that is spent on education in Pakistan. I have visited madrassahs across Pakistan&mdash;and I have been taken to the best of the madrassahs&mdash;where I was shocked. Most shocking of all is the fact that many people in Pakistan do understand that they live in an increasingly competitive world, that they have to compete with, among others, India, their next-door neighbour, and that if they cannot raise skill levels in Pakistan, the problem will become worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.3/5">The hon. Gentleman identified the issue very sharply. I wrote down what he said: &quot;Pakistan needs a war on poverty because it constitutes an increasingly illiterate nuclear power.&quot; That should stop us in our tracks. We have become, quite rightly in my opinion, very worried about the Iranian nuclear programme, but Pakistan already has nuclear weapons and delivery systems and, as the hon. Members for Bournemouth, East and for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) told us, it could well break up. It is very important that we recognise the importance of maintaining the integrity of Pakistan's borders, because if it does break up, the whole area will become much more problematic.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.3/6">I have been reassured when I have been in Pakistan that the army is keeping a tight rein on the nuclear sites and missiles. As the House has been told before, one has only to go back two or three years to see the danger to the world of a stand-off between Pakistan and India. That was a very dangerous moment. The worst nightmare that one can imagine is an al-Qaeda attack on a nuclear establishment in which such people perhaps got hold of some of that stuff. Trying to help Pakistan to maintain security and, at the same time, encouraging it to begin to behave like a modern nation in the way in which it educates its young people is therefore vital. That is the proper way forward and it is the route that we are following.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.3/7">I was very glad to hear the contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase>. I remind her, however, that Pakistan is a sovereign nation&mdash;a very big sovereign nation that is very proud of its identity and the integrity of its borders. We would like to do many things in many countries in the world, but when it comes to, for example, a UN investigation into the death of Benazir Bhutto, it is a different situation from that of Hariri, because when Hariri was murdered, the Lebanese were worried that the murder had been planned and carried out by people from another country. I have not heard that as far as this murder is concerned&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.309.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to initiate this debate regarding the future of personality disorder services provided by the Henderson hospital in my constituency. Last week, I brought a delegation made up of clinicians and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" name="Tom Brake">the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase> to see the Minister about the decision to close the Henderson in March. I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to catch your eye during the debate, Mr. Cummings.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/2">My message today is simple: unless the Minister acts, the NHS is in danger of sleepwalking into the closure of this nationally and internationally renowned service. The diagnosis of personality disorder covers conditions and disorders that arise from severe emotional distress and inner chaos, most often as a result of trauma, childhood abuse or neglect, to the extent that such people are unable to manage life. As a result, they may suffer from depression, psychosis, have suicidal urges, harm themselves and others, have eating disorders, misuse drugs or alcohol, or be involved in crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/3">The Henderson is a unique service because it is a self-governing community. The residents take responsibility for running the service, from cooking, cleaning, ordering food and gardening to selecting new residents, running meetings, supporting peers through crises and liaising with staff. Residents are not prescribed psychiatric medication, as the aim is to work through the underlying issues causing their problems. The Henderson is a 24/7 community in which the range of activities includes intensive group psychotherapy, sociotherapy, psychodrama and art therapy. It is completely unlike any traditional psychiatric hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/4">Prospective residents are offered support to prepare them for admission from an outreach team, which also offers post-discharge support. The Henderson allows its residents to work through complex and extremely painful issues such as childhood sexual abuse, which would be dangerous to explore in a non-residential setting when there is a risk of self-harm, violence or disassociation after discussing such difficult matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/5">The Henderson is 60 years old. It has a long history of research and expertise in treating personality disorder in this country. The hospital is a unique national training resource, offering clinical placements, workshops and conferences for a wide range of staff working in both the health service and the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/6">In 1997, the Henderson's funding was secured by the national specialist commissioning advisory group in recognition of the fact that the then internal market had caused a dramatic fall in referrals. At the same time, convinced by the research evidence, NSCAG asked the Henderson to establish two other services in the north of England. Sadly, with the prospect of devolution of funding to primary care trusts, one of those services, Webb house in Crewe, has closed because of commissioning problems and the other, Main house in Birmingham, is also under threat. As last week's deputation to the Minister explained, the Henderson is not a local service; it is a national service receiving referrals from places ranging from Land's End to Northern Ireland to John o'Groats. I have already sent the Minister in a letter some figures that confirm that.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/7">Last year, funding was devolved from NSCAG to PCTs. Unfortunately, in the devolving of those funds, the money from NSCAG was divided up between PCTs on the basis of population, rather than level of usage. Before the change in funding, the Henderson had a six-month waiting list. The transfer of funds to PCTs saw a fall in funded referrals from an average annual referral rate of 220 cases before the devolution of budgets to PCTs to just 33 since April 2007 to date. Such a dramatic fall can be accounted for, just as it was the last time round, only by the change in commissioning arrangements. Psychiatrists surveyed by the Henderson report that the uncertainty about the Henderson's future, the bureaucracy involved in applying for funding and the lack of PCT funding are preventing them from referring suitable patients. Clearly, the funding system, not clinical need, is driving the Henderson to the edge of extinction.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-16a.311.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="311"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080116/halltext/80116h0009.htm#08011692000504">
	<p pid="a.311.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. That point was made during the deputation last week, and I shall underscore it later with some of the research evidence that underpins the model used at the Henderson and the other facilities that I mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/2">Given the policy context provided by the national institute, how does the Minister justify a situation whereby five residential services for complex personality disorder from around the country are gradually being lost because of piecemeal decisions made by individual PCTs? Does he accept the national institute's view that therapeutic community models such as the Henderson and Main house are an essential part of the services for the treatment of severe personality disorder? Will he concede that to close the Henderson would be to exclude the most complex cases of personality disorder from the most appropriate treatment, that that would be against the guidance of the national institute and, therefore, contrary to Government policy?</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/3">The Minister rightly asked about the evidence base when we met last week. There is a strong evidence base for the approach I described. In 1995, the Henderson carried out a peer reviewed study that compared patients treated for a minimum of three months with patients who were refused funding for their treatment. The two groups did not differ in their demographic or clinical features on referral. In total, fewer than one in five of the treated sample were either convicted or re-admitted to hospital after one year of discharge, compared with more than half of the non-funded group. In short, those who participate in the Henderson therapeutic community are less dependent on psychiatric services and less likely to enter the criminal justice system after leaving treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/4">Research also shows that in the year before admission to Henderson, a cohort of 24 patients used a total of &pound;335,196 worth of psychiatric and prison services. In the first post-discharge year, no patients spent time in prison or a secure psychiatric unit. The total cost of the latter services was only &pound;31,390, which represents a huge saving to the public purse and a huge benefit to the individuals who received the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/5">What is the way forward? I believe that the Minister will tell us that the answer lies with the merger of the Henderson with the Cassel. I do not believe that that is the way forward. That option is all about short-term fixes to get two hard-pressed mental health trusts out of a financial jam. Merger would not meet the need: some people with personality disorder who go to the Henderson could never be referred to a new service at the Cassel because of the latter's families unit. Merger would provide cover for the closure of the Henderson, a cut in residential places and the loss of critical expertise. In the end, the service that would emerge from a merger process would be smaller and even more vulnerable to the vagaries of local commissioning.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/6">Frankly, it is unfair to leave South West London and St. George's mental health trust to sort out a national issue. A halt is required to give opportunity and space for the proper consideration of the alternative options. That is about having either national or regional specialist commissioning of a network of therapeutic communities. I hope that the Minister will give serious consideration to that proposal because his Department alone could bring all the agencies, local commissioners, the host organisations that provide the services, and the national specialist commissioning group around the table. If that does not happen, we would have to ask what will happen to the people who do not go to the Henderson in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/7">The loss of the service would leave some of the most marginalised and stigmatised people in our society at risk. Instead of being treated, those people are likely to become the victims of revolving door admissions to inappropriate acute mental health services. They are likely to be medicated but not treated, and, worse still, they could wind up in prison or even committing suicide. They deserve better&mdash;I hope we can achieve that.</p>

	<p pid="a.312.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> on securing the debate. I shall make no apologies if I go over the same ground that he covered or that was covered in the meeting that the Minister kindly arranged last week.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/2">As hon. Members heard, the Henderson is a last resort for many of its patients. Many of those will have exhausted mainstream treatment and care including psychiatric medication, and imprisonment and sectioning under mental health legislation. I should like to tell Members two personal stories that give insight to the Henderson's healing role.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/3">Fifty-three year old Veritee was a resident at the Henderson in 1975. She describes herself at the time as desperate, chaotic and homeless. She had multiple problems, including drug use. Various in-patient psychiatric treatments were tried unsuccessfully. She was told that nothing could help her, until she was referred to the Henderson. She described it as a total success and has since gone on to work with young people and to found a charity for post-natal illness.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/4">Emma experienced self-harm, suicidal thoughts and an eating disorder. She was not helped by cognitive behavioural therapy, transactional analysis or anti-depressants. She turned her life around at the Henderson hospital. Ten years on, she is a senior academic who has a family of her own.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/5">I am fortunate to have a trusted, experienced member of staff who was helped by her stay at the Henderson&mdash;indeed, she prepared my speech. The treatment that Veritee, Emma, and my member of staff received at the Henderson was not out of line with Government policy; on the contrary, it was very much in line with what was set out in &quot;Who Pays? Establishing the Responsible Commissioner&quot;, which recommends residential psycho-therapeutic services for severe cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/6">The responsibility for funding such services is clear: it should be commissioned by specialist, national services. We should not lose the service simply because of a lack of specialist commissioning. Are commissioners in a position to ignore Government policy on specialist national services for personality disorder, and as a result to exclude the patients who can benefit from such a level of expert input? It seems that the South West London and St. George's trust was wrongly advised not to apply for national commissioning, but its position has changed. The Henderson is now putting together an application with the Cassel and Main house to provide a national network of services. A less satisfactory option, to which my hon. Friend referred, would be a merger, but there are significant issues on whether the commissioners would support such a service, and because of the number of beds that would be available. Clearly, the preferred option is specialist commissioning for the full network of residential communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/7">I should like to finish by saying that it is clear from talking to residents and from the other feedback that I have had that their view&mdash;indeed, these are their words&mdash;is that the Henderson</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/8" class="indent">&quot;gives you control over your own therapy &mdash; you're not just strapped to a bed and given drugs&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/9">Residents value the feedback from their peers, who have had similar experiences to them. They also value the 24/7 nature of the Henderson, as residents support each other to deal with their feelings after difficult therapy groups without resorting to destructive behaviour and they are helped to manage their symptoms in their daily lives outside of groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/10">I will conclude by asking the Minister whether, in the light of the facts presented here by my hon. Friend, myself and other Members through their interventions and also through the reports of the personal experiences of those who have benefited from the Henderson, he will support the application for the network of residential services from the Henderson, Main house and the Cassel for funding from the specialist commissioning groups?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-16a.313.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" speakername="Ivan Lewis" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="313"  time="016:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080116/halltext/80116h0009.htm#08011692000506">
	<p pid="a.313.0/1">First, I congratulate the hon. Members for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) and for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) on securing this important adjournment debate. I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1927" name="Stephen Hammond">the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1418" name="Lynne Jones">the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones)</phrase> on attending the debate. They wanted to make the case for the importance of specialist services for people with personality disorders, although I do not think that the importance of those services is the subject of this debate, which is about the nature of those services going forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/2">I acknowledge the specialist expertise, the commitment, professionalism and indeed the ethos of the Henderson hospital; the passion and level of support for its service is because people genuinely and strongly believe that it makes a tremendous difference to people's lives. There are many individual examples of people who feel that as a consequence of the treatment they received at Henderson their life chances are very different from what they might have been. There is thus no dispute about the specialist nature of Henderson; nor about the fact that it enjoys widespread support and that, for many people over a number of years, it has provided an incredibly important experience and, in some ways, a very different therapeutic experience from other mental health services, which one could describe as more mainstream, more conventional or more traditional.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/3">However, in the context of a debate such as this one, we must acknowledge that there have been changes in mental health care, just as when one looks at various physical conditions such as cancer or heart disease one can see that, thankfully, we do not provide the same care as we did 60 years ago. There has been massive and rapid reform and change in the way that we treat a variety of conditions. Indeed, however much we still have to do, mental health services in the UK are much better than they were 10, 15, 20 or 30 years ago, although they are nowhere near as good as they need to be. As the relatively new Minister with responsibility for mental health, I am passionately determined that we improve our mental health services, in terms of the continuum of interventions and care in every community.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/4">It is true that the nature of support for people with personality disorders is changing and an increasing number of people are receiving intensive support within their own homes. However, in the context of changing care and a different way of doing things, there will always be a need for high-quality tier 4 services, and there can be no dispute about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/5">The responsibility of commissioners is reasonably straightforward. It is to secure two things: quality outcomes for patients and value for money. The two go hand in hand, and any political party, particularly in opposition, which focuses on only one of those things is entirely dishonest. If such a party ever held responsibility for any service or any organisation, as Opposition parties do in many local authorities, part of the decisions it would have to make would involve achieving value for money as well as giving the local population what they clearly need and want.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/6">The other issue on which I agree with hon. Members is that we are talking about a specialist service. It cannot be commissioned on a PCT by PCT basis. In my view, it must be commissioned through regional networks. I think that is a really important statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/7">Can Ministers instruct the NHS at local level what it must do about its commissioning decisions? Members of the party of localism talk constantly in this Chamber&mdash;usually when people are not here&mdash;about not having command and control from Westminster and Whitehall, but instead allowing the people closest to local communities, whether defined regionally, sub-regionally or locally, to make decisions, so I find it quite extraordinary that they are trying to nationalise the issue; in my view, they are doing so, unfortunately, for political purposes. Much of the case that hon. Members have made is valid, but some of it fails to reflect the reality that we are moving away from command and control from offices in Westminster and Whitehall to a system where we devolve and give more responsibility, and where we trust&mdash;in this case&mdash;commissioners to make the right decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/8">I accept that the decisions cannot be made, in this case, on a purely local basis; they have to be made on a regional basis and I shall certainly be reinforcing that message through the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.315.2/1">I understand that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence is working up guidelines on borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder, which it expects to publish at the end of this year. Is not it vital that we keep services such as those at the Henderson and Main House going, so that when we see what the NICE recommendations are we can ensure that those services are still in place and able to evolve? As the Minister said, services will always evolve&mdash;we do not have a command and control structure&mdash;but we need to ensure that we do not lose services that may be the very services that will be recommended by NICE later on this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.316.3/1">Okay.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.3/2">Many people care passionately about the service and the unit, which I completely understand. However, it is important to be honest: Ministers are briefed and receive information from a variety of sources, and I know that there is a debate about the strength of the evidence for the interventions from the Henderson. There is no professional unanimity about whether its care model delivers outcomes so consistently that it would be superior to alternative interventions and models of care.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.3/3">I am not a clinical expert or best placed to make that judgment and those choices, and to come to conclusions. I am entirely reliant on the views of professionals, but I have received no advice suggesting that the model is far superior to other clinical interventions for people with personality disorders. I understand the professionalism and passion, and the unique ethos that has made a difference to many people's lives. The services must be commissioned regionally rather than by a single PCT. Services for people with personality disorders have changed and are changing, but there will always be a need for high-quality, tier 4 services. The matter lies in the hands of the local authorities that have been asked to decide whether they want to pursue the matter, and in the hands of regional commissioners.</p>

	<p pid="a.318.1/1">I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise this subject this afternoon. I am very much a passionate advocate of the extended school programme, which the Government launched in 2003. There has been a huge expansion of investment in that programme, which is designed for many purposes: to offer wrap-around services for children and young people in schools, between 8 am and 6 pm; to offer holiday programmes and enrichment opportunities in sport, drama, music and other activities; to reach out into communities; to offer parenting support; to involve people from local neighbourhoods in their schools; to turn those schools, which generally are highly trusted institutions, into a means of supporting neighbourhoods and contacting parents and others in the community, and to be a springboard for other services, such as access to health care and benefits advice and so forth. I am sure that the Minister will expand on that in her response.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/2">I am hugely in favour of the programme, which did not come about by accident; it was an act of political will to introduce it, with Sure Start, which it complements, and to find the money to develop them. I have one full service extended school in my constituency&mdash;Quinton Kynaston&mdash;and I know that the pupils there have benefited hugely from the services on offer. It has been run very well. As the Government's own evaluation of the extended school programme last summer demonstrated, that school has achieved improved results that seem to correlate strongly with the extended school provision itself. I understand that the Department's research, published last summer, found that the percentage improvement in GCSE results was double the national average. Not only did it produce academic benefits, but it seems to correlate with reduced levels of crime and antisocial behaviour. So there are many benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/3">As the Minister knows&mdash;she has been very generous in discussing this matter with me&mdash;my critique today is not of the service itself, but of the fact that, for a couple of important reasons, the schools and neighbourhoods that need the extended school offer the most are struggling to deliver it, and will struggle to sustain it, because of the way that resources are used. Some of those issues pertain specifically to the capital, and inner London, including my own local authority, and others pertain to the actions and behaviour of local authorities and their education departments and the ways in which they interact with schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/4">This debate is particularly germane, because the extended school offer is also central to the delivery of the next stage of lone parent employment and the welfare reform agenda. For that reason, I am very grateful for the timing of this debate. It is my contention, and that of the leading organisations in this field&mdash;the Minister knows that I am particularly indebted to the 4Children charity, which has taken an interest in this&mdash;that the offer does not match expectations for entry into the labour market for large numbers of lone parents. I shall return to those points later.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/5">The central thesis of my argument, which I have made to the Minister before, is that resources are needed to kick-start and to sustain the extended school offer. There are two issues: first, central Government support and funding; and secondly, the expectation about, and reliance on, charging policy. I shall deal with them separately.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/6">We have money that we did not have before, so I hope that the Minister understands that I do not intend to sound churlish. We all want more money, I understand that, and we all want more money than we can get into any given service, but the issue is about teasing out what the big numbers of national funding mean for local schools, what the expectation is and what can be delivered. In a letter from the Minister for Schools and Learners to me last June, the investment that was discussed was bundled up with the school standards fund. Indeed, locally, some of it has been bundled up with Sure Start grants. In the letter, the figure for the school standards fund, the personalised learning support and whatever else, added together was &pound;225 per secondary school pupil per year, which is good money and welcome for schools. However, it is not entirely fair to add the school standards fund and the personalised learning grant together and place them in the context of developing extended schools, because they are not the same thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/7">I hope that the Minister agrees that we are dealing with schools, such as most secondary schools in my constituency, that have a legacy of desperate underachievement. I do not want to use that word, but the children are all capable of achieving a great deal more. In our education authority, none the less, there is a legacy of serious attainment problems in most secondary schools. We have an academy, which is on the rise, but which achieved only 17 per cent. A to C grades last year, including in English and maths. Surely, we do not expect personalised learning grants to be put into the extended school programme. Those schools desperately need to invest everything that we give them in boosting the curriculum and their in-school provision. If we remove that grant, and consider the Kick Start grant that is dedicated to extended schools, and the Sure Start grant, each school receives &pound;14,000 to &pound;16,000 this year, which equates to about &pound;20 per child per year. As I have said in correspondence with the Minister, we must accept that it is not possible to provide wrap-around services that open at 8 am and close at 6 pm, offer holiday services for the summer, every half term and Easter, and provide enrichment and opportunities for sport, drama, music and all the other activities that we want to provide, for &pound;20 per child per year. It is not possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/8">In addition, some of our schools, particularly in inner London, have limited resources. They do not have outside space or playing fields, and in some cases, they are being asked to use their delegated budgets to access the facilities that provide the services that we want to provide. So, the situation is made even worse, because the Government offer money to schools, and they have increased core funding to schools dramatically, but in some cases, the local authority takes money with the other hand in order to levy charges for access to local sports fields.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/9">A representative of one secondary school told me during consultations in the past couple of weeks that it pays &pound;10,000 a year for off-site facilities, including sports pitches. Almost &pound;5,000 is spent just to access pitches on Paddington recreation ground. That &pound;10,000 is half the money that we provide for extended schools, so does the Minister agree that one thing an education authority can do&mdash;particularly in that case, the education authority in my constituency&mdash;is say, &quot;Let's at least support the ethos and practice of the extended school programme by ensuring that access to all local authority facilities, such as sports facilities, is free&quot;? It is no good our giving with one hand and taking away with the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/10">I am also concerned that investment in schools in the most deprived communities, and in children from the most deprived households, does not reflect their relative deprivation. That is a central point. I accept that the problem is due in part to the local authority's distribution formula, but it raises a bigger question for the Government. In my borough, we have an admittedly slightly larger secondary school, where 8 per cent. of children are on free school dinners. It receives from the Kick Start and Sure Start packages a larger grant than a secondary school that has 30 per cent. of children on free school dinners, 45 languages spoken, and 35 per cent. of children on school action and school action plus. If we are not only to enrich the lives of children, but to do something to close the opportunities gap for children from the most deprived backgrounds, that situation cannot be allowed to go unchallenged.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/11">I should like money to go to all those schools, and I am not trying to play the class warrior, but I have one ward where 83 per cent. of children live in workless households, many have been homeless, and by definition all live on benefits. They do not have access to the cultural enrichment that middle-class parents can offer their children, and we know that that matters. It is not the only thing that matters, people can overcome those disadvantages, and many do, but structurally that level of disadvantage matters and holds children back. We must reflect on how we can deliver an adequate offer that is biased towards children who experience the greatest disadvantages.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/12">The Government have made it clear that the Kick Start grant is meant to be just that, to set a service up and get it running, and that the expectation is for a charging policy to be introduced to maintain the service. The Minister reinforced that message in a letter to me a couple of weeks ago. I am not opposed in principle to a charging policy, but I am concerned about how it will interact with the needs of the lowest income households in order to make services sustainable. There are two problems. First, there are schools that have a high proportion of children with free school dinner entitlement. They are by definition less able to establish a sustainable charging policy. Parents on income support, incapacity benefit or whatever can neither pay nor draw on tax credit, and if there are enough children in a school from that background, building and sustaining a service will be impossible. I have explained to my right hon. Friend the Minister that we have schools with 30 to 60 per cent. of children with free school dinner entitlement, and the borough is in the top 10 for authorities with the highest proportion of children on free school dinners.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/13">A primary school head teacher wrote to me on Tuesday about the issue. Her school is able to draw on lottery money&mdash;a three-year lottery grant&mdash;to help it with sustainability, and she said:</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/14" class="indent">&quot;At the moment we are lucky in that we do not have to charge the parents for any clubs but this is only because they are run by teachers and we have the funding&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/15">the lottery money&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/16" class="indent">&quot;for external teachers&mdash;but this...will not last. It is a cause for concern because we know that there is a huge drop-out when they are charged (as seen at Play centre).&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/17">When Westminster city council increased its charges for play centres in primary schools, the number of children attending them halved, particularly among families on income support.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/18">The second, complementary, problem is that the Department for Children, Schools and Families argues that child care tax credit can help, but as the figures that I have provided to the Minister demonstrate, we are a very long way from making that a reality. The Minister knows from the figures that only 450 households in the entire borough are in receipt of the child care tax credit, which is a tiny proportion. That is equivalent to the number of parents in one primary school only, out of 50 schools in the entire borough. The problem is partly to do with take-up, but overwhelmingly to do with the structural issue of accessing tax credit in high-cost areas, particularly in London. Even in luckier areas, where tax credit receipt is much higher, Rhondda has only 850 recipients, Hartlepool only 660, the whole of Newcastle just over a thousand and even the whole city of Manchester only 3,000. Given that almost all the credit that is paid is used for high-cost under-five child care, I suggest that the number of people using it to pay for holiday and out-of-school provision is in the hundreds across the country. Child care tax credit has its place, but I suggest that that is not it.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/19">We know how many schools are delivering extended schools, which is excellent, and there has been real progress. We also know that in the autumn, under the Government's plans, 140,000 parents of 11 to 16-year-olds will be migrated on to jobseeker's allowance from income support. The Government's stated expectation is that there will be a service from 8 o'clock to 6 o'clock, 48 weeks a year, to back up current services. I appreciate that some of that will happen in 2009-10, but there will none the less be a national programme to meet the needs of those 140,000 people, with 260,000 people with children between five and 11 to be included later. Yet currently, as 4Children and the Make Space review have demonstrated, we have a place for only one in every 200 children. The need is urgent.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/20">I wish to ask the Minister a question to which I have not really had an answer. Who is really monitoring, and can provide hard data on, the availability of provision that constitutes child care, although we would not use those words, that is safe, secure and guaranteed from 8 o'clock until the start of the school day, from the end of the school day until 6 o'clock and in every school holiday&mdash;the need is flexible&mdash;in each school? It seems that there are different views in the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department for Children, Schools and Families about what extended school provision should do and what the guarantee will be.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/21">We need an urgent review of the capacity to meet the lone parent employment objectives. I should like a departmental commitment to review delivery in the most deprived areas first and a recognition of the difficulties that we have in delivering in high-cost areas with limited space. I want to see whether London Challenge can make recommendations on how we can deliver in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/22">I should like clearer, transparent monitoring of the delivery of full 8 o'clock to 6 o'clock, 48-weeks-a-year wraparound care, including holidays. I want assurance that we will consider the severe limitations of the child care tax credit for the purpose in question and that there are worked-up proposals for converting the credit into a voucher, which would be simpler, more accessible and help us to deliver the credit. I should like to be assured that the Department is having urgent consultations with regional development agencies. In London there has been the childcare affordability programme, which has been a huge success in a difficult environment, and a youth offer is improving provision for older teenagers. The gap in the market is provision for five to 15-year-olds, and the RDAs should be prevailed upon to help us fit the missing piece in the jigsaw.</p>

	<p pid="a.322.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> on securing the debate, and I thank her. She described herself as an advocate for children and young people, particularly for extended schools and related services. She is indeed a fierce advocate, and she has been responsible for getting the local authority in Westminster to think critically about how it operates its systems for the development of extended schools. There is scope for that to be done further.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/2">I know that my hon. Friend supports the fact that Government have given an explicit commitment and top priority to transforming options for children and young people and their parents at local level. As she rightly said, the services in extended schools, operating from 8 o'clock to 6 o'clock with a mandatory menu of options for children, range from study support and extra-curricular activities to support for parents. They include secure child care upon which parents can rely, which is part of a wide package of measures, including children's centres and placing on local authorities a duty in law to ensure that there is sufficient child care of different types that meets parents' needs, not just in its quantum but through its high quality and with the flexibility needed for their working patterns in the labour market.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/3">My hon. Friend will know that those changes, alongside the changes in maternity and paternity benefits and the right to request flexibility at work, are part of a package intended to give parents many more options for combining working and family life. There is a particular focus on families from more disadvantaged backgrounds, because it is for them that work is particularly important. It raises their standard of living and quality of life and can lift families out of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/4">My hon. Friend rightly mentioned the importance of extended schools for the development of children and young people. Children in many families get the opportunity to do enriching activities that are important for their development and relate directly to their ability to achieve academically. The activities are not just nice add-ons that are good things to do, they are an opportunity to develop skills such as leadership, initiative and creativity, which are part and parcel of children's development. It is important that we extend those opportunities to disadvantaged children. The objective of ensuring that children from more disadvantaged families have the opportunity to take part in extended activities in school is of paramount importance to the Government. It is one of our top priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/5">My hon. Friend began by talking about resources. We cannot, and I believe should not, orchestrate the process of developing services from the centre with a command and control model. We must necessarily depend on local authorities and their partners, including schools, to take the general policy direction and resources that the Government give them and relate them to their local needs. Within the constraints of how policy is defined, they should implement and provide services in ways that reflect those needs. There is no other option. In the case of my hon. Friend's area, there are some problems in how that has been done, particularly for disadvantaged children. When we see such problems, we must recognise them and work with the local authority, but we cannot operate in a way that would require my Department to orchestrate the development of services from the centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/6">I should like to take up another point. My hon. Friend said something like &quot;It's not fair to muddle money together,&quot; referring to the different funding streams for extended school start-ups, the sustainability of extended schools and personalisation, among other things. We depend on schools and local authorities to use the different funding streams that come from central Government flexibly and in ways that add value one to another to achieve the best for children. That is not muddling those funding streams. We expect local authorities to use the extended school resources to put those things into particular schools. Alongside that, the money that they get for personalisation should be used to identify individual children for whom those different tranches of money can be brought together to assist those children and give them the most opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/7">Personalisation is not separate from the opportunities that will come through a school that offers a wide range of extra-curricular activities. Personalisation for a particular child might involve having access to a wide range of creative activities, such as sport and drama, or having extra study support. That will come through the provision from the extended school, but it might be paid for at least in part by the personalisation money that is attached to that child precisely because they are a child from a disadvantaged background. I know that that is a difficult task for some schools and that some are doing it better than others at the moment, and we want to support them all to do it well, but it is right to tell schools and local authorities that they must have the flexibility to use that money creatively for individual children. By giving them that flexibility, if they use it properly, we can maximise the impact of those opportunities on individual children.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/8">My hon. Friend asked about her local situation, particularly about sports fields. I know that some schools in Westminster do not have their own sports facilities, but that is a matter for the local authority. I agree with her in spirit that local authorities should make their leisure facilities available, free of charge, to schools that do not have such facilities. I am not dictating that to Westminster, but other local authorities have adopted that approach. Indeed, other local authorities have added their resources to Government resources to develop extended schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/9">On the allocation of extended schools money, my hon. Friend compared two particular schools. If they are the same schools that she recently mentioned to me informally, I can tell her that I have looked into that in some detail and that we will talk to Westminster about some of those issues. Westminster has a method of allocating resources that is based 50 per cent. on school numbers and 50 per cent. on a definition of need, which is different for primary and secondary schools. The school in a middle-class area that she mentioned has significantly more pupils than the school in the deprived area, so the 50 per cent. that relates to school numbers will bump up its allocation of extended school start-up money. However, the formula for the need element is hard to understand, and it is worth my hon. Friend going to speak to the new director of children's services there, because it is hard not to disagree that it looks strange that a school with only 14 per cent. of children on free school meals&mdash;not 8 per cent., as she said&mdash;should receive more than a school with 32 per cent. of children on free school meals, albeit a slightly smaller school.</p>

	<p pid="a.324.1/1">My hon. Friend is right: we have had this problem before. The information that I have been provided with says that one school has 14 per cent. of children on free school meals and the other has 32 per cent. The first school has 772 pupils, compared with 593 in the other school. It is legitimate to ask why a school in a fairly affluent area, albeit slightly bigger, which has much lower needs in terms of social deprivation should end up with a higher allocation of extended school start-up, given that we rightly expect schools to have a charging policy where that is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/2">However, the allocation of money in any local authority has to be agreed by the schools forum, as it has in this case. On child tax credit, there are several opportunities for Westminster to&mdash;</p>
