<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-18a.3.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="3"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081118/halltext/81118h0001.htm#08111869000423">
	<p pid="a.3.3/1">My hon. Friend often plays the straight man to me, and he has again fed me the perfect line to take me on to raising awareness and prevention. I agree with the points that he made, and I will reinforce them in my next couple of paragraphs.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/2">More than 40 per cent. of all strokes could be prevented if people kept their blood pressure under control, monitored cholesterol levels, ate healthily, stopped smoking, and took regular exercise. I am not yet on to awareness; I am talking about prevention. The Government have introduced a programme of vascular checks for 40 to 74-year-olds, which I would like to know a little more about. Will the Minister tell me when I, as a 55-year-old, and perhaps others here can expect to receive our personal invitation for a check under that important step forward? Is it possible to use similar techniques to identify and target those with a family history of or a propensity for strokes and give information on how to avoid them, and what they and their families should do at the outset? The first moments when someone detects that a person does not quite look how they did yesterday are crucial. What can we do to get information to the people in families with a propensity for stroke to enable them to see that action needs to be taken really early and quickly? Will the Minister consider the techniques of direct mail and the use of data tracking to ensure that we get to those people much earlier?</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/3">Both public and professional awareness of risk factors and symptoms of stroke are frighteningly low. The face, arms and speech test&mdash;FAST&mdash;relates to some of the key signs to act on early. Someone may notice that a person is not speaking as accurately as they did before, that they have trouble raising an arm or have a slight drooping or tingling of the face. The symptoms of stroke are often not as dramatic as those of a heart attack, in which people may clutch their chest and fall to the ground in agony. However, the symptoms of stroke are of equal importance. If we can act early, we will save thousands of lives and prevent years of unnecessary disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/4">It is worrying that people do not know&mdash;I admit my own ignorance on this&mdash;that when a person has a stroke, they should dial 999 in the same way as when someone has a heart attack. That means that a person suffering a stroke can be treated quickly. I have one small quibble with the fantastic people&mdash;those in the voluntary sector and the professionals, who do an incredible job&mdash;who have provided some of the information for me on this subject. When we are trying to raise awareness, can we please not use acronyms and medical jargon? We should talk in a way that ordinary people understand, so that they can obtain treatment and help themselves and their families. When we talk about TIAs, coronary heart disease, aphasia, vascular, FASTs and so on, it is little wonder that people are confused. If we keep things simple, we will raise awareness throughout the UK in the same way as awareness has been raised of some of the key symptoms of heart attack.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/5">The issue of professional awareness also needs to be examined. Some 20 per cent. of GPs admit to not referring one in five cases of mild and major strokes to hospital immediately. It is honest of them to say that, but we need to ensure that they are aware of the issue so that they can rectify the situation and save lives. Last year, the Stroke Association invested &pound;500,000 in a press and radio advertising campaign to raise awareness of the fact that</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/6" class="indent">&quot;stroke is a brain attack&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/7">To implement the kind of sustained wide-ranging campaign that we need to make permanent improvements, the Government must play a role and take the lead, alongside the great work being done by the Stroke Association. I hope that when the Government do that, they will also consider the impact that raising awareness will have because there will obviously be an increased demand on services. I also hope that the Government will consider the impact on stakeholders, including those who offer advice and support to the public, as they may well have a steep increase in requests for their services.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/8">I am pleased to say that my city is apparently doing well in relation to strokes. We are already responding to the national strategy and the Nottingham city primary care trust and NHS Nottinghamshire are holding a week-long campaign this week that will encourage people to become more aware of the symptoms of strokes and to change their lifestyle. Nottingham PCT has commissioned community services, such as the new leaf stop smoking scheme, health trainers, exercise referral schemes and food and cooking schemes to support people at risk in the community and encourage them to be more active and eat more healthily. Lack of exercise and an unhealthy diet are important risk factors for stroke.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/9">A locally enhanced service, which is basically the incentivisation of GPs, has been commissioned with all GP practices to identify and manage patients who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease. I am happy to say that it includes a partnership scheme with the pharmaceutical industry in Nottingham called &quot;happy hearts&quot;. That scheme is doing well. The &quot;change makers&quot; project also works with local community volunteers to improve awareness of stroke symptoms and risk factors. So, as a result of Government action and colleagues from all parties repeatedly raising the matter&mdash;including a debate that took place around 18 months ago on the Floor of the House&mdash;we have progressed from a big national strategy to real projects on the ground. What further plans are there to improve public and professional awareness of stroke symptoms and what people should do at the onset of a stroke? Equally important, what plans are there to make those campaigns sustainable? One-offs are really welcome, but it is also important to have a sustained campaign to change our view and the culture surrounding the treatment of stroke.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/10">I now come to the point already made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> about the need for rapid assessment and treatment. Time is of the essence when treating stroke. According to the Secretary of State, there is a window of only three hours in which stroke patients must be seen, scanned and treated. For each one-minute delay, 2 million neurons are lost from the brain, yet people who know this subject far better than me say that awareness of stroke is at the level of awareness of heart disease that existed 10 years ago. We still have a lot more to do, but that does not mean we need bags more money&mdash;of course, resources are always welcome&mdash;but the Royal College of Physicians has clearly stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/11" class="indent">&quot;we do not necessarily need more resourses just better organisation of what we have already&quot;.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-18a.5.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="5"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081118/halltext/81118h0001.htm#08111869000425">
	<p pid="a.5.1/1">My hon. Friend has put it more eloquently than I can. I am not going to say that everyone will be as right as rain, but if we get to people early and give them the right treatment, they can go on to lead a full and productive life. In essence, during a stroke parts of the brain lose oxygen, which is the source of life for the brain. The longer the brain is left to suffocate, the greater the damage that will take place and the greater chance there is of irreparable damage. Early intervention is really important. My hon. Friend has clearly described the stark contrast between what happens if a stroke is dealt with quickly and what happens if it is not dealt with quite so expeditiously.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/2">Nigel Mason of GE Healthcare goes further than the Royal College of Physicians and says</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/3" class="indent">&quot;reconfiguring staff and procedures for a daily two-hour immediate access clinic would save lives and generate &pound;42 million savings as well&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/4">We all care about the individuals concerned, but even if we consider the matter purely in terms of a sensible way to manage resources, we can save immense amounts of money by getting it right. There are many other examples of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/5">Stroke patients are around 25 per cent. more likely to survive, they make a better recovery and they spend six days less in hospital if they are admitted to a stroke unit, rapidly assessed and receive specialist care from a multi-disciplinary team. The national stroke strategy sets a clear standard to ensure that effective urgent care is in place, including transfer to an acute stroke centre that provides scans and thrombolysis&mdash;I hope I have got the pronunciation correct&mdash;where appropriate. The medical profession will shriek at this, but, for ordinary mortals, thrombolysis is basically souped-up aspirin. The national stroke strategy also refers to prompt admission to a specialist stroke unit. All those things in a line mean that we have done a great deal to reduce the number of deaths and disabilities arising from strokes. In addition, oe of the hopes in the strategy is for more specialist stroke nurses to be available. We are only a year into the strategy, but perhaps the Minister will give an indication of when he hopes to have complete coverage, and when every hospital will have a stroke nurse.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/6">With regard to thrombolysis, which is probably better known to people in the business as clot-buster drugs, the Secretary of State said last year:</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Right now, less than 1 per cent. of people who have a stroke are receiving thrombolysis. If we can get that number up to 10 per cent., 1,000 people a year would regain their independence, rather than die or be disabled for life. By following the guidelines set out in this strategy, 1,600 potential strokes can be averted through preventive work and a further 6,800 deaths and disabilities can be avoided.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/8">What a prize for something so simple and inexpensive; 6,800 deaths and disabilities could be avoided. Clot-busting, thrombolytic drugs can be the difference between someone leaving hospital on foot and beginning a lifetime in a wheelchair. In Ontario, 37 per cent. of patients get clot busters. Will the Minister bring us up to date on the level of use of clot-busting drugs in this country? The Secretary of State said more than a year ago that it was less than 1 per cent., but I am sure that that figure has improved. Perhaps the Minister will tell us how well we are doing and what the curve is. I do not expect the figure to leap to 37 per cent., but we would like to know what the curve is to ensure that people receive those very simple drugs at the moment when they need them most.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-18a.7.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="7"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081118/halltext/81118h0002.htm#08111869000429">
	<p pid="a.7.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. Yes, I will come on to those issues, and no doubt the Minister will respond on the patchy nature of provision. We need to look for the trend lines. Is something improving, and is it improving everywhere? Is there convergence in levels of provision? It would be unfair to say in a year, &quot;Has this problem been solved?&quot; Of course it will not be, but colleagues on both sides of the House will hope to see the trend lines going in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/2">Why do we do scans? I understand that the main reason is to exclude the other cause of strokes, which is a bleed in the brain. Clearly, we do not want to administer clot-busting drugs if the cause is a bleed, and a scan will immediately eliminate that possibility. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in July 2008, just a few months ago, that a brain scan should take place within one hour of someone being admitted to hospital. The strategy emphasises the need to improve access to scans and stipulates that brain imaging should be performed in the next scan slot, or within 60 minutes of a request out-of-hours. In 2006, only one in 10 people were scanned within three hours. We need a tight target to make scans available 24/7. Any unit unable to deliver scans by a particular time should not be called a specialised stroke unit. I hope that the Minister will consider that. In Sweden, 100 per cent. of those who need a scan get one, and we should aspire to that in this country. Will the Minister tell us the percentage of scans in the UK and in my own city of Nottingham, and by what date we aspire to reach 100 per cent.?</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-18a.7.2" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-18b.7.2" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-18a.7.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="7"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081118/halltext/81118h0002.htm#08111869000431">
	<p pid="a.7.2/1">The only difficulty with the hon. Gentleman sitting immediately behind me is that clearly he is looking over my shoulder at what my next paragraph is about. He makes a very pertinent point, which runs on from the one about scans. We need to get people in the right place to have the scan. All local stroke networks should ensure that patients who could benefit from urgent care are transferred to an acute stroke centre that provides 24-hour access to scans and other specialist stroke care.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/2">In Nottingham, ambulance staff all use FAST&mdash;the face, arm, speech test&mdash;to identify emergency stroke patients. The Secretary of State said last year:</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/3" class="indent">&quot;We are consulting about upgrading strokes from category B to category A events so that ambulances arrive within nine, rather than 18 minutes.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-07-11.1484"><i>Official Report</i>, 11 July 2007; Vol. 462, c. 1484</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/4">For the Department to consult on a nine-minute difference shows how important the Secretary of State and the Department consider the matter. Will the Minister tell us whether that review&mdash;that consultation&mdash;on changing the category from B to A has been completed and what the outcome is? Those minutes really can be the difference between life and death for many hundreds of people.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/5">While I am talking about the way in which things are done in Nottingham, I will, if I am permitted, make a small boast. Nottingham university hospitals stroke services have been shortlisted for the forthcoming <i>Health Service Journal</i> awards in the &quot;improving access&quot; category for their work on TIA and hyper-acute services. There are four stroke units in Nottingham&mdash;one acute stroke unit and three rehabilitation units&mdash;and a system of virtual beds means that a bed is highly likely to be free for those patients who are FAST-positive. The stroke services are centralised in a 72-bed unit on the City hospital campus. There is direct access to the stroke unit through agreed protocols with the ambulance service. In other words, ambulance staff can drive by other medical facilities to go to the right place. That is not only permitted but encouraged. Thrombolysis&mdash;I keep getting my tongue twisted round that one&mdash;is available Monday to Friday from nine to five. That is excellent, but we need to be greedy. We need to say that it has to be available 24/7. Strokes happen at the most inconvenient time and they also happen at weekends. We have a daily one-stop clinic for high-risk minor strokes and acute care and rehabilitation were located in one unit in response to patient feedback.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/6">I now come to a number of points raised by colleagues. The third part of my argument is about the provision of after-stroke rehabilitation care, which my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire mentioned. As I discovered in a debate on incontinence last year in Westminster Hall&mdash;I think that you may have been present, Mr. Williams&mdash;when it comes to NHS matters, treatments and state of the art technologies are not the problem. The problem is that in soft skills and empathetic aftercare, medical culture requires serious transformation. That is the hardest thing to do, but it is at least as important as the medication, surgery and all those other things that we are so good at.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/7">According to the Healthcare Commission, one year after leaving hospital, 80 per cent. of stroke patients think that they are not receiving adequate care. There is no magic wand and no one expects the Minister to pop up and suddenly deliver an answer to the problem. It needs lots of hard work, grinding organisation, staff training, supervision&mdash;all those things that are criticised under the general heading of bureaucracy. To make the health service work for an individual patient who has suffered something life changing, whether incontinence, a stroke or something else, we need the human interaction that, in many cases, makes life worth living. That must be examined and worked on over and over again.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/8">Seven of the 20 new national stroke strategy quality markers are directly linked to the support and community services needed by those who have suffered a stroke and their carers. They include high-quality rehabilitation, information, advice and the practical and peer support that colleagues have mentioned. Such support should be provided throughout the care pathway and in line with individual need. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. For my next question, will the Minister tell us how we secure effective discharge planning that is built around the needs of the individual?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-18a.9.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="9"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081118/halltext/81118h0002.htm#08111869000433">
	<p pid="a.9.1/1">I know from reading up for this debate and from past debates, how committed my hon. Friend is to this topic, and the effort that he has put into it over many years. I agree with him, and I will come on to say a few words about stroke clubs and the difference between them and communication support groups, which are also very important.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/2">As part of the stroke improvement programme, there is a central national team&mdash;I am pleased to say that it is based in the east midlands&mdash;which supports the development of the 29 local stroke care networks I mentioned. In Nottingham, a well-established partnership works across the local health and social care community through the stroke services strategy group with representation from the Stroke Association and an excellent relationship with @astroke, the local patients forum. There are also strong local research links with the university. Professor Marion Walker and Ossie Newell, a stroke survivor, were winners of a local media &quot;reach out&quot; award for their work in developing research and rehabilitation programmes for people who have had strokes.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/3">My next question is about rehabilitation. NICE recommended 45 minutes of rehabilitation a day. Does the Minister know when that target is likely to be met? What steps are we taking towards it? As part of the national stroke strategy, the Department of Health published a local authority circular last May entitled, &quot;Demonstrating how to deliver care for adults in the community.&quot; It stated that councils with adult social services responsibilities in England receive funding to deliver long-term stroke care for adults in the community, and it encouraged more joint working between health and social care providers. That is important to enable stroke survivors to receive a seamless transfer of care from the hospital to the community, and to ensure that they receive the support they need for as long as necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/4">Does the Minister know specifically whether information about how that grant is spent by local authorities will be made public, so that we can see the implementation of the stroke strategy as it unrolls and overall monitoring can take place? The money is apparently ring-fenced, and we must ensure that it stays that way. The funding, however small, must be sustainable&mdash;I do not know how many debates in Westminster Hall I have been attended where I have said that. Quick bursts of activity for one year or for three, are often worse than useless. I would prefer to have smaller amounts of money sustained over a longer period, so that people know where that central core of money is and can build around it.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/5">Colleagues from all parties have mentioned community services. A particularly pleasing part of the new strategy are the references to the value of communication support groups for stroke survivors. The Stroke Association has pioneered work in that area with its &quot;Lost without words&quot; campaign. Communication difficulties include aphasia and speech impacts, which affect approximately one third of stroke survivors. Without support, survivors can experience problems including depression, isolation and an inability to return to work. Currently there are no communication support services in the Nottingham area. The group Aphasia Nottingham aims to help, but it is entirely voluntary and receives no statutory funding. However, there is a real need for that service in Nottingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/6">At present only 12 per cent. of stroke survivors in England have access to communication support groups organised by the Stroke Association. That figure is even lower in my area, which I share with my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire. Historically, there have been challenges to the discharge of stroke survivors back into the community, thereby creating &quot;bed blocking.&quot; Nationally, a community stroke team is in place, and from January next year, there will be a system of early supported discharge, which should help to address that problem. Nottingham primary care trust is currently recruiting a team for that system.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/7">Community care for stroke survivors is fragmented. The level of care that someone receives seems to depend on the area in which they live. In Nottingham, adult social services care for stroke survivors, and a 12-week programme called Stroke Ability is heavily exercise-based and has elements of prevention and awareness work. As my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire said, there are a number of stroke clubs in the area. From next year, a further family and carer support service in the south of the county will be funded by new local authority funding to help people with the transition from hospital to home. It is imperative that the Government encourage local authorities and PCTs to take account of the communication support needs of stroke survivors in their communities, and ensure that they keep that money ring-fenced for stroke-specific services.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/8">Finally, the national sentinel audit of stroke care by the Royal College of Physicians has proved an extremely useful tool for monitoring the implementation of standards and service improvements in the acute sector. However, there has not been a similar focus on monitoring community services. The Healthcare Commission's patient survey 12 months after discharge from hospital was published in 2006, and gave an excellent snapshot of the standard of care and support for stroke survivors in the community. For my 13th question&mdash;there is just one more before I sit down&mdash;may I ask the Minister whether further surveys along those lines or an extension of the Royal College of Physicians auditing process into community care will be undertaken?</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/9">My final and briefest question is about the development of the work force to meet the markers that the Secretary of State mentioned when announcing the strategy. In Nottingham, we have a stroke training programme for all staff working for the stroke service, and we have one of the 10 Government-funded medical stroke specialist training posts. However, although the funding is welcome, again it is non-recurrent. We need specialist staff with stroke knowledge and skills, and Department of Health training for an agreed competency framework. When will that framework be ready and how will it be managed? Will units receive accreditation for providing different levels of specialist care? How much sustainable support are the Government providing to all levels of stroke care staffing?</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/10">I hope that I have been generous in accepting interventions to allow a large number of colleagues to contribute, and I apologise for taking up a lot of time. I believe that the Government are to be congratulated heartily on putting in place an excellent, although long overdue, stroke strategy. People who care about this subject, from all parties, inside and outside this House, campaigned for it for a long time. We must now put stroke awareness high on the agenda and ensure timely and urgent treatment to improve the quality of life of people suffering the after-effects of a stroke. I hope that this debate gives the Minister an opportunity to tell us what progress has been made since the national strategy was announced and what milestones he hopes can be achieved over the next year. The key message that I have received in putting together this debate is that it is not so much about money, but about organisation. As with so much public policy, if we choose to intervene early, the impacts will be cheaper, more effective and, in this instance, will save many lost and broken lives. I thank you, Mr. Williams, for allowing me to make my case at some length.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-18a.13.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" speakername="Mark Williams" colnum="13"  time="010:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081118/halltext/81118h0003.htm#08111869000437">
	<p pid="a.13.0/1">It is a particular pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Williams. We are indebted to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> for raising this very important debate. However, I am sure that he will understand when I say that tributes should be directed to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" name="Andrew Turner">the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> for his contribution. The test of time will show that he has been an inspiration to many thousands of people who have had the same experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/2">I represent a Welsh constituency, so the responsibility for Government policy that affects my constituents is a matter for the Welsh National Assembly, and I am reminded by the Chair not to stray into devolved matters. Like the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, I want to spend a few minutes talking about the invaluable work of the voluntary sector and, in particular, of two or three organisations with which I have had the privilege of working over the past couple of years.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/3">The hon. Gentleman said that we cannot build rehabilitation services without the voluntary sector. We have heard a lot about the Government's laudable 10-year strategy and the contribution that social services departments make, but we must also acknowledge the work of the voluntary sector; without it, the lives of many thousands of people would be considerably worse. It has risen to meet the challenges mentioned earlier. For example, strokes are the third most common form of death in the United Kingdom, accounting for 9 per cent. of the deaths of men and 13 per cent. of women. The Aberystwyth and district stroke club in my constituency has 60 members, 40 of whom have had strokes. Many carers attend the meetings. We have not heard a huge amount about the carers and the unique advice and support that should be directed toward them.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/4">The Aberystwyth and district stroke club was borne out of frustration with the lack of provision, yet, in its 20-year history, it has never received any public funding. A similar such point was alluded to by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>. The club has been reliant on the generosity of businesses and local residents to keep it going. It offers important confidence-building services, weekend breaks and help for people who may not have the chance or the resources to get away. It runs a bus, which is funded by the lottery's &quot;awards for all&quot; scheme, that costs between &pound;4,000 and &pound;5,000 a year. However, more importantly, it enables stroke victims to meet other people in the same position as themselves&mdash;people who are some way along the path to rehabilitation, and who can offer the wisdom of their experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/5">A central focus of the debate so far has been the need for immediate care and diagnosis. Everybody in this Chamber will agree with that goal, which has been raised by the Aberystwyth and district stroke club. Many of its members have had to wait 24 or 48 hours for a scan.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/6">Like many others here, I represent a rural constituency. If we put into that context the misfortune of suffering a stroke and mix it with living in some of the most isolated and scattered communities in the country, it is a frightening experience. Ambulance times are already challenging. I ask the Minister to comment on the role of telemedicine throughout the country. The service has been pioneered in my constituency in Bronglais hospital, in Aberystwyth, and plays an invaluable role in assisting early diagnosis. It brings the expertise that may be available elsewhere into more scattered communities&mdash;a point made by Professor Boyle in his analysis.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/7">We were disturbed to hear the story from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1770" name="Paul Truswell">the hon. Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell)</phrase> about the couple in his constituency. We need to remind ourselves that recovery from stroke can be an incredibly long-term process; 25 per cent. of all long-term beds in hospital are occupied by stroke patients. We need to ensure that support is available in hospital and that the voluntary mechanisms are in place to enable people to have the moral support and encouragement to make the long journey to full health.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/8">I applaud the Government for their announcement about the ring-fenced money, but I echo the views of the hon. Member for Nottingham, North about the need for us to monitor where that money is going and to ensure that our social services are delivering the services that we and the Government expect of them. For those who are able to live at home after suffering a stroke, the support provided by the voluntary sector is invaluable. I know that we are only a year into the strategy, but will the Minister tell us whether an early appraisal has been made of the adequacy of the ring-fenced funds?</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/9">Some voluntary groups have raised real concerns about the grants and funding made available to them. Positive Action for Stroke, which is based in my constituency, has had real difficulty obtaining funding. The Progressive Action Group in Aberystwyth faces similar concerns. I hope that the Minister will reflect on the importance of voluntary organisations in helping those who have had strokes, even if he cannot get into the nitty-gritty of the funding. Some public bodies have been reluctant to fund voluntary groups when lottery funding has not been available, and it has been a great challenge to find alternative sources of funds. If the Minister pointed the voluntary groups in the direction of funding, that would be very welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/10">I want to emphasise the importance of the services that voluntary groups offer. Progressive Action arranges what it calls &quot;fun activities&quot;, such as computing and arts and crafts. However, such activities also help stroke victims to return to the employment market. We have heard about the depression faced by many stroke victims. Again, in a rural constituency, that should be seen in the context of rural isolation, the feeling that one is not getting the services to which one is perhaps entitled, compounded by the health condition that has to be endured.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/11">The ability to have organised breaks and activities allows people to be much more active than they might otherwise be. We are all aware that activity and dialogue, which the hon. Member for Isle of Wight mentioned, are integral to recovery. Such activity also ensures that victims can redevelop motor skills. The care is delivered as part of a care package, but once that time in hospital has ended, the recovery process can go on for many months and years. Having help and support outside the hospital environment is extremely valuable in aiding recovery. It is also very beneficial for people to be able to make new friends, and to meet those who have had similar experiences and been through the same process.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/12">The hon. Member for Nottingham, North put his case very concisely. I, too, believe that part of the emphasis should be on the importance of raising awareness to prevent strokes. However, as the hon. Member for Isle of Wight said&mdash;my contribution is humble compared to his&mdash;it is important to recognise the work done by the voluntary sector in providing assistance to those affected by strokes.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/13">I want to finish by praising the work of our health professionals. We have talked about developing skills and expertise in our hospitals. We have all had our family experiences in these matters; mine involved a dear aunt. I remember the fateful phone conversation when her husband told me that she had suffered a stroke and had lost the power of speech. She was a chatty, enthusiastic and vibrant individual who did a huge amount for her community: then&mdash;stop. Two years on, she has recovered her power of speech and is as active a member of the community as she used to be. That is no small tribute to her abilities and enthusiasm, but also to the health professionals who have helped her so much, and to the voluntary sector.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-18a.16.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" speakername="Greg Mulholland" colnum="16"  time="010:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081118/halltext/81118h0003.htm#08111869000440">
	<p pid="a.16.0/1">That was my mistake. I thank the hon. Gentleman for that correction.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/2">I want to echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion, and I pay tribute, too, to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" name="Andrew Turner">the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase>. It was incredibly humbling to hear of his personal experience, as well as enormously informative for us all. I think we all want to thank him for sharing it, and for his contribution to the debate. I reiterate what has been said about his being an inspiration to many people who have suffered strokes, in showing what people can do and how they can come back from a stroke. The way in which he has served his constituents is a tribute to him. The hon. Gentleman also made an interesting point when he mentioned the wisdom of thinking before we speak. Many hon. Members could remember that&mdash;and I certainly do not exempt myself from that group.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/3">I had a vivid reminder about strokes a few weeks ago, when the mother of one of my best friends unfortunately suffered a severe stroke. She was in the highlands of Scotland and it was only thanks to the response of the air ambulance, and the wonderful medical care that I am delighted to say she received, that she is still with us. She is now recovering. It is a slow recovery but she is making good progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/4">As we have heard, the effects of stroke can vary enormously. Stroke is the third biggest cause of death in the UK&mdash;there are about 50,000 such deaths every year&mdash;and the largest single cause of disability. Each year, 110,000 people in England alone suffer a stroke. Stroke affects more women than breast cancer. It is estimated that the overall costs of treatment for strokes and related and subsequent disabilities is a staggering &pound;2.8 billion a year. As we have heard in eloquent speeches from the hon. Member for Nottingham, North and other hon. Members, the debate is important because we must ensure that care of the best quality, including consistent access to treatment, is available for those who suffer strokes, but also because of the need for prevention. That is why the Liberal Democrats warmly welcome the national stroke strategy, which was published in December. The chief executive of the Stroke Association, Jon Barrick, described it as</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/5" class="indent">&quot;a momentous opportunity to transform the outcomes and lives of stroke survivors.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/6">What the debate is about&mdash;as I am sure we would all agree and the Minister would acknowledge&mdash;is checking that we are taking that momentous opportunity, and seeing whether people are receiving better care than they were 10 months ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/7">The initial signs are that some progress is being made. Even before the strategy was announced, 97 per cent. of hospitals had a stroke unit, and more than 90 per cent. of stroke units providing acute care had access to brain imaging within 24 hours of admission. That is a big increase&mdash;82 per cent.&mdash;since 2004, and is to be commended. However, there are certain points that we need to examine, and the audit this year by the Royal College of Physicians found that only 45 per cent. of hospitals could meet the recommendation made in the strategy that high-risk patients who had a transient ischemic attack or mini-stroke&mdash;and I share the wish of the hon. Member for Nottingham, North to use ordinary phrases that mean something to people&mdash;should be examined and treated within 48 hours. Given that the Stroke Association has pointed out that meeting that one target could result in an 80 per cent. reduction in the number of people going on to have a full stroke, the standard is one that needs real focus both now and as the strategy progresses.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/8">A requirement has been placed on primary care trusts to set out their plans for improving stroke services for 2008-09. The House should welcome that, and monitor it. However, the Stroke Association has voiced concern that an absence of national targets and time scales for those targets in the strategy may affect progress. It is important to say that some strategic health authorities have gone further than the strategy specifies, and have included a timetable for the implementation of selected recommendations, but serious consideration should be given to setting a timetable across the board for implementation of the targets, so that we can achieve the speed of change that we need, and be confident that people are getting consistent access to services in all areas. Good progress has been made, which is enormously encouraging, and we all welcome that. I want to ask the Minister whether we can examine progress annually. Today's debate is useful, but we should continue to monitor what happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/9">Most of the debate today has rightly focused on issues such as prevention and acute hospital treatment and care, but the speech of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight in particular dealt with the huge importance of long-term care and community support following a stroke. The importance of effective long-term care and the need for stroke sufferers to be active participants in their treatment has been well documented. According to the Stroke Association, only about half the individuals who have experienced a stroke receive the rehabilitation that they need in the first six months following their discharge from hospital. In the next six months only one in five receive the help, support and treatment they are deemed to need. That is something on which the strategy should focus, and I hope that the Minister will agree.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/10">One of the most important issues in the debate is embodied in one of the figures that has been quoted: 40 per cent. of strokes can be prevented. The importance of awareness of strokes cannot be overestimated. One concern is that polling by the Stroke Association found that one in five GPs do not refer about 20 per cent. of cases of mini-stroke. Just over half of GPs said that they would refer someone with a suspected stroke immediately. A concentrated effort must be made to ensure that strokes are regarded as nothing short of a medical emergency, in which time is of the essence, and that all treatment is recommended with that in mind. I am aware that NICE and the Royal College of Physicians recently published guidelines, and I hope that there will be a concerted effort across the board.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/11">I pay tribute to the Government for the &pound;12 million that is to be invested in the next few years in awareness activity. That is a common-sense thing to do, considering the enormous cost of &pound;2.8 billion that I have already mentioned. I should like an assurance from the Minister that any public awareness campaign will take account of the needs of some ethnic minority groups that are at greater risk of strokes, and of the possibility that it may be more difficult to reach those groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/12">Finally, there is a need for more research. The Stroke Association funds &pound;2.5 million of research, and we must always look for ways to improve what is done. To conclude, this has been an excellent debate. It could not have been more timely and I do not think that it could have been more informative or constructive for all of us. I simply urge the Minister to allow us all to continue to contribute to monitoring the progress of this very important and very welcome strategy, and I look forward to hearing his response to the debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-18a.18.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" speakername="Mark Simmonds" colnum="18"  time="010:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081118/halltext/81118h0003.htm#08111869000441">
	<p pid="a.18.0/1">I am pleased, Mr. Williams, to see you in the Chair.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/2">I want to reiterate the comments of other hon. Members in congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I also want to congratulate him on the very comprehensive and detailed way in which he introduced this significant topic. He set out very clearly the importance of ensuring that the Government maintain the momentum that has been generated recently, first by the National Audit Office report, then by the Public Accounts Committee report and finally by the stroke strategy, which was released roughly a year ago. I thought that he made his points in a very constructive and thoughtful manner, and hopefully the Minister will respond in a similar vein.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/3">The hon. Gentleman was right to congratulate the Stroke Association, which does fantastic work in this area. I will not repeat them, but he was also right to highlight the four key markers that the Government set down. He was also correct to summarise the four distinct areas&mdash;the patient pathway&mdash;of awareness, diagnosis, treatment and subsequently community care and rehabilitation. If all those areas are addressed, that will make a significant difference to patient outcomes. The Minister will probably not have time to answer in detail all of the 14 questions that the hon. Gentleman put to him today, but I am sure that he will respond in writing to the hon. Members who are here with answers to all of those excellent questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/4">I also must say to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" name="Andrew Turner">the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> that his contribution today was exceptional and inspirational, and I am delighted to see that he has clearly made a full recovery and is back on full form, both in articulation and humour, which is very good to see. He was absolutely correct to highlight the important contribution of the charitable and voluntary organisations, particularly in rehabilitation and community support. He was also right to ask all of us, irrespective of our party political persuasions, to thank and congratulate the people involved in those organisations. As an additional question, it would be helpful if the Minister would address the point made both by my hon. Friend and by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> about the potential to fund or assist charitable and voluntary organisations in the community and rehabilitation aspects of their work.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/5">We heard, too, from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" name="Mark Williams">the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)</phrase>, who raised the important issue of the contributions of the voluntary and charitable sector. Furthermore, he stressed the overriding importance of people who have experienced strokes meeting others who have gone through a similar experience, if only to ensure that those people understand that they are not alone and that they are not unique in their experience of stroke. The hon. Gentleman was right to highlight the problems that are exacerbated in large rural constituencies. I, too, represent a rural constituency&mdash;the Lincolnshire constituency of Boston and Skegness&mdash;and I suspect that we have problems that are similar to those that he faces in north Wales. I sometimes think that the Government do not necessarily address the needs of those who represent physically great but sparsely populated rural areas and provide the requisite funding, although that is not the specific issue that we are debating today. The hon. Gentleman was also right to praise health professionals who are involved in stroke care.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/6">Of course, there is cross-party support for the enhancement of stroke services, particularly those that improve patient outcomes and survival rates, although it must also be said that, despite the stroke strategy, we still have fairly low survival rates in the UK in comparison with some other EU countries. Nevertheless, we recognise and welcome the progress that has been made since the publication of the stroke strategy, particularly in the development of stroke networks. However, it was a shame that it took the Government so long to produce that strategy, and I suspect that they did so only in response to the highly critical reports from the NAO and the Public Accounts Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/7">Despite all the evidence that care in a specialist stroke unit increases a patient's chance of survival and recovery by 25 per cent. and reduces their stay in hospital by six days, in 2006 just 15 per cent. of stroke patients were admitted to stroke units on the day of admission. I accept and acknowledge that that is a slightly historic statistic. However, it would be helpful if the Minister could update it, either today or subsequently, particularly in the context of the overriding importance that is now correctly attributed to stroke and stroke care, both in the operating framework, which identifies stroke as a national priority, and in the primary care trusts' operational requirements, which was a point quite rightly made by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/8">There are some background statistics that I briefly want to put on the record, because some of them are worrying. The national audit by the Royal College of Physicians this year showed that only 45 per cent. of hospitals were able to meet the target in the stroke strategy of investigating and treating high-risk patients with transient ischemic attack, or TIA, within 24 hours, and yet that is clearly one of the key methods of identifying patients at risk of stroke and preventing patients from going on to have a full stroke.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/9">Fast access to stroke units and fast treatment is a key to a patient's survival, whether that treatment is the CT scans that were mentioned earlier or the three-hour time limit for thrombolysis. These two methods of treatment must be linked, as the hon. Member for Nottingham, North pointed out, so that the thrombolysis is not administered to patients who would not benefit from it or to patients to whose health it would be detrimental. One statistic that has already been given is from Sweden, and it is absolutely startling compared with our own performance here in the UK; in Sweden, 100 per cent. of stroke patients have access to a CT scan within 24 hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/10">A quarter of British hospitals have no specialist stroke nurse and only 22 per cent. of hospitals have an early supported discharge team. Specialist teams working in a multidisciplinary framework are best placed to improve outcomes and reduce mortality. Last year, I visited the North Tyneside general hospital near Newcastle, which has a fantastic specialist stroke team. That team not only works in the hospital but goes into the community, with outreach workers and specialist nurses. I very much hope that that the Minister will ensure that that model is rolled out across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/11">One of the disparities that seems to exist between statements made by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North and the previous Government announcements relates to the population screening that the Prime Minister announced in January. It was clear from the Prime Minister's announcement that the screening would be whole-population screening with cardiovascular checks, which would also include looking for tell-tale signs of a stroke. It would be interesting if the Minister could say, first, whether or not the funding has been provided to support that whole-population screening and also whether or not the clinical evidence supports that type of screening, or is the hon. Member for Nottingham, North correct that screening should be limited to those between the ages of 40 and 74?</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/12">We also support the &quot;hub and spoke&quot; strategy for specialist stroke centres. Clearly, there is a direct correlation between specialist stroke centres and better patient outcomes and survival rates; in those centres, patients are scanned and given thrombolysis if appropriate and necessary. However, that does not necessarily mean that there should be closures of small stroke wards in local hospitals. Indeed, Manchester is perhaps the best example of a good system; in the local service plan for Manchester, a hyper-acute unit has been proposed, where all stroke patients would be taken for the initial scan and treatment, before they are referred back to their district general hospitals for treatment to be continued and for subsequent treatment in the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/13">In the remaining few minutes, I have just a couple of additional questions for the Minister. Again, if he does not have time today&mdash;I clearly understand that this is the debate of the hon. Member for Nottingham, North&mdash;it would be helpful if he could write to me. For example, how much of the funding pledged for the stroke strategy has been delivered? How many of the stroke centres to date have achieved all 20 quality markers for a good stroke strategy? I assume that not all of them have achieved that target and, if so, what is the time scale for enabling all stroke centres to achieve it? Would the Minister also say a little about the awareness campaign that will begin next year? Has thought been given to the fact that it may stimulate additional demand, and does the NHS have the facilities and sufficient capacity to deal with such additional demand? Furthermore, what are the Government doing to support the communication needs of people who have suffered a stroke? That point was quite rightly made by other hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/14">I also want to reiterate two key points made by other hon. Members; again, if the Minister does not have time to address them today, he and his team at least need to think about them. The first point is about awareness, including public awareness of stroke. A recent NOP poll demonstrated that there is both confusion and ignorance about the signs of stroke. Promoting awareness also includes the important factor of GPs. I was very concerned, as other hon. Members were, when I saw the statistic that about 20 per cent. of patients who go to GPs with a TIA are not referred on. The second key issue that hon. Members have raised, which the Minister will want to address, is the concern about ring-fenced money going to local authorities. That money has clearly been used, in some instances, for purposes for which it was not intended. That issue needs to be looked at, because it could have a detrimental impact on stroke care.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/15">In conclusion, we spend more on stroke services, as a nation, and there is rightly an increased focus on them, but we still have worse outcomes than comparable European nations. We should adopt more of the recommendations of the National Audit Office and the Select Committee on Public Accounts to enable our dedicated and hard-working stroke physicians, nurses and associated health care professionals to improve the quality of stroke care in the shortest possible time.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.0/1">I intend to be brief, which means that we may have an opportunity to give the Minister very adequate time in which to respond to this debate and, perhaps, to take a number of interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/2">I hope that hon. Members will not mind if I remind them that we in Parliament tend to be obsessed about the requirements of a functioning democracy. One cannot taken this debate about regional broadcasting in isolation; it is about broadcasting and broadcasting standards generally and the importance of ensuring that our broadcasters are able to provide information and to delve below the surface of what is going on in this country and worldwide. That is essential in ensuring that we have a functioning democracy. We can either accept the model whereby one state corporation&mdash;the BBC&mdash;fulfills that public service broadcasting function, with perhaps a few add-ons from Channel 4 and elsewhere, or we can accept that if we are to have an effective organ to provide the background, investigative programmes, information and debate that is vital to a functioning democracy, we need independent broadcasters as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/3">I am probably one of the most IT-challenged people on earth&mdash;I do not understand digital systems&mdash;but if this is the brave new world that we must accept with open arms and if this is the inevitable future of broadcasting in this country, we should consider something before we step beyond the precipice and accept the final Americanisation of British broadcasting and engage in the multi-channel culture. I fear that such a culture will be an acceleration of the race to the bottom and a continuation of the celebrity game show/makeover programmes that involve the ritual humiliation of the working classes by their apparent betters, or reality TV and &quot;Big Brother&quot; programmes. Broadcasters tend to revert to such a diet of programmes when they can think of nothing else to do. I fear that that will largely be the kind of thing that the multiple channels will provide. If that is what commercial TV is going to provide, before we go down that route I hope that we hon. Members&mdash;in the debating chamber of the nation&mdash;will engage in the debate and encourage the Government to stop and think and allow us the space in which we might recognise that broadcasters provide a vital service to the nation and to the regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/4">When talking about regions it is important that we do not simply accept the Government's ideas of regions, which are, in fact, Government zones; they are not places that people identify with. There is no internal integrity or community of interest within the Government zones. I speak for myself in respect of the Government zone of the south-west. Those zones are not the basis on which to provide the local news and information input into the kind of debate that we require.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.1/1">I am certain that it will be diminished by the results of the decisions that are currently being taken by ITV. It is clear, both in conversation and in debate, and from the pronouncements of Michael Grade on behalf of ITV, that he wants ITV to be a stand-alone commercial company and does not want to accept public subsidy for the service that ITV provides, in whatever form. I am not sure what his and the company's attitude is to tax credits or tax breaks that might be made available as an inducement to provide public service broadcasting, but by and large ITV's position is as I have said. As a result of that, as night follows day, bearing in mind the costs of the news gathering and reporting&mdash;the investigative work&mdash;that are required to pool the kind of programmes that we have seen in the past and make those available at regional level, ITV cannot achieve programming at the sub-regional level as it has managed to do in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/2">The fact that the Government's regions do not exist means that people are less likely to follow the programmes, because they are statistically less likely to get news from the areas about which they are most concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/3">It could be argued that, as a result of the campaigning that I and others have done on behalf of the excellent service provided by a number of companies since the early '60s, beginning with Westward Television's coverage of Cornwall and Devon, ITV has agreed to extend the local cutaway within the evening broadcast. That is welcome. However, as I said in an intervention, it will be a threadbare service with hardly any staff and without the studios and resources enjoyed in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/4">It is important that our regional broadcasters should be able to put in the resources and, if they provide a valuable service, to dig below the surface and ask questions, not simply report on press releases and turn up, if they can get there, at tragic events to stand outside and give us reports. We want the service to provide us with more in-depth analysis and with the same quality of information as in the past. Given the resources planned at the moment, I fear that that simply will not happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/5">I will ask an entirely na&iuml;ve question. If what we are trying to achieve&mdash;I believe that we should be trying to achieve it&mdash;is a good-quality, well-resourced public service broadcaster in the independent sector, and if ITV is not prepared to provide that, should we not offer channel 3 to someone else? If that is the easiest, most accessible number for people to find on their gizmo&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.31.1/1">Their EPG&mdash;whatever that stands for. If that is the case, channel 3 should be offered to someone who is prepared to accept the tax breaks, public subsidy or whatever is required to give us the quality of public service broadcasting, independent of the BBC, that this nation and its regions and local parts require to achieve the functioning democracy that we need. My fear, which also underlies the comments made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase>, is that if there is no independent provider of such a service, the quality of the local BBC service, with the best will in the world, will decline. Without some competitor holding it to its mettle and challenging it, I fear that the BBC will both withdraw services and fail to maintain its present standard.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.0/1">I agree entirely. A lot of us who feel rather cynical about what ITV proposes anticipate that it will not be many years before the currently proposed regional broadcasting provision will be reduced further, until regional broadcasts are effectively provided from studios in London. That fear may be unrealistic, but if ITV is going to find it difficult to maintain the rather bland regional programming planned at present, when that proves unsuccessful&mdash;I think that it will, because it will not provide the local news and views required&mdash;I fear that a further diminution will occur, and that ITV will justify it by citing falling audience numbers.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/2">My final comment and plea to the Minister&mdash;and, through her, to Ofcom and ITV&mdash;is that I do not stand here as someone who looks back to the dewy days when my birthday was read out by Gus Honeybun on Westward Television and I got five bunny hops. It is not about wanting to rekindle the old days; it is about maintaining a vital information broadcasting source in people's homes that ensures and underpins a functioning democracy. I also fear that ITV will lose out, because its unique selling point is that, unlike all the other channels with which it wants to compete, that produce the same bland stuff&mdash;game shows, celebrity programmes and so on&mdash;it includes a brand that is local to each area in which it broadcasts.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> on securing this debate and giving an excellent introduction to the complex issues with which many people are struggling. I think that he and all Members would agree that public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom is the envy of the world, but for a variety of reasons, we are in danger of losing that reputation.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale made a powerful case for regional programming&mdash;both news and programmes produced in individual regions that reflect those regions to the rest of the country&mdash;and gave a clear analysis of the concerns expressed by many people about the ITV proposals to cut regional broadcasting. He described it as the long slow death of regional broadcasting, and I share his concern. I have only to look at what is happening in my own region, with the proposed amalgamation of ITV West and ITV Westcountry. As I will describe, there is already a problem with the arrangements for ITV West. There are people in my constituency who are not that interested in regional news coverage for the areas outside Bath, but I am absolutely certain that people in Bath are not very interested in what happens in Truro and other such places in the far south-west.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.1/3">The amalgamation will diminish a service that many people think is important, and that view is backed up by research. Ofcom's most recent research shows that 78 per cent. of consumers attach high value to the news from the nations and regions. The BBC Trust's most recent report showed that 83 per cent. of people surveyed by the trust thought it important that the nations and regions were accurately represented to the rest of the United Kingdom. ITV's proposals will clearly damage what people in those surveys have demonstrated is important to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.1/4">I urge people not to wear rose-tinted spectacles when addressing the issue. If we look in depth at that research, we can see that only 20 per cent. of the people surveyed are very satisfied with the current regional news programming from both ITV and BBC. The satisfaction level drops even further when people are asked what they think about regional news programming as a way of finding out about specific local issues that affect them. We should not just address the question posed by my hon. Friend about how to maintain current regional programming, but consider more carefully what people really want, and try to find solutions to provide what they want.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.1/5">There is no doubt that the criticisms of current regional broadcasting are real, and that is before any changes are introduced. The BBC Trust, for example, is critical of the BBC for producing news through a &quot;London-centric prism&quot;. If we are to have proper regional broadcasting, we must address the issues that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">the Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> raised about properly resourcing it and ensuring that we have the news gatherers, equipment and so on to provide it. There is then a problem with how to fund that, and I shall return to that shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.1/6">Another area of concern about regional broadcasting is that the regions that we seek to protect are perhaps not necessarily the best ones. After all, they were developed around existing transmitters, and not to try to reflect particular communities of interest. There are a number of issues to be considered. Is what we are getting providing good-quality material? Answer: there are some concerns. Are the areas the right ones? Answer: probably not. Does provision really meet what people want, which on the whole is more locally focused news that reflects what is happening in their immediate local community?</p>
	<p pid="a.32.1/7">That last concern was forcibly picked up in November last year when the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport produced a report in which it said that</p>
	<p pid="a.32.1/8" class="indent">&quot;local television services in the UK are underdeveloped in relation to almost the whole of the rest of the free world&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.1/9">I have no doubt whatsoever that in future we must find ways, whether alongside regional news or replacing it&mdash;I hope that it is alongside&mdash;to provide high-quality, local news, not just as we already have on radio, but on television.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.1/10">Some people say that local programmes are already beginning to be developed on the web&mdash;more will develop if the BBC local video proposal goes ahead&mdash;but that is increasingly where more and more people, particularly young people, are looking for news. Indeed, the evidence shows a huge growth in the number of young people who have switched off from watching the ordinary television news, whether national or regional news, and are turning to the worldwide web for news. I shall go further and say that the technology is being developed&mdash;it already exists to some extent&mdash;to enable material on the web to be placed on our television screens and the miraculous electronic programme guide.</p>

	<p pid="a.34.0/1">If my hon. Friend will allow me, instead of giving a quick, glib answer, I would prefer to develop my thoughts about that in more detail in a moment, because it is critical.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/2">Before we move forward, having begun to put together thoughts about what we want&mdash;national programming, regional programming and the addition of high-quality local programming&mdash;we must be aware of the context in which a debate about how to achieve that takes place. That is why, as my hon. Friend said, Ofcom is conducting a major review and why the Government are simultaneously conducting a review so that proposals for a way forward may be made early in the new year. The context in which we do so has been summed up succinctly and admirably by Ofcom:</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/3" class="indent">&quot;The existing system of public service broadcasting...&mdash;a publicly owned BBC with competition from commercially funded broadcaster&mdash;is under huge pressure, and will not survive the transition to an all-digital broadcast world.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/4">That will not survive, so we must do something and not just bemoan the problems facing us. We must come forward with radical solutions to determine what we want, how to deliver it, and how it can be funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/5">The same Ofcom report explains why there is a problem:</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/6" class="indent">&quot;With more digital channels and new online, TV-like programmes the market will continue to make a significant contribution to content that meets public purposes, particularly in entertainment, sport, archive programmes and, in one exceptional case, news.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/7" class="indent">However, the commercial prospects for areas like regional and national news, children's television, UK drama and current affairs are poor. Nor can these most highly valued genres be sustained on ITV, Channel 4 and Five under the existing system as competition intensifies. Indeed, our extensive analysis indicates they will not deliver genres that require large and risky investment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/8">That is the context in which we are operating. Simply wishing to retain regional programming as it exists at the moment will not help us. We must talk about how to move forward, so we must have the debate. I welcome my hon. Friend's debate, as it is the start. It is the first time that the issue has been debated seriously in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/9">My hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives asked about the BBC local video. You will be aware, Mr. Williams, that the matter is being considered by the BBC Trust. The result of that consideration will be combined with Ofcom's market impact assessment, and by Friday it will bring those two pieces of work together and make its judgment. Although I was critical of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1905" name="Edward Vaizey">the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey)</phrase>, who speaks for the Conservative party on such issues, for not having clear views during a previous debate on another issue&mdash;he said that he would prefer to see the outcome of research&mdash;I confess that on this occasion I shall join him, because the critical piece of work is that market impact assessment, and my hon. Friend rightly said that newspapers, ITV and others are concerned about the impact of the BBC's proposals. Frankly, I am not competent to conduct that market impact assessment and will have to leave it to others, including the hon. Member for Wantage, who might have done some of his own research.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.3/1">I would like to make it clear that for health and safety reasons, I was not wearing a thong&mdash;mainly for the health and safety of the people watching. However, only Fox FM covered the important event of young men raising thousands of pounds for national and local good causes in Didcot. I pay tribute to the hard work of those young men.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.3/2">No one has made the point in this important debate that &quot;The times they are a'changin'&quot;. We now live in an extremely different broadcasting world from the one that existed two or three years ago. As the hon. Member for Bath pointed out, it is in fact the market that has noticed such changes, rather than hon. Members. As we move into a digital environment, ITV is under an extraordinary amount of pressure to make the same profits it used to and to provide the same quality of service. The way in which we gather information and news has changed completely. Almost all young people get their news from the web and social networking sites, and they spend more time on their computers than watching television. We all have hundreds of channels from which to chose to watch our news and broadcasting&mdash;whether we have Freeview or a subscription to a commercial company. It is a testament to ITV and Channel 4 that they have been able to maintain anything resembling their previous market share.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.3/3">There has been virtually no leadership on the issue from the Government. It has been fascinating to watch how they have dealt with it. First, the entire subject of public service broadcasting was handed over to Ofcom, which treads a fine line between being a regulator and a policymaker. Ofcom certainly came up with a series of interesting policies on the future of public service broadcasting, many of which have now been cast aside&mdash;including the proposal to have a public service internet site. When Ofcom got too big for its boots, the convergence think-tank was created to enable the Secretary of State to call people together. That has cost the taxpayer the princely sum of &pound;300,000. Not content with a large and expensive building in Cockspur street where he could perhaps call people together to discuss the future of convergence, the Secretary of State hired Arsenal football stadium for his first meeting. The convergence think-thank did not come up with much and the issue then went back to Ofcom.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.3/4">We now have the land grab by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. The arrival of Peter Mandelson seems to have spelled the demise of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport as a force in broadcasting policy. Lord Carter of Barnes is now installed in Victoria street and he has commissioned yet another review of the impact of digitisation on television and numerous other areas. We are told that the Government will come up with their policy in January. We wait with bated breath to see what emerges from either Lord Carter or the Secretary of State; it is not clear who will make the announcement. Government policy is all over the place on this issue, and meanwhile, as every hon. Member has pointed out, we are witnessing the slow decline, potentially, of regional broadcasting and regional news.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.3/5">I would like to echo the comments made by many hon. Members about the importance of regional news in particular. Four fifths of people say that TV is an important provider of local news; 90 per cent. of people in the devolved nations say that. Eighty-eight per cent. of people say that it is important that the main TV channels provide news from the nations and regions, and 70 per cent. said that it was important for ITV to make programmes in different parts of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.3/6">At the same time, it is worth pointing out that in most regions about 40 per cent. of people said that if there was no regional news, they would get their regional news from other sources. It is also important to point out that even with the current set-up of regional news, many of us do not identify with those regions. For example, there is very little coverage of the events in my constituency on local BBC news.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.3/7">Although many of us in this Chamber will of course regret the cuts being made by ITV to regional news, we cannot, as I think the hon. Member for Bath said, look on this issue with rose-tinted spectacles. ITV is taking what it regards as proper action in the face of the difficulties it faces now in having an analogue regulatory system while competing in a digital world. Again, it is a matter of regret that the Government seem no further forward in easing the regulatory burden on ITV. There are a number of things&mdash;I am not saying that they are panaceas&mdash;that would make life much easier for ITV. For example, under the audiovisual media services directive, we have a consultation on product placement. Product placement would not necessarily fill the coffers of ITV, but it would make life much easier.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.3/8">I was lucky enough to visit the set of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; with ITV's head of public policy, the estimable Jane Luca. We went round and had a good look at the shop in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, where all products have to be covered up from view. It is impossible in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, unlike the rest of the country, to buy a Kit Kat or a Mars bar. I do not think that if someone bought a Kit Kat or a Mars bar in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, the world would come to an end, but ITV might be able to make slightly more money. We live in this bizarre world where people watching &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; on Channel 4 will see no end of product placement, from an Aston Martin downwards, but in British programming, no product placement is allowed.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.3/9">What is the Secretary of State's reaction when he launches the review? It is to say that he is completely against product placement&mdash;he has cut the review off at the knees even before it has begun. There is no news on contract rights renewal. There is no news on flexibility on advertising minutage. On all those regulatory burdens imposed on ITV, there is no leadership from the Government. Therefore, ITV has to react. It has to save &pound;40 million a year and to merge regional news operations, but again I counsel hon. Members against sounding like Cassandra. As I understand it, the key bulletins that ITV is planning to drop are the weekday mid-morning bulletins&mdash;it would be interesting to know how many people watch those&mdash;and the lunchtime weekend bulletins. The main bulletins&mdash;the ones that hon. Members and their constituents watch&mdash;the early evening and late evening bulletins, will remain.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.3/10">In addition, ITV is hoping that Ofcom will allow it to drop its regional production quota from 50 to 35 per cent., but at the same time there will be an increase in Channel 4's regional production quota from 30 to 35 per cent. I am told by Ofcom that although that will save ITV some money, it will also result, if we take into account what the BBC is doing as well, in an increase overall in regional production from all broadcasters. That is a necessary and sensible move to give ITV the opportunity not to go bust.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.3/11">We would be well advised to take account of exactly what pressures companies such as ITV are under. We learned only last week that almost 2,500 people had lost their jobs in media companies such as Virgin Media, Haymarket and Time Out, and another 4,000 jobs are likely to go not just at ITV, but at Channel 4 and in national and local newspaper groups. That is why the current consultation on local television is so important. As the hon. Member for Bath pointed out, this is an interesting issue because the Conservative party has a clear position on it, which is that we firmly oppose the BBC's proposal to introduce local video. Again, ITV is doing its bit: itvlocal.com provides 1,900 hours of video content viewed by 1 million people a month. It is due to break even next year. That system will be decimated if the BBC gets its way. As ITV points out, it will &quot;jeopardise commercial services&quot;. Local commercial radio companies have called the BBC's proposals a &quot;damaging intervention&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.3/12">A couple of weeks ago, I received a letter from Simon O'Neill, the brilliant editor of my local newspaper, the <i>Oxford Mail</i>, and his colleague, Derek Holmes, the equally brilliant editor of the <i>Herald Series</i>, from which I get my local news and which occasionally I am very lucky and privileged to appear in. They point out that, in Oxfordshire alone, 15 websites are already run by seven local newspapers with local video. They say that if the BBC goes ahead and broadcasts local video services, that will be a serious threat to their business. The point that they make, which I think is one of the most powerful arguments made, is this: why is the BBC allowed to do online what it would not be able to do offline? Let us imagine the furore if the BBC announced tomorrow that it was to publish a national daily newspaper. People would think it utterly absurd that the BBC was choosing to compete in a market that was already saturated, so why on earth is it being allowed to compete with taxpayers' money, licence fee payers' money, in a market that is being served by local newspapers, local commercial radio companies and ITV?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-18a.41.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1837" speakername="Barbara Follett" colnum="41"  time="012:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081118/halltext/81118h0007.htm#08111869000479">
	<p pid="a.41.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that contribution. We must keep up those services. However, we must remember that the licences currently held by Ofcom are worth &pound;200 million today, but in a couple of years' time they will be worth about &pound;40 million. That is a significant drop and shows that its ability to attract money is lessening rapidly.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/2">The switchover to digital TV, with its greater numbers of free-to-air commercial channels, is eroding and fragmenting ITV's audience and therefore its ability to attract advertising revenue. That process has caused ITV's share of the advertising market to drop by more than 10 percentage points between 2004 and 2007. Hon. Members have alluded to the growing popularity of new audiovisual services, from online content to video on demand and catch-up TV. I know that many of us in the Chamber are probably not young enough to understand the mechanics of catch-up TV, but the coming generations use it all the time in the way that we&mdash;or at least I&mdash;used to switch on Muffin the Mule.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/3">As a result of those and other challenges, Ofcom believes that by 2011, the cost of public service obligations will exceed the benefit that they offer to commercial public service broadcasters. That alarming assessment gives the Government, Ofcom and broadcasters difficult issues to address and I would like to outline how we intend to do that. The hon. Member for Wantage said that we had lost control, and that Lord Carter had moved to the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. I assure the hon. Gentleman that Lord Carter has not moved&mdash;he happens to share a suite of offices with me in Cockspur street, and communication between us remains strong.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/4">We foresaw this problem when we introduced the Communications Act 2003. That Act imposed a duty on Ofcom to report every five years on the state of public service television broadcasting. It also ensured that Ofcom had the flexibility to make changes to a significant proportion of obligations as and when necessary. I reassure the hon. Member for Wantage that we are in discussion with it about that. Ofcom is currently in the middle of a public service broadcasting review. Such reviews are necessary because today we do not manage top-down but through consultation. We talk to people and try to reach an agreement that is backed by them. In other words, we seek to work by consensus, not authoritarian diktat.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/5">Ofcom's phase 2 document was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-25">25 September</phrase> and clearly showed, as hon. Members have done today, that the public value public service broadcasting, and want it to continue. The Government and Parliament have the responsibility for designing the statutory framework for the provision of public service content. That includes the purposes, the delivery mechanisms and the funding framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/6">As hon. Members said, in its report, Ofcom identified three models that it felt merited further discussion: the enhanced evolution model, a refined BBC and Channel 4 model, and a refined competitive funding model. It is clear from today's discussions that those three models attract criticism and approval from various groups&mdash;the review will weigh up those positions and consider what each model offers. I urge hon. Members, and anyone else who is interested, to contribute quickly to the consultation, which closes on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-04">4 December</phrase>, because we want everybody to get involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/7">It is also clear from Ofcom's report that certain programme genres are much more at risk than others, especially regional programming and national and regional news, which were the key themes of the remarks by the hon. Member for Rochdale. I assure him and other hon. Members that the Government remain committed to ensuring that programmes are made for, and in, the regions, and not just in London, or inside the M25 belt. That is why we embedded a regional dimension in the Communications Act 2003, which should facilitate the development of a critical mass of production outside London and the M25 area. It should also ensure that broadcasters continue to invest time and money in producing high-quality programming for the regions&mdash;I said &quot;should&quot; several times just then, because, disappointingly, ITV failed to meet its out-of-London production quotas in 2006 and 2007. The quotas are set by Ofcom and are statutory obligations, and the Government expect the relevant broadcasters to meet them. However, the possible sanctions for failure to do so are a matter for Ofcom, whose decision on ITV we await.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/8">Currently, the BBC and ITV offer viewers programmes that are made in their region, about their region. As Minister for the East of England, I take the point that local people do not always identify closely with those regions&mdash;indeed, living in Hertfordshire, I find it difficult sometimes to identify with content beamed broadly at the East Anglian coast&mdash;but that problem probably extends beyond the remit of this debate, so I shall put it to one side for now.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/9">In addition to the regional programming, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 are required to produce a proportion of programmes outside the M25. However, it is clear from today's debate that the main concern of the majority of people is ITV and its regional programming dimension, which has played a crucial part in ITV's unique appeal since it was launched in 1955. I am old enough to remember the launch and can tell hon. Members what a change the first commercial broadcasting company brought. Nationwide, audiences gathered around their television sets to watch high-quality programmes, including regional programmes. However, in the 53 years since, things have changed. Although ITV offered a big change from the London-centric programmes that people had been used to until 1955, and although ITV produced a big change in the BBC&mdash;it had to up its regional content&mdash;things have now changed again, and ITV's market price reflects the enormity of that change, as the hon. Member for Wantage said.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/10">Popular programmes such as &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;Doc Martin&quot; continue to ensure that television is not only, or mainly, about London. Although ITV spends about &pound;120 million a year on regional services, and provides around 5,000 hours of regional programming every year, its regional news represents the vast majority of its output in volume and cost. That is what we are talking about today. ITV spends more than &pound;100 million a year on news provision alone. The key question is how sustainable this is in the light of competition from multi-channel television and the proliferation of new media in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/11">In a strategy document on content-led recovery published last year, ITV expressed, and attempted to address, concerns about the validity of its business model. One of the key components of that strategy was a new approach to regional news, which the hon. Member for Bath outlined. However, I shall repeat it quickly. The strategy would provide nine flagship regional news programmes in place of the 17 currently provided and would involve merging some of the smaller regions, such as ITV Westcountry, ITV West, ITV Border and ITV Tyne Tees.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/12">ITV has confirmed, however, that it is committed to ensuring that each region will be fully equipped with journalists, camera crews and news-gathering equipment in order to cover breaking and emergency stories. It will also provide segments within news programmes to provide an even more localised service in areas such as Border and Tyne Tees. However, the Government accept that there is a fear that the quality of coverage provided is under threat and that those stories best covered in the regions will be buried or reported inaccurately. In difficult times&mdash;for example, during a flood or a hospital crisis&mdash;it is crucial that people get the information for their area. As a regional Minister, I had to deal with the outbreak of avian flu, when we really needed regional information, so I understand fully the high value that people place on regional news services. I am glad, therefore, that Ofcom is consulting on its proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/13">In these difficult times, the fact that people are facing job cuts in all ITV regions must be causing great concern, and I sympathise with journalists whose jobs are under threat. The Government and Ofcom have taken a twin-track approach to the current difficulties that public service and commercial broadcasting is facing. We are looking at policies and the practicalities of the situation, and despite the ominous warnings from the hon. Member for Wantage, Lord Carter is very engaged in this policy area&mdash;and in Cockspur street, not Victoria street.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-18a.48.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" speakername="Bill Rammell" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office"  colnum="48"  time="012:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081118/halltext/81118h0008.htm#08111869000483">
	<p pid="a.48.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1384" name="Eric Illsley">the Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley)</phrase> on securing this debate, on behalf of his constituent, about the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's consular assistance policy and, more specifically, the handling of the case of Dale Nord who, as he has said, tragically died in Indonesia in January. I know that the issue has greatly concerned my hon. Friend, who has pursued it vigorously. I would like to take this opportunity to express my condolences to the Nord family. I can only imagine how hard it must be to lose a member of one's family in such circumstances. This is a particularly poignant time as the first anniversary of Dale Nord's death approaches.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/2">There has been much correspondence between Mr Nord's sister, April Nord, and the FCO about the events on the day of Mr Nord's death and I fully appreciate the family's need to know as much detail as possible about the circumstances. Consular staff in Jakarta and London have tried to provide Ms Nord with as much support and information as we can. I regret it if discrepancies between our records and Ms Nord's have added further to the family's distress. I know that Ms Nord does not agree with aspects of the version of events that our duty officer in Jakarta recorded. As we have made clear to her, that is simply a record of what the embassy duty officer was told at the time and the action he took.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/3">My hon. Friend has said that Ms Nord feels she received inaccurate information on the medical condition of her brother from our duty officer. I do not think that it is appropriate in this forum to go into the detail of the information relayed about Mr. Nord's medical condition, but I reiterate what we have said in previous correspondence: our duty officers are not medically trained personnel; their role in such situations is to relay information between the various parties. They cannot and should not interpret medical information. Any diagnosis and decisions on treatment are made by the relevant medical staff. If there was a misdiagnosis of Mr. Nord's condition&mdash;I do not know whether that is the case&mdash;our duty officer in no way contributed to it. He was simply passing on the information that he had been given. I must say that, in the circumstances, I do not see what other course of action was available to him.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/4">My hon. Friend also said that the west Yorkshire coroner, who has opened an inquest into Mr. Nord's death, has concerns in relation to this case. As my hon. Friend knows, in addition to the documents from the hospital that the coroner requested, we have provided him with a statement from the embassy officer who was on duty at the time of Mr. Nord's death, which records the information that the duty officer was given and the actions that he took, and a statement from the vice-consul in Jakarta, whom the duty officer had consulted. The coroner has not expressed to the FCO any dissatisfaction or reservations about those statements, nor has he asked for any further evidence from the two individuals concerned. I understand that there is one outstanding request from the coroner for information from the hospital itself, which our staff in Jakarta are trying to obtain on his behalf. I hope that we can achieve that outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/5">Clearly, a particularly distressing issue for Mr. Nord's family is their belief that treatment was withheld from Mr. Nord until such time as the hospital received payment. Hospital treatment in Indonesia is not free and requires either a deposit or a confirmed undertaking to pay from an insurance policy, so it is not unusual that the friends who were with Mr. Nord would have been asked for an initial payment. However, it is our clear understanding from what Mr. Nord's friend said to the duty officer at the time that in fact, the hospital did not withhold treatment from Mr. Nord until it received the payment that it had requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/6">Our belief is that Mr. Nord was treated by the hospital throughout that night and he was certainly being treated when the duty officer from the embassy arrived. Our understanding is that, on his arrival at the hospital at 1.50 am, Mr. Nord was moved to the intensive care unit. Further, the hospital log shows that treatment took place at 3 am and the duty officer from the embassy was first contacted at 3.35 am. That record certainly demonstrates that Mr. Nord had received treatment before the duty officer from the embassy arrived.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/7">One of the main concerns that my hon. Friend and Ms Nord have raised with us is why the FCO could not guarantee payment of Mr. Nord's medical costs. My hon. Friend has also said that he believes that the FCO should have procedures in place to assist British nationals who need funding in medical emergencies such as this. However, I must say that I do not agree with that view. Unfortunately, a huge number of British nationals end up in hospital overseas each and every year, needing treatment. Indeed, there have been almost 3,000 cases already this year that we have been notified about. The UK Government cannot pay the medical costs of those individuals, nor can we provide financial guarantees on their behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/8">The FCO has invested substantial resources in making it clear to British nationals who are travelling or living overseas that they need to have full travel insurance. Our consular directorate's &quot;Know before you go&quot; campaign was launched in 2001 to encourage British nationals to take the necessary precautions to ensure that they have safe and trouble-free travel abroad. The need to obtain comprehensive insurance is one of the campaign's key messages, and a wide range of methods and partnerships are used to promote it. The FCO's travel advice on its website includes suggestions about what a travel insurance policy should cover, and what the real cost of medical treatment could be for those who travel without insurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/9">As my hon. Friend is probably also aware, in 2006 the FCO published a booklet, &quot;Support for British Nationals Abroad: A Guide&quot;, which clearly sets out what we can do and, just as importantly, what we cannot do for British nationals overseas. Page 16 of that booklet explicitly states:</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/10" class="indent">&quot;We will expect you to have full travel insurance for your trip, or health care and other appropriate cover if you are living abroad. The Government cannot cover medical costs&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/11">With regard to this specific case, our duty officer was therefore correct in saying that he could not guarantee payment of the medical bills on the Nord family's behalf. I must say that if we were to make such an undertaking in individual cases, we would have to do it in every case, the cost of which would be colossal, and I believe that the resulting burden on the taxpayer would be both unreasonable and unaffordable.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/12">As my hon. Friend knows, the duty officer at the embassy went to the hospital where Mr. Nord was being treated and he tried to facilitate a credit card payment by Mr. Nord's family, but I understand that that payment was refused because the hospital's standing instructions required its accounts office to see the original credit card. Of course, I understand the additional distress that can be caused when funds are needed in an emergency and that any time delay in the transfer of funds adds to that distress. Although it will bring little comfort to the Nord family at this time, they may want to know that the FCO is examining the possibility that in some emergencies where British nationals are in urgent need of funds, we will be able to take card payments ourselves directly from friends or family in the UK, and thereby, in situations such as this one, quickly facilitate payment to a hospital overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/13">Ms Nord has also expressed reservations that the person on duty at the embassy, who was not a consular officer, may not have been best placed to provide assistance to her brother and herself; indeed, those concerns have also been expressed by my hon. Friend this afternoon. I must point out that duty officers deal with all inquiries to an embassy's out-of-hours emergency number, many of which are not about consular issues. In this case, although the duty officer was not working in a consular position in the Jakarta embassy, he had previous consular experience. He also spoke to the vice-consul at the post to brief him on the situation and on the actions that he had taken. The vice-consul confirmed to the duty officer that he was following consular guidance in dealing with this situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/14">Although I again appreciate that it will not alleviate the Nord family's distress at their loss, the FCO is reviewing how we deal with out-of-hours calls to our missions overseas and examining how we can ensure that we have as consistent and professional a service as possible out of hours, as well as during the working day. As I have said, I appreciate that that does not help Ms Nord and her family, but I hope that the House will note that we are continually looking for ways to improve the consular service that we offer to British nationals overseas, particularly those in serious distress.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/15">Having said all that, I genuinely understand the concerns of relatives when, as in this case, someone dies tragically thousands of miles away in a situation that the relatives feel they have no influence over. It is a tragic situation; this incident was a tragic accident. However, nothing will bring Mr. Nord back. Nevertheless, if it would help I am happy to meet my hon. Friend and his constituent to explain as fully as possible our actions and those of our consular staff, and our understanding of exactly what took place. Sometimes, such a meeting can be a better forum within which to discuss these matters than an Adjournment debate in the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/16">As I said at the beginning of this debate, I genuinely and deeply regret that this tragic situation has been made worse for Mr. Nord's family by their belief that he was treated neither promptly nor correctly by medical staff at Pertamina hospital, and by their dissatisfaction with the assistance that the duty officer at our embassy in Jakarta provided. However, I am satisfied that the duty officer provided the appropriate consular assistance. Much as we might like it to be otherwise, it was not in his power to guarantee payments for Mr. Nord's treatment, nor was it in his power to interpret any medical diagnoses. I simply do not think that either of those actions would have been possible in the circumstances. Nevertheless, the offer that I have made to meet my hon. Friend to discuss this case is a genuine one, and I will happily meet him if that is what he wishes to do.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-18a.52.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" speakername="Oliver Letwin" colnum="52"  time="012:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081118/halltext/81118h0008.htm#08111869000484">
	<p pid="a.52.1/1">I can genuinely say, Mr. Key, that it is a delight to serve under your chairmanship.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/2">I asked for this debate because, a few years ago, I found myself, as Members of Parliament do from time to time, at a meeting in a Committee Room that had been booked by outsiders who were explaining some matters to us. I was not at all sure that I really needed to be there but I had gone along for the ride, so to speak. At the meeting, a rather large map of Great Britain was projected electronically on the wall. It was very heavily shaded in some parts, and it showed the digital coverage that would be achieved with the digital switchover. There were just a very few points of white on this impressively shaded map. The people who held the meeting were from what is now Digital UK, as well as other groups, and they explained that the coverage was magnificent and it was only the tiny white points where there would not be any coverage.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/3">I am as blind as a bat, as you might know, Mr. Key, so I had to take out my glasses, but even that did not work. I had to walk over and get close to the screen to see that my constituency and that of my neighbour in South Dorset were pinpointed with unerring accuracy as the two in the whole of the south of England that will not be well covered by digital broadcasting. As you might imagine, Mr. Key, I suddenly became extremely interested in the meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/4">That meeting led to the formation of the Dorset broadcasting action group, which is known as DorBAG. We have had a series of constructive and useful meetings with representatives of Digital UK and the BBC at various levels. I have also had meetings with the director-general of the BBC and members of the central staff, as well as with Ofcom and a range of other relevant parties, and some progress has been made. Many of my constituents who will not be served by digital terrestrial broadcasting, due to the lie of the land, will nevertheless be able to get hold of Freesat, which was not available when I was stuck in that room looking at the map. That will enable them to receive digital broadcasts without having to deal with Mr. Murdoch. However, my constituents, and those in South Dorset, experience significant problems with news coverage that are bound up with more persistent problems that have nothing to do with digital switchover.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/5">The main issue is the so-called &quot;three mux, six mux&quot; problem with which the Minister will be familiar. It so happens that my constituents are served by relay transmitters, although why that is the case is lost in the mists of history. For reasons that I dimly understand&mdash;too dimly to give the House any adequate explanation&mdash;when digital switchover occurs, people who are served by relays will not receive the full suite of channels that they would get if they were served by a main transmitter. For reasons that I understand even less, that effect is not uniform, so only some of my constituents will have access to the full range of channels.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/6">Having sat down with the experts&mdash;of whom I am not one, of course&mdash;I have discovered that on some streets in my constituency, people on one side will receive the full set of channels whereas those on the other side will not. You will understand, Mr. Key, from your extensive experience as the conscientious Member for Salisbury, the kind of civil unrest and the postbag that will be generated for me and my neighbour in South Dorset&mdash;whoever that may be&mdash;if our constituents can compare notes. Suppose that Mrs. Jones discourses, in the shop, on the merits of the programme that she saw the night before, but Mrs. Smith could not get it. That will not make Mrs. Smith happy, not least because she is paying the same licence fee as Mrs. Jones. Nothing on earth will persuade Mrs. Smith that that situation should have occurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/7">The Government's account&mdash;I know this because I have tabled parliamentary questions and have written letters on the matter&mdash;is that the decision is a commercial one, and it is not theirs to take. They say that it is the commercial broadcasters that have decided not to foot the bill for making a full suite of channels available to all my constituents, but there is a hitch in that argument. It is true that the broadcasters have taken that decision, but I have no doubt that if there were no regulation at all, they would have chosen to serve only the urban concentrations. They might well have decided that it simply was not worth serving people in West Dorset or, while we are at it, perhaps even those in Salisbury. In general, what compels them to serve a wide population and to give access to programming is the regulatory framework that is partly designed to have exactly that effect, and rightly so. I do not think that the Government can skip out of the matter by arguing that it is a commercial decision, because underpinning that decision is a regulatory framework that does not compel broadcasters to provide equivalent levels of service where technically possible, which it is in this case, to all the residents of an area.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/8">There has been a regulatory failure, but we do not necessarily need a regulatory solution. There is a practical, humdrum solution that would also solve a second problem that I want to raise with the Minister. I have already raised it with the director-general of the BBC and some of his colleagues, and DorBAG has raised it at various levels within the BBC. In West Dorset and South Dorset, we suffer from being on the margin. Poole and Bournemouth are, culturally speaking, part of the south of England, whereas Exeter and Plymouth are, culturally speaking, part of south-west England. Dorset, particularly West Dorset and South Dorset, lies betwixt the two.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/9">For many years, the BBC and other broadcasters have been unable to decide quite where in the cultural map of Britain South Dorset and West Dorset fit. That problem is not shared by the people of South Dorset and West Dorset. My constituents, who differ in many other respects would, if asked&mdash;although I have never tried it&mdash;probably respond to a deed poll with a 90 per cent. return answering that they are culturally part of the south-west. We do not feel allied to Hampshire, and we do not look to it. Part of the reason why the geographical county of Dorset was split into the unitaries of Bournemouth and Poole and the rural county of Dorset was precisely because the rural county of Dorset looks west, not east.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/10">There is extraordinarily little interest in my constituency in news about Bournemouth, although it is a fine place and we have nothing against it. Bournemouth is of great interest to the people who live in it, but to the people of my constituency, who rarely go anywhere near it, it is not a place of great interest; it is just a place. News about Bournemouth and Poole, of which one can see a lot on TV screens in South Dorset and West Dorset, if one can get coverage, which many people cannot, is of no interest. Moreover, the southern offices of the news-gathering organisations do not regard Dorset as part of their remit any more than West Dorset regards itself as being part of their culture, so they do not provide any serious amount of broadcast news about events in West Dorset or South Dorset. The south-western parts of the BBC would be keen to do so, because they do regard us as being part of them, but, alas, they are not mainly responsible, and most of the broadcasts do not come from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/11">As a result of DorBAG's efforts, the BBC has made considerable advances on news gathering, particularly for radio news, and it has made partial moves to set up a team of journalists who will work from Dorchester and Weymouth and will concern themselves with events in rural Dorset. Unfortunately, however, the configuration reflects the very problem that I describe, because responsibility for that group of journalists will be shared. There is so-called matrix management. Whenever I hear such words, I know that I am hearing a confusion. Those poor people, who will be earnestly working for truth in the news-gathering organisation that will be established in Dorchester, will have two masters&mdash;south-west and south&mdash;and will not know whether they are coming or going. Because they have two masters, they will no patron, as that would not be core to the offering of either. They will be at the margin of each. Their chances of getting the editor of either to take seriously the product that they provide will be reduced. If an editor is fundamentally focusing on a particular area, most of the news that he wants to put on will be from that area. The rather inconvenient fact of a half share in West Dorset and South Dorset news gathering will not make them think that that area should be the centrepiece of their news programming.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/12">Why do I go into this long excursus about news and its origin? Because the very same solution that would solve the three mux, six mux problem, and the problem of some people having very few channels compared with others after switchover, would also solve the problem of news broadcasts. If there were a new main transmitter that provided the full suite of channels for all those in my constituency and South Dorset who can receive terrestrial TV, and if that transmitter were linked to the south-west so that BBC South West were responsible for the news content that went out to the locality, we would get not only all the channels but news programming that was local and became part of the core offering of the south-western part of the Beeb. That would be a huge advance for my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/13">I do not think that there would be huge expense involved. There would be some&mdash;the capital expense of establishing the mast&mdash;but that is a very small part of the cost of digital switchover. As I understand it, running costs would not be increased by the manoeuvre. Moreover, we have established that there would be positive enthusiasm in BBC South West about taking on the responsibility for West Dorset and South Dorset broadcasting. We would have a lasting arrangement that would satisfy my constituents and relieve both the Minister and me of an endless stream of irate constituents complaining about getting half as much broadcasting as they have paid for, and still not getting the news to which they think they are entitled. Of course, we shall make that proposal to the BBC Trust and the director-general. I hope that the Minister will give it a fair wind and ensure that my constituents are not left at the margins of news and in the unfortunate position of receiving, in many cases, only half the channels that other people receive.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.1/1">I accept that, which is why I tried to frame the debate in the spirit that I did. We should always keep such things under review. I would value that evidence, because it can inform the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford, and me, once officials have looked at the matter again. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Gower for raising the issue. In the broadest sense&mdash;it is not only about DLA and the higher mobility component&mdash;it should be incumbent on the Government and the Department for Work and Pensions to consider and take his comments very seriously.</p>
