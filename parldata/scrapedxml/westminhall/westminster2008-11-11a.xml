<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-11a.195.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="195"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081111/halltext/81111h0001.htm#08111147000505">
	<p pid="a.195.3/1">I welcome this debate and I acknowledge your point, Mr. Bayley, so we will finish in good time to allow us to observe the two-minute silence.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/2">This is not the first debate that we have had on housing in London and it certainly will not be the last. A number of recidivists are here, including my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> and the Minister. I guess that we will debate the matter quite a few more times, because the housing situation in London is difficult and, for the constituents whom my colleagues and I represent, it is dire.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/3">There is a huge amount of housing stress. The current financial problems&mdash;the credit crunch&mdash;have exacerbated these difficulties, with a number of people moving into negative equity, although I suspect that a lesser proportion have moved into negative equity in London than in other parts of the country. There are also problems with repossession and there is a huge level of stress among owner-occupiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/4">London housing is expensive, both in the private rented sector and in the purchasing sector. The lending policies of many of the banks and building societies over the past few years&mdash;lending astronomical proportions of people's income, often relying on two incomes&mdash;mean that there is a serious crisis if one partner loses a job or does not get the bonus that was expected. I hope that the Minister will offer us some assurance about the behaviour of the banks and the building societies on the repossession policy, because repossession of a property benefits almost nobody; it is a disaster for the family concerned and is traumatic for the children of that family, which often ends up homeless and a charge on the public assets anyway. I hope that, since we have put &pound;34 billion into the banks and given a huge amount to them in loans, we will use the power of public ownership of the banks&mdash;or at least part public ownership&mdash;to enforce on them a much more humane, rational policy on lending and repossessions. That does not just apply to London; it applies to the whole country.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/5">Broadly speaking, 58 per cent. of Londoners live in owner-occupation, 9 per cent. live in housing association properties, 19 per cent. in private rented accommodation and 14 per cent. in local authority properties. Those figures are from a couple of years ago and I suspect that the number in owner-occupation has gone down, the number in private rented has gone up a great deal and the number in local authority accommodation has probably remained roughly the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/6">The problem in London is that housing is so expensive that local authorities are not building as much as one would hope. The housing associations have similar problems. So many people are having difficulty buying that they are forced into the private rented sector&mdash;indeed, many are forced into the private rented sector by local authorities that have nowhere to put them or because the housing associations cannot do it. On top of that, the number of starts, particularly in the private sector, has decreased a great deal&mdash;by 19 per cent. in one year, in respect of the relevant quarters. The number of starts by registered social landlords&mdash;that is, housing associations&mdash;is roughly the same. However, the number overall has gone down. The number of completions has also gone down. We are looking at an acceleration of decline, which is a difficult situation to be in.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/7">The useful briefing provided by the Greater London authority states:</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/8" class="indent">&quot;London has by far the greatest housing needs of any English region...50,000 households are homeless and living in temporary accommodation in London, and around 200,000 households are overcrowded.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/9">We also have</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/10" class="indent">&quot;the highest house prices in England, with acute affordability problems in most boroughs...In the last three years nearly 75,000 new homes were built in London, 34 per cent. of which were affordable homes (either social rent or products such as shared ownership for those on intermediate incomes). These figures do not include several thousand vacant homes returned to use and non self-contained units in hostels and halls.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/11">I mention that because the word &quot;affordability&quot; is thrown around too easily when we talk about housing needs in London. The reality is that, certainly in my constituency and, I suspect, in those of my colleagues, there is no possibility for 80 to 90 per cent. of the people that I represent to buy a home in the community where they live in. The figures vary across London, but there is probably no constituency where even half can afford to buy within their community. This is a serious crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/12">The reality is that we are not building enough homes. The Housing Federation briefing states that we are</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/13" class="indent">&quot;not building enough homes. Only two thirds of the social homes needed in the capital each year are being built and, overall, London needs at least an extra 11,000 new homes a year...The number of people made homeless in London last year outstripped the number of new social homes built. Over 15,000 families were accepted as homeless by London councils last year. But fewer than 11,500 new social homes were built.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/14">In other words, the number of people who are homeless is increasing; the social disaster is getting worse. It goes on:</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/15" class="indent">&quot;House prices cost over 14 times the average Londoner's income and private rents are more than twice as expensive as social rents...In 2007, the average cost of a London home was &pound;355,000...Buying at the cheapest end of the London market still requires an income of over &pound;56,000, more than double median earnings in the capital.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/16">This is a disastrous situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.0/1">I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman; he makes an important point. Does he agree that part of the difficulty is that there is a relationship between local and central Government in relation to the housing benefit rules? That also makes the problem of affordability acute. I endorse what he said about the appalling human cost, which applies even in relatively wealthy boroughs, such as the City of Westminster&mdash;as it does, of course, in Islington.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> on securing this debate. It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase>, who has initiated similar debates previously.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/2">Although the debate highlights the crisis that we all feel and see, it is slightly reassuring to hear that it affects boroughs other than our own. Week after week, we sit in our constituency surgeries hearing the tragic cases of people who cannot find housing. There is a great deal of frustration, which I am sure other hon. Members here today share. People come to us, seemingly as a last resort, but there is very little that we can do except speak to the housing authority and see whether anything further can be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/3">The fact of the matter in most cases, as we have heard, is that no housing stock is available. As I have tried to explain to some of my constituents, it is not the borough's deliberate policy to stop people having a house. It simply does not have the stock. It is incredibly difficult to explain that, and I can understand why people's frustration often boils over. I would hate to work in a housing department&mdash;indeed, I pay tribute to those who do. We listen to such problems in our surgeries, but those working in housing departments listen daily&mdash;hourly&mdash;to people who are desperate to get a home.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/4">The hon. Member for Islington, North rightly pointed out the problems for families. I know of similar cases; I am sure that we all do. The idea of the old-fashioned nuclear family&mdash;the married couple with two kids&mdash;has changed. We now see people marrying for the second time who have to bring up kids from a first marriage. I am dealing with a case at the moment of a family with teenage children who are unrelated and of different sexes, but who are expected to share the same room. I am sure that that is not allowed, but it has to happen or the family will have nowhere to live. That is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/5">The London borough of Hillingdon, which covers my constituency, has another housing problem&mdash;again, one that will be found in other areas. Brunel university is located in the borough, so student housing has taken up a lot of the private rented sector. It has also pushed up prices. I spent some time at London university living in private rented housing, so I am not blameless, but it something that must be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/6">The frustration of local people is that they want to see their kids getting a place of their own and making a start, but it is not possible. Another effect is completely overstated, but it has to be said. When people come to my surgeries&mdash;again, I am sure that similar things happen elsewhere&mdash;one of the first things they say is, &quot;Yes, but we live near Heathrow.&quot; We know what that means: they think that asylum seekers will be pouring into the country and taking local homes. The facts do not back that up&mdash;it may be a small factor, but that is all. Unfortunately, in times of housing shortage, it is exactly such things that increase tension. It is something of which we must be aware.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/7">We have not discussed this, because of the lack of time, but I think of older people, who often find themselves without suitable accommodation. We need more suitable accommodation for older people. I accept that some may not want to leave their present home, but if new homes are adapted and if they seem nice, they might be willing to move, thus freeing up accommodation for others.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/8">We shall hear more about housing problems as a result of the current crisis. Things will become more and more difficult. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1651" name="Lee Scott">the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Scott)</phrase> spoke of a well known bank. What worries me is that many of the most vulnerable people go to mortgage lenders who not only charge incredible rates, but are ruthless when customers default. Such cases are difficult to deal with. We as MPs can talk to the banks and we might normally get a favourable response, but some of these mortgage companies are like the car clampers of the banking world: they take no interest in human misery.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/9">Later today, we will be debating Heathrow. Given that the London borough of Hillingdon has an acute shortage of housing, it is incredible that the Government should be on the verge of giving the go-ahead to a scheme that would knock down 3,000 or 4,000 homes. No one knows exactly how many homes will go, but people who have lived in villages and communities for generations will be expected to find somewhere else to live. At present, there is nowhere else for them to go. I find that incredible. If only for that reason, we should not have the runway expansion at Heathrow.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/10">This afternoon, if I am lucky enough to speak, I shall elaborate on my other reasons for taking that view, but we are talking this morning about housing provision. If we knock down 3,000 or 4,000 homes, it will make finding housing in west London even more impossible than it is now.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.0/1">As always, I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for her intervention. There are two points there: first, people have a right&mdash;a human right, I believe&mdash;to continue to live where their families grew up, whether in central London or elsewhere. We have a duty to provide affordable housing in those areas. Secondly, clearly there is no willingness to do that. Families are being told to move out of the borough, and the council is actually boasting about the length of time that people will be on the waiting list&mdash;12 years before people will even be considered for a property. Homeless families turning up to the town hall are made to wait outside in the cold for several hours before being seen. However, as she said, when they are palmed off to outer London, there is clearly no willingness to accommodate there. This crisis bas been caused not just be the economic circumstances, but by political intervention. Only Government intervention will resolve that.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.2/1">Thank you very much for your guidance, Mr. Bayley.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> on securing this very important debate and on sharing with us his heartfelt thoughts. 20 years ago last month, I moved to his constituency. As is my wont, I recently walked around that area&mdash;Birnam road, just off Tollington park&mdash;and judging by the new development on the Durham road estate, things have been spruced up. However, that is not to take away from what he was saying. I am sure that there are some major problems within those estates.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/3">Housing has been an issue close to the heart of London Members since the Great Reform Act. I am reading a quite fantastic book, which all Londoners should read: Jerry White's &quot;London in the Nineteenth Century&quot;, which deals with housing crises back when London did not extend much beyond the boundaries of my constituency, and perhaps that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase>. It discusses the problems of the rookeries and the slum clearances. Back then, housing was a major issue. The hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out that, in the aftermath of the second world war, and in the 1950s and 1960s, there was a united front politically in providing more housing in the capital. Although there are some disagreements&mdash;I am sorry about the tone of the comments of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1559" name="Andrew Slaughter">the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter)</phrase>, who is not in favour of the work of the Conservative-run Hammersmith and Fulham council&mdash;there is much broad agreement on some of the concerns that we all share.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/4">I receive a huge postbag of letters from constituents on many subjects. After immigration and the antics of parking regulators in Westminster city council, housing is the third most commonly raised subject. Many poor working families in Westminster have lived there for generations, but are regarded as not being poor enough to qualify for council or other social housing. The waiting lists in inner London&mdash;I am sure that this applies equally to Islington, Westminster and Hammersmith and Fulham&mdash;are mind-boggling. The area has become over-polarised. One must be unfeasibly rich or unfeasibly poor to live in so much of central London. That has been a perennial problem in the centre, but it is now extending to much of the capital.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/5">I do not want to say too much about <i>The Times </i>article yesterday. I have some sympathy perhaps with what the Government are trying to do. The notion of a secure tenancy for life that can be passed on down generations seems very much at odds with London mobility and diversity&mdash;the idea that those in the public sector would have security, but those in the private sector would not. However, that will be further explored in times to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/6">Last month, I met representatives of the G15&mdash;a group of London's largest housing associations, which house one in 10 Londoners, or some 700,000 people, and manage more than 400,000 homes. The group develops most of London's new affordable housing each year, and aims to create balanced and sustainable communities. It offers a range of homes to ensure that estates do not concentrate poverty, but contain a vibrant mix of people and incomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/7">The lack of capital liquidity to fund new housing schemes, the collapse in the financial viability of house builders and an acute lack of mortgage finance for those buying new homes are starting to cause real problems for London's housing providers. Although affordable housing production is progressing, it centres only on schemes that were either in progress when the crunch arrived or could not be stopped. That will mean a reasonable number of completions this year, but a collapse in the programme next year and, conceivably, no programme at all in 2010-11 unless there is an engineered flow of mortgages for first-time buyers.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/8">I will not say very much more. I hope that the Minister will tell us what will be done about the gap that I mentioned. There is a risk of us being complacent today because work is going on, but the effect of the credit crunch will have a major impact in three or four years' time unless action is taken now to put some of the work in train. It is fair to say that many housing associations are building homes for all sections of the housing market, from social rented and shared-ownership homes to the intermediate market rent and market sales. As all hon. Members will agree, we need to maintain that broad mix in London's communities. As well as offering homes for the poorest in society, we also need to provide better options for the people who are too rich to be able to rent socially, but too poor to buy in the market. That middle group has become ever larger in the communities that we represent. We want to have cohesive communities in which people do not feel the need, or desire, to move away from places in which they have lived and worked for some decades.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/9">I have overstepped my time, but thank you, Mr. Bayley, for allowing me to make my contribution. I know that it is a very important subject to which all of us will return before too long.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-11a.212.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" speakername="Sarah Teather" colnum="212"  time="010:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081111/halltext/81111h0003.htm#08111147000525">
	<p pid="a.212.0/1">I apologise for the state of my voice. I have a very bad cold, so I hope that you can hear me, Mr. Bayley.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> on securing this important debate. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">The hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> described housing supply and lack of housing provision as an issue that is dear to the heart of every London MP. That is very true. As a fellow London MP, it is certainly an issue that is dear to my heart. Lack of housing, poor, overcrowded, unaffordable and unsuitable housing have all been mentioned today, and they are among the key issues brought to my own office every week. Like the hon. Member for Islington, I hear the same stories week after week. We hear similar stories about how poor housing causes misery, breaks marriages, ruins health, destroys education and, most importantly, extinguishes hope for many families in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/3">Up to 50,000 children are stuck in temporary accommodation in London. In my constituency, that represents one in 10 of Brent's children. The continual moves and the unsuitable housing affects their ability to thrive at school. Just as they settle in one school, they are moved on somewhere else. If that temporary accommodation is also overcrowded, there is no way that they can do their homework. That point has been made by many hon. Members today.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/4">More than 300,000 people are stuck on waiting lists for social housing in London, and 20,000 of those are in Brent, many of them in my constituency. That is an issue of both lack of supply and extreme demand. Falling house prices will not necessarily help the matter. As mortgages become less affordable, we expect a knock-on effect on the affordability of renting as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/5">Many hon. Members mentioned cases from their own constituencies. I want to mention a couple from mine. Mr. H. has been on the housing list since 1984. He is in band C, so he is classed as someone in housing need. He is disabled and unable to work. He is single, but he has children who do not live with him. He cannot get a property because he is a single man, which means he cannot get proper access to his children. Mr. H. has been left on the housing list under four different Prime Ministers and still has little chance of finding a home.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/6">Miss. G. was registered for re-housing 11 years ago. She was in band C but, after representations from our office, she was upgraded to band B two years ago. She is in a two-bedroom property with four children, all of whom share a bedroom. Her son suffers from autism and learning difficulties. He has to share with his sisters, which has affected all of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/7">The hon. Member for Islington, North described other such heart-rending stories. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1893" name="John Randall">The hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)</phrase> spoke about how often such stories tip over into racial tension. Housing is one of the few issues in my constituency&mdash;an area of probably unqualified tolerance&mdash;that will bring tension about immigration to the fore, which is why I hope the Government will now accord greater priority to the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/8">Like other hon. Members, I was very anxious about the ideas that were floated in <i>The Times </i>yesterday. We need to find new and innovative ways to deal with the lack of housing. We already have a situation in which a person has to have a severe physical and/or mental health problem&mdash;probably a drug problem&mdash;and probably also has to be a single mother to have any chance of social housing. It is hard to see how the situation can be improved if such people are threatened with eviction if they fail to look hard enough for a job, and also if they get a job and their circumstances change.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/9">The Government must tackle the supply issue. I hope they will consider using the current downturn to take advantage of falling land prices to buy up land and properties, where appropriate. They will have to lift registered social landlords' borrowing limits and extend that flexibility to local authorities. We have that opportunity, and we should not let it go by. We can deal not just with the current crisis, but with the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/10">The Government must be more flexible with their house-building targets. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> mentioned, we have to accept that funding schemes through sales programmes will cause problems at the moment. I hope the Government will bring forward that subsidy and allow RSLs to fund their own building programmes through a greater proportion of subsidy rather than relying on private sales, otherwise we will end up with no build at all, which will mean that the Government miss their housing targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/11">We must have a coherent programme to tackle the issue of empty properties. A number of hon. Members mentioned partially built properties. Developments that are not completed often lie empty. I said that RSLs should be able to buy up some of those properties. However, as the hon. Member for Islington, North mentioned, that will not always be appropriate because such buildings will not necessarily be of suitable size to meet the long-term needs of social tenants.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/12">The Government could make better use of their own scheme, the empty dwellings management orders, to ensure that such buildings are put back into use for private rent. Moreover, I hope they will consider more short-term rent options. Other options exist in other countries in which property is brought into use on a short-term basis. We must be innovative when we consider this issue. It is no good for town centres to have many properties lying empty and available for squatters to inhabit when we have tens of thousands of people in the same area waiting on the housing list for more property.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/13">On repossessions, it is vital that we do whatever we can to keep people in their homes. It will be a disaster not just for those individuals who lose their homes but for local authorities, because they will have to deal with even more people who are desperate for housing at a time when the system is creaking at the seams.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/14">I have concerns about the pre-action protocol that the Government have announced. There is considerable doubt that the courts will enforce much of what is in the protocol. Instead, I hope the Government will consider amending the Banking Bill, which is going through Parliament at present, to put some of those things into law.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/15">Housing is a vital issue that affects all of us here today regardless of our party. The Government have made a number of announcements recently to tackle the problem. Unfortunately, when we go through the detail, we find that there is not a great deal of action. I hope that that will change and that the Government will accord greater priority to the matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.231.2/1">I am sorry but I will not give way. The law cannot be changed significantly in the courts of law.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/2">A number of hon. Members have mentioned various states and countries, including the Netherlands, the state of Oregon and Washington state, which has recently changed the law. The significant thing about Oregon is that, according to recent research published in the British Medical Journal, one in six Oregonians who have taken lethal drugs provided by their doctors were actually suffering from treatable depression, which the doctors had failed to diagnose. There is a danger that some people will want to go beyond terminal illness and serious long-term conditions and go to younger people and those seriously suffering from mental illness as well. Baroness Warnock said in a recent article in <i>The Times</i>:</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/3" class="indent">&quot;If you're demented, you're wasting people's lives, your family's lives, and you're wasting the resources of the NHS.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/4">What a statement for a peer of the realm to make! Let me remind hon. Members that some of the 700,000 Alzheimer's patients in this country would follow the course set proposed by hon. Members if Baroness Warnock and her supporters had their way.</p>

	<p pid="a.232.2/1">I am sorry but I will not give way. We have limited time.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/2">The majority of doctors are opposed to physician-assisted suicide, as is the British Medical Association and all the royal medical colleges. In 2005, the House of Lords Select Committee recorded the view of the General Medical Council:</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/3" class="indent">&quot;A change in the law to allow&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/4">physician-assisted suicide&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/5" class="indent">&quot;would have profound consequences for the role and responsibilities of doctors and their relationships with patients. Acting with the primary intention to hasten a patient's death would be difficult to reconcile with the medical ethical principles of beneficence and non-maleficence.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/6">I agree. In the words of Lord Carlile of Berriew,</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/7" class="indent">&quot;The slippery slope is no fiction; it is already well-polished.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/8">There are few of us who are not afraid of death, especially the uncertainty that is associated with it. We are all anxious not to become a burden on others and none of us would wish to suffer pain over a prolonged period. That is what organisations like Dignity in Dying&mdash;I still prefer to call it the Voluntary Euthanasia Society&mdash;play on. The alternative is to ensure that people have dignity in dying and that their physical, spiritual and emotional requirements are met. I welcome the introduction by the Government of the recent end-of-life care strategy, which has many good things in it. Hopefully, dignity in dying will become much more prevalent when that strategy is practised across the country in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/9">I do not want physician-assisted suicide to become a treatment option. I remind hon. Members what Hippocrates said in 400 BC:</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/10" class="indent">&quot;I will give no deadly medicine to anyone if asked, nor suggest any such counsel.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/11">How a society treats its dying patients is a litmus test for that society.</p>

	<p pid="a.234.3/1">I take that on board entirely, Mr. Bayley. Indeed, the judges ruled that only Parliament can change legislation&mdash;a point that I am sure we would all readily accept.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.3/2">Some opponents of a change in the law on assisted dying argue that the law is not broken so we should not attempt to fix it. However, much evidence shows that, despite those claims, the status quo has many negative consequences. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" name="Evan Harris">The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase> said that the status quo forces terminally ill people to look for alternatives, to exercise control over the manner and timing of their death when they feel that their suffering has become unbearable. That status quo has a terrible cost. We have already heard that, on average, 16 British citizens travel to Dignitas every year. The Home Office has identified that there are four cases of mercy killing each year, but I suspect that that represents only a small fraction of the real number of cases. Of course, such cases often never reach the courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.3/3">Sadly, each year, a number of terminally ill people resort to what are often violent and botched suicides. A number of people refuse food and water, to exercise control over the time and manner of their death. In addition, every year more than 900 people explicitly request that they receive assistance in dying from their doctor. The consequences for those who help can be dreadful, and many terminally ill people are driven to desperate measures, such as violent suicide or starvation. They are unable or unwilling to find someone to help them, because they know that that would involve breaking the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.3/4">Those figures demonstrate that the current status quo has an extremely negative impact on a sizeable proportion of terminally ill people. I should like to make it clear that Dignity in Dying campaigns for all terminally ill people to have access to excellent top-class palliative care services, regardless of age, disease, geographical location or any other factor.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-11a.235.1" nospeaker="true" colnum="235"  time="011:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081111/halltext/81111h0007.htm#08111147000009">
	<p pid="a.235.1/1">Of course, we all know that access to excellent palliative care is not always available. We also know that, for some people, good quality palliative care cannot address their concerns about losing autonomy, control and dignity at the end of their lives. That is far from being a failure of palliative care. This is person-centred issue and, most frequently, at the heart of a request to die is a concern over a loss of autonomy and a desire for control.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/2">The House of Lords Select Committee on the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill recognised that there are a group of patients whose demand for medically assisted dying will not be deflected by any circumstance&mdash;certainly, not by more and better palliative care. The National Council for Palliative Care, the British Medical Association and Macmillan Cancer Support have all acknowledged that to be the case. Dignity in Dying believes that mentally competent terminally ill adults should be allowed the option&mdash;it is an option, because it is a matter of personal choice&mdash;of an assisted death within strictly legal safeguards. That would bring an end to the many negative consequences of the status quo for terminally ill people and their loved ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/3">As we have heard, there are a number of ways in which individuals will take matters into their own hands&mdash;for example, Dignitas deaths, mercy killings, violent and unfortunately botched suicides, people refusing food and water and, in some cases, doctors helping their patients to die. The Swiss organisation Dignitas helps people with incurable illnesses to die and regularly features in the British media. In fact, more than 650 British people are members of Dignitas and, since October 2002, more than 100 British citizens have travelled to Switzerland to have an assisted death. That is an average of 16 citizens a year who go to Dignitas. Those people have travelled with the help of their loved ones, and they fear terribly what the legal consequences will be for their loved ones when they return to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/4">The lack of legal certainty in respect of prosecution of people who accompany their loved ones leads some terminally ill people to travel to Switzerland alone and often&mdash;this is a very important point&mdash;much earlier than they would otherwise have wanted to do. People are forced to die in a foreign country, away from familiar surroundings and, in some cases, without their loved ones&mdash;without their family.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/5">Mercy killings are slightly different. Under the current law, anyone who ends the life of another can be convicted of murder and receive a life sentence, even if the act is a compassionate response to a dying person's request for help to die. Despite the risk of being convicted of murder, a number of people resort to mercy killing, and they often regard that as a final act of love towards a person&mdash;perhaps someone to whom they have been married for 50 or 60 years&mdash;who is suffering and has requested help to die.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/6">Home Office records show a total of 57 suspected cases of homicide from 1990-01 to 2004-05 that could be described as mercy killings. I am sure that that is only a fraction of the real number, which can never be discovered. The current situation has incredibly negative effects.</p>

	<p pid="a.236.2/1">In view of the fact that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1471" name="Chris McCafferty">the hon. Member for Calder Valley (Chris McCafferty)</phrase> took more than twice as long as the guidance from the Chair advised, I shall be exceedingly brief. I believe that the title Dignity in Dying would be far more appropriate for the hospice movement than for the former Voluntary Euthanasia Society.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.2/2">I believe that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> was absolutely right when he said that one has to apply common sense in these terribly delicate and sensitive areas. Legislating for situations as extreme as those with which we are concerned today is not the best way to apply common sense. The law and common sense are often poles apart. I believe that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" name="Brian Iddon">the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon)</phrase> put his finger on the nub of the problem when he said that hard cases make bad law.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.2/3">I believe above all that my own sole contribution to the debate will be to pick on a single word that has been used by the apologists for voluntary euthanasia&mdash;safeguards. They say that, of course, appropriate safeguards must be in place. One cannot, in practical terms, put safeguards in place. One cannot safeguard a vulnerable elderly person from being pressed in private to tell the doctors that he or she wants his or her life to be ended prematurely, and one cannot have a safeguard against a selfless vulnerable person, even without pressure being applied by anyone else, feeling that it is their obligation to ask for euthanasia in order not to be a burden on others. Of course, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1900" name="David Winnick">the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick)</phrase> said, there are relatively few tragedies in the present situation. Let us not substitute heavy-handed legislation to make a much larger number of abuses the consequence of ill considered interference by the state.</p>

	<p pid="a.241.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" name="Evan Harris">the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase> on securing this debate. The subject has clearly aroused enormous interest, and we have had an excellent debate&mdash;short but good.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.0/2">We heard contributions from all sides; the arguments were well thought through and passionately stated, and the strongly held beliefs expressed were frequently based on personal experience and personal philosophy rather than party politics. Consequently, the three Liberal Democrat Members here today reflect three different positions. We have heard the Liberal Democrat Front Bench spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase>, repudiating his own policy. We have seen <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> flanked by people who passionately disagree with everything that he said. Similarly, different views have been expressed by my right hon. and hon. Friends.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.0/3">This debate is clearly not one that we needed to start. It is ongoing. Others with an interest&mdash;including Dignity in Dying, or the Voluntary Euthanasia Society&mdash;continue to press on the subject. Although Parliament has not changed its settled view since 1961, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" name="Edward Garnier">the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)</phrase> made clear the debate has not been in suspended animation. I have no doubt that it will continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.0/4">I wish to make it clear that I agree very much with what hon. Members said about the state of the current law. There is no doubt that the position is clear. As the hon. and learned Gentleman said, until the Suicide Act 1961 was passed, one could be sent to prison for attempting suicide if one managed to survive the attempt, and frequently people were imprisoned for such offences. Section 2 of that Act deals with the highly unusually offences of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the suicide or attempted suicide of another. It is not unique, but it is unusual because it criminalises something that is not itself an offence. There is a similar offence under the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003, but the provision is highly unusual.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.0/5">The crime of complicity in suicide&mdash;it is still a crime&mdash;covers a variety of situations. As we heard today, it covers situations of widely different moral culpability. There is a continuum, but Members would draw the line at different places. One merit of having a clear law is that it draws a clear line. However, as the hon. and learned Gentleman and others have said, one must then consider how to enforce it. If one has a clear line and no enforcement, is the position any clearer? That question has been the nub of our debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.0/6">In the context of concerns expressed by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1450" name="Madeleine Moon">the Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon)</phrase> in her brief intervention about technological advances and the use of the internet to encourage suicide, the Government have reviewed the situation. We have considered the current state of the law, as has the Law Commission. Among other things, the commission said that it believes the current law to be about right.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.0/7">Having reviewed the matter, the Government, too, believe that the present law covers encouraging suicide on the internet. However, because equivalent provisions have been replaced in the rest of the criminal law, we believe that there would be benefits in updating and clarifying the language. We have said that we intend to do that when parliamentary time allows. I cannot say this morning, before the Queen's Speech, when that might be&mdash;whether it will be sooner or later&mdash;but we have made it clear that we intend to simply and modernise the language of existing offences. It will be done when parliamentary time allows.</p>

	<p pid="a.243.1/1">I agree that there are pros and cons to the status quo, and I can see that there will be pros and cons to any change, or to the line being drawn in any particular place that might be suggested. We need a consensus in society and in Parliament before any change can made&mdash;if, indeed, there is an acceptance among Members of Parliament that the law ought to be changed. The moral dilemmas and difficulties are great. We all have different views, as do the political parties, on precisely where that line should be drawn.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/2">This morning's debate has indicated that this is a live issue and a matter that parliamentarians and Governments must and will continue to consider. I have no doubt that there will be opportunities for those on all sides of the argument to debate the subject and to propose measures to change the law in one way or another. We will have the opportunity to take those decisions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-11a.244.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1879" speakername="Adrian Sanders" colnum="244"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081111/halltext/81111h0008.htm#08111147000596">
	<p pid="a.244.1/1">I believe that I am the only Member for a Devonshire constituency who was born in the county, so I feel some emotion about any changes made to it. It is the county of Sir Francis Drake, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Francis Chichester, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Agatha Christie and Sir Joshua Reynolds&mdash;so many famous people have come from my county. Unfortunately, a flawed process is underway looking at how the county is managed. It has been marred by the misinterpretation of criteria and guidance, which has led to conclusions that have upset everyone and failed to achieve any obvious service delivery improvements, taxpayer savings or enhanced democracy anywhere in the historic and beautiful county of Devonshire. Specifically, the process has disadvantaged one of the two unitary authorities&mdash;namely, Torbay. The process is flawed because it is top-down and seeks to fix a problem that may not exist. It has no identifiable grass-roots support and fails to recognise what problems may exist and how improvements could be made for the people of Devon.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/2">I am an advocate of unitary local government supported by independent precepting parish or town councils, but I fear that the way in which the review has been handled will result in the worst of all worlds for all areas of the county. The boundary committee for England ought not to be allowed to move the goalposts and change its interpretation of the guidance once the process has begun. That is a serious allegation, but, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-06">6 February</phrase>, guidance was published for communities and local government in response to the decision not to allow Exeter city council to become a unitary authority. Section 8 of the guidance stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The matters on which the Boundary Committee is requested to advise in relation to the unitary proposal from Exeter City Council are:</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/4" class="indent">a) where there could be an alternative proposal for a single tier of local government and if so on what basis, for Exeter and the whole or part of the surrounding Devon county area, (with existing, or if necessary changed, boundaries of Plymouth City or Torbay Borough) which would in aggregate (including any implications for Plymouth City Council and Torbay Borough Council) have the capacity, if it were to be implemented, to deliver the outcomes specified by the five criteria set out in Annex A to this request&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/5">Paragraph 1.4 of the draft proposal, which was published in July, reads:</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/6" class="indent">&quot;In providing that advice, we are able to propose changes to the boundaries of the city of Plymouth and the borough of Torbay, both of which are existing unitary authorities in Devon. However, the guidance accompanying the Secretary of State's request for advice makes clear that we may only recommend changes to the boundaries of those two authorities if, on the basis of evidence received, our judgement is that such changes are essential to facilitate a unitary pattern of local government in the two-tier area of Devon that would have the capacity to meet the five criteria. Further, any changes to the boundaries of Plymouth or Torbay must maintain the concept of those areas as unitary local authorities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/7">Then, yesterday, the boundary committee issued a briefing note for today's debate in which the boundaries have moved again:</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/8" class="indent">&quot;With regard to the existing boundaries of Plymouth City Council and Torbay Borough Council the Secretary of State also said: 'boundary changes to Plymouth City or Torbay Borough are to be considered necessary only if, on the basis of any evidence received, the Committee considers that: they are essential if there is to be an alternative proposal for a single-tier of local government&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/9">First we were told that Torbay and Plymouth would be specifically included in any discussions on changes in local government service delivery in Devon, then that they might be involved and now that they will be involved only if certain criteria are met.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/10">It was felt that Torbay had been included at the start of the process&mdash;the boundary committee gave a clear indication to officers and councillors, as well as to me, that we should engage with the process&mdash;so it is extraordinary that council tax payers' money has been thrown down the drain and time wasted when we were allegedly never invited to participate in the first place. The Minister should ask why Plymouth and Torbay unitary authorities would have made considered submissions, alongside individuals and organisations from both areas, if the boundary committee had not misled them into investing time and resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/11">How the boundary committee can continue under the misnomer that it is advising the Secretary of State on the structure of local government in Devon, when four out of every 10 Devon households are excluded from the review, amazes me. I cannot speak on behalf of my Devonian cousins in Plymouth, but my constituents, who make up three quarters of the residents of Torbay unitary authority, will miss out and be disadvantaged if either of the recommendations from this unelected and unaccountable quango are accepted. This process has missed an opportunity to reunite Plymothians and the people of Torbay with the rest of Devon as a whole, or at least with unitary authorities with &quot;Devon&quot; in their titles. Three or four evenly sized unitary authorities could have met each of the five criteria laid down by the Secretary of State. They could also have tackled the problems faced by Torbay unitary authority and the challenges confronting the south Devon economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/12">Torbay is the same size as the Exeter unitary authority that the boundary committee ruled out on the grounds that it was too small to be an effective unitary authority. Torbay needs to be placed in a much wider south Devon context of commuter patterns, health care and education provision and economic activity. The towns of Totnes, Ashburton, Dawlish, Paignton, Newton Abbot, Torquay, Teignmouth and Brixham share a common heritage and history. Yet the people of Teignbridge and South Hams have been denied the opportunity to consider taking over the smaller area and population of Torbay, and instead could be taken over by the largest unitary authority in the country with a headquarters a long way from the people it serves. Indeed, unitary county hall could well end up in Barnstaple if one of the draft recommendations is accepted.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/13">If either of the recommendations is accepted, Torbay will be the smallest unitary authority in the south-west region, encircled by the largest unitary authority in the country. It will certainly not be in my constituents' interests to be overshadowed in this way and it would be a great injustice not to allow them even to participate in the process that brought it about.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/14">In a letter to the review manager from the elected mayor of Torbay and the chief executive, the point was made very clear that:</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/15" class="indent">&quot;No viable, long term solution for the local government structure for Devon can be considered without the implications of any proposal on Torbay and Plymouth.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/16">That should be straightforward and common sense, but clearly it is not happening. Torbay and Plymouth have effectively been excluded from the review, even though the review's final and accepted recommendations will have important implications for both those areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/17">The solution is to go back to the drawing board and start again from the grass roots up. If the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government wants to improve local government in Devon, the whole of Devon should be included in those improvements. She should return to the criteria, reform them and get the review right. Instead of displeasing all the people all the time, the Government should include all the people in determining changes to the delivery of their services. This is after all supposed to be local government, but &quot;local&quot; seems to be the one thing missing from this whole debacle.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-11a.257.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" speakername="Geoffrey Cox" colnum="257"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081111/halltext/81111h0011.htm#08111147000612">
	<p pid="a.257.1/1">I am pleased to have secured this debate on education funding in Torridge and West Devon, and in Devon more widely. It is a subject of considerable concern to many of my constituents. Over the past six months or so I have received an unprecedented number of representations from heads of small rural primary schools, as well as from parents, governors and teachers, about the position that they find themselves in as year by year their budget declines and what they have to do with it increases.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/2">The subject of my speech will be the manner in which the current dedicated schools grant is allocated. In 2007-08, Devon is 144th of 149 local education authorities in that regard. A Devon schoolchild receives &pound;410 less per year than the national average. Pupil numbers are falling: between 2006-07 and 2007-08 they fell by 800, which under the current formula meant a cut of &pound;2.8 million. When I have previously raised the extreme disparity between the amount a Devon schoolchild receives and the national average with the Minister for Schools and Learners, he has replied that the priority of Ministers is deprivation. He says that in Devon there are significantly fewer disadvantaged pupils according to Government criteria. This year 8.5 per cent. of Devon's dedicated schools grant is for disadvantaged pupils, against a national average of 12.1 per cent. That may be true of Devon as a whole, but it is not true of Torridge and West Devon.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/3">The borough of West Devon and the district of Torridge comprise the most disadvantaged areas of the county of Devon. West Devon is one of the most rural and sparsely populated areas of England. Just 0.4 people per hectare live in West Devon, compared with an English average of 3.77 people. Devon county council notes that while the county is perceived as being well below the average in suffering from deprivation, it actually has the fourth lowest average wage in the country. In Torridge and West Devon, we are in the bottom 10 for wages in the entire country. In West Devon the most recent available figures show, for example, that average annual earnings were only 63 per cent. of the average for England and Wales, and in Torridge the figure is even lower.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/4">Of the 80 parishes that were studied in a recent Exeter university project, 28 of the most disadvantaged parishes were in Torridge and 13 were in West Devon. That means that more than half of the most deprived rural areas are in my constituency. The indices of deprivation 2007 reveal that the extent of rural deprivation in the area is grim. Ten wards in Torridge and West Devon are among the top third of deprived areas in the country. The parish of Lydford, which is close to my home, is one of the most deprived rural wards in England, 9,231st in the rankings and lower than many deprived urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/5">Geographical deprivation is a particularly important factor in rural Devon and it has achieved significant notice in the media in recent months. In my constituency we have some of the most geographically deprived wards in the country. England is divided into more than 32,000 areas. In those areas, the wards of Bridestowe, Forest and Milton Ford are in the top 100 most geographically deprived areas in the country, while others such as Walden, Two Rivers and Broadheath are in the top 200. In total, 14 wards of Torridge and West Devon are in the top 500.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/6">Pupils in those circumstances are suffering the effects of a fundamentally misaligned system of grant allocation. The dedicated schools grant is calculated by multiplying the number of school and early years pupils by a standard rate. That rate is based on need as assessed in 2005-06. There are four additional elements: area cost adjustment, sparsity, additional educational need and high-cost pupils. I will come back to those, but the central theme of my remarks is that there has been a fundamental failure to recognise the extra costs of running a high number of smaller schools in large rural areas such as Torridge and West Devon and Devon as a whole. In addition, there has been a substantial rise in the number of children with special educational needs, which is unrecognised.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/7">Over the summer I visited many schools and met heads, teachers, parents and governors. They told me of the gradual erosion of the ability of those excellent schools to provide the education that the children deserve. They told me of the strain on heads, as they take on ever greater teaching responsibilities; of the cost of their strategy and leadership roles; of the suspension of library subscriptions; of the ever more thinly stretched time of teaching assistants; and of reductions in experienced staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/8">Some 129 schools in Devon local education authority have 100 pupils or fewer, so 40 per cent. of all schools in Devon have fewer than 100 pupils, and 72 per cent. of those schools are in rural areas. The local education authority has determined that even the smallest schools&mdash;those with 53 children or fewer&mdash;require a minimum of 2.6 full-time equivalent staff, 500 hours of administration and one mealtime assistant. There are 42 such schools in Devon, which is 13 per cent. of all primary schools, including a dozen in my constituency. The tasks of leadership of smaller schools is in many respects the same as in larger schools. The proliferation&mdash;the blizzard&mdash;of Government initiatives does not discriminate by pupil numbers and salaries have to reflect that.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/9">Each school, however small, must have a fixed cost regardless of the number of pupils. Tearchernet estimates that primary schools with between 80 and 100 pupils cost 16 per cent. more per pupil. That additional cost, which must grow as the number of pupils gets smaller, is simply not reflected in the current grant. The Minister may argue that those factors are taken into account by the sparsity element. I accept that around &pound;9 million this year is allocated to Devon on account of that factor, but she knows that the current sparsity index relies on data from the 1991 national census. In addition, the cost of smaller schools has almost certainly risen, not least because of the extra responsibilities of which I have spoken.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/10">The other day I heard a story that in the past few years Northumberland received less sparsity allowance than Birmingham. The current sparsity assessment does not reflect an ageing population or the scarcity of children, so we need to look again at how sparsity is assessed. It affects the cost of education in a large rural area in many ways. For example, if one is buying in support services, the support staff who come to provide those services will have to charge as an overhead the cost of travel to the school. There are a multitude of ways in which sparsity affects the cost of delivering education in a large rural area.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/11">I want the Minister to explain why it is that a Devon schoolchild receives &pound;410 less than the national average. If it is because of deprivation then I hope that I have illustrated that deprivation is as bad in parts of Devon as it is in many urban areas. Yet the smaller schools in those deprived and geographically deprived areas the ones that are suffering the effects of the crunch on their budgets.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/12">If the sparsity factor is intended to take account of the extra costs of running small schools&mdash;fixed costs that cannot be seriously reduced&mdash;surely it needs to be reviewed urgently. I know that a review is taking place, but adjustments must be made to reflect the number of small schools and the fact that children may be scarce, although in a county such as Devon, with an ageing population, the population may in fact be growing in certain areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/13">The sparsity factor clearly is not doing its job. As I visited schools during the summer, I was told stories by anxious parents who congregated in draughty halls to talk to me. They told me about coming in to maintain the fabric of the building because the school's budget was insufficient. I myself participated in a painting session at Meavy school in west Devon. The governors and I did the work because we could not afford to have somebody else do it&mdash;we had to do it ourselves. Parents, governors and teachers are truly worried. As I said, there is an unprecedented level of concern. Sparsity and the cost of running small schools must be reflected in the Government's allocation of grant funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/14">Another factor that I would urge the Minister to take into account is the considerable rise in the number of special educational needs children in Devon. In the summer of 2003, SEN children made up 14.4 per cent. of the total school population. By the summer of 2008, it was 20.9 per cent. The Minister may be aware that there has been a significant increase in the number of diagnoses of children who are on the autistic disorder spectrum, yet those vastly increasing numbers are not reflected in the dedicated schools grant. That is largely because the assessment of need was made prior to 2005-06, and the current dedicated schools grant is a spend plus grant. Therefore, all the assessments of need are locked in as of 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/15">That is one reason why the disparity exists, but I would be deeply grateful to the Minister if she could explain, although not in the habitual terms of Ministers who recite figures that we all know, how she would respond to an anxious parent or governor, or a strained head teacher, many of whom I have met this year. They are taking on an additional teaching load because they cannot afford to employ an experienced teacher, or even a teacher at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/16">The dedication and commitment of such people to primary school education in my constituency is unparalleled. The schools get excellent Ofsted reports, and the parents and governors are deeply committed to them. Such schools support small rural communities, and it is not an exaggeration to say that they are loved. They are an intrinsic part of the community and deliver an excellent education for children, particularly vulnerable children.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/17">How would the Minister explain to those people that, bit by bit, they are experiencing a painful erosion in their ability to do what they want to do for children, and to provide them with the best possible education? Costs mercilessly and remorselessly rise while budgets decline in real terms. The fabric of the buildings is deteriorating. Subscriptions cannot be taken out for the school library. Teachers have to take on extra responsibility. I urge the Minister to provide a real answer to those people through me, because although this debate is not well attended, I know that her words will be attended to most carefully, given the attention to the problem in my constituency and across Devon.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/18">I know about the current review of the dedicated schools grant. One assurance that I seek from the Minister today is that the special value of small rural schools will continue to be recognised. The Government created a presumption against their closure, which I welcomed. I hope that she will be able to say that it will continue&mdash;that small schools and the valuable benefit that they represent to communities and children will continue to receive emphasis in the Government's policy making. As well as emphasis and protection, however, small schools need Government support through funding, and that means a realignment of the dedicated schools grant to reflect some of the cost pressures of which I have spoken.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/19">If realignment is not carried out urgently, I gravely fear for the future of many&mdash;or certainly some&mdash;of the schools in my constituency and across Devon. That would be a catastrophe, because, as I have said, those schools provide an extraordinarily fine education. I should declare an interest: my own son, who was on the mild end of the autistic spectrum, received the most extraordinarily fine education from our local village school. It was caring, and it was provided in a small setting. Those on the autistic spectrum cannot deal with a large group or a big crowd of children. Therefore, in many cases, a small village school is ideal. I would like such education to fostered and nurtured, and provided for hundreds more children living in the rural areas that I represent.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/20">The expressions of concern that I received this summer were unprecedented. I almost received more requests for meetings than I could cope with from anxious head teachers, parents and governors. I would like education in small schools to be fostered and nurtured, but there is a deep sense of distrust and concern that the current review will not produce a realignment of funding and grant to enable them to prosper. Amalgamations and federations often do not work in dispersed rural areas because of the distance that one has to travel to collaborate. That is a problem with early years as well. If there is a large distance to travel, it is difficult for two or three villages that have to co-operate even to set up such a facility. What they really need is a recognition of the additional costs of such schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/21">I am grateful to the Minister for being here. I hope that I shall give her ample time to give my constituents, through me, a real answer. They and I know that education funding has risen. I have seen all the figures, and so have they. We know that in the past five or 10 years education budgets have risen in real terms, but so have costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/22">There is a high teaching cost in rural areas. For example, the area cost adjustment does not seem to include any cost adjustment for Devon that reflects the higher cost of employing teachers in rural areas. We want to know that the Minister and the Government are looking at the plight of small, often fragile and vulnerable rural communities and not discounting them because they are small. We must recognise that small schools form a crucial part of the education that is offered in this country, and that it is education of which we should be extremely proud.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-11a.261.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1766" speakername="Sarah McCarthy-Fry" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families"  colnum="261"  time="013:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081111/halltext/81111h0011.htm#08111147000613">
	<p pid="a.261.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" name="Geoffrey Cox">the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox)</phrase> on securing the debate. It is possible to tell from his comments that he is deeply involved with the issue and with representing his constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/2">Nothing could be more important than ensuring that every child, in every area, can go to a good school. As the hon. and learned Gentleman said, to achieve that, we have put unprecedented investment into our educational system. Our teachers are the best they have ever been&mdash;those are not my words, but the words of Ofsted. More than ever before, children and families are being put at the heart of everything we do, and services for them are at the heart of communities. Through academies and trusts, new school governance models have given local government and schools greater freedom to make the best use of the resources that are available to them to respond to local challenges and best serve the children and families in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/3">Local authorities are more in control of how their funding is allocated, and it is right that they are. It would not be right to impose central solutions to local problems. Local authorities are best placed to understand the needs of their communities and to allocate their funding accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/4">Nearly &pound;3 billion of funding is provided nationally for deprivation. We are aware that not all of it reaches the schools with the deprived pupils, so we are working with local authorities to ensure that funding provided for deprivation is being targeted to those pupils. The distribution of that funding is left to local discretion and Devon county council has consulted the Department to work out how to move funding in the local formula to such schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/5">As the hon. and learned Gentleman pointed out, Devon has received a year-on-year increase in school funding of 12.8 per cent. over the current three-year settlement to ensure that we can continue to build the best possible system for our young people. As he mentioned, we have set the funding for the next three years under the spend plus method, which has two principle advantages. First, every local authority is guaranteed an increase per pupil per year, with an obligation to pass on a minimum guaranteed increase per pupil to schools. Secondly, allocating funding over a three-year trajectory&mdash;currently from 2008 to 2011&mdash;has successfully given schools and local authorities greater stability and security in their allocations to ensure that they can plan ahead with certainty. Although that inevitably reflects historic patterns of distribution and spending, it has preserved in the baseline the additional funding above the old schools formula spending share, which many local authorities, including Devon, historically provided for their schools. For those reasons, we are confident that the funding levels first set in 2005-06 by the spend plus method have provided the right balance of funding for local authorities across the national picture. In addition, two thirds of respondents to our consultation last spring favoured retaining spend plus rather than switching to an updated version of the old SFSS.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/6">We must strive for excellence in education provision for every child and we must aim for consistently high standards, but it does not follow that funding, service provision or any other measure should be applied in exactly the same way across the country. If we are to close the gaps between the most disadvantaged and the rest, we need to invest in those areas, and those pupils, who need it most.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/7">In 2007, 36 per cent. of young people receiving free school meals achieved 5 A* to C GCSE passes compared with 63 per cent. of their better-off peers. That discrepancy is not acceptable. In the classroom, our teachers provide more intensive support to those pupils who are underachieving than they do to those who are charging ahead under their own steam. That is why we have introduced greater personalisation and flexibility into the curriculum, so that every child's needs are catered for, not just those of the fortunate few. Our funding streams must allow the same flexibility, so that we can target resources where they are most needed, while maintaining a consistent standard of education. With a guaranteed increase in spending per pupil over a long-term trajectory, the spend plus method has helped us to achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/8">We need to ensure that the system is keeping pace with the change and challenges that local authorities will face in future. We need to start thinking about that now to ensure a thoroughly thought-through system for 2011. That is why we launched a review of school funding in January to create a new formula that will commence directly after the current three-year settlement. The review will take into account a wide variety of views and research to develop a formula which continues to direct funding where it is needed, taking into account local priorities and costs. It will be targeted to raise the achievement of all pupils consistently across the national picture to reflect the changing needs of local areas and to support schools to be fully equipped for 21st-century learning. Priority factors in the review process will be the area cost adjustment, provision for high-cost pupils, special and additional educational needs and sparsity, which I will address later. We are inviting input into that process via the formula review group, which is currently gathering evidence for the review, and we will be opening work up for public consultation in 2010. I strongly encourage our partners in local government and schools, and other interested parties, to contribute to that process. The work of the review group will be available on the Department's Teachernet website.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/9">As the hon. and learned Gentleman has expressed, rural schools in sparsely populated areas remain a significant challenge to the local authority in Devon, and around the rest of the country, in making planning and allocation decisions. As he mentioned, we have recognised that in the current funding formula. In 2007-08, the dedicated schools grant contained almost &pound;188 million of funding for sparsity, of which Devon will receive &pound;9.14 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/10">We are determined to protect rural schools, because they are making an invaluable contribution to their local areas. The hon. and learned Gentleman can be confident that the review will take these issues into account. We already recognise the value of rural schools. As he said, earlier this year the Minister for Schools and Learners wrote to local authorities reminding them that we introduced a presumption against closure in 1998. That does not mean that we say that no rural school will ever close, but it is up to local authorities to ensure that the balance is managed properly against the presumption that we will close them.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/11">We want to see surplus places in rural primary schools used to broaden the services that schools offer. Our vision of the 21st-century school offers an opportunity to do that. We also want to see shared governance arrangements between small village schools as a means of addressing financial and educational challenges. Although the hon. and learned Gentleman said that that would not work in Devon, I recall that, at oral questions a few weeks ago, hon. Members who represent Somerset constituencies said that federations were working well in rural schools there.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/12">Our review will reflect our aim to protect rural schools, together with an assessment of the changing costs of rural schools over time. Some local authorities with many rural schools may decide to allocate more funding to their primary provision. That will be a matter for local determination, but as we develop the new funding formula, we will focus on building a strong system so that every school can operate to the best of its abilities to provide the highest possible standard of education to its young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/13">In the meantime, as our review progresses, we are providing support to schools and local authorities to help them make the most of their funding and resources. My Department has produced a package of measures, including a day's free consultancy advice for every school, combining educational and financial expertise, and a new interactive website that will serve as a gateway to existing guidance on improving value for money and as an ongoing means of support.</p>
