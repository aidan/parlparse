<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-15a.258.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1749" speakername="Bill Olner" colnum="258"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081015/halltext/81015h0001.htm#08101537000524">
	<p pid="a.258.0/1">Everyone in the delegation was a great ambassador, not only for the IPT but for the UK Parliament. I do think that the trip was important. It was non-political and formed a genuine basis on which we could learn better about how UK business operates and works in China and the rest of the world. I agree with my hon. Friend that that happens because of the sincerity of the relationship between the UK businesses that support the IPT and the fellows who get attached to them. I think that bond is very unique. We would be challenged if we tried to emulate it, because it has developed over many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/2">We were impressed by our visit to the Suzhou industrial park&mdash;a joint venture with Singapore. Following an agreement signed in 2002, funding was made available and within five years we saw a massive industrial park offering every facility to Chinese and international businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/3">We also learned about how China is handling climate change. BP China is at the forefront of investigating clean technology and has invested in a university-scale research unit that employs more scientists and climate change experts than I care to mention. Not only did we hear about its extensive research and development, which will produce remarkable results in reducing emissions, but about its skill in handling a major joint venture with China to shape a way forward for energy to serve a country of 1.5 billion people. I think that when the Chinese consider the scale of what is being done, and needs to be done, in their country, their position becomes apparent to them and they think, &quot;We might be China, and we might punch a bit, but there is a real big world out there that we need to know about.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/4">Having arrived shortly after the earthquake in Sichuan, we paid our sincere respects to all those who tragically died in that natural disaster and signed the book of condolences at the foreign ministry. The power of nature can make us realise how frail human beings are.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/5">As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1769" name="Mark Hendrick">the Member for Preston (Mr. Hendrick)</phrase> said, we were presented with an excellent overview of Chinese operations by PricewaterhouseCoopers. We also learned from Arup about eco-city initiatives and saw many of the magnificent earthquake-proof high buildings, which are very visible on the skyline. China is an earthquake region and major engineering is needed to ensure that buildings are safe. We also visited the consul and were advised by UK trade investors on their initiatives on UK investment in and out of China and the major Expo scheduled for 2010. Sadly, that has attracted little UK funding. Are we doing enough at ministerial level to provide aid and assistance to UK businesses, particularly in China?</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/6">Education was also a focus of our visit. British interests were represented in various joint ventures delivering high-quality secondary and higher education on a major scale. With the British Council, we visited the campuses of the universities of Nottingham and Liverpool and of Dulwich college to see how non-Chinese children can receive an international education and hopefully contribute in the future to China's fast-growing economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/7">While in Shanghai, I did my fellowship with GKN, and it was very good to witness the GKN experience in Shanghai. It was making automotive products for the Chinese automotive industry. Some of the my colleagues on that visit said that my face became a little more animated when I saw metal being cut and other things that I fully understood and was au fait with. I congratulate GKN and others on being able to move into that sphere and contributing to Chinese automotive industries.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/8">The purpose of today's debate is threefold. First, if they catch your eye, Mr. Illsley, it gives an opportunity for hon. Members to recount their experiences and impressions and to tell us what perceptions they formed on the visit. Secondly, I want it to raise awareness of what more British business could do in China, and how that could be helpful. I should be grateful if the Minister, even though he is new to his job, told us how important he thinks that relationship is.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/9">Thirdly, given the global crisis that we face, with Chinese sovereign reserves amounting to something like $1.8 trillion, we should foster our relationship with China and encourage it to invest more in British businesses. Global economies have changed a great deal in the past six months, and that makes it even more important that the UK is a major player in the global field of business in both China and the wider world.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-15a.259.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1631" speakername="Mark Prisk" colnum="259"  time="009:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081015/halltext/81015h0001.htm#08101537000526">
	<p pid="a.259.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Illsley. I start by warmly commending <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1749" name="Bill Olner">the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner)</phrase> for securing the debate and for his excellent leadership of the trip, in conjunction with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1930" name="Ben Chapman">the hon. Member for Wirral, South (Ben Chapman)</phrase>. Perhaps I should confirm that I was a member of the delegation, although I suspect you will have gathered that, Mr. Illsley. As a trustee, I was impressed by the organisation provided by the IPT's staff and by the wonderful support and involvement given by the companies that sponsored and supported the trip. It was immensely helpful to have UK businesses alongside us while we were in Shanghai.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/2">I am aware that a good number of colleagues wish to contribute, so I shall move quickly through three broad points that I hope will add to the debate. First, reflecting on our trip to Shanghai from a little distance, I note that China is not a single market. In business and politics, we tend to talk in shorthand as though it were one large, homogenous market, perhaps because the Han ethnic group makes up about 90 per cent. of the population, or because Mandarin tends to be the language that most UK businesses or politicians encounter. There is an assumption that there is a homogenous whole, but if one looks carefully, one sees that the continent is just as diverse as Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/3">Let us consider the north-south divide. In the south, cities such as Shanghai are fast moving and entrepreneurial. We saw that on our trip. Time and money matter there, as they do in many western cities. That is a crucial characteristic for such cities, and is one reason why Shanghai is the financial centre of China, although there may competition from Hong Kong in that regard. There is a cultural focus on entrepreneurship. However, when I talk to UK businesses, they tell me that their experiences in the north of the country&mdash;north of the Yangtze&mdash;are of a relatively slower and perhaps more bureaucratic way of dealing with business. That might be because Beijing, like Washington in the USA, is a corporate town and the corporation is government, making the culture somewhat different to that in Shanghai, Hong Kong or Shenzhen. It is important to understand that there is a difference between the areas to the north and south of the Yangtze.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/4">It is also important to remember, when thinking about whether China is a single market and at how businesses should approach it, the difference between the eastern seaboard and the rural hinterland. Roughly half of the 1.3 billion people in China live not in major urban centres or sprawling suburbs, but in the poorer and more remote towns and villages. We saw on our trip that there has been a huge migration of labour into the cities, with many such people working unofficially on construction sites. However, a substantial section of the population is not part of the economic revolution, perhaps because of their income level, location or age. From a business point of view, when thinking about the scale of that marketplace, it is worth remembering its characteristics and how it is differentiated.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/5">My second point is that China is not becoming a western nation, as might initially have appeared to be the case. It is simply becoming a modern nation. My first impressions of Shanghai were, I suspect, the same as those of most hon. Members present. It seemed remarkably like our western cities, with the shops and brand names, the people's adoption of western fashion, and even traffic jams. However, on talking to UK and local business people I realised that there are still vital differences to living and doing business there. I offer hon. Members a simple, but perhaps controversial, example. When we arrived at the hotel, a letter awaited us that set out the Government's rules and regulations governing use of the internet. I shall not test the patience of the House by giving all nine rules, but they included the following examples. When using the internet, one should not:</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Endanger China's unification of the country, territorial integrity and sovereignty... Betray China's national interests or endanger the security and honor of the country... Violate religious policy, publicize or promote any evil cult organisation... Spread rumors and disturb the social order and stability of the country&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/7">Those rules might seem strange, but they are not simply the demands of a one-party state. The character of rules such as the one about the country's honour, suggests something very different to our social norms.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/8">As I suspect my hon. Friends will realise, I am no expert on the teachings of Confucius, but it seems to me that certain values that are distinctly different to our own remain central to the people of China. We believe in democracy and freedom of the individual, whereas they instinctively respect their rulers and always put family first. We believe in equality before the law, whereas they have far more regard for the quality of the ruler. Even with the upheaval of huge migration between rural and urban areas, there is still a strict hierarchy of relationships in China that shapes every family, business, community and political organisation. What we might perceive as subservience, they regard as respect. The paramount importance of face, or mianzi, matters greatly to every person, business and part of that nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/9">On my trips to Shanghai and to Hong Kong the previous year, I saw that things are changing. One interesting dynamic is what changes will come of the &quot;Little Emperor&quot; generation. Children grow up with considerable demands on them, but they also have considerable opportunity and might become more self-centred than their parents. If we look across the piece, British businesses that want to succeed in China will continue to need to understand the distinct values of that nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/10">My third point is that UK plc needs to do better. As I have said, I have been to both Hong Kong and Shanghai in the past 18 months, and I have been immensely impressed by many of the UK players whom I have met, such as the team at BP. I am sure that hon. Members will agree that they showed a long-term vision and professionalism that could match any competing company in the world. Other companies that are leading players, such as GKN and Arup, command immense respect in China. However, I fear that the overall effort of UK plc is not working as well as it might. Although our exports to China have grown, French exports have grown at twice the rate of ours, and German exports at three times the rate. In my discussions with businesses in Shanghai and subsequently, I have met several people who believe that the UK's official representation is not as effective as it should be.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/11">One of the problems is the unnecessary duplication of effort by Government agencies&mdash;the peculiarity of having different offices in different parts of Shanghai that often go to the same meetings and pitch for the same opportunities. The regional development agencies and UK Trade and Investment should not be jostling with each other for the same business. There should be one strong team working for the whole country, pooling resources and operating in each of the key cities. I would be particularly interested to hear the Minister's response to that point, given that the former Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform made it clear, quite rightly, that he wanted to see that duplication ended.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/12">Equally, there is evidence to suggest that some of the original dynamism of the China-Britain Business Council has been lost and that British businesses and politicians are not getting in to see the right people in the Government at the right time. That problem was much commented on. I hope improvements have been made. If it can be demonstrated that things have changed, that would be fantastic; if it cannot, urgent work is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/13">The opening up of China and the rapid expansion that that has created is a great opportunity for businesses in this country. We already have world-class players there&mdash;people who are regarded highly in China because they have taken the time to understand the markets and the people with whom they are working&mdash;yet UK plc is falling behind. Politicians in government and the business world generally need to realise that China is not a single market, but a continent of different cities and peoples and a truly segmented marketplace. We need to strengthen and unify our presence on the ground. Indeed, as the global economy turns down, we must become even more competitive. Our trip last May certainly helped me to understand the opportunity and challenges before us &mdash;I suspect that the same is true for other hon. Members&mdash;and I hope that it will inform Government policy in the coming months.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-15a.262.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1930" speakername="Ben Chapman" colnum="262"  time="009:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081015/halltext/81015h0001.htm#08101537000527">
	<p pid="a.262.0/1">May I first refer to my entry in the Register of Members' Interests? I am delighted that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1749" name="Bill Olner">the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner)</phrase> has secured the debate. As chairman of the all-party China group, I was delighted to join him in leading the delegation and contributing to it. The all-party China group has nearly 500 members, and it is vastly important that all parliamentarians and not only members of the group are aware of the scale, speed and nature of change in China. There is simply insufficient knowledge on China, not only among the general public, but among parliamentarians. I try to take a delegation of around 10 Members to China each year, but even assuming the group's membership of 500 did not change, it would take me 50 years to get through the list, so I will lose no opportunity to get hon. Members to see and believe what is happening in China, and particularly in Shanghai. It is also particularly important that visits are as focused as ours was on the specific issue of British business in China.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/2">I congratulate the staff of the IPT on their work and initiative. I would like to join the other members of the delegation who have already spoken in thanking all those who received us and helped us on both the British and Chinese sides. We have not yet mentioned Virgin, which was helpful, not only in getting us to China, but in briefing us on the issues that it and other companies face there. Overall, we could scarcely have received a more rounded view of the issues and opportunities of the business environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/3">When I first went to China in 1986 as commercial counsellor, it was a very different place from the China we see now. It was a country of Mao suits and bicycles, and doing business was pioneering and difficult. Commercial practice and law was not as we know it, negotiations were a special art form and intellectual property issues were problematic at best. However, many of the companies we saw in Shanghai in May were in China before I went in 1986, which is a fulsome demonstration of their commitment to the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/4">For many years China was the biggest potential market in the world. It took a number of years for the actuality to arrive, but now that it has we can see that in rounded terms the Chinese economy has grown at about 10 per cent. per annum since 1978. My maths is not so good, but I know that that is a lot of growth. It is a phenomenon that has changed the shape of the world. It is clear that an organisation that is in business in any serious way needs to be part of what is happening there.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/5">The perception of China has been changing ambiguously over the years, from booming market to challenging competitor. For many years it was regarded as an exporter of deflation, but more recently it has been regarded not only as a good place to do business, but as an exporter of inflation and a voracious consumer of raw materials and other goods for which the rest of the world has a need.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/6">Attention has long been focused on China's human rights record, pollution, its role in Africa and its challenge in other markets. Despite the image at the time of the Olympic torch, the prevailing image of China is of an economic powerhouse, as exemplified in Shanghai, and the nation that produced the most sensational and successful Olympic games. China has for some years been an attractor of foreign direct investment and is increasingly an outward investor. Of course, China is not standing alone. If one looks at the east, one is looking at India, Vietnam, the Asian dragons and tigers and the old economies of Korea and Japan. The sum of that is that the world is becoming oriental rather than occidental. It means that the economic centre of gravity is moving eastwards, and the political centre of gravity with it. That has profound implications for all that we do in relation to China.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/7">China has been the pac-man effect in action, and becoming part of it has been an imperative and not an option. Whether the biggest challenge for us would be China's continuing success and growth or its relative slowing-down and failure&mdash;not that one can look at it in those terms&mdash;has long been an interesting question.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/8">As we saw in May, any reference to China as the workshop of the world simply fails to capture the incredible and rapid changes taking place within its borders and limits the nature of Sino-British partnership. We would be unwise to ignore, for example, the implications of a vast and growing Chinese middle class that would potentially consist of more than 500 million consumers by 2025. As we have said, British industry is very much aware of those opportunities. As science and technology take centre stage within the Chinese Government's strategy for sustainable development, so a space has opened for expertise and experience in that area. Perhaps a prime example of that is Arup's involvement in the Dongtan eco-city close to Shanghai.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/9">The build-up to the Beijing games gave us many opportunities, and British firms were able to play a part in many sectors, such as the provision of temporary power for Olympic facilities, the design of the &quot;Bird's Nest&quot; stadium, representing the British Olympics organising committee and the design of the magnificent terminal 3 building at Beijing airport. Those are but a few examples. It would be impossible in the time available to represent the range and diversity of opportunities and the successes that we have achieved in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/10">Although we can celebrate the strength of the Sino-British economic partnership, we must be careful to avoid complacency. We are told that the UK is Europe's largest investor in China, but we should be aware, echoing the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1631" name="Mark Prisk">the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk)</phrase>, that in 2006 the net investment in China by British businesses fell compared with 2005. Furthermore, we should remember that that investment is dominated by a few companies, notably the oil companies. If we are to maintain an upward trajectory, and continue to capitalise on Chinese economic expansion, we must think about China with even greater interest and commitment than that which we have previously reserved for the US and Europe. Our trade deficit in Chinese goods, again reflecting the point made by the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford, was &pound;12 billion in 2006, and it continues to grow. At the same time, China was our 13th most important destination for goods, and 20th on the list for our services. That simply is not good enough when we consider that China is positioned to become the world's largest economy within two decades.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/11">It is a courageous man who will speculate how China is affected by the current global economic crisis, and on present form it is not clear. On the latest statistics, our trade continues to grow, but it will certainly be affected, as will China's growth&mdash;still between 9 and 10 per cent.&mdash;as it is hit by what is happening in the wider global economy. There is a minimum economic growth level that China must maintain in order to maintain social cohesion, given the absence of a sophisticated social security net, growing aspiration among the Chinese people and, notwithstanding the one-child-per-family policy, population growth. At this stage, while China sees economic turmoil as principally a western phenomenon, its exposure to problem assets cannot be assessed. Some factories are affected and some are closing. Basic production in steel, for example, is being cut.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/12">China is making its contribution to a global solution and, like the west, is cutting interest rates. While having a relatively closed financial market, the Chinese economy will be affected. However, the supertanker effect&mdash;I am sorry to be so corny&mdash;is in play, as is the level of technological development, so the effect will probably be relative and China will remain in global terms an attractive place to do business. This is not a time to switch resources or attention from our business with China.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/13">The second question I want to deal with, which has not been raised as much since stock markets started to rise again, is whether China will use its massive foreign exchange reserves and sovereign funds to buy up our assets at knock-down prices, and whether that would be a good thing. China has been an increasingly responsible global and regional player, both financially and politically. It played an extremely important leadership role in the Asian financial crisis and it will do so now. Thus far, to the best of my knowledge, it has used its sovereign funds in equity investment and in banks, which hon. Members might be surprised to learn, among other things. China also recognises its responsibilities and its lack of knowledge in running business. We have long sought Chinese investment and in the current climate we will want more. After all, it was a Chinese company that relaunched auto production at Longbridge.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/14">The role of British business in China is crucial, but the Government are always central to achieving its aims, and the resources that they devote to this end must reflect both the scale of the challenge and the aspirations of industry. Our trade and investment team total 91 full-time equivalent staff in China to promote the interests of British goods and services there. That has increased by a quarter since 2005, which is obviously a step in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/15">I pay tribute to the China-Britain Business Council, which does excellent work in China for British companies, and to its current and past chairmen. As a nation, however, despite our task forces, prime ministerial and high-level visits, we still have not sufficiently moved on from an &quot;us and them&quot; relationship to one of greater partnership. We still treat China as if it was just another country, albeit an important one, but the fact is that the world has changed and we need to take account of that. We have not sufficiently changed our institutions or our attitudes to take account of the new global centre of gravity and the historic shift. We must do more.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.2/1">The hon. Gentleman makes the point better than I would be able to, and I agree with everything he said. We are not making as much as we could of existing possibilities. Enforcement issues, consistent implementation of intellectual property rights, market access, red tape and subsidies to domestic companies all continue to feature among the barriers to doing business in the market. Such concerns need to be fully addressed in order to support UK exports and investments. We really could and should be doing better. My goodness, having visited Shanghai, I can understand why the Americans are slightly fearful of the competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/2">I shall end with just a few remarks about the Essex-Jiangsu partnership. As all hon. Members know, Essex is the finest county in the country, and it always leads the way. The Essex-Jiangsu partnership has been running since 1988 and was formalised in 1992 by Lord Hanningfield, who just celebrated 10 years as a Member of the House of Lords. It was established with the overall goal of developing firm and long-term bonds with Jiangsu province and creating a harmonious relationship between Essex and China, and it has indeed done that.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/3">The partnership aims to give practical support from the Jiangsu authorities to the county's exporters, and to attract inward investment to Essex. The relationship has already produced great benefits for the county. In 2006, 30 businesses, including three Essex companies that have since set up operations in the province, were helped to find opportunities in Jiangsu.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/4">Thirty-five Essex schools are actively engaged in curriculum links with Jiangsu schools, and a group of 12 primary and secondary schools has pioneered a successful drive to promote the teaching of Mandarin in Essex. Many teachers from Essex schools have already visited schools in Jiangsu and partnership links are developing.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/5">The county council is aiming for the partnership to be recognised as the most productive relationship between a British local authority and a Chinese provincial government by 2010. Two years ahead of 2010, I am prepared to announce that it is the most successful relationship.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/6">Essex county council is also holding a cultural festival to celebrate its 20-year partnership with Jiangsu province. Hundreds of celebratory events are taking place up to March 2009. This is a prime example of the kind of pro-active, innovative approach to Chinese education and trade links needed in all parts of the UK and, as ever, Essex leads the way.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/7">If we are talking about second languages in our schools, let us encourage Mandarin. It is a difficult language, and most of us have trouble speaking English, let alone a foreign language, but let us encourage people to speak Mandarin. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1631" name="Mark Prisk">the Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk)</phrase> said earlier, let us try to make the most of our opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/8">I visited Shanghai zoo and I am determined that we secure a couple of pandas for London zoo&mdash;whether they will be leased or rented to us I do not know&mdash;and a couple for Colchester zoo.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/9">This was a fun trip, but every member of the delegation would agree that it was worthwhile. I already had an image of China, but the trip changed my perception. What a wonderful country China is and what wonderful opportunities it provides for each and every one of us, particularly in these challenging times.</p>

	<p pid="a.266.1/1">I thank my hon. Friends the Members for Nuneaton and Shanghai (Mr. Olner) and for Wirral, South and Beijing (Ben Chapman) for the way that they masterfully looked after us in Shanghai. It was by some way the best trip I have ever been on. It was the best prepared trip&mdash;we had a number of seminars, language tuition and a marvellous pre-run before we got there.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.1/2">Everyone has said &quot;Well done&quot; to the Industry and Parliament Trust and I commend it for its utter professionalism, which was outstanding. I, too, have done an IPT fellowship: mine was with Motorola 10 years ago. Motorola was the first company in America to be in China, 25 years ago. That was a hard call.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.1/3">I was pleased to be in Shanghai, having been brought up in Hong Kong. It was good to see, in a sense, a second side of the Chinese face.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.1/4">Some of the presentations that we received were outstanding. I still remember the BP presentation on intellectual property. The Chinese have struggled with that, but they are trying to get to grips with it, and BP is taking a global lead on that with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.1/5">I share hon. Members' reservations about whether we are really clued-in to what is going on in China. I ask the Minister to set up a China council on the same level as the National Economic Council on the credit crunch that we are considering at the moment, because I do not think that Departments understand what is going on. If the 19th century was the British century for the world and the 20th century was America's, last week the 21st century became the Chinese century. China has $3 trillion of reserves, which is much more than the Federal Reserve has and certainly more than the Bank of England and Frankfurt have. This is the changing of the guard and we were lucky to just be on the edge of it in May and June.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.1/6">A totally new approach is required. I shall try to illustrate that by looking at our Foreign Office representation. In China, we have one embassy and four consulates for a population of 1.3 billion. In India, we have one high commission, three deputy high commissions and three trade offices for a population of 1.2 billion. In America, we have one embassy and seven consulates for a population of 302 million. In Europe, we have 27 embassies and nine consulates general for a population of just under 500 million. That works out, in representation terms, as one embassy or consulate in China per 260 million people and, in India, one in 172 million. That is completely wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.1/7">We are so out of&mdash;I cannot think what the word is. We have misread the tea leaves about China and India at every level of Government in this country. We have done some good things in India&mdash;for example, we set up the UK India Business Council, and the UK-India education and research initiative to look at universities exchanging students and courses and trying to build relationships&mdash;but we have not done that in China.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.1/8">I hope that, out of this&mdash;although it is too early for the Minister to comment&mdash;comes the recognition that we need to have a proper all-engaging discussion about what we do about China. The events of the past two weeks have been so profound that I am not confident that we get it. That was one of the good things about going on the trip: not only was there terrific fellowship from all parties, but it was good fun and hard work and, because we were well prepared, we got so much more out of it than has been the case on previous visits.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.1/9">One of many statistics given in a presentation threw me completely: 80 new cities of 5 million people each will be built in China over the next 10 years. That means 400 million new houses and other buildings, including schools and hospitals, as well as roads and goodness knows what. The demand for British product would be absolutely enormous, but where are we? We are behind Germany and France already.</p>

	<p pid="a.268.1/1">I agree. At the same time that that city has been built, we have had the Thames Gateway proposals. I am at the edge of that at Sittingbourne and Sheppey, but I can tell hon. Members that we will have still have the Thames Gateway in another 20 years and not much will have moved. A fundamental shift in thinking is required and China is leading the way, although it has borrowed, largely from Singapore. There are models out there that we can use, but for some reason we are becoming more isolationist in our thinking, which, in a global environment, unnerves me.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/2">Those 80 new cities built over the next 10 years will, with a combined population of 400 million, have twice the population of Britain, France, Germany and Italy. We have to get our minds round the staggering economic change that is going to happen in China.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/3">There were many highlights to the visit, but I should like to pay tribute to my favourite architect, I. M. Pei. We were privileged to see his new, beautifully designed, elegant, sensitive museum in Suzhou. He has done that while finishing the new cultural museum in Doha. I do not know where he finds the time: he is only 91. I sense that the museum in Suzhou will be his last ever commission. It was wonderful to meet his daughter and to spend time walking round the building. As somebody who loves architecture, I would not have missed it.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.1/4">I want the Minister&mdash;although he may not be able to say anything about it now&mdash;to galvanise his Department to go to No. 10 and create a China council.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-15a.268.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1769" speakername="Mark Hendrick" colnum="268"  time="010:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081015/halltext/81015h0002.htm#08101537000535">
	<p pid="a.268.2/1">I start, as my colleagues did, by paying tribute to the excellent work of the IPT. Sally Muggeridge and her team did a great deal to prepare us for this visit. I also thank the firms that sponsored the visit, including PricewaterhouseCoopers, Virgin and many others.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/2">My interest in the visit came from two perspectives. First, my background before becoming a politician was in engineering and science, and seeing how China has developed industrially and technologically was of great interest to me. My other area of interest, which sparked my fascination with China, is education. My first visit to Shanghai just over two years ago was to two universities that were working closely with the university of Central Lancashire in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/3">The university of Central Lancashire has more than 1,000 students from mainland China, one of whom, I am sorry to say, sadly died last week in an accident when he was hit by a bus when on a bicycle in Preston. I send my condolences to that student's family. Many students from China are in Preston studying at UCLan. Many are spending two years in China and one year in Preston to obtain a bachelor's degree, and many are doing two plus two to obtain a master's degree in a variety of subjects. Two and a half weeks ago, I was fortunate to attend the opening of the Confucius centre at the university of Central Lancashire in Preston with the Chinese vice-consul, who came from Manchester to attend the opening. My constituency and its university have many ties, and I have many interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/4">When visiting China with the delegation, I was impressed to see that other educational institutions, such as Liverpool university and Nottingham, have a presence there with my university. I spoke to two young students from Liverpool university about their experience, which was reminiscent of mine 26 or 27 years ago, when I had a placement in Germany. The two students from Liverpool were studying in China and now see the world from a different perspective, in which China is becoming a major player.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/5">To draw a parallel with my experience, I trained as an engineer 27 years ago in Germany. I had learnt the language and a great deal about the history of Germany and its people at a time when the Common Market was developing into the European Community and what we have now with the Berlin wall down&mdash;a European Union of 27 member states. What we have now in China, partly through the engagement with Singapore and the Government of Lee Kwan Yew at the time, is an opening up over the past 20 years, with huge technological advancement, huge technological investment and huge educational investment. Much of the value that we export to China is education, not only from my local university, but from other universities that I have mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/6">To put into perspective what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1819" name="Derek Wyatt">the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Derek Wyatt)</phrase> said, China has as many people studying for PhDs&mdash;not just bachelor's degrees&mdash;as we have in the population of this country. One realises why, as my hon. Friend said, in the next 80 or 90 years, China will play a role in the world that America played during the last century and Britain played during the century before that. There are great challenges ahead and great opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/7">My newly ennobled Friend Baron Mandelson of Hartlepool and Foy and the Minister have a big responsibility on their shoulders to ensure that Britain can work with our European partners to create the sort of market and economy that can compete with the challenges facing us from China. There are many opportunities, and British business could benefit from working with our Chinese friends and partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/8">I have referred to the scale of the development at Suzhou, which is breathtaking. We are doing a little in this country to improve matters, and I had the pleasure last week of visiting Daresbury laboratory in Cheshire, which has become a science and innovation centre in the north-west. I spent six years working there as an electronics design engineer before coming into full-time politics. That institution should have had the Diamond project, but I shall not re-enact old battles. Nevertheless, it is developing leading-edge research facilities and the innovation that will drive many of the products and services that this country needs to compete with countries such as China, but that is happening on a much smaller scale than what we witnessed during our visit.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/9">We need more investment in education, and science and technology. We have the expertise, the drive and the institutions, but we obviously do not have the population to provide the number of engineers and scientists to bring about that major competition. We can achieve that only through greater co-operation and, I dare say, integration with the European Union. Apart from competition, we can work together with China. We can co-operate through business and the technological links that we are developing. We can work together culturally through education and institutions such as the Confucius institute my constituency and others throughout the country. We can work together politically through visits such as that organised by the IPT, and Government-to-Government relations, which are also important.</p>

	<p pid="a.270.0/1">I have only one or two brief points to make, because my colleagues have made their points eloquently about the importance of the visit.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.0/2">I shall not compliment IPT more than to say that the trip was the hardest-working one that I have ever been on, and the most fun, because, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1819" name="Derek Wyatt">the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Derek Wyatt)</phrase> said, we were properly prepared. That is not always the case with such visits. I thank all those who were involved making the trip work by doing so much advance work with us, so that we understood what we were seeing when we got out there.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.0/3">One of the great benefits of the visit was that Labour Members did not have to be present to hear the result of the Crewe and Nantwich by-election, although it came through with great speed. Conservative Members made no bones about relishing the majority that was secured for the time being in that by-election.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.0/4">I was interested in the question of information technology and its liberalising or restrictive effect. We continue to need to work with the Chinese in that area, or they might go as far as insisting that everyone with a television requires a licence from the Government to watch it. We would not want to go in that direction, would we, Mr. Illsley?</p>
	<p pid="a.270.0/5">My final and more serious point is that we were asked by our hosts whether we would like to see an industrial park. I was up for that because I have an industrial park in my constituency that provides around 1,000 jobs, so I am very proud of it and we work hard to keep it. The industrial park in China had 6 million people living inside it. When we visited the university, I said that it was good to have a university inside the park, and my host said that it was one of 10.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.0/6">I went home to my constituency in Nottingham, where we have 31,000 people on incapacity and related benefits. The experience of being in China and seeing the pace at which things are moving, and comparing that with what was happening in my constituency, before the financial crisis, was sobering. I am not necessarily pessimistic, but all of us and particularly those of us who are in Government or who aspire to Government must learn certain lessons. We need to learn about long-term financial stability and long-term planning and about not looking at the next quarter's results, but the next decade's results. We need to invest for the future. It might be that we do that in a different way, but some of the fundamental lessons are to be learnt from China and we ignore them at our peril. There are tremendous advantages to looking at the long term, and part of that means looking for long-term partnerships with the Chinese Government, so that we can all benefit from a different regime and a different global economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.0/7">I thank my colleagues for their tremendous fellowship on the journey and all those responsible for making it such a success. I am certainly one of those whose eyes were opened. I relished visiting a beautiful country and meeting some marvellous people.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-15a.279.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1609" speakername="Derek Twigg" colnum="279"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081015/halltext/81015h0004.htm#08101537000544">
	<p pid="a.279.1/1">I raised this debate to put the spotlight on the Rugby Football League's decision of <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-22">22 July 2008</phrase> to reject the application made by Widnes Vikings for a licence to secure entry to super league for the 2009 to 2011 seasons. It might surprise some supporters in Widnes that I have not spoken on the matter before, but having recently ceased to be a Minister, I now have the opportunity for such a debate, which I welcome. It was my decision, made on my initiative, to introduce this debate&mdash;it had nothing to do with Widnes rugby league football club.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/2">I should make it clear that although I see some merit in the super league licence system, I am unconvinced that it is the right way to go for the game in this country. I have always been and I remain firmly of the view that there should be a system of promotion and relegation. I am in favour of super league expansion, but that should not happen at the expense of heartland clubs such as Widnes.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/3">This has been a sad episode in the club's long and illustrious history. Widnes rugby union club was established in 1873 and was a founding member of rugby league's northern union in 1895. Since 1920, the club has boasted numerous Lancashire cup and Challenge cup titles, three championship titles and the coveted world club championship. A super league member from 2002, the club was relegated in 2005. In the following two years, it narrowly missed out on promotion to super league; however, the club was beset by financial problems and went into temporary administration. Salvation came in the form of local business man Mr. Steve O'Connor. He purchased the club in November 2007, injecting &pound;1.3 million of investment to reinvigorate the Vikings with new facilities, logo and management structure&mdash;he became chairman&mdash;in preparation for the super league licence bid. That unfortunately came to an end when the RFL announced the 14 successful applicant teams, which did not include the Widnes Vikings.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/4">In Widnes, there is a widely held view that the RFL has an inherent dislike of the Widnes club because of something that went on in the past that no one can quite fathom. To back that up, Widnes supporters point to the club's inexplicable exclusion from the inaugural super league in 1996 and the fact that the club was relegated in 2005 to allow the Catalan Dragons into super league. The treatment of the club in relation to the super league licence further reinforced the view that the RFL has it in for Widnes.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/5">As a long-standing Widnes Vikings supporter, I have been impressed by the new energy and enthusiasm surrounding the club, and its dynamic and professional approach. The club's board, staff and players have been commended for the way in which they have taken full advantage of the O'Connor-Stobart investment and the successful partnership with Halton borough council to modernise the club. I have seen the excellent facilities and the hard work that they have produced, ranging from the new players' gym and treatment rooms and a new media club room, to better seating in the stadium and impressive innovations in electronic ticketing, marketing and community activities. Further achievements include the new website, fans forum and updated merchandising and season ticket sales.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/6">I firmly believe that the RFL shifted the goalposts when assessing Widnes Vikings's application, rejecting it on the basis not of its specified criteria but on a pre-determined bias against the club's recent financial past. In doing so, I believe that it brought the entire franchise system into disrepute. I am sure that the Minister will appreciate that that has led to massive disappointment, frustration and anger within the local community in Widnes and in my Halton constituency, and I will welcome his comments on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/7">Despite the club's highly successful record and its state-of-the-art modern facilities, which are further enhanced by new investment, the RFL rejected Widnes Vikings's super league licence application, mainly because of its recent financial past, despite previous reassurances to the contrary. That is a key point. The application was rejected even though the club felt that it had complied fully with the application criteria for a super league licence, and was led to believe that its recent liquidation status would not impinge on its application.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/8">In post-<phrase class="date" code="2008-07-22">22 July</phrase> discussions with the Rugby Football League, chairman Steve O'Connor was told that his turnaround of the Widnes Vikings was not of sufficient duration for the RFL to be confident of the club's long-term viability. That was despite Steve O'Connor's personal cash bond offer of &pound;500,000&mdash;that is important&mdash;to ensure the solvency of Widnes Vikings over the three years of the super league licence period. I am not aware that any other club offered such a guarantee.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/9">Appearing on the Sky Sports rugby league &quot;Boots 'n' All&quot; programme on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-23">23 July</phrase>, the RFL executive chairman Richard Lewis denied giving any prior assurance to Steve O'Connor regarding the administration situation in response to a fan's e-mail question. When questioned by interviewer Eddie Hemmings, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/10" class="indent">&quot;The insolvency issue played a significant part&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/11">In a reply to a letter that I sent on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-29">29 July</phrase>, Mr. Lewis stated on <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-05">5 August</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/12" class="indent">&quot;Their financial background was a major factor and this was always going to be the case&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/13">However, in the very next sentence, Mr. Lewis wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/14" class="indent">&quot;it was perfectly possible for Widnes to be awarded a licence and without revealing any confidentialities, they did finish well ahead of several other clubs&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/15">I am not 100 per cent. sure what that means, but it raises a concern. That prompts the question: if the granting or otherwise of a super league licence was determined by the club's recent insolvency, why was it allowed to bid on the basis of other criteria, which the club, in my view, more than fulfilled? That is a key point.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/16">At the time of the proposed O'Connor takeover of the club, I rang Richard Lewis with three aims in mind: first, to tell him my views on the O'Connor proposal and the current local situation; secondly, to ask the RFL not to impose too harsh a penalty on Widnes; and thirdly, to clarify whether Widnes would be allowed to bid for a super league licence. I was assured that the club would be allowed to do so and that any application would be judged solely on its merits. To this day, the RFL has provided no substantive evidence to explain why, against its own criteria, Widnes Vikings was refused a super league licence, other than its past financial situation. However, if that was always going to be a problem, why was the club allowed to bid?</p>

	<p pid="a.282.0/1">I want to back up my hon. Friend and say that, historically, the criteria for promotion&mdash;this was certainly true when I was involved in rugby league and a member of the council&mdash;included a requirement for grounds to meet certain standards. Those standards were enshrined within rugby league. It was about improving the grounds for the future of the game. It has always been the case that the grounds were part of the criteria for a club to get promotion. A club might win the championship, but that did not automatically mean entry into super league. Part of the entry was that a club had to have minimum ground standards. I totally agree with my hon. Friend that Widnes' standards are beyond everyone else's. Does he agree with me that it might be better if we accepted Widnes as an extra team, as part of the family. All families grow. Let us grow it by one more club and put Widnes within super league.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-15a.282.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1609" speakername="Derek Twigg" colnum="282"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081015/halltext/81015h0005.htm#08101537000548">
	<p pid="a.282.1/1">I endorse what my hon. Friend says. Given the quality of the Widnes Vikings' bid, it beggars belief that the super league did not increase to 15 clubs. We have had no real explanation for that. It should have happened, given the comments that I have had from Richard Lewis about the quality of Widnes' bid. With regard to the other clubs, I am for expansion of the game, but I am not sure about the Crusaders' bid given the low base of their support. Their away support is almost minuscule, they are relatively new and the ground is of a completely different standard to the Widnes Vikings' ground. How could their bid outdo that of the Widnes Vikings? I will leave that for others to discuss at a later date.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/2">As my hon. Friend mentioned, if the bid was judged against the current ground, it would appear that the existing stadium fails to meet the minimum standards. I am referring to the situation in Wakefield. Furthermore, the requirement for the home stadium strategy in the super league application form states:</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Home stadium is of a standard to be expected of a premier international sporting competition in the 21st century.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/4">At the end, it states:</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/5" class="indent">&quot;It is anticipated that any club planning or embarking on new stadium builds or significant improvements to current facilities will not satisfy this criteria.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/6">Again, that seems to be a contradiction. I do not think that they can have it both ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/7">It is encouraging to note that solidarity with Widnes Vikings has been expressed across the country, not least in Yorkshire itself. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-24">24 July</phrase>, in an article entitled &quot;Licence farce is a dark day for the RL,&quot; reporter James Roberts of the <i>Halifax and Calderdale Evening Courier </i>delivered a stinging verdict on the RFL's handling of the entire process, pointing primarily to the rejection of a super league licence for Widnes as his central argument. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/8" class="indent">&quot;In the end, the Super League licence process turned out to be exactly what its critics feared: a giant carve up of the kind you simply would not experience in any other sport. Before anyone starts, my cynicism is not born out of Halifax's rejections.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/9">He continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/10" class="indent">&quot;No, my sympathy lies with the people of Widnes, who have been mugged by the game's powerbrokers for the third time in a little over a decade. The Vikings missed the original Super League cut in 1996, were relegated to make way for Catalans three years ago and have now been tossed aside once again, despite having a case for inclusion that was arguably more compelling than a handful of other competitors. To summarise: Widnes have the ground, heritage, a solid fan base, the development set up and the money.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/11" class="indent">In the debit column was their flirtation with administration last year, before the arrival of transport mogul Steve O'Connor and his millions. The Vikings certainly weren't expecting that to hamper them though. Even as they fought out Sunday's 26-26 thriller at the Shay, the club's hierarchy were utterly convinced of their own success. With some justification too.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/12" class="indent">The Rugby Football League's own assessment of the 19 bids&mdash;which incidentally contains more holes than the proverbial Swiss cheese&mdash;highlights the fact that Tuesday's big winners, Salford and Celtic, have poor ground facilities. And poor old Widnes? Well, I'm still no nearer to understanding that one. I have never made any secret of the fact that I fundamentally disagree with the franchise system. But if we're going to do it, let's at least do it fairly.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/13">Mr. Roberts has this damning conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/14" class="indent">&quot;At this moment in time, it is difficult to avoid the impression that the RFL picked the 14 clubs, on grounds of geography, a couple of years ago and have been acting out a long-winded pantomime ever since.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/15">In undermining the entire super league licence process with the get-out that it could ignore the criteria it set down and make discretionary decisions outside the process, the RFL has effectively played fast and loose with the entire scheme. At the end of the day, in seemingly moving the goalposts for super league licence approval and showing a breathtaking and arbitrary disregard for its own criteria, the RFL has made a mockery of the entire process from the outset.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/16">Throughout the whole process, Mr. Steve O'Connor and his dedicated team at Widnes Vikings have demonstrated a forward-looking, get-on-with-the-job-and-not-go-about-sulking approach that speaks volumes about the professional integrity and the characters of those involved. I pay tribute to Mr. O'Connor and the staff and players at Widnes for their professionalism and the way in which they have borne this terribly disappointing news.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/17">Halton council was well ahead of the game in ensuring that its rugby league club had a modern stadium with excellent facilities in which to play. The stadium also hosts other sports, including the north-west's regional table tennis centre. I ask the Minister what message it sends to other local authorities that are putting in massive investment and championing their key sporting institutions if Halton is treated in such a way?</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/18">In conclusion, Widnes Vikings are under new leadership and have the resources to go forward. They have a fantastic modern stadium&mdash;as we have been hearing about&mdash;a solid and sizeable fan base with a clear potential to grow, an excellent community development and marketing strategy and they have in place the necessary people and resources to develop young players.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/19">I also want to mention Widnes' large away support. Some of the local derbies will take between 2,000 and 3,000 supporters. That is a sizeable amount of money. Even crossing the border into Yorkshire and elsewhere, the club takes a sizeable number of supporters, which shows their great commitment. That is now lost to rugby super league. In addition, Widnes are sponsored by Stobarts, one of the most well known brands in the country. Surely the super league would have wanted to be associated with that brand, which is the sort of brand it is particularly looking for. Those are the other things that the super league is missing out on.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/20">It is difficult to consider the situation objectively. If Widnes' application was judged on its merits, as the RFL told me it would, how could they fail? That is the point I keep coming back to. The system has not been transparent as the RFL promised. When my hon. Friend the Minister next meets the RFL, will he raise the concerns that I have set out today and seek assurances that the next licence application process will be much more transparent, and that any expansion of the game should not be at the expense of rugby league heartland clubs such as Widnes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-15a.286.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" speakername="Gerry Sutcliffe" colnum="286"  time="011:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081015/halltext/81015h0005.htm#08101537000555">
	<p pid="a.286.3/1">My hon. Friend tempts to get me personally involved in this issue, which I do not want to do. As I said, there was an opportunity to express any concerns in the discussions that were had with the RFL and in the dummy run process in 2006 and 2007. I know that there was a problem because Widnes went straight into administration, or insolvency, in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.3/2">However, from what I have been told by the RFL, the licensing application process was a fair process. In all processes, there are winners and losers. My hon. Friend is aggrieved because he believes that Widnes are unfair losers. I will raise his concerns with Richard Lewis and Nigel Wood, but in my view it is for the RFL to run the league, and I think that it does so very well.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.3/3">My hon. Friend said at the start that he did not agree with the franchise system. The RFL believes that licensing offers the best of both worlds. One national league club is guaranteed a place in super league in 2012, and with a three-year licence it will be given every chance of success, thereby removing the yo-yo effect of clubs chasing and overstretching for promotion. We know in rugby league, as in other sports, that that has been a problem. All licences into super league were issued for three years and clubs will be judged on how well they deliver their agreed plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.3/4">My hon. Friend mentioned Wakefield Trinity Wildcats. I can confirm that I have received the same information that he did: that the change in the plans for the new ground made no difference to the licensing application. That was not a consideration in relation to the licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.3/5">Super league's licensing is one of the drivers for the development of new stadiums, which produces benefits for the community and, on game days, for spectators, players and officials. As my hon. Friend knows, Widnes Vikings finished sixth in the Co-operative national league one this season, and things are looking good for next season, both on and off the field, with nearly &pound;10,000 worth of season tickets purchased already and a number of good player signings.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.3/6">I also know that exciting plans have been mapped out for the national league for 2009 onwards, including a 150 per cent. increase in funding, live TV coverage every week, a weekly magazine, corporate website production and the inclusion of a French club, which will add extra vibrancy and interest to that national league. There will also be significant extra income for clubs from the Challenge cup.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.3/7">Only two clubs can be admitted to the super league for next season, and inevitably other good clubs will miss out. However, the door is not shut and the players and fans of Widnes Vikings should be reassured and confident that, with their current management team in place, they will be in a far stronger position in two years' time, when the club can apply again for a super league licence. I wish the club really well in their endeavours.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.3/8">Rugby league is a fast-growing sport and it is important that we try to give support to the national league and to the other leagues right across the country that rugby league has been developing. In the last two years, rugby league has experienced a 27 per cent. increase in participation, with almost 250,000 people currently involved as players, coaches, match officials or volunteers. The Active People survey reports that more than 110,000 people take part in rugby league at least once a month. Furthermore, in Halton, my hon. Friend's constituency, Sport England has invested &pound;44,000 over three years in its contribution to a rugby league development officer, who is charged with getting more people to participate in rugby league in that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.3/9">I am also pleased to say that participation among women and girls has also seen a healthy year-on-year increase of 42 per cent. There are now 579 girls registered with age groups from under-12s to under-16s, and the RFL runs festivals for girls fortnightly between March and October.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.3/10">As my hon. Friend has said, it is important that football and rugby clubs become the heart of their communities. I know that the investment has gone in from Halton borough council to the Widnes Viking club, to try to increase participation and ensure that more people are involved in sport, so I understand that it was a great disappointment to everyone concerned that Widnes Vikings did not get into super league. However, Widnes Vikings now have a position&mdash;a platform&mdash;to build on and hopefully they will be successful in the national league. Then they will be in a position to ensure that they do not return to the horrors of the past, particularly when they went down after their last game in the super league and became insolvent almost immediately. The club have turned that situation around and is now looking forward to the future, from the secure base that my hon. Friend has talked about.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.3/11">I think that is difficult for the RFL to put forward a process that it sees as fair and rational but that also withstands challenge. Where there are outstanding questions that my hon. Friend feels the RFL has not answered, I will certainly pursue those questions with Mr. Lewis and Mr. Wood. I must say that there will always be disappointments when we have this type of process. However, for the good of the game, it is important that we move forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.289.3/1">It is a great pleasure to be under your watchful eye this afternoon, Ms Walley. I am grateful for this opportunity to discuss care for those with learning difficulties in the NHS. Only a few months ago, in a similar debate, I was fortunate enough to be able to raise the parallel issue of care for the elderly in the NHS. In that debate, I made a point that I shall repeat now for the record. Most of us receive excellent care in the NHS. It is an institution of which we are rightly proud and in which skilled and dedicated people respond superbly to the daily challenges that they face. However, as hon. Members' casework makes clear, all too many cases of neglect and failure in relation to two groups&mdash;the elderly and those with learning difficulties&mdash;show that there is a problem that must be recognised and acted on at the highest level of Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/2">I am here today to give voice to the family of my constituent, Emma Kemp, who had a severe learning disability. She died in 2004 of cancer, not after months of chemotherapy or intensive drug treatments, but without receiving any treatment for it at all&mdash;and, until the last month, without pain relief&mdash;despite being given a 40 to 50 per cent. chance of survival when she was first diagnosed.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/3">I will talk further in a moment about Emma's tragic story and her mother's brave campaign to ensure that it is not repeated for any family, but I start by acknowledging that society has come a long way in our attitudes toward those with learning disabilities. Thankfully, episodes such as the Mental Deficiency (Amendment) Act 1927, which defined people with learning difficulties in the most horrendous way, are in the past, yet Government policy has not gone nearly far enough to reduce the inequalities and discrimination faced by people with a learning disability. The discrimination that my constituent Emma faced is at odds with the values of the modern world and of the NHS. What is the point of the Government's talk about patient rights and an NHS constitution when even the most basic right to treatment cannot be provided for some of the most vulnerable people in our society?</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/4">Many hon. Members will recall that Emma's case was first highlighted in a Mencap report aptly named &quot;Death by Indifference&quot;, about which I am sure we shall hear more in this debate. The report told not only Emma's story but those of five other people with a learning disability who suffered pain and died, perhaps unnecessarily, while in the care of the NHS. Mencap has worked ceaselessly with the families of those people and many others across the country, with PCTs and health trusts and in the media to raise the profile of those with learning difficulties and their treatment in the NHS. I have nothing but praise for the fantastic job that Mencap has done in supporting Emma Kemp's family and for its campaigning work.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/5">Let me state clearly that this debate is not about knocking one or even six hospitals or GPs and clinicians; it is about facing up to a systemic failure. Understandably, the injustices revealed in &quot;Death by Indifference&quot; provoked a media and public outcry. In response to the criticism, the then Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1676" name="Patricia Hewitt">the right hon. Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt)</phrase>, to her credit, announced both a health ombudsman's investigation into the six individual cases and an independent inquiry to investigate the general health inequalities experienced by people with a learning disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/6">Although we are still waiting for the health ombudsman's report, the independent inquiry chaired by Sir Jonathan Michael published its report just after Parliament went into recess this July. The report contained criticism of current practices and made a host of recommendations, many of which would have made a difference to my constituent Emma's chances of survival if they had been accepted practice at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/7">As I have said, Emma was a lively and loved 26-year-old with a severe learning disability who was living in a supported living environment close to her family when her mother noticed that Emma was losing her appetite. Emma's mother, Jane, for whom I have enormous respect, is one of those rare people whom one meets in such a role. She is a real campaigner and has been a fantastic witness in presenting the case for Emma and similar people throughout the country. Jane took Emma to a GP who, although Emma had not eaten for eight days, sent them away, saying that it might be a virus. Not satisfied with her daughter's diagnosis, Jane took Emma to her own GP, who advised that Emma be admitted to hospital. Despite Emma's obvious pain and distress, the medical professionals could not diagnose a physical problem. It was left to Emma's family to point out to doctors that Emma had a lump in her groin, which they had found while helping to wash her in hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/8">Emma's learning disability meant that she exhibited challenging behaviour. She was frightened of being in hospital and of being examined by doctors. Nevertheless, the doctor investigating the lump in her groin was able to take a biopsy under local anaesthetic. After that, despite the fact that Emma was still not eating, she and her mother were sent home from hospital with painkillers in oral tablet form, although it was understood that Emma could not swallow tablets. Once at home, Jane was left to chase the medical professionals for Emma's diagnosis. Finally, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-18">18 June 2004</phrase>, Emma was diagnosed with type B1 lymphoma, which attacks the lymph nodes and can enter the bloodstream. The doctors gave Emma a 40 to 50 per cent. chance of survival but said that Emma's behaviour meant that they could not treat her.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/9">What the doctors failed to understand was that due to her learning disability, Emma lacked the capacity to consent to treatment. Just because Emma was in pain and frightened of the treatment that the doctors wanted to give her did not mean that she understood the consequences of refusing treatment or that she was choosing to die. I do not understand why the doctors did not listen to Emma's mother, who demanded treatment for her daughter, or apply their own General Medical Council guidelines. The guidelines are specific. They make it clear that if a patient has no capacity to consent, doctors should make all attempts to make the patient as comfortable as possible so that they can be treated. The fact that one of the doctors could take a biopsy of the lump in Emma's groin is evidence that, with the right approach, it would have been possible to treat her. However, instead of receiving treatment, Emma was sent home&mdash;still starving, in immense pain and without a solution for providing her with pain relief.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/10">Five days later, alarmed by Emma's continued distress, Jane brought her back to hospital, where she languished for a further two days without any pain treatment. By that time, Emma had also stopped drinking. So determined was Jane to protect her child from the pain that she instructed a solicitor to serve notice on the doctors to start pain relief. When even that made no difference, the solicitor started an action in the High Court, which had the desired effect. The hospital finally provided Emma with pain relief in a patch.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/11">Emma's mother also demanded a second opinion, which showed that Emma had only a 10 per cent. chance of survival. Reluctantly, Emma's mother agreed to palliative care, which was provided through an excellent facility in the Newbury community hospital called the Rainbow Room. Emma died there on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-25">25 July 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/12">As I said earlier, we are still awaiting the report from the health ombudsman, but it appears possible that the large reduction from a 40 to 50 per cent. to a 10 per cent. chance of survival may have been based not on the spread of the cancer but on the capacity to consent. Should that be true, it is indeed alarming.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/13">Reading Sir Jonathan Michael's excellent report, it is easy to see what a difference his recommendations could have made to prevent the tragic delays and failure to provide treatment that I outlined. Two of his recommendations stand out. The first is that</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/14" class="indent">&quot;Family and other carers should be involved as a matter of course as partners in the provision of treatment and care, unless good reason is given&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/15">As hon. Members know, had doctors listened to Emma's mother's instinct that there was something seriously wrong with Emma's health when she first stopped eating, who knows how early they could have caught the cancer? Mencap says that too often the parents and carers of people with learning disabilities are ignored by medical professionals, despite the fact that their knowledge is vital. It is they who live day in, day out with the individual with the learning disability, and it is they who will be the first to notice behavioural changes and be able to help to interpret non-verbal communications of pain and distress.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/16">Another crucial recommendation of the inquiry states:</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/17" class="indent">&quot;Those with responsibility for the provision and regulation of undergraduate and postgraduate clinical training must ensure that curricula include mandatory training in learning disabilities. It should be competence-based and involve people with learning disabilities and their carers in providing training.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/18">At the moment, medical professionals do not understand enough about people with learning disabilities, but understanding their health needs and the ways in which they communicate is crucial. Research commissioned by Mencap found that 75 per cent. of general practitioners had no training to help them deal with patients with learning disabilities and that 95 per cent. felt that a patient's learning disability made it more difficult for them to make a diagnosis. Even doctors acknowledge that they need to be given the confidence to intervene early and to take seriously the health needs of a person with a learning disability. In evidence taken by the independent inquiry, three quarters of health and social care professionals who responded mentioned the need for better education and training for staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/19">Will the Minister tell us when we can expect to hear the Government's response to the independent inquiry? It made 10 very good recommendations. We have had good assurances from Ministers about it, but we want action and to know how the recommendations will be implemented. Mencap, the families of the six people whose cases were described in the &quot;Death by Indifference&quot; report, and many hon. Members are calling on the Government to accept all the recommendations in the inquiry. It is worth noting what the chief executive of Mencap, Jo Williams, said on the day of the report's publication:</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/20" class="indent">&quot;The independent inquiry proves that people with a learning disability are being discriminated against in the NHS, which is leading to unnecessary pain and death.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/21">She continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/22" class="indent">&quot;It is clear that there is a desperate need for mandatory learning disability training for all health care professionals, and for people with a learning disability and their families and carers to be at the centre of all decision made surrounding their healthcare.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/23">The health inequalities faced by people with a learning disability are not limited to Emma and the five other individuals referred to in &quot;Death by Indifference&quot;. The Department of Health reports that there are 1.5 million people in this country with a learning disability, an estimated 40,000 of whom have a profound and multiple learning disability such as Emma's. People with a learning disability have higher health needs than the rest of us, yet many of them receive some of the worst treatment. For example, they are three times more likely to die from a respiratory disease, have a higher risk of coronary heart disease&mdash;the second most common cause of death among those with learning disabilities&mdash;and higher rates of gastrointestinal cancer and stomach disorders. We need to hear today what the Government will do to respond to this growing need.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/24">Why the Government have taken so long to improve the services available to people with a learning disability is beyond me. In his first speech as Secretary of State for Health, a year ago, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1648" name="Alan Johnson">the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West and Hessle (Alan Johnson)</phrase> admitted that people with a learning disability face some of the greatest health inequalities. What action has been taken to resolve such inequality? If the Government had taken action after Mencap's first report, &quot;Treat me Right: Better Healthcare for People with a Learning Disability&quot;, published in 2004, which outlined the same types of inequality as those we are discussing today, how many lives might have been saved? That report made very clear and open recommendations, many of them very similar to those made in Sir Jonathan Michael's report. The independent inquiry states that</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/25" class="indent">&quot;leadership is essential to deliver policy effectively for vulnerable groups in society&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/26">We want to hear from the Minister that the Government are stepping up to the call for leadership.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/27">It is not only hon. Members here today who are concerned about the treatment provided to people with a learning disability. Back in May our very own Joint Committee on Human Rights published a report on the human rights of those with learning disabilities, and found that</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/28" class="indent">&quot;for many adults with a learning disability, the violation of their human rights is seen as a normal part of their everyday lives&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/29">The Committee expressed concern that adults with learning disabilities in health and residential settings suffer neglect, abuse, discrimination and indifference. It also stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/30" class="indent">&quot;the Department of Health could do much more to promote a culture change and a human rights-led approach&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/31">It seems that once again we return to failures of leadership from the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/32">Debates on health inequalities are too often focused on dry statistics and numerical calculations of outcomes. What we have talked about today is a real human tragedy, and I hope that I have helped the Minister to understand the human cost of health inequalities. I leave her with the words spoken to my constituent, Jane Kemp, about her daughter, Emma: &quot;If she had been a normal young woman, we would not hesitate to treat her.&quot; As Mencap said to me, such comments cannot be proved, because they were not recorded in health notes. However, just because discrimination and health inequalities are difficult to prove, does not mean that they do not exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/33">I hope that the Government will take the recommendations of the independent inquiry seriously. We want to hear not just assurances and warm words, but whether the Government intend to implement all 10 recommendations, and if not, why not. If they do, how will that implementation be carried out, and on what time scale? I believe that the six families in the report, &quot;Death by Indifference&quot;, deserve no less.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-15a.293.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" speakername="Tom Clarke" colnum="293"  time="014:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081015/halltext/81015h0006.htm#08101537000557">
	<p pid="a.293.0/1">I sincerely congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" name="Richard Benyon">the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon)</phrase> on obtaining this debate on this very important matter and on his very comprehensive speech. At times, it was very touching, particularly when he dealt with the important case study of which he quite rightly reminded us. This debate is about people and families and their concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/2">For some years, I have had the privilege, with Lord Rix, to Chair the all-party learning disability group. The input from Mencap and the support for our work is quite profound. I hope to turn to that in a few moments. First, however, I say to my right hon. Friend, the Minister, that nothing that I shall say in the next few moments takes away from what I think are the Government's quite incredible achievements in the field of disability over the past 10 years. In particular, I welcome her support for advocacy, which she has expressed on many occasions, and which is central to the many issues being debated.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/3">Almost two years ago, the all party group on learning disability met to discuss the Healthcare Commission's report into learning disability services in Cornwall. Some 18 months ago, the Disability Rights Commission, as it then was, spoke to us about the findings in its report, &quot;Equal Treatment: closing the gap&quot;. Those reports addressed systematic failings&mdash;the hon. Gentleman has rightly used that term today&mdash;in the NHS regarding patients with learning disabilities. In his response to those reports, the Minister who then had responsibility for those matters, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for International Development&mdash;we congratulate him on his promotion and thank him for his great work in his former role&mdash;was quite trenchant in recognising the problems. He said that things were not good enough and that there was evidence of &quot;systemic indifference&quot;. That is what we are addressing today.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/4">There have been positive aspects to the Government's response to the report, as we will no doubt hear from my right hon. Friend when she winds up. In its recently published strategy on health inequalities, the Department stated that it plans to use the reduction of health inequalities for people with learning disabilities as a standard against which to measure improvements for all vulnerable groups. I strongly welcome that, and I hope that the Minister will bring us up to date not only on those plans but on the Government's thinking as we move forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/5">The Government's independent inquiry, published in July, to which the hon. Gentleman has referred, points us in the direction in which we want to go. It recommended that the Department should</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/6" class="indent">&quot;immediately amend Core Standards for Better Health, to include an explicit reference to the requirement to make 'reasonable adjustments' to the provision and delivery of services for vulnerable groups, in accordance with the disability equality legislation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/7">As we have heard, however, the NHS has largely failed to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that people with learning disabilities are not discriminated against. Health care information leaflets are not produced in easy-read format and they do not reach people with learning disabilities, their carers or their advocates. In many cases, no side rooms are made available for people for whom the confusion of an open waiting room and ward would prompt challenging behaviour. As a result, individuals might become stressed and feel obliged to leave, and some will be unable to access the treatment that they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/8">I accept that seeking a solution to such problems, making progress and ensuring that there is not a postcode lottery means investing resources. I must make the point again that it is deplorable that sometimes in Scotland, there is no evidence that funding that has been clearly allocated for specific purposes is being spent on those purposes. That applies especially in relation to the Barnett formula and in the field of learning difficulties. I understand that in addition to the &pound;34 million for disabled children and their families that was allocated to the Scottish Government under the Barnett formula&mdash;we have previously debated that matter in this Chamber&mdash;a further &pound;20 million was recently allocated specifically to the NHS in Scotland. We are still looking for evidence that that money has been going where it was intended to go. I shall not dwell on that issue, although I feel passionately about it, as it will probably be an ongoing issue in debates between the Scottish Government and the UK Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/9">The hon. Gentleman talked about the work that many of us do with Mencap. Mine has introduced me to the numerous alarming episodes experienced in hospital by people who have learning disabilities. I warmly congratulate Lord Rix on the fantastic job that he has done on this issue, among others. He approaches campaigns with all his fervour, intelligence and experience. We must thank him and Dame Jo Williams for everything they do. I also thank the individual supporters of Mencap throughout the country, particularly parents and carers, who do so much to focus attention on these important issues through their involvement in campaigns such as the &quot;Death by Indifference&quot; campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/10">One story that emerged from Mencap's research was about Laura&mdash;an active, talkative and independent woman with a learning disability who went into hospital for an emergency operation. After the operation, she was visited by her carer, who became concerned that no matter how much she chatted to Laura, she did not say a word. The carer said:</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/11" class="indent">&quot;On the third day I asked one of the nurses if she knew why Laura wasn't speaking. She looked surprised and said: 'Can she speak?' I told her that Laura could speak as well as anybody else. There was no reason for anybody to assume otherwise. I went back in to see Laura and I offered her a pen and paper, thinking that she might be able to communicate with me that way. Laura couldn't even hold the pen. When I saw the pen roll on to the floor, I suddenly thought, oh my god, she's had a stroke.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/12">It took doctors another two days to confirm that Laura had indeed suffered a stroke during her operation.</p>

	<p pid="a.295.1/1">Way back in 1986, when I was fortunate enough to be first in the ballot for private Member's Bills, the first person whom I met was Lord Brian Rix. Unfortunately, some of the issues that we are debating today were raised in that meeting and addressed in that Act. If I may say so, with great respect, I am not sure that it does any service to the cause that we are promoting simply to address these problems in relation to one particular Government as though they did not exist before. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Let me put on record that the hon. Gentleman appears to agree.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/2">The independent inquiry also made several important points about the often sensitive health needs of children with a learning disability. They are particularly important in light of the fact that medical advances and neonatal care improvements mean that more children with profound and multiple learning disabilities and complex health needs are surviving into childhood. Of course, we strongly welcome that, but the health service must adapt to that reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/3">I conclude by noting that the Government's aim of achieving equality, by 2025, for people with a disability is a worthy one. If we can do it earlier, that will be very welcome. If the Government were to adopt the recommendations in the independent inquiry, that would go a long way toward helping the Minister and her colleagues in other Departments to achieve their goals. In that, they have our full support.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-15a.295.2" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-15b.295.2" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-15a.295.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" speakername="John Barrett" colnum="295"  time="015:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081015/halltext/81015h0007.htm#08101537000560">
	<p pid="a.295.2/1">People with a learning disability are 58 times more likely to die before the age of 50 than the general population. I was stunned when I read that horrific fact in a Mencap paper, as I am over 50 and am very close to a little four-year-old girl with learning difficulties called Maria. It leaves me fearing for her future, unless we can be sure that the NHS gives everyone equal service.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/2">I should possibly declare an interest as that little girl is my granddaughter, and she would not be alive today were it not for the dedicated team at the new Edinburgh Royal infirmary, headed by Dr. Ian Laing. Her treatment and care have been second to none, partly because communication with new-borns is to a large extent exactly the same, regardless of whether they have a disability. The parents and the medical team know how to get the information they need for the right treatment for that child. Unfortunately, the problems change as the child becomes an adult.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/3">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" name="Richard Benyon">the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon)</phrase> on securing the debate and on a powerful and emotional speech and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> on his excellent contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/4">Today we heard stories of patients who died because they were not listened to or understood. It might be more difficult to communicate with some people than with others, but that can never be an excuse when deciding on their treatment. Anyone who has witnessed an accident and emergency unit at a major hospital at the weekend, when drunks who have self-inflicted wounds clog up the system and sometimes attack the doctors and nurses, is amazed at the patience and tolerance of the staff while they establish exactly what treatment is required. We need that level of understanding and patience delivered to everyone with a learning disability. It is not too much to ask, and indeed, anything less is completely unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/5">Some of the examples supplied by Mencap, whose work I highly commend, highlight the problem we face. People have been left for days or weeks to suffer in pain, often in extreme agony, and some of them eventually die. Mencap gave many examples; one was that of Mark, who was admitted to hospital with a broken leg, only to die after eight weeks of suffering. I mention that case because NHS staff are experts in the reduction and management of pain.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/6">When my mother was being cared for at home while suffering from terminal cancer, we were told that she need not suffer as the pain could be brought under control. When people with cerebral palsy were asked how the condition affected their quality of life, they claimed&mdash;to the surprise of many&mdash;that the No. 1 issue was not the problem of communicating or walking, but the pain: if the pain was controlled, life could be far more tolerable, but if it was not, life could be a nightmare. That is why good communication is at the heart of the debate. Those with learning difficulties may have associated problems for the rest of their lives, but they should not have pain, and the treatment they receive in the NHS should be of the standard that we expect for everyone else.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/7">The hard evidence that people with learning disabilities face health inequalities is simply overwhelming. From the Joint Committee on Human Rights to the independent inspection bodies who regulate and review the provision of health and social care, everyone accepts and agrees that we are facing a genuine problem. For people between the ages of 20 and 29 with a learning disability, mortality is nine times higher for men and 17 times higher for women. Forty per cent. of people with a learning disability have hearing problems. People with a learning disability are more likely than the general population to be either underweight or overweight.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/8">In July 2006 the Healthcare Commission and the Commission for Social Care Inspection published their joint report into the abuse of people with learning disabilities in the Cornwall Partnership NHS Trust. Inspectors found evidence of 64 incidents of abuse in the five years to October 2005, including staff hitting, pushing, shoving, dragging, belittling, mocking and goading people who used the trust's services. They also found incidents of staff withholding food, giving cold showers and making over-zealous or premature use of restraint&mdash;the list goes on. The families of those with a learning disability and carers were not involved in the delivery of services, yet staff routinely made decisions about almost every aspect of their life&mdash;whether they could go outside, which cup was to be used, how they spent their money and who lived with whom. The Healthcare Commission and the CSCI made a damning assessment of the failure of the whole system to protect adequately the people in its care, identifying a &quot;whole system failure.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/9">In the Sutton and Merton Primary Care Trust, the finding of the report on learning disability services showed that they were similarly concerned, with institutional abuse being prevalent in most parts of the learning disability service. The report stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/10" class="indent">&quot;the model of care was largely based on the convenience of the service providers, rather than the needs of the individuals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/11">The situations in Cornwall and in Sutton and Merton are by no means unique. The excellent independent inquiry found that there had been appalling examples of discrimination, abuse and neglect of people with learning disabilities across the range of health services. Those examples all underline our systematic failure to provide the proper framework, the adequate training and the proper inspection regime needed to provide the basic levels of care and support that those with severe learning difficulties deserve.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/12">As hon. and right hon. Members will know, the new Care Quality Commission will take over the functions of the Healthcare Commission, the CSCI and the Mental Health Act Commission. It is absolutely vital that the new Commission has the teeth and independence to make a real impact on the standard of health treatment given to vulnerable groups such as those with learning disabilities. Recommendation 7 of the independent inquiry highlights the importance of greatly improving the monitoring of the standard of general health services provided for people with learning disabilities. I look forward to hearing from the Minister today that that will be the case.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-15a.297.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1876" speakername="Angela Browning" colnum="297"  time="015:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081015/halltext/81015h0007.htm#08101537000561">
	<p pid="a.297.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" name="Richard Benyon">the Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon)</phrase> on securing the debate. It was extremely moving to hear his account of Emma and the experience of her mother, Jane, in trying to get the right treatment for her.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/2">I welcomed the setting up of the independent inquiry back in 2007 and the publication over the summer, but we should remember that some of the inquiry's recommendations are the same as those set out in the Government's own document, &quot;Valuing People&quot;, which was published as long ago as 2001. Although I do not want to fall foul of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, whom I respect greatly for his knowledge and care in these matters, the purpose of today's debate is surely to seek an assurance from the Minister that those ongoing problems and distressing matters will be addressed in such a way that we can all feel that progress is being made, and the parents and carers of those with a learning disability can feel more confident that their children are in touch with the statutory services and will be treated equally, with real understanding of their particular needs and how they can be supported.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/3">I was particularly concerned that the independent inquiry found that very few nurses specially trained in learning disabilities were working in the NHS, as they are often the main point of contact for those with a learning disability, as we have heard this afternoon, and that is also the case with primary care services. Learning disability liaison nurses assist with admissions, help to assess needs and give help and advice to ward staff on meeting the needs of patients with a learning disability. As the inquiry states, they can challenge preconceived notions of learning difficulty and help to ensure that the patients' lives are valued. The presence of those nurses can have a significant impact on the quality of the treatment provided to an individual with a learning disability. Will the Department of Health act on the inquiry's recommendation that the work force of those nurses be strengthened?</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/4">The inquiry also recommended that annual health checks be brought forward for everyone with a learning disability, and although I am pleased that the Government last month announced that they would be brought in as part of the GP contract, I wonder why it has taken the Government so long to introduce them when the evidence that they work has been available for some time. For example, a study of annual health checks in Australia revealed a sixfold increase in the detection of conditions such as visual impairment and in the take-up of immunisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/5">We have heard some harrowing accounts concerning individual people who were mentioned in the Mencap &quot;Death by indifference&quot; report, which prompted the Government to set up the independent inquiry. Sadly, those are not isolated cases. After the publicity that the report received, the charity Mencap was contacted by a large number of people who wanted to share their stories about the experiences of people with a learning disability when accessing mainstream health services. The accounts that we have heard today, of Emma, Laura and Mark, are not isolated cases. I was particularly struck by the case, in the report, of Sara, a young woman who ended up with an 8 cm brain tumour. When she presented with symptoms she was merely given paracetamol and when it was eventually discovered that she had a brain tumour it was much too late to operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/6">What struck me about the personal accounts that we have discussed was that all the people involved had parents who were by their side speaking on their behalf; presumably they were worried out of their minds&mdash;but there were people there to be advocates. I have raised that point in other debates about other forms of disability, and in particular, as hon. Members will know, about people on the autistic spectrum. We all understand that when professionals&mdash;doctors and others&mdash;come across someone whom they are treating for a physical condition, who presents with behaviour that is sometimes challenging and sometimes merely what I would merely describe as rather strange, or with a particularly high pain threshold, which is not uncommon in the relevant group, it is quite a challenge to get beyond that to identify the physical condition and the appropriate pathway.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/7">We all understand the time pressures on such professionals. However, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> said, it is a matter of communication and of giving the individual patient the time needed to get beyond what is presented. The fast track to doing that, if a parent is with the patient, is to listen to parents. Unfortunately&mdash;although I do not think that one should apologise for the fact&mdash;parents in such stressful conditions are sometimes quite emotional, and I worry that professionals, including quite experienced doctors, sometimes find their distress and emotion difficult to deal with. Perhaps instead of addressing that distress, those professionals are led by it to ignore key things to which they should give more time. However, none of that excuses the situation that we have been discussing. There is a real need to deal with it. I hope that nurses with experience in learning disability can help to be the bridge between the parent, the patient and the health professional.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/8">Of course, not every patient has with them a close relative or carer who can explain how they normally behave, their difficulties and how they present themselves to many people. That applies particularly as people get older. People with learning disabilities get older as the rest of us do, and they may not have a close person who knows them well enough to advocate for them. As hon. Members know, the Mental Capacity Act 2005 established an independent mental capacity advocate service&mdash;the IMCAs, as they are called. I served on the scrutiny Committee for the Mental Capacity Act 2005, and on the Bill Committee, and I clearly recall, because it was only three years ago, our conversations in Committee about how the advocacy service would help to solve the problem for people in exactly the situation I have described, with no one to speak up for them or articulate their concerns. The Act also introduced a legal duty on NHS and social care staff to refer eligible people to the IMCA service.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/9">The advocates provide a real chance to redress the health inequalities experienced by people with a learning disability, as they act as champions for those who would not otherwise have a voice. Sadly, however, as the Department's report found, referrals from medical professionals</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/10" class="indent">&quot;for Serious Medical Treatment are particularly low across the whole country, raising concerns about the extent to which the NHS is, at present, complying with the requirements of the Act.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/11">That does not require a lot of research or any new legislation. It concerns something that is on the statute book now. I particularly hope that the Minister will act today: if an NHS body is not putting into place what statute requires, that should be addressed extremely urgently.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-15a.307.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" speakername="Stephen O'Brien" colnum="307"  time="015:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081015/halltext/81015h0009.htm#08101537000566">
	<p pid="a.307.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" name="Richard Benyon">the Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon)</phrase> on securing this important and timely debate. He mentioned that over the past few years he has supported his constituent, Jane Kemp, during the still ongoing complaints process into the death of her daughter Emma. We heard a moving account from my hon. Friend. Likewise, the other hon. Members who have expressed their testimony on behalf of their constituents are in a similar position.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/2">My hon. Friend's speech, and other hon. Members' contributions to this vital debate, will, like all other speeches in this place, be recorded word for word for ever, but unusually, unlike so many of the speeches made in the House, those made today will also have the added merit of being memorable and therefore influential in terms of trying to shift the whole legislative, statutory and attitudinal basis for making improvements as we go forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/3">In the Chamber today are two Members of Parliament from Scotland, where many such matters are devolved, and are acknowledged as such. It is important that we see the universality of the issues and recognise that, although our responsibility in this Chamber is effectively under English jurisdiction, there is cross-reference that is valid and important.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/4">Given that this debate is substantially concerned with the independent inquiry into access to health care for people with learning disabilities, by Sir Jonathan Michael, published in the recess, and given that the inquiry report's 10 recommendations apply to the Department of Health, or to its sphere of influence, and given the seriousness of the failings&mdash;involving people's lives&mdash;that the inquiry is seeking to reverse, it is vital that the Health Minister, who is here listening, is also here to act. As a former Treasury Minister, she knows more than most how to flex the channels and influence the Government to find the necessary funds to support the action called for today. I am much encouraged that she is the Minister answering the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/5">During his speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury mentioned the importance of training for doctors and nurses in how to engage with and meet the health needs of those with a learning disability. There is clearly an advantage to both undergraduates and those already registered having meaningful contact with individuals with a learning disability and their family carers to improve their understanding of what it means to have a learning disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/6">I, too, pay tribute to all that Mencap has done over many years, under the initiative and leadership of Lord Rix and also, more recently, under Dame Jo Williams, whom I first met when she was in charge of Cheshire social services, when I was first elected. I pay tribute to her, and all her colleagues, not least because of their influential &quot;Death by Indifference&quot; report.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/7">Mencap has highlighted the case of Cathy, who has Down's syndrome. Cathy visited an audiologist for a hearing test, as she had experienced a little discomfort. That should have been a routine procedure, but, sadly, as the audiologist did not know that people with Down's syndrome have short, straight ear canals, he pushed the otoscope too far into Cathy's ear and perforated her eardrum. It was not possible to repair the perforation and Cathy has had to wear a hearing aid ever since.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/8">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1876" name="Angela Browning">the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning)</phrase> mentioned the Government's recent announcement that the provision of annual health checks for people with a learning disability will be one of the five new categories of directed enhanced schemes included in the general practitioner's contract. That is good news. However, as my hon. Friend said, the evidence for the positive impact that annual health checks can have on the health of people with a learning disability has been clear since 2001. The Australian evidence that she cited has given us confidence that it is effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/9">The Welsh Assembly has provided a financial incentive to GPs to introduce regular health checks for people with a learning disability since April 2006. Initial findings are that, in the first year, 51 per cent. of those with a learning disability who received a health check had a newly identified health need and 9 per cent. had a serious health problem. Subsequent checks a year later identified further new health needs among 68 per cent. of those tested and serious problems were identified in 11 per cent. of those people.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/10">Some primary care trusts, such as the one in Birmingham, have already commissioned directed enhanced services in their areas to provide annual health checks. In Birmingham, out of 1,500 health checks, 205 previously unknown health problems were identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/11">Bearing all this in mind, it is no surprise that, back in 2001, the Government first acknowledged the value of annual health checks in their policy paper, &quot;Valuing People&quot;, which hon. Members have cited. Some 18 months ago, the Government said:</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/12" class="indent">&quot;We agree that health checks are the most effective way to improve the health of people with learning disabilities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/13">Therefore, the Department of Health has known for a long time what is needed to ensure that people with a learning disability get equal health outcomes&mdash;indeed, it has known for seven years. Despite all the evidence that such provisions would have a major impact on addressing health inequalities faced by people with a learning disability and that those would have helped them overcome the barrier of access and entry into the health care system, the Department did not give priority to ensuring that good practice was implemented until just last month. We had been questioning the Government about how they were dithering. Let us acknowledge that the implementation has now happened and let us hope that the Minister will say that they will not dither over certain matters that we have identified and that they will go forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/14">In July 2006, the then Secretary of State for Health was asked the following question:</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/15" class="indent">&quot;one of the important recommendations in &quot;Valuing People&quot; back in March 2001 was that everyone with a learning disability should have received a</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/16" class="indent">'Health Action Plan by June 2005.'</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/17" class="indent">Will the Secretary of State say whether that has indeed happened? If it has not happened yet, when will it have happened?&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-07-11.1257"><i>Official Report</i>, 11 July 2006; Vol. 448, c. 1257</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/18"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1676" name="Patricia Hewitt">The right hon. Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt)</phrase> responded, saying,</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/19" class="indent">&quot;I understand that some areas have put those in place for all people covered by the recommendation. However, that is not the case universally&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-07-11.1258"><i>Official Report</i>, 11 July 2006; Vol. 448, c. 1258</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/20">I hope that the Minister will tell us in a moment whether, two years since that exchange and seven years after the promise was made, health action plans have been rolled out across the country. If not, will she agree to write to me, listing the places where they have and have not been put in place?</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/21">The impact is clear. For example, people with learning disabilities and other health problems, such as diabetes or stroke, such as the moving case that we heard about from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, have fewer measurements of their body mass index taken than others with diabetes, and those with stroke have fewer blood pressure checks than others with stroke. They often experience diagnostic overshadowing, which is when reports of physical ill health are viewed as part of the learning disability and may not be investigated or treated.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/22">A central principle of our NHS is that care should be available to all, free at the point of use and according to need, not ability to pay. Yet for those with a learning disability access to services is often far from ideal. I pay tribute to the work of Diabetes UK with Speakup, the self-help and advocacy charity, to produce accessible information and education to ensure that people with learning disabilities are able to have their health needs met by primary care services: GPs, practice nurses and other staff. Diabetes UK and others are calling for work towards improving early intervention for high-risk groups and flexible and integrated care packages for vulnerable people with diabetes. I hope that the Minster will outline what work the Government are taking forward in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/23">Part of the problem is that, as usual, the Government are avoiding collecting the data needed to be able to assess accurately the health inequalities experienced by people with a learning disability. For example, as my hon. Friend the member for Tiverton and Honiton commented, the independent inquiry calls for an increase in the number of learning disability liaison nurses and health facilitators. Can the Minister tell us how many there are at the moment? I suspect that she will have to say, &quot;Of course not.&quot; Can the Minister tell us how many of each are on permanent and fixed-term contracts? Again, I fear that she cannot. Can she even tell us how many NHS trusts have a disability equality scheme or how many people with a learning disability have a health action plan in place? I fear that she cannot. There is a grave danger that by not collecting information centrally we do not have the data on which the relevant action can be taken under ministerial direction and guidance. There is a mismatch between aspiration and the data required.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/24">One reason why people with a learning disability seem to face such health inequalities might be found in the fact that 30 years ago at least 60,000 people with a learning disability lived in long-stay hospitals. Although those numbers have been reduced, many of the services that are needed to replace them, in the community, have not come through and have not been available. Poorer people, in particular, experience difficult access and poorer health outcomes. I should be grateful if the Minister stated explicitly how the Government will respond to each of the 10 recommendations in the Michael report. I shall not list them because they are well known, and I prefer to give the time to the Minister for her response.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/25">An important point was made a moment ago about the 18-year-old cliff edge, and I want it to be well understood. I look forward to the Minister's response, and hope that she will implement the independent inquiry's recommendations, which we have discussed, as well as the full involvement of families&mdash;we heard about that especially in the case of Tom, described by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" name="Martin Horwood">the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase>. Let us ensure that the medical profession conforms to its statutory duty, and thus enables advocates to have teeth.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/26">Many families of people with learning disabilities report that some doctors, consciously or unconsciously, believe that their son's or daughter's health problem is a result of the learning disability and that not much can be done about it. That is a dangerous assumption and, as we have heard today, can lead to undiagnosed or misdiagnosed conditions.</p>

	<p pid="a.310.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" name="Richard Benyon">the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon)</phrase> on securing this important debate, and I hope that he understands that if hon. Members take longer to read out questions than the time that I have left to reply, it is regrettably not always possible to answer each one.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/2">I apologise on behalf of the new Minister for Care Services, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1512" name="Phil Hope">the Member for Corby (Phil Hope)</phrase>, who is attending a Standing Committee and unable to attend our debate here. I know that he shares his predecessor's concern about the issues that hon. Member have raised, and that he is equally committed to putting matters right. Those issues are also at the front of the Secretary of State's mind. Earlier this summer, he met the families of those patients whose tragic deaths are described in the report, &quot;Death by indifference&quot;. He has maintained a close personal interest in the ongoing inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/3">I have listened carefully to what has been said this afternoon, and I thank the hon. Member for Newbury and other hon. Members for speaking with such passion and clarity on such a vital issue. The principles that govern the NHS are simple, powerful and enduring. We believe that it should be inclusive, responsive and compassionate. Those qualities are paramount when providing health care for people with learning disabilities, who may have multiple needs and require a tailored approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1876" name="Angela Browning">The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning)</phrase> spoke powerfully, as she always does on such issues, as did other hon. Members, and made it clear that such qualities are not being met in every setting for every patient. That cannot be tolerated. She pressed the Government on a number of issues, and I shall respond to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/5">I share the hon. Lady's dismay at the evidence that medical practitioners are disregarding the requirements of the Mental Capacity Act 2005. When I leave the Chamber, I shall ask my officials immediately to take up the issue and to report back to my hon. Friend. I agree that the abuse of people with learning disabilities is absolutely unacceptable&mdash;I can think of no other words to state that more strongly&mdash;and that we must take the matter forward. Other hon. Members spoke eloquently, and I agree with them that it is necessary to listen to family members. My officials are working closely with the National Family Carer Network to ensure that their concerns are addressed, and that families are given support and are listened to as an expert partner.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/6">Other issues of transition were also raised. The Government are taking work forward to unblock the processes, and to combine assessments to ensure that young people with complex needs have that smooth transition that the hon. Lady so eloquently identified. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> said, there are many examples of outstanding work throughout the country, and of health and care professionals working together to deliver for people with learning disabilities, and going that extra mile. That shows that the NHS can do it, which makes it all the more unacceptable if parts of it do not.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/7">The family cases that hon. Members described are deeply distressing, and inexcusable. They are anathema to what the NHS represents and, as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> said, addressing inequalities has been one of the most important priorities for the NHS, but much remains to be done, and we are not shirking that.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/8">Much has been said about the Government's alleged inactivity in many areas, and I want to make a couple of points before going on to say what we shall do next. The Government have taken action to improve access to health care through the operating framework for the NHS for 2008-09. We have specifically directed improvements in the NHS in the quality of care for people with learning disabilities and inequality of access to care. That includes developing personalised plans that address health and care needs. We have directed enhanced services for GP practices to provide annual health checks. That is not all we have done because we were doing things previously, which are in progress, but we are going further.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/9">We have published the primary care service framework to support PCTs to deliver that better primary care. We have launched the national awareness campaign to examine education and the programmes that we need to introduce and which hon. Members rightly identified. We have also made clear what we intend to do in the next stage review. We want to ensure good practice so that everyone can expect the health care from professionals that they are entitled to. We responded to the Joint Committee and have taken work forward to improve services.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/10">We considered the report from the Disability Rights Commission and took action, but I shall not describe that because it is on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/11">Following publication of the report about abuse in Cornwall and in Sutton and Merton, the Secretary of State, the NHS chief executive and the director general of social care wrote to the NHS and social services, reminding them of their responsibilities to provide the highest care.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/12">There is a wider job to do, and hon. Members were quite right about driving a culture of change through the entire NHS and eradicating the problems, whether they are based on ignorance or fear among NHS staff when they encounter patients with learning difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/13">Reference was made to Sir Jonathan Michael's report, and although I cannot pre-announce our response, I want to make absolutely clear our commitment to respond effectively to the 10 recommendations, and to ensure that our response is included in the Government's forthcoming cross-cutting strategy, &quot;Valuing People Now.&quot; I hope that hon. Members understand why I cannot pre-empt that. My colleagues and I want deep, effective change, not a quick fix.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/14">I thank hon. Members, Mencap and all those families who have continued to bring these important issues to our attention. We are determined to act on them, not just in the Department of Health, but throughout the Government. I am confident that we can transform the way in which the NHS responds to the needs of people with learning disabilities, and to ensure that all NHS staff understand individuals, their needs and how to deliver the best possible health care and outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/15">It is unacceptable for any trained health professional not to discharge their responsibilities for the care of any patient in the NHS. We intend to continue to make that clear, and to bring about the necessary cultural change to deliver the services that all hon. Members want for all members of our society.</p>

	<p pid="a.313.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon, Ms Walley. I welcome the Minister to her new role. When she was in her previous job, I was supposed to meet her yesterday to talk about the Aberystwyth tax office, so we were obviously destined to meet one way or another this week. I am pleased she is here to respond to a matter of acute concern for many farmers in my constituency, across Wales, and more generally across the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/2">Sheep electronic identification has certain limited benefits in terms of tracking disease, but those are far outweighed by the many problems that have emerged since EU regulation 21/2004 was first proposed. The rationale for electronic identification came from the wide spread foot and mouth outbreak in 2001, when there were problems with tracking animal movement. That presented a severe problem because, at that point, subsidy was linked to headage. That is no longer the case and therefore, from the outset, there is a fundamental problem with the rationale behind EID.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/3">The ID and batch recording system, which is backed up by the six day standstill situation, already tracks disease and works perfectly adequately, as I am sure the Minister realises. There is not really a problem, yet we have a supposed solution that will potentially pile misery on the farmers whom I and the hon. Members here from all parties represent. I believe that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will not be introducing a national database to hold the records, but I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed that. Without a database to record the information, all we will be left with is a huge paper trail that will make it difficult for us to assess the small amount of useful information produced.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/4">The system cannot provide us with secure traceability within the food chain because when animals are taken to slaughter, the tags will be removed. There will be no way of retaining a traceability function beyond that point. I do not dismiss EID out of hand; in fact, there may well be a case for some countries to adopt it, but, as far as I can tell, the UK farming community is virtually unanimous in its belief that it is not right for the UK, and it is certainly not right for Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/5">Farmers have told me that the benefits are minimal and are certainly not worth the additional costs and difficulties that they would experience. The experience of those who have taken part in the trials is instructive; for some it worked fine, but even those who did not experience problems did not think it was particularly worth while or beneficial. If we are going to introduce an added burden on our farmers and the wider rural community, there needs to be a good reason for the regulation to be introduced. I am yet to meet anybody in the UK farming community who believes that to be the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.314.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is making an important point about the technology. Does he agree that that is a particular problem in relation to auction sales. I understand that the requirement will be for every single sheep to have its tag read before it is sold at auction. In an auction, such the one at Ruthin, 5,000 head of sheep might be sold in a single session. The proposal will render the process of auction almost impossible.</p>

	<p pid="a.315.2/1">They would certainly reach that conclusion if an adequate appraisal had been undertaken. Most hon. Members in this Chamber have certainly reached that conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.2/2">I would like to return to the practical difficulties with tagging. Farmers are not just worried about the electronic system itself, but the need for individual tagging. On a small scale that might not be deemed a particular problem, but when we are talking about farmers with flocks of 1,000 sheep or more, it is suddenly a much more difficult task. I am not convinced that that has been fully appreciated by the Commission or, indeed, by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.2/3">There are numerous difficulties for hill farmers, and I declare an interest as the secretary of the all-party group on hill farming. I understand that some of those who have trialled the technology have found that when the time has come to bring sheep back down from the highlands to the lowlands, as many as 20 per cent. of the tags have gone missing. Clearly, both the cost&mdash;estimated at as much as &pound;1.50 per tag&mdash;and the additional labour required to refit the tags will be a further burden that our hard pressed farmers can ill afford.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.2/4">In Wales, 80 per cent. of farms are in less favoured areas, which inevitably means that we are more dependent on moving animals from the high to the lowlands. That means we will have to invest more in the technology. I know that the Minister will be unable to comment specifically on Wales&mdash;I think it is right that she should not&mdash;but I hope she will acknowledge that because of the nature of the agricultural industry of some parts of the UK, those areas will be particularly badly affected by the regulation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-15a.316.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" speakername="Mark Williams" colnum="316"  time="015:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081015/halltext/81015h0010.htm#08101537000580">
	<p pid="a.316.2/1">I am particularly grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that point; it is the next one in my speech. At this time, farm incomes are falling, so the additional burden is particularly unwelcome. In less favoured areas, incomes for the year ending February 2008 were forecast at &pound;5,900 for sheep and cattle farms, and for non-LFA sheep and cattle farms the figure was &pound;8,700. Bearing in mind that the scheme is expected to cost farmers thousands of pounds&mdash;I have seen figures suggesting that 18 per cent. of those amounts would need to be diverted towards compliance with the scheme&mdash;it is not difficult to envisage yet more farmers leaving the industry. I hope that even if the Minister cannot promise to lobby for a derogation for the UK from the regulation, she will be able to outline what the Government plan to do to assist farmers to be able to implement the regulation without it costing their livelihoods.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.2/2">Sheep farmers are struggling to stay in business without these additional concerns. One example raised in the excellent report by the Country Landowners Association and the Scottish Rural Property and Business Association was that of fertiliser. In 2006, that cost &pound;160 a tonne, but is going up to &pound;450 a tonne now. That was contrasted with the average price of fat lambs, which has increased only to &pound;55 from &pound;40. The economics of sheep farming have become more problematic in recent years&mdash;indeed, in recent weeks and days. By introducing the regulation, we are reducing our farmers' competitiveness relative to other nations that do not have that burden, which is a very dangerous route for us to go down with a very vulnerable industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.2/3">Last year, I asked questions about the exact financial cost that farms would face in implementing the regulation. At that time, I was given a figure of about &pound;1,900 for a 1,000-ewe farm and about &pound;1,000 for a 200-ewe farm. Has the Minister reviewed that figure in the intervening time and in the light of intervening experiences?</p>
	<p pid="a.316.2/4">We should not forget that the debate is not just about farmers. They are my main concern this afternoon, but the issue goes much wider, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1506" name="David Jones">the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones)</phrase> said. Markets and abattoirs will have to take expensive action to ensure that they comply with the regulation. We are talking about the viability of rural communities as a whole. Abattoirs face an additional cost in the form of the new meat hygiene regulations. I know that that is not a responsibility of the Minister or her Department and that it is outside the remit of this debate. However, I will ask what consideration the Government are giving to ensure that regulation as a whole is not designed in such a way that it becomes inevitable that farmers give up their livelihoods and communities lose vital amenities. I have only one abattoir in my constituency, but if it was forced to close as a result of the regulation, that would have all sorts of implications for local sourcing and attempts to reduce food miles, as well as the obvious economic effect on the broader community.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.2/5">That is the problem. It is a big problem. I hope that in delaying implementation of the regulation until 2010, the Government have at least accepted some of the arguments that I have made. I surmise from the fact that the Government have pursued that course of action that they recognise that there are real problems facing farmers, and I hope that they will continue to make representations on those concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.2/6">The Minister's predecessor, Lord Rooker, was quoted as saying after a recent meeting in Limoges to discuss the scheme:</p>
	<p pid="a.316.2/7" class="indent">&quot;There was a complete slamming of EID&mdash;almost all speakers were against it. I made the point that from our individual trials, EID is not cost-effective and there are better ways of achieving disease control. We want a review of the regulation so it imposes fewer burdens.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.316.2/8">I hope that the new Minister will echo those sentiments when she responds to my speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.2/9">I acknowledge that the concerns raised so far have come largely from the UK and Ireland&mdash;particularly vocal has been the National Assembly for Wales&mdash;but increasingly it is becoming apparent that some other countries that will come under the regulation are growing anxious about whether that is appropriate. I appreciate that the Minister is new to her job, but I urge her and her officials, if they have not done so to date, to meet the Governments of other European countries that may be coming round to our point of view.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.2/10">One difficulty that we face on the politics of this is that more member states will not be subject to EID than will. A national flock of 600,000 or more, or 160,000 for goats, is required before a member state becomes subject to the full extent of the regulation, thus 16 member states will not have to introduce EID. That is not to say that they will not be affected by it. I wonder what discussions there have been with member states that will not be required to introduce EID and whether there has been any attempt to persuade them of our concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.2/11">I have not secured the debate on the basis that farmers are luddites, that they are refusing to change or that they have not expressed concerns about security. I believe that the farming community would be happy, with support, to implement regulations that brought benefits and were cost-effective, but EID is ineffectual and expensive and the burdens that it will place on farmers are extremely onerous. I strongly urge the Minister to do all that she can to fight the corner of our farmers and rural communities as a whole. I hope that she will tell us that she will continue to fight this all the way. There is consensus among hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber who are concerned about the regulation. I hope that at the very least she will work with us to ensure that the extent of the burden is reduced and that we help the farmers in some of our most deprived communities as much as we can.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-15a.322.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1664" speakername="George Howarth" colnum="322"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081015/halltext/81015h0011.htm#08101537000588">
	<p pid="a.322.1/1">Refractory Angina is a painful condition that affects up to 15,000 people in the UK, many of whom have had unnecessary treatment. At this point, I should like to express my gratitude to councillor Ken McGlashan, a colleague and friend of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1665" name="Edward O'Hara">the Member for Knowsley, South (Mr. O'Hara)</phrase> and I, for drawing our attention to the problem, and to Professor Michael Chester, who has provided much of the briefing that I am making use of today.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/2">Compared with a decade ago, much is known about how to treat the condition, yet because awareness of that knowledge is low, many patients live in unnecessary fear, and our health care system does not adequately cater for them. Improving care for refractory angina is important because it can make a direct improvement to patients' lives. Greater knowledge and awareness can save unnecessary operations and improving care teaches us lessons on how to structure our health care system's rewards and incentives.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/3">Before I talk about the availability of treatment for the condition and the associated challenges, I should first explain the difference between stable and refractory angina. According to the British Heart Foundation, stable angina is an increasingly common condition and affects around 1.2 to 1.4 million people. Improvements in medicines, coupled with technological advances, have allowed more angina sufferers to be treated than ever before, which is welcome. However, inevitably, those approaches are certainly not universally effective, and a growing number of patients experience severe debilitating symptoms that do not respond to the measures available&mdash;in other words, refractory angina. Typically, refractory angina patients are frightened, confused and vulnerable. Most have previously undergone cardiac procedures that have afforded temporary relief of the symptoms, but which have failed after a period. Long-term recurrence of symptoms following bypass surgery and angioplasty is well known and although many patients undergo further procedures, that is are not appropriate for a growing number of others. That is particularly true for elderly and infirm angina sufferers, for whom the risk of further surgery can outweigh the benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/4">Refractory angina is characterised by disabling symptoms of chest pain, breathlessness, significantly impaired function and poor quality of life&mdash;the last of those things applies both to the sufferer and their carers. Sufferers are often further burdened by misconceptions about the causes and implications of their chest pain, and many hold the incorrect belief that the symptoms of what is in fact usually a stable condition are warning signs of an imminent heart attack or even death.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/5">How does the NHS respond to such patients? I should first say that the problem is not new. The March 2000 national service framework for stable angina recognised the existence of the problem of refractory angina, but set no targets. In 1999, Baroness Hayman, then a Health Minister, responding to calls for a national strategy to deal with the condition, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/6" class="indent">&quot;I do understand that refractory angina is a difficult and distressing problem...There is a growing recognition of the problem and the likelihood that the number of people who suffer from refractory angina will increase&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/7">We have a growing problem and, at the moment, no clear strategy to address it.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/8">As Baroness Hayman predicted, the number of sufferers has increased. That is partly because when the number of revascularisation procedures rises, so does the number of patients whose symptoms return after a period of post-procedural remission, often within three years of the operation. Another reason is that we have an ageing population, and the elderly tend to want to avoid invasive procedures if possible. That is certainly understandable in the case of invasive coronary interventions such as percutaneous coronary intervention, which is also known as stents, for stable angina, because even small risks of a heart attack, stroke or death increase in significance when such procedures are performed only to relieve symptoms.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/9">In 2002, the European Society of Cardiology, prompted by the work of the UK National Refractory Angina Centre, sponsored a special study group to investigate the problem of refractory angina. Based on its estimates, there could be as many as 50,000 sufferers in the UK. More recently, the respected Cheshire and Merseyside Cardiac Network and the North Wales Cardiac Network predicted that, in their regions, where there is a population of around 2 million, there will be 2,400 sufferers by 2017. If that estimate is correct, the NHS might expect to have 78,000 sufferers to cater for by the end of the decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/10">I said that refractory angina is characterised by disabling symptoms of chest pain, breathlessness, significantly impaired function and, additionally, poor quality of life for sufferers. Often, sufferers have misconceptions about the causes and implications of their chest pains, and many believe that the symptoms are warning signs of imminent heart attack or death, so their ability to manage their condition and lead healthy lives is unnecessarily affected. Many sufferers dramatically reduce their levels of activity in the mistaken belief that that will reduce their risk of heart attack. In fact, on the contrary, in doing that, they increase the risk and, at the same time, their quality of life diminishes. People with refractory angina become frequent attendees at GP surgeries, undergo multiple emergency admissions to hospital and suffer exacerbated chest pain. Many patients and carers live in an unfounded perpetual fear of sudden death.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/11">As well as the human cost, there are clear implications for the efficient use of precious health care resources. An audit in 1998 showed wide variations in refractory angina care practice. There is no doubt that, although dedicated health care professionals in different parts of the country provide what they honestly believe to be the best treatment available, patients are offered dramatically different management strategies depending on where they live.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/12">Despite the growing number of patients with refractory angina, there is currently only one specialist centre available: the multi-award winning and internationally acclaimed NRAC in Liverpool, which has pioneered consumer-centred service design and delivery since 1996, is the only dedicated NHS specialist service for patients suffering from chronic refractory angina. Under the highly respected leadership of Professor Chester, the centre has received a number of prestigious NHS awards. Last year, he won the highly prized Sunday Times and Henley business school customer experience leadership award.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/13">In 2000, the then Prime Minister described NRAC as</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/14" class="indent">&quot;representing the very best of the NHS&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/15">The then Secretary of State for Health, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1527" name="Alan Milburn">the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn)</phrase>, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/16" class="indent">&quot;NRAC is leading modernisation in the NHS&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/17">and in 2003, the then chief executive of the NHS, Sir Nigel Crisp, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/18" class="indent">&quot;By putting the patient first and making a commitment to customer service, the centre has a vital role in modernising the NHS and making it fit for the 21st century&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/19">I draw attention to those accolades not to flatter the centre for its leadership, although it deserves immense credit, but to point out that in a national context of highly variable care quality, it is possible to deliver outstanding results and to have a real effect on people's lives. Moreover, that leads to real and profound efficiency benefits. Published research and audits show that NRAC produces savings that substantially exceed costs by preventing unscheduled admissions and unnecessary palliative procedures. NRAC's value for money has been endorsed by senior commissioners and Department of Health advisers.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/20">This specialist patient-centred, cost-saving approach to refractory angina management developed at NRAC is available to fewer than 100 of the predicted 10,000 new patients who present with the condition each year. Despite repeated calls going back to 1998, there still appears to be no clear national strategy. It is vital that we have a proper appreciation of the growing scale of the problem to equip local NHS providers with the appropriate knowledge, skills and facilities to be able to respond effectively. There is an added challenge that the very definition of the condition&mdash;refractory meaning angina that has resisted treatment&mdash;signifies a failure of previous treatments. Perhaps that explains why professional representative organisations representing the cardiologists and surgeons have avoided dwelling on how to respond to the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/21">We need a number of approaches to help the health service address the condition more effectively. First, training should be considered. NRAC has a state of the art multi-professional training programme and has shown that health care professionals can be trained to deliver high-quality refractory angina care.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/22">Secondly, we need to consider funding across the system as a whole. Primary care trusts continue to focus on high-cost palliative revascularisation targets, which were set by the national service frameworks nearly a decade ago, before the full impact of refractory angina was properly understood. It has been estimated that, of the &pound;2.5 billion that will be spent on coronary revascularisation over the next decade, more than &pound;1 billion will be on purely palliative procedures. Much of that will go to pay for expensive equipment brought in from abroad and could be saved if the simple out-patient education programme provided by refractory angina specialists was offered. The cost reductions are not clear, but some experts estimate that it could be as much as 90 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/23">Thirdly, we need to consider funding for NRAC. Only yesterday, the centre received referrals from Leicester, Inverness, Birmingham and Blackburn. While NRAC remains the only specialist centre in the country, it is vital that it has adequate resources for the care that it provides directly and also for the education of health care providers further afield so that patients do not have to travel so far for treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/24">Fourthly, we should look at rewarding outcomes. It is no secret that the Department is working on a large set of patient-reported outcome measures that will be published for consultation shortly. It is right that NHS provision should focus on quality, and the proposals are, therefore, welcome in principle. There are a number of detailed points that also need attention for them to work effectively for patients with refractory angina.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/25">PROMs take as their starting point a treatment intervention, but as I have discussed earlier, there are many examples of patients with refractory angina undergoing unnecessary treatments. There is a gap in the process of giving consent. That needs to be quality assured so that we can be sure that patients understand all the issues before an &quot;informed&quot; decision can meaningfully be given. Ignorance of the alternatives is not consistent with valid consent. One solution would be to give patients a checklist of evidence-based alternatives to palliative surgery. At the very least, that would ensure that they have heard of them. It would also reduce medico-legal vulnerability by ensuring that patients were aware of the options before treatment began.</p>
