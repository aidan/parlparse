<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-29b.78.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" speakername="Andrew Love" colnum="78"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061129/halltext/61129h0001.htm#06112991000466">
	<p pid="b.78.1/1">Yes. It would not seem to be beyond the ability of the international community or the Lebanese authorities to ensure that the tribunal also looks into the assassination of Minister Gemayel. That would be welcome, including, I am sure, in Lebanon. However, we have to await the evidence. All that I am saying is that we have to deprecate those who jump the gun and who have made accusations without any evidence to back them up.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.1/2">We await the recommendations of the Baker commission. I was watching television last night, and I gather that they will be out next week. I hope that the commission will, if nothing else, resolve the ambivalent attitude of the United States authorities to Syria and Iran. Yesterday, the President of the United States said that the Iranians were beyond the pale, but other spokesmen say different things. If it does nothing else, therefore, the Baker commission could at least resolve the question of whether there will be a dialogue. That would help enormously to resolve some of the problems that exist, particularly in relation to the arming of Hezbollah and the border incursions, which, if yesterday's events involving a suicide bomber at the border are anything to go by, are still very much under way.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.1/3">The good news is that Lebanon is beginning to get back on its feet, and the international community can do a great deal to re-establish a better image of itself in Lebanon by helping those involved in that process. However, we need to do that publicly, because the Lebanese are looking for our Government to put pressure on the other states in the region, to stand up for Lebanon and the Lebanese Government and to try to bring peace to their beleaguered country. Thank you.</p>

	<p pid="b.81.1/1">Not at the moment. I think that the Syrian Government feel that they are fixed in position; they see the potential for the entire thing to collapse if they begin to release the controls that have kept them in office, under the President and his father. Of course, there are people in the regime, as there are in many other Governments in the region, including the state of Israel, whose actions in trying to sustain the interests of their Governments do not bear very much examination according to the standards by which we should expect our Government to proceed, and by which we hold them to account through the courts. That is part of the challenge facing us&mdash;to extract people from positions in which their record of behaviour does not bear examination. We need a form of truth and reconciliation process for all the different communities; there are many different communities in the Lebanon, for example, with a record of the most brutal and violent internecine conflict. Looking back over a century, the record of those communities' interaction is a tragic and ugly story.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/2">Any attempt to use British influence to make progress means talking to all representative groups that have widespread support in their communities, even if we do not like their present politics and methods. The only way we can begin to pull standards forward is to engage with them. My instinct is that that is the position of the Prime Minister now, and it is a shame that it is happening at the end of his term of office, and that he is focusing on the issue when he is politically at his weakest. Indeed, that rather mirrors what seems to happen with American Administrations; Presidents at the end of their time in office always focus on the middle east as their authority and their ability to deliver wane.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/3">I believe that there are signs of hope, but hope will come only if we can engage with elements that we see at the moment as radical and rejectionist. Where they enjoy significant support in their populations, we need to guide, coax and encourage them into a much more constructive path. I hope that our Government can play, and are playing, a role in that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-29b.81.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1637" speakername="Tom Levitt" colnum="81"  time="010:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061129/halltext/61129h0002.htm#06112991000472">
	<p pid="b.81.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" name="Andrew Love">the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love)</phrase> on securing the debate. He and I, with my hon. Friends the Members for Dewsbury (Mr. Malik) and for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy) and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1514" name="Colin Breed">the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed)</phrase> were in the delegation in Lebanon a couple of weeks ago. As chairman of the all-party group on Lebanon, my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton was the de facto leader of the group, and he led us with good spirits through 15-hour days and the Beirut traffic, keeping our spirits up as far as was possible in the circumstances. I am also pleased to welcome my hon. Friend the Minister for the Middle East. Three times in the past 12 months I have come back from areas of conflict, and three times I have debated with him in this Chamber. It is a good relationship so far.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/2">Like my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton, I was profoundly moved and distressed by the images that we saw in Beirut and the south of Lebanon. There is no doubt that the killing of the eight Israeli soldiers and the kidnapping of two on the Lebanese border was wholly unnecessary and wrong, and the kidnapping should be remedied as soon as possible. The same applies to what is happening in Gaza as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/3">However, the way in which the Israelis responded to that situation, with the desolation and damage that we saw, was wholly disproportionate. We went to the village of Ait al-Chab, where virtually every house had been destroyed. According to Christian Aid, 54,000 homes were damaged or destroyed overall by Israeli attacks over 33 days, with 140 schools damaged. Why target schools? We visited a school for children with learning disabilities that was on a hill above the village. It had been bombed and destroyed, so 93 children from 23 different villages were being educated elsewhere, in just one room. We saw bridges that had been clinically taken out. Every single bridge on the motorway between Beirut and the south of the country had been taken out with precision bombing. We also saw places in Beirut where clinical attacks had removed blocks of flats with such precision as to leave scars like missing teeth in the fabric of the city.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/4">As well that, 1.2 million cluster bombs were used, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton said. We saw several of them first hand in olive groves, which has made it impossible for the harvest to be taken in this year and for people to get their businesses and livelihoods back together. Every day since the war ended, two people&mdash;mostly children&mdash;have died because of unexploded bombs. Those bombs have a 40 per cent. failure rate, which makes it inevitable that they will be dangerous and life threatening for a long time to come. Indeed, we were told that some of those munitions were already 30 years old. They were probably ex-Vietnam stock, and were rusted up and looked pretty lethal. The impact on us of what we saw will probably last a lifetime.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/5">Perhaps the most moving moment for me was when my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury and I visited the site at Qana where a block of flats had, I think, been taken out on the last day of the war. Some 29 people were killed, 17 of whom were children. Completely fortuitously and unplanned, we met an elderly man who had lost his brother, his son and his daughter-in-law, and three grandsons in the destruction of those flats. As far as we knew, there was no military reason for taking out that building. It was miles from anywhere and was not even particularly close to the border. I do not think that a satisfactory explanation for such wanton and wholly disproportionate destruction can ever be given.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/6">The good news is that there has been a cessation of hostilities since the middle of August&mdash;people were anxious that we regarded it as a cessation of hostilities, not as a ceasefire. As my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton said, there are still factors that bring into question whether a real ceasefire and withdrawal of forces is in operation. Those factors include the Shebaa farms and the over-flying&mdash;that is, the threatening use&mdash;of military aircraft, not to drop bombs, but simply to remind people of their presence and the nearby Israeli border. All those issues are yet to be resolved.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/7">I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1778" name="Crispin Blunt">the hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt)</phrase> on many things to do with the middle east. However, we had to wait 33 days for a ceasefire and, although I was one of those who called for early words from all sorts of sources to try to resolve the conflict, if words had been sufficient, I am sure that they would have been used. But words were never going to be sufficient, and it was always going to be more important to have a sustainable cessation of hostilities. That sustainability was always going to take longer to achieve than simply waving a magic wand. Therefore, although it is wholly regrettable that the war continued for 33 days, and although the Israelis could have stopped it at any time&mdash;having got compensation, as they saw it, for the attacks on their land&mdash;the fact that British people were at the United Nations, negotiating, talking and relating to other players in the field, and the fact that what has happened subsequently has proved to be 99.99 per cent. sustainable meant that it was worth going that extra mile and waiting those extra few days. Some of the politicians whom we met in Lebanon accepted that. They accepted that a worse solution would have been a ceasefire that broke down every few days.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/8">There are legitimate political arguments taking place in Lebanon. Although I am no expert on it, Lebanon has an interesting constitution, because it maintains that there should be statutory representation at the highest level for the Christian, Sunni and Shi'ite communities. That is under attack now, partly because of the political ascendancy of Hezbollah, partly because of a strong feeling that the one-to-one-to-one relationship in the constitution is 50 years out of date, and partly because of controversies around issues such as the United Nations investigation into the Hariri assassination. Although all parties superficially supported the UN investigation, it is clear that the pro-Syrian ones perhaps did not have their hearts in it. Indeed, the day before we arrived, five members of the Lebanese Cabinet walked out, bringing about a political crisis that was being dealt with as we were there.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/9">There have been other assassinations besides that of Hariri. We met the father of Mr. Tueni, who was killed a year ago, and there has been the killing of Gemayel since then. There has also been a rearrangement of some of the political alliances in Lebanon, with General Aoun's party occupying a different position on the political spectrum than in the past.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/10">There are 128 members of the Lebanese Parliament, of whom 14 are Hezbollah's elected representatives. The view that Hezbollah politicians put forward within the democratic context must be acknowledged as a genuinely legitimate part of the Lebanese political spectrum. We met Hezbollah politicians who were committed to democracy and the parliamentary route, but who were nevertheless using the present lack of clarity in Lebanese politics precipitated by the war to push home what they saw as their political ascendancy. That has been caused by the feeling, particularly in the south of the country, that Hezbollah's military wing successfully resisted the Israeli incursion&mdash;that is not my interpretation, but my feeling of what people were thinking in that part of the country. When an organisation such as Hezbollah is not only seen to be actively defending people's interests and delivering aid to them&mdash;by providing cash directly to homeless families, for example&mdash;but seen to be a legitimate political force, that organisation will be in the ascendancy.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/11">Putting the war aside for a moment, I am sure that the reason for Hezbollah's ascendancy is exactly the reason Hamas was so successful in Palestine earlier in the year, as the hon. Member for Reigate said. The reason is to do with the effects on the economy, and therefore the self-confidence of the countries that are directly affected by the way in which Israel has undermined the operation of their economies. The Lebanese economy in the south of the country is non-existent in exactly the same way as the economy of the west bank is made non-functional by the network of roads, settlements, roadblocks and occupation there.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/12">Lebanon is at a historic crossroads, as it has always been in 1,000 years of history. Its democratic tradition is under threat&mdash;it is certainly wobbly&mdash;and we need to support its democratic institutions such as its Parliament. We need to support its President, its Prime Minister and all those committed to the democratic way. We must ensure that they are not undermined by the threat of war and its effect on the economy, society and civilisation of Lebanon.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/13">At present in Lebanon, there are 1.2 million unexploded cluster bombs, which threaten people's lives daily, and half a million land mines, some of which have been there for more than 20 years. Such a country cannot function as we would hope and expect.</p>

	<p pid="b.88.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" name="Andrew Love">the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love)</phrase> and other colleagues who participated in the debate. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" name="Jeremy Browne">the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne)</phrase> pointed out, it went from a narrow perspective on Lebanon to consider the whole of the middle east.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/2">May I begin by putting down a marker? I shall try to do it in the most non-partisan way, as I believe that the Minister may well agree, although he cannot say so. In the debate on the Queen's Speech last week, the Foreign Secretary said that there had been many debates over the past year on the middle east. I want to put it on record that the overwhelming majority of debates held on the Floor of the House and in Westminster Hall, almost without exception, have come about as a consequence of hon. Members asking for them or Opposition parties calling for them and giving up their time, or because the Government were forced to come to the House to answer an urgent question. Given the seriousness of the situation in the middle east&mdash;I shall move on to that in a second&mdash;it is in the Government's interest to table a debate in their time, without necessarily having a vote, on Government strategy on the middle east across the board.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/3">My former pupil, King Abdullah of Jordan&mdash;it is not possible to have a better line than that. As I have said before, among the many officer cadets who went through my hands I have at one extreme one who is serving Her Majesty in jail, and at least one who has become a king. King Abdullah&mdash;&mdash;I agree with the hon. Member for Taunton that he is a very shrewd man&mdash;said in a speech the other day that he feared that within the next few months we would see three civil wars in the middle east: one in Palestine, one in Lebanon and one in Iraq. I think that all hon. Members are only too conscious that there is a danger that a series of conflicts are about to morph into one major conflict that could break out in the middle east. The seriousness of the situation should not be underestimated and the challenges are enormous.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/4">This is not necessarily an accurate analogy, but at times I despair that the Lebanon, which has so much going for it in many respects&mdash;natural resources, an innovative population, a sophisticated society and, at its best, a society that is pluralistic, includes many ethnic groups and religions and has shown in periods of its history that it can work&mdash;is in danger of turning itself into the Weimar republic of the middle east, if it is not already in that position. I use that example because it shows a democracy that is slowly being destroyed by political groupings that participate in that democracy but have paramilitary forces that resort to violence and assassination and will use parliamentary democracy ultimately to destroy that state.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/5">We know what we are talking about. It is the fear of any secular Muslim in the middle east and elsewhere; there is an undoubted aim to establish an Islamic fundamentalist state in Lebanon, and not only in Lebanon but in Iraq, Egypt and elsewhere. That is not in the interests not only of the millions of Arabs who are domiciled in the middle east but of those of the Islamic faith elsewhere in the world. That is the challenge for us all. I do not have an easy answer for how to cope with political parties that participate in the parliamentary process but, at the same time, have armed militias and are prepared to assassinate. That will be the challenge not only for our Government but for the American Government as well. We should try to work out what we should not do as much as what we should.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/6">I want, too, to emphasise the fact that there are no quick fixes. I do not think that any hon. Members have suggested that. The idea that the President of the United States of America, our Prime Minister and others could have come up with a quick fix this summer is from cloud cuckoo land. Also from cloud cuckoo land is the idea that within the next couple of months, as we wait for the Iraq study group to report, it will somehow come up with a single brilliant answer that will resolve the situation in Iraq. Frankly, when this morning's sitting is over, I would be happy to buy all my colleagues who are in the Chamber a cup of coffee and give them all half an hour and a sheet of paper to come up with some suggestions, and they will more or less mirror whatever the Iraq study group comes up with. I do not say that in a light-hearted way, but we end up building false hope. We are going to be in for the long haul.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/7">In terms of the debate that we have had so far, I agree that much of the problem in Lebanon has been caused by external forces, whether they are Israel, Syria, Iranian support for Hezbollah or the failures of the so-called great powers in one way or another. However, in many respects, part of the solution is in the hands of the people living in Lebanon. There is always the danger when one goes to the middle east and talks to the people that the excuse is that it is somebody else's fault. That is partly true, and by expecting the international community and individual countries to bail them out they may put off the evil day, but much of the solution is in their hands.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/8">I believe that what our Government do and can do over the next few months will be important. There will be no quick fixes. I think that the Prime Minister is genuine in what he wants to do in the middle east. Like my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1778" name="Crispin Blunt">the Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt)</phrase>, I suspect, sadly, that, because the Prime Minister has announced that he is going, with the best will in the world his influence will obviously be less than we would hope for a British Prime Minister. The one thought that allows me some optimism&mdash;sadly we are about to go through a period of great change&mdash;is that realism has broken out in Washington and we are about to see a reversion to a more sophisticated approach not only to the middle east but to the kinds of things that the US Government might do to use something other than fairly blunt instruments.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/9">It is easy to load a lot of the blame for the situation in Lebanon and the Palestinian Authority on the Israeli Government. There is no doubt that the Israeli Government have made serious errors, but I want to conclude by saying two things about Israel. First, despite its many faults, it is a democracy in an area where there are few democracies. It is possible to criticise the Israeli Government and go into opposition. Secondly, it would be unwise to underestimate the ability of the Israeli Government to respond after a recent operational defeat, which Lebanon undoubtedly was. We need Israel to participate fully in any wider middle east peace settlement. Without the Israelis, there will be no peace.</p>

	<p pid="b.92.1/1">I am very glad to respond to that because when I was in Beirut in the middle of the bombardment Prime Minister Siniora stressed to me that the Shebaa farms were, in many ways, the most potent motivation expressed by Hezbollah. He said, &quot;Sort that out and a big weapon will be taken away from them.&quot; I do not know if that is true or the effect that Shebaa farms has on Hezbollah. As the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk hinted, Hezbollah has a much wider agenda than that. But, Shebaa farms does not help and there is no question about that. We have pressed the United Nations to ensure that the right resources are allocated to delineate those borders properly in order to prevent an argument between Syria and Lebanon about how the Shebaa farms situation should be resolved.</p>

	<p pid="b.106.0/1">I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak in this debate, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on raising this important issue. I have taken a long and close interest in the railway system, not least because I have been a commuter for 27 years on First Capital Connect, which was Thameslink and, before that, British Rail.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.0/2">I study the railways with interest and read about the subject, and I have many friends and colleagues in the railway industry who tell me on a daily basis what is actually going on. My comments are based on some background of knowledge and are not just made from a position of prejudice, even though it is probably well known to everyone here that I do not think that privatisation was a good idea and that I strongly believe that the railways should be reintegrated into a publicly owned system.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.0/3">I have recently heard surprising comments from private enterprise members of the railway industry, who said that they had overheard a Treasury official saying that the reason why we privatised the railway system was &quot;to promote its decline&quot;&mdash;those were the words that were used. Before that, apparently, another Treasury official, who was put on the board of BR, said, &quot;I have come on to the board to oversee the decline of the railway industry.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.106.0/4">There was a profound disbelief in the railways among Governments and among politicians in general. We believed collectively&mdash;I am not talking about us personally&mdash;that the railways were a system of the past and that the future would be the roads. I understand, although this might be apocryphal, that Mrs. Thatcher believed that railways were inherently socialist because they were collective and people travelled together, whereas the true freedom-lover, the individual, would always drive by car.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.0/5">That story might not be true, but apparently it was true that there were plans at one point possibly to close Midland Mainline and the line that goes through my constituency. That was at the extreme of the mania for road travel. I think that the world has realised that a terrible mistake was made and that we can never all get on to the roads. They are now incredibly crowded. Setting aside any concerns about carbon dioxide, we need our railways. The fact that millions more people are travelling on the railways every year demonstrates that the population&mdash;our constituents&mdash;believe in railways, which will be more important in future as we deal with environmental problems and the population density of this country. It is possible that the population of this country will rise to 70 million and we will need more transport, so the narrow, fast corridors that rail provides will be vital.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.0/6">The franchise that serves my constituents is First Capital Connect, and before that it was Thameslink. One of the features of privatisation was vertical disintegration: the rolling stock is owned by rolling stock leasing companies or ROSCOs&mdash;essentially the banks&mdash;who lease them to the train operating companies, who buy time on the track owned initially by Railtrack and now by Network Rail. Even Conservative Members realise that that vertical disintegration was a terrible mistake and that vertical integration is the way forward. If we have vertical integration, the franchises will disappear and will be integrated into another sort of railway organisation, be it public or private. Over time, it might even start to look a little like British Rail. At a meeting at Westminster, the former regulator, Tom Windsor, said that the only thing that was wrong with British Rail was that it handed over the railway network to Railtrack &quot;in good order&quot; but that the problem was that there was desperate under-investment. The network had been starved of investment for decades.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.0/7">If one compares the level of investment in railways in Britain with that in railways on the continent, one can see the difference. We are now trying to make up lost ground. Unfortunately, we are doing that in the private sector instead of the public sector and that costs a lot more. My friends in the railway industry suggest that, for example, the cost of laying a mile of railway track is now between four and five times what it was under British Rail when costs were held down by cash limits and work was carried out by directly employed staff who did a superb job and, as Tom Windsor said,</p>
	<p pid="b.106.0/8" class="indent">&quot;worked miracles on a pittance.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.106.0/9">Had we had more foresight, we would not be in our present position. We would have a much better, modern railway system with better investment and the work would be done much more cheaply.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.0/10">The franchises are relatively short term, so there is not much incentive to invest, and we are going to integrate them and make them longer term. If all the risk is held by the Government, who pay the bill and are responsible to the electorate, what is the point of having the system in the private sector if it is inherently subsidised and non-profit-making? The system is not sensible and we shall look back on it as a period of political madness.</p>

	<p pid="b.109.0/1">It is in the Treasury's interest and that of all rail operators to have more bums on seats&mdash;more passengers paying their way on the trains. Is he aware that Passenger Focus's recent research shows that the aspirations of the Cross Country franchise would lead to 2.8 million fewer passenger journeys a year, predominantly because everyone travelling to the south coast or the south-west from north of Crewe&mdash;and from Oxenholme in my constituency&mdash;would have to change at Birmingham New Street station?

	<p pid="b.109.5/1">I accept entirely what the hon. Gentleman said. Indeed, I made the point earlier that the railway system was under-invested in for decades by successive Governments of both parties. As Tom Windsor said, people</p>
	<p pid="b.109.5/2" class="indent">&quot;worked miracles on a pittance&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.5/3">We did not have the investment then, and one has only to go to foreign countries to see what such investment can achieve. I recently went from Cologne to Frankfurt on a fantastic high-speed line, 30 per cent. of which was in tunnels. Those involved had spent a very large sum on it, but we are nervous about spending money. The private sector, however, spends three or four times what we need to spend, because it is so inefficient at building. However, I understand, Mr. Weir, that we are talking about franchises and train operators, rather than the track.</p>

	<p pid="b.110.1/1">Indeed. That is absolutely right. I went to yesterday's briefing by Network Rail's chief executive, who said how much improvement there had been. One great advantage of the franchise system, of course, is that when the franchises come to an end, they can simply be handed over to the national railway operator, which might be Network Rail plus operators. There is no problem about buying the franchises, because they are just handed over when they come to an end. If we bought them in beforehand, of course, things would be more difficult.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/2">My hon. Friend is right that we are moving progressively towards the reintegration of our rail industry and something like a modern version of British Rail, although it would, I hope, have a lot more investment. It would be easy to move in that direction and it would not be costly: we could just hand the franchises over to John Armitt and his chums and we would be moving back towards a publicly owned railway.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/3">I should add that if the ROSCOs are going to rip off the purse in the way that they have in the past, we should say, &quot;Right, we are a monopoly buyer. We will pay this amount for your trains. If you don't like it, sell them to us at a knock-down price, and we'll buy them back in.&quot; There would be a cost, but it would not be prohibitive. At the same time, we could possibly do a deal to reduce the leasing charges and lease operations until such time as, bit by bit, they all come back into public ownership.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/4">My hon. Friend is right to suggest that we are moving back towards a publicly owned, integrated national railway system. Unfortunately, Front Benchers on both sides do not want to be seen to be allowing something to be recreated in the public sector, because that goes against the zeitgeist&mdash;the spirit of the times&mdash;which is all for privatisation, and the slightest step back from that might persuade some people that there is a case for public ownership, not just in the railways, but perhaps elsewhere. However, we are talking about how the franchises could be quickly integrated with the rail network operators to recreate a national railway system.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/5">At present, there are too few incentives in the system to provide a good service, keep trains in good order, make rides comfortable and provide enough stock. Another problem that has resulted on my line as a result of the franchise system is that there is a shortage of stock. Those who know the Thameslink network will know that there has to be a dual-voltage operation, because there is AC on the north side and DC on the south side. There have to be special trains with both types of motor, but there is a limited number of them. Some are actually held by another franchisee, but it will not let them be transferred to our franchisee, which needs them.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/6">At peak times, as I have experienced myself, there is a four-car operation instead of an eight-car operation, even as far out as Luton. We are so short of sets that if one set goes out of operation, it becomes a scrum to get to work. Even I have occasionally had to stand, even though I travel in from as far out as Luton, and people will certainly have to stand by the time that the trains reach St. Albans. That is unacceptable. We need more trains and more stock. Even now, there is stock that could be transferred to Thameslink, but it is not being transferred. The reasons are complicated reasons, and the franchisees cannot agree on the issue. With an integrated national system, however, that stock could simply be transferred, and we could have optimal use of all stock in all regions. That would make for a much better railway and much more comfort for my constituents and for all those who travel on lines such as mine.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/7">I think that I have made my point. I did not expect to have quite this much time and I am surprised that many more Members do not wish to speak on this subject. My speech has therefore been rather longer than I thought that it would be, but my basic point is that the franchise system is nonsense. It should be wound up quickly by integrating the train operating companies with Network Rail and by beginning to recreate a sensible national integrated railway system. Thank you.</p>

	<p pid="b.111.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on his highly topical choice of subject for debate: we had the Network Rail annual report on Monday and the announcement on regulated fares yesterday.

	<p pid="b.111.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">The hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> will not be surprised to hear that I approach the issue from a different philosophical perspective from him. I should like to disabuse him of his notions about the prevailing culture in the Treasury in the run-up to privatisation. Between 1994 and 1997, I was either at the Treasury or the Department of Transport, and it is a travesty of the truth to portray the policy towards the railways as a sinister conspiracy to run them down. What one wanted to do was to release them from the constraints of public sector funding and the Treasury and to unlock their potential to allow them to expand. In my time at the Department of Transport or the Treasury, I certainly met no officials who held the views that the hon. Gentleman describes.</p>

	<p pid="b.112.0/1">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the leadership coming from the top of both Departments was heavily tilted the other way and that the policy he describes was certainly not the Government's policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/2">Closer to home&mdash;to revert to the speech by the hon. Member for Twickenham&mdash;my constituents are also talking about the railways, because work by Network Rail has overrun on two successive weekends, as a result of which my journey from Andover on Monday took two hours instead of one. Network Rail says that it has a grip on the contracts, but the contractor has overrun on two successive weekends, causing considerable disruption on the network. Such problems are not assisted by Network Rail's reported inability to spend all the money that it has been allocated, because of some byzantine investment processes.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/3">The hon. Member for Twickenham may not know that the first franchise train to run in this country left Twickenham station at about five o'clock in the morning one February in, I think, 1996. Somewhere in my archives, I have the first ticket to be sold by a franchised operator, and I was escorted on that historic first journey by Toby Jessell, who was the Member for Twickenham at the time.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/4">As the hon. Member for Luton, North implied, the previous Administration's policies on the railways was among their more controversial, but I would argue that the concept of franchising was sound and successful. We have created an industry that did not exist before&mdash;a train operating industry. Before that, all we had was British Rail, the monopoly that operated the railways. If it did not perform, we could not sack it and we could not get anybody else in&mdash;we were stuck with it. Franchising has enabled successful operators of other modes of transport&mdash;airways, buses and ferries&mdash;to apply their skills to the railways. We would not have been able to take that approach had we not privatised the railways and restructured them in the way that we did.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/5">Franchising has also enabled the taxpayer and the passenger to benefit from the constant re-bidding for the franchises and to capture the extra value, which one simply could not do when British Rail was the provider. Coupled with privatisation, franchising has led to additional investment in the railways, which we would not have had before, when we were wholly dependent on what we could get out of the Treasury. If anybody fails, as has happened, others are willing to take over and to do a better job. We could not have had that before.</p>

	<p pid="b.115.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on initiating the debate. He has made several points about South West Trains and the new franchise that will be echoed across the country as the new franchises elsewhere are set out. I want to consider some of those and set out what I believe should be the vision for the railway industry in the future. Interesting though the debate was between <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase>, it is a debate for the past, and it does not deal with the present and future needs of the railway industry and passenger commuters.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.1/2">Whatever else we might say, the railways are in a period of unparalleled growth. Passenger numbers and investment are up, and no doubt the Minister will tell us about the &pound;88 million a week that the Government are investing, which is welcome, and the &pound;1.1 billion subsidy that is given to the network each year. My concern is that the management of the railways addresses neither the continued growth of the railway industry nor passenger demand for decent services. As my hon. Friend said, the predicted growth on South West Trains, and one person saying that it will introduce new rolling stock, is contradicted by the reality of seat removal, and my information from Angel Trains whereby South West Trains has been told that it cannot purchase new rolling stock or expand the service.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.1/3">If one considers the Government's plans for growth in new house building in the south-east and the south-west, one sees an immediate contradiction between the Government's transport policy and the reality of other policies. Last night I met business representatives from Colchester. They were concerned at the amount of house building planned in their area, and the fact that there are no plans within the franchise to expand the service. There is a contradiction between Government policies on house building and growth, and the letting of franchises.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-29b.119.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" speakername="Julian Brazier" colnum="119"  time="015:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061129/halltext/61129h0007.htm#06112991000533">
	<p pid="b.119.0/1">Indeed, but we are here to discuss franchising. I shall make a number of points on the relationship between franchisees and the track.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/2">The Opposition transport team has been taking part in a large number of discussions on the future of the railways. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1927" name="Stephen Hammond">the Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond)</phrase> has engaged during the past 12 months with the directors of every single franchisee company. It is because he is at a conference that a shadow Minister with responsibility for shipping and aviation rather than he is replying from the Opposition Front Bench.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/3">I make no apologies for privatisation. Not only did it deliver the first new trains to my constituency in 40 years, it resulted in a 30 per cent. growth in passenger numbers during the past decade. The Conservative party is firmly committed to trains, not just because of the collective need to tackle CO2 emissions but because of the reduction in congestion that it offers for road users. The view that we have come to, as has been mentioned several times, is that the current structure of the railway network and franchising system is not fit to meet the capacity challenge.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/4">There are a number of reasons. The relationship between franchisees and Network Rail, although it has improved, has tended to be dominated by disputes as each apportions blame for delays to the other. Endless man-hours are wasted deciding who is responsible for lost passenger-minutes and how large a fine one party owes the other. The greatest irony is that because of the huge subsidy that the railways receive, the money passed back and forth comes from the public anyway. That is one of the reasons why ticket prices have just seen a fourth annual inflation-busting rise, as my right hon. Friend said.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/5">My hon. Friend recently visited the new joint control centre at Swindon, where he saw a little cameo of the situation. The centre was supposed to herald a new, constructive relationship between Network Rail and the train operating companies. It should come as no surprise to hear that a significant portion of the building's floor space has been assigned to&mdash;wait for it&mdash;the delay attribution team. A similar experience was described to me by a commuter who, after bricks fell off a bridge and as they sat for an hour and a half waiting for the muddle to be cleared, heard a conversation back and forth between the train driver and someone on the other end who was clearly trying to gather data to ensure that Railtrack and not the operator took the blame. That illustrates that the relationship is not working at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/6">The bidding process has figured in this debate. It is another aspect of franchising that has gone seriously awry. What we have witnessed during the tendering process is the Government's ever-increasing desire to recoup from train operating companies some of the vast sums that have been spent on the rail networks since the demise of Railtrack. The companies, in turn, have ratcheted up their bids in the knowledge that the overriding point of interest to the Department, or rather the Treasury, is the size of the premium they are willing to pay. Christopher Garnett, former chief executive of GNER, made the well-publicised comment that it was far better to overbid drastically for a new franchise than to underbid and lose it. Yet there is no point in the Department accepting absurdly high bids when it is quite clear that they cannot be met. My hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon alluded to GNER's particular problems as a result of a court judgment, but the wider point applies. Everyone ends up losing out. Fares go on and on rising to cover the premiums, and the taxpayer ends up forking out when the premiums cannot be delivered.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/7">The Government should be awarding contracts not just to the highest bidder but to the one that shows that it has serious plans for enhancing the service it wants to operate. Unfortunately, recently re-awarded franchises have been tied up with such tight specifications that the operating companies are left with little or no room to innovate. It is clear that the franchising process is going wrong mainly because of too much Government interference at the time of setting and sometimes subsequently. Can it really be right that 12 civil servants are involved in writing timetables? Is it not madness that all procurement decisions lie in the last resort with Government? Is it not altogether crazy that in 2006, the Secretary of State has operational involvement in and control of the railways? It must stop. Politicians should set and agree the railways' strategic framework with industry and passenger groups&mdash;a number of speakers have made it clear that that is not happening&mdash;but the railway professionals should run the railways. The Government should not be in the business of micro-managing them, but unfortunately they are.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/8">The Transport Committee report has been referred to several times, but I shall quote it:</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/9" class="indent">&quot;The Government has embraced the notion that private enterprise is best at delivering high-quality, innovative services such as the passenger railways, and yet it does not trust companies to deliver these services without highly detailed and specific contractual requirements which reduce the scope for innovation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/10">I entirely agree. The Government need to stop dictating and give the companies that operate the railways the scope to respond to demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/11">Undoubtedly the greatest failure of the current franchising system is the fact that it does not allow for capacity increases in line with the rise in passenger numbers. That problem is going to get worse. The Office of Rail Regulation forecasts that although passenger numbers will grow by 28 per cent. by 2014, rail capacity will grow by just 2 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.124.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right; it is not the only thing that is considered. A great deal of work is done to ensure that any potential premium that may be paid by a future franchisee is deliverable. That is a crucial part of the franchising process.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/2">The hon. Member for Twickenham mentioned the impact of open access on GNER. He was suggesting, I think, that the impact of open access operators on the east coast mainline was responsible for some of the problems that GNER is reported to be having. However, no open access operator gets access to the railway unless it can convince the Office of the Rail Regulator that that will have no significant impact on the revenue of existing franchises. They must always be given precedence over any open access operator, for the simple reason that open access operators do not pay track access charges.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/3">Vertical integration was mentioned. I accept what the hon. Member for Canterbury says; a debate can be had, and the Government do not shirk from that. However, as the Transport Committee's report into rail franchising makes clear, there is not much of a case to be made for vertical integration in respect of the benefits that might be achieved by going for that particular structure. Of course the Government would be willing to look at particular proposals made by particular authorities and operators, but in my experience train operators do not want the responsibility of repairing infrastructure and the infrastructure companies do not want the responsibility of operating trains.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/4">Stagecoach is committed to increasing the passenger performance measure from the present level of 90.1 per cent., as a moving annual average, to 92.5 per cent. by 2009-10 and 93.3 per cent. by the end of the franchise. To put that in perspective, at present the national average of all train companies is 87.6 per cent., so whatever criticism has been levelled at South West Trains during this debate, its performance is well above the average of any of the train operating companies.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/5">The franchise builds on progress already made. Recent timetable changes have brought about high reliability and extra services. All the train companies have been criticised for increasing fares. South West Trains currently runs some of the lowest fares on the network. It runs a low-cost operation called Megatrain&mdash;the equivalent, I guess, of the low-cost airlines&mdash;on a limited number of services on selected routes, and Stagecoach proposes to continue the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/6">I turn to the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North. Neither I nor the Government approach the structure of the railways ideologically. We do not look at the privatised railways and conclude that, because they are private, they are good.</p>

	<p pid="b.126.1/1">I disagree. I should point out that since the new franchisee took over that franchise, performance has been at least maintained or, as the hon. Member for Canterbury says, improved.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/2">What would be the point of renationalising the rail industry unless we could show benefits for the travelling passenger? We have the highest safety record in history and performance that, although not at an all-time high, has certainly improved greatly since the Hatfield incident in 2000. Record investment is going into the network. In the context of the more than 1 billion passenger journeys being made&mdash;the highest level since 1946, I believe&mdash;what would be gained?</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/3">I say with all respect to my hon. Friends the Members for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) and for Luton, North that the only thing to be gained would be the ticking of an ideological box to say, &quot;We are on the left; we are a socialist party&quot;. I am not convinced that moving into the public sector would achieve anything except the wearing of a left-wing conscience on our shoulders.</p>

	<p pid="b.128.0/1">On that point, would the hon. Gentleman agree that there is great inconsistency? The region qualified for convergence funding, yet despite the avowed objective of such funding to get high-skilled, well paid jobs into west Wales, we now face this situation. In my constituency, not only will we lose 37 jobs, but we have already lost two jobcentres and a social security office. The loss of all those high-skilled jobs has a real impact on small communities such as the ones that he and I represent.</p>

	<p pid="b.128.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. There is a glaring inconsistency and potential incompatibility between what is proposed and the wider aims of the objective 1 programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/2">The economy of west Wales, like that of many peripheral rural areas, is characterised by low-margin activities such as agriculture and tourism, and low levels of manufacturing and business services. The result is that Pembrokeshire's economy is dominated by micro-businesses: more than 83 per cent. of businesses employ fewer than five people, and a high proportion of workers are self-employed. In many places in the region, the public sector is actually the dominant economic activity, so when the Government take a knife to the public sector in places such as Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, they risk seriously undermining the local economies. At a time when numerous Government agencies are trying hard to create new sustainable jobs in mid and west Wales, it is perverse that another arm of government should remove excellent skilled jobs from the communities. I would welcome the Paymaster General's views on the compatibility of the initial HMRC proposals with the objective 1 programme in mid and west Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/3">I would also be grateful if the Paymaster General could comment on how the plans would help deliver on the stated aim of the Welsh Assembly Government to move public sector jobs out of Cardiff and distribute them more equitably in the Welsh regions. It seems that the HMRC proposals would do precisely the opposite. What discussions have there been between her Department and officials at the Assembly about that?</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/4">The starting point for the reorganisation was, of course, the merger between Revenue and Customs last year, which has led to the need for some rationalisation in the office estate. Bringing accommodation back in line with operational requirements seems entirely sensible and reasonable, and I believe that most Members would agree wholeheartedly that an efficient public sector is a good thing and that the Government have a duty to maximise value to taxpayers. I would go further than that and say that Ministers should positively seek out opportunities for streamlining operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/5">But what we are discussing in this case is not the streamlining of back-office functions but deep and severe cuts in the front line of a vital public service. I find it hard to square the proposals that were outlined in &quot;Transforming HMRC&quot; with the stated aim of the review to ensure that &quot;service standards are improved&quot;. For example, my local office in Haverfordwest is one of those earmarked for closure. It employs some 65 staff&mdash;making it one of the largest employers in the town&mdash;in the debt management and banking function. Those people recover money for the Exchequer. Their work involves visits to homes. In fact, visits are a vital part of their operation. How can that be done remotely from a centre in Cardiff?</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/6">The compliance function will be affected. All the work carried out by the compliance team in Haverfordwest is location-specific; that is, it must be undertaken in the locality. It includes visits to businesses to examine records. Again, I ask how such work can be done efficiently from a processing super-office in Cardiff.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/7">Then there is the processing function itself, or what is known in rural areas as distributed processing, which is the business of processing self-assessed tax returns. I understand that all that work is to be centralised in Cardiff. Could the Paymaster General offer some clues as to how those functions will be delivered to individuals and businesses in Pembrokeshire and across Wales to the same or a better standard by a centralised contact centre in Cardiff?</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/8">The other local office in Pembrokeshire is in Pembroke Dock. It focuses mainly on collection of excise from the two oil refiners. I understand that there is also a VAT team at that office. There is a no longer a permanent Customs presence working on detection at the port; the intelligence side of things is now based in Birmingham. I have been told that the VAT team at Pembroke Dock is comprised entirely of ex-uniform staff. One employee suggested to me that, given the Government's renewed interest in border security, it would be easy to transfer staff to a new Customs and security team if VAT jobs are to go from Pembroke Dock. Perhaps things will come full circle and we will have a proper uniformed Customs presence once again in Pembrokeshire. I ask the Paymaster General to comment on that idea.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/9">The Federation of Small Businesses in Wales stated that there is genuine concern among businesses about the impact of the proposed cuts on the quality of service from HMRC. Many of the businesses are small businesses or self-employed people who do not have specific expertise in finance, accounting or taxation, so they value local contact with HMRC. The FSB stated that there is a danger that HMRC will increasingly be perceived as</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/10" class="indent">&quot;a faceless agency of enforcement rather than an agency able to afford help and advice&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/11">I note that, under the terms of the review, HMRC is specifically committed to retaining a face-to-face service in all locations where such a service currently exists. Given the sheer scale of the proposed cuts outlined in the document, it is incumbent on the Paymaster General to spell out just how such face-to-face service can be maintained to a high standard when the offices themselves will disappear. Is not the problem that HMRC simply does not see small businesses and places such as Pembrokeshire and rural west Wales as key customers? I noted the press statement from the Treasury on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-20">20 November</phrase> that announced the implementation of the recommendations of the Varney review into links with large businesses. The positive approach to providing big business with a high-quality tax service contrasts, I am afraid, with the message being sent out by the proposals that we are discussing this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/12">What assessment does the Paymaster General make of the potential for lost revenue as a result of the proposed reorganisation? I understand that her Department will save some &pound;74 million nationally by cutting some 2,500 compliance jobs, but that its own figures identify that it will lose &pound;250 million in yield to the Exchequer. It might be that she considers that the potential loss in yield as a result of the new wave of centralisation will be less than the efficiency margin that can be squeezed out, which would make it worth while, but I would be very sceptical. In any case, such calculations should be in the public domain.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/13">I want to conclude&mdash;rather negatively I am afraid&mdash;by drawing attention to a letter to me from the Paymaster General dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-28">28 July</phrase> this year about the HMRC estate in which she said:</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/14" class="indent">&quot;There are no current plans for closure of Haverfordwest or any other offices in West Wales.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/15">She signed off the letter cheerily with the comment:</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/16" class="indent">&quot;I hope your constituents will find this letter helpful.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/17">No, they do not. Just four months down the line, they are staring at a massive programme of office closures and job cuts by HMRC in Pembrokeshire and across Wales. This is not the first time my constituents have been given an assurance in writing or from the Dispatch Box about a threatened local service in Pembrokeshire only for that assurance to appear totally and utterly worthless just a matter of weeks or months later. I refer specifically to an assurance we were given about the future of Withybush hospital last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/18">Coming back to these proposals, I hope that the Paymaster General will look hard at what is proposed in the document and at how it impacts on west Wales. I believe that if she considers the evidence, she will see that the proposed closures fly in the face of Westminster and Welsh Assembly Government economic policy towards the objective 1 area, that they will cause real economic damage to a number of sensitive areas, that they will not lead to an improved taxation service for businesses in west Wales and that they risk further undermining the accessibility, reputation and perception of HMRC in the eyes of honest taxpaying individuals, families and companies. I look forward to her reply.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-29b.139.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" speakername="Vernon Coaker" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department"  colnum="139"  time="016:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061129/halltext/61129h0010.htm#06112991000570">
	<p pid="b.139.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1535" name="Mark Todd">the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd)</phrase> on securing this debate and on his timing in having it the day after the announcement of the police funding settlement. That was a brilliant piece of intuition. This is not the first time that he has contributed to a debate on police funding and policing in Derbyshire: he has been a regular contributor to such debates for a number of years. I am sure that his constituents recognise that he has fought assiduously for the best possible police service.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.0/2">From what my hon. Friend has told me about the good work of the local crime and disorder partnership in south Derbyshire in combating crime and establishing a good partnership, I know that it has led people to feel safer in their communities and made a real contribution to the work that is being done. I hope that he feels that he is making a contribution to everything in his own area. I am glad to see him supported here by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1373" name="Judy Mallaber">the Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber)</phrase>. We are also joined by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1536" name="Patrick McLoughlin">the right hon. Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.0/3">I wish to discuss the announcement of the national funding, and the funding picture in general, before turning to the specifics in Derbyshire. This time last year, we announced the provisional allocations for both 2006-07 and 2007-08. Police forces and police authorities have welcomed the extra certainty brought by the two-year settlements, which is why we will move to a three-year settlement next year. All police authorities and forces have received a 3.6 per cent. increase in the general formula grant, which makes up the great bulk of central Government support to the police. Adding in specific grants, capital support and central spending, the overall increase in Government spending on policing is 3.1 per cent. That represents a generous settlement for the police, as I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire knows, coming at a time when inflation is at 2.7 per cent. It builds on a series of similarly generous settlements.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.0/4">To put that into context, funding for the police service as a whole will have increased by &pound;4.2 billion between 2000-01 and 2007-08, an increase of 62 per cent. Such sustained increases are unprecedented and demonstrate the Government's commitment to law and order and to a well financed police service.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.0/5">I turn specifically to the Derbyshire police force. Like every other force, it has benefited from the generous funding settlements of the past few years. Following the normal consultation process, to which my hon. Friend will be able to contribute, if the House approves the provisional allocations that were announced yesterday, Derbyshire will next year receive &pound;105.8 million in general grants and &pound;18 million in specific grants. Compared with the total of &pound;92.4 million in 2000-01, that is an increase of well over a third. From 2006-07 to 2007-08, there will be a 3.7 per cent. increase, which is a cash total of &pound;3.8 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.0/6">As my hon. Friend noted, the products of the investment can clearly be seen. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March</phrase>, Derbyshire had 2,046 police officers, which is 255 more than in March 1997, and 1,084 support staff&mdash;an increase of 361 from 1997. There were also 42 community support officers, which were an innovation of the Labour Government. He will remember that the idea of introducing CSOs was controversial, whereas now everyone is trying to get more of them. There are 42 in Derbyshire so far, and 429 special constables.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.0/7">All that is significant, but as well as looking at resources we must consider what the taxpayer is getting for all the extra investment. Those results are also impressive both nationally and in Derbyshire. In Derbyshire, overall recorded crime has fallen by 21 per cent. in the past three years. That equates to more than 20,000 fewer victims of crime. Vehicle crime fell by 41 per cent. between April 2003 and March 2006, and domestic burglary fell by more than half. In the past year, violent crime has fallen by 4 per cent. and drug offences by 17 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.0/8">I take this opportunity to pay tribute to everyone concerned at Derbyshire for their efforts and for the real improvements they have made to the safety of constituents in Derbyshire. I echo the words of Janet Birkin, the chair of Derbyshire police authority, who recently said:</p>
	<p pid="b.139.0/9" class="indent">&quot;We are absolutely delighted with the force's performance which demonstrates that Derbyshire remains a safe place to live, work and visit.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.139.0/10">I know that my hon. Friends the Members for South Derbyshire and for Amber Valley will agree with that.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.0/11">I give all that information to set the context for the debate, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire did. Whatever complaints police authorities and forces may have are set against the background of substantial increases in funding for all forces and significant falls in the volume of crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.0/12">Derbyshire police forces and others in the east midlands have suggested that they are relatively underfunded compared with forces in other parts of England and Wales. My hon. Friend also made that point. One argument advanced to support that point is that the funding per head of the population in the east midlands is lower than in other regions, but population has never been the sole measure on which police funding is determined. A moment's thought reveals that using population alone would be a crude and inaccurate way of determining the relative policing needs of each area and therefore the allocation of resources to individual police forces. We have to take account of the demographic composition of the population, including wealth and employment status, and factors such as population density.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.0/13">All those elements are factored into the relative needs formula on which is based the distribution of available funds between police authorities in England and Wales. I could not begin to describe the higher mathematics used to operate the formula, but it is set out in full detail in the police grant report. As my hon. Friend said, the draft of the report was sent to all hon. Members in England and Wales yesterday. I do not know whether the right hon. Member for West Derbyshire wants to intervene to explain the formula.</p>
