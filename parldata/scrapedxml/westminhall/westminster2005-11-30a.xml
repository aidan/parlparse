	<p pid="a.80.1/1">I agree that the costs are high. However, I am trying to suggest a way forward in case the Government are not prepared to commit any more public money. I would far rather they treated light rail as they treat road schemes, on which it does not seem to matter how much costs overrun, but if they will not do that, we need some alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/2">The fourth matter to consider is the cost of the public works. At the moment, a promoter has to pay 92.5 per cent. of such costs. For the Manchester Metrolink scheme, that is &pound;45 million. In France the limit is 30 per cent. and in Germany it is zero. Public utilities are expected to bear the cost just as we here expect them to bear the cost of restoring any roads that they dig up.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/3">The final change needed is to reduce the time that the Department for Transport takes to approve a scheme. We need a speedier and simpler process with more support from the Department for Transport so that, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1596" name="Peter Viggers">the hon. Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers)</phrase> suggested, some of the expenses that authorities currently incur could be saved and used in other areas where the money might be better spent.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/4">Everybody wants to see the inexorable rise in road traffic halted. Light rail is popular with the public, and can deliver if the Government have the will to support it. I am in no doubt that many hon. Members want that happen, as we can see from the recent formation of the all-party group on light rail. Now I seek a similar commitment from the Government&mdash;or has everything that we have heard recently been just warm words?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.82.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" speakername="Graham Stringer" colnum="82"  time="09:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h01.htm#51130h01_spnew11">
	<p pid="a.82.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a profound and important point, which the Transport Committee has made to Ministers a number of times. Local transport plans have four objectives, and not one of them is regeneration. It clearly should be, because the people who run our great cities say that regeneration is their top priority, and transport should be fitted into that.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/2">My next point is about an interesting connection. The Secretary of State and other Ministers have explained that the costs of tram systems have increased, and that is true. However, during its study the Committee found that the Department was part of the problem. It had persuaded and supported a procurement system that, as the hon. Member for Rochdale says, is expensive. The cheapest system would have been public sector procurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/3">The Department had been a problem because of its response times to different tram schemes. There were two delays of more than 18 months in its response to one scheme, and all the time inflation was increasing in the building industry, and the banks and finance houses were getting more and more risk-averse because of the problems with Network Rail and one or two of the tram systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/4">When we looked at the Department's evidence to the Select Committee, it was almost impossible to come to any conclusion other than that there was serious bias in the Department in favour of deregulated buses and against trams and light rail. I refer hon. Members to the evidence from FirstGroup, on page Ev 173 of the Select Committee report, and the Department's evidence on page Ev 185: the criticism of light rail is almost identical. However, most of the other evidence across the board presents a much more balanced view of where trams and light rail are appropriate. They are not appropriate in every case, but trams provide solutions that cannot be provided by anything else where there are heavily populated corridors in large urban conurbations.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/5">While the Department was delaying its responses, in Greater Manchester it was encouraging FirstGroup and Stagecoach, in a deregulated bus system, to run in competition with trams. That was unhelpful. When there is such encouragement via quality bus corridors, that often means that feeder bus routes, both to the tram system and into those corridors, get worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/6">I am aware of the time, so I want to finish with three quick points. Where has all this left us? As the hon. Member for Rochdale said, the &pound;520 million is back on the table and the passenger transport executive in Greater Manchester is now going through a bidding process for the first phase of what would have been the big bang solution, which is refurbishment. However, the tram system in Manchester is not working as it has done and is not attracting so many passengers.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/7">I phoned the deputy director general of the Greater Manchester passenger transport executive yesterday, and he said that the system works better when there are 32 trams, although they can get by with 28. However, because of the delays, often only 25 trams are in service, which means that my constituents&mdash;the people whom I represent&mdash;often have to wait in the cold weather at rush hour, finding that trams are not turning up. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister whether the process can be speeded up.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/8">I shall suggest how that that could happen. There is a &pound;102 million contract; 10 trams that could move on to the system and improve the situation would cost only &pound;16 million. What sort of centralised country are we living in? Not only can a great city such as Manchester not make such decisions itself, but it has to wait for the Department for Transport and the Secretary of State to make a decision to invest in a relatively small number of trams. We need those trams now. We need the final decision as soon as possible, because the travelling public are getting impatient; they like the system but it is not operating as well as it could, because of the delays.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/9">The hon. Member for Rochdale, in a comprehensive speech, made the point that we must ask ourselves about the centralisation in this country. Not only that, he said that we should consider how things happen in Lyon in France, and why a relatively small place in France&mdash;Clermont Ferrand, whose exact population I do not know&mdash;can put together a &pound;190 million, 14 km tram system in four years from the decision to finance it, not the 15 years it is taking us to put tram schemes together in this country. That indicates that we have too much centralised decision making, which delays the process and is bad for the cities and regions of this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/10">I will finish with a point that will not be controversial in Manchester, but might be here in London. The last time we had this debate, a number of us made the point that this subject illustrated the fact that the north-south divide existed, because at the same time as the money was stopped for the three tram schemes, one third of a billion pounds was announced for London transport&mdash;and since then, there has been the decision to hold the Olympics in London. I think that that is a disastrous decision for the cities and regions of England.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/11">The Minister has a terribly difficult job, and is regularly conveying bad news to parts of England. I want assurances that the &pound;3.5 billion now being talked about for a new sewerage system for east London and the Olympics will not&mdash;as <i>The Guardian</i> reported last Friday&mdash;influence the financing of the Manchester Metrolink. I would also like the assurance that none of the other extra resources going into transport in London that we have heard about on the Transport Committee will come out of the Manchester scheme.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.84.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1664" speakername="George Howarth" colnum="84"  time="10:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h01.htm#51130h01_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.84.0/1">I shall confine my remarks to Merseytram line 1 and lines 2 and 3, which would have followed had it gone ahead. The line has been in the making for the past five or more years, with strong support from Liverpool city council&mdash;in principle, at any rate&mdash;and huge support from Knowsley metropolitan borough council. A enormous amount of work, most of it imaginative, went in from Merseytravel, the passenger transport authority for Merseyside. After a great deal of work, we were told yesterday by my hon. Friend the Minister that the scheme would not get Government approval.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/2">It is important to get the context right. Line 1, which would have had a profound effect on my constituency, was routed in a particular way for particular reasons. Of the 20 most deprived electoral wards in England, 11 are in Merseyside and Merseytram line 1 would have run along six of those. As a result of that deprivation, Merseyside has qualified for European Union objective 1 status since 1994 and 81 per cent. of the people in the catchment area of Merseytram line 1 live within the objective 1 area. It was deliberately sited along that route for that reason.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/3">In figures published in July 2004, unemployment in Liverpool and Knowsley were, respectively, 96 per cent. and 59 per cent. above the average for the north-west. There is a clear need for the tram to make employment and education much more accessible for people in some of the poorest areas on Merseyside. Access to health and shopping facilities would also be a benefit. It is not just me saying that. The inspector at the public inquiry that was held last year recorded in his report:</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Line 1 would have a very significant impact in socio-economic terms, greatly enhancing the prospects, networks and life chances of people living in areas of extremely high social and economic deprivation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/5">He also said:</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/6" class="indent">&quot;especially for the majority of Line 1 corridor residents who are without a car, the presence of the tram would significantly improve access to jobs, opening access to the additional 12,000 city centre jobs which are an Objective One target and improving access to 55,000 jobs overall.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/7">Line 1 would have had a huge impact on the local economy, especially in some of the poorest areas of Merseyside. The route would have hugely enhanced Kirkby in my constituency. Indeed, line 2, which would have terminated in your constituency, Mr. O'Hara, would have had a similar effect, and line 3 would have had a huge effect on south Liverpool.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/8">Where are we now? I find the whole thing bitterly disappointing and I am perplexed by the way in which the Government have dealt with the main local authorities and Merseytravel. Back in June, when the Government started to get cold feet about the scheme, we had meetings with the Minister. There were also many discussions between the local authorities and Merseytravel. He set certain conditions, which were fair. With the benefit of hindsight, I understand why he did so.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/9">The principal condition was that the local authorities would agree to fund any cost overruns, and a lot of work was done on that. However, I take slight issue with something that the Minister said in an interview on Radio Merseyside yesterday, at which I was also present. He said that no due diligence work had been carried out since June, but that is simply not true. Investec was commissioned by the local authorities to carry out that work and it came up with a figure that it felt reasonably represented the likely quantum of any cost overrun.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.87.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" speakername="Greg Mulholland" colnum="87"  time="10:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h01.htm#51130h01_spnew15">
	<p pid="a.87.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> on securing this debate, on an occasion that is more timely than he could have possibly known when he requested it. That leads me to offer my condolences to the people of Liverpool and south Hampshire for the very bad news that they received yesterday about their two schemes. We in Leeds can empathise, after the decision to turn down the supertram a few weeks ago. One of the only positive things to have come out of that very disappointing process in the past few months&mdash;a process that was probably very similar to the experiences of the people of Liverpool and south Hampshire&mdash;is that it led to my first appearance in <i>Private Eye</i> as a result. Unfortunately, however, it was in &quot;Colemanballs&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/2">My parents live in Altrincham, which is at one end of the Metrolink. In 1992 I saw commuters start to take shiny new trams into Manchester, as they never would have taken buses. Since I have been in Leeds, I have been a proponent of the Leeds supertram scheme, first as a member of the West Yorkshire passenger transport authority, Metro, and more recently as an MP. The decision itself has been a bitter blow, as has the way in which the city and its people have been treated. The decision was delayed and delayed, until finally it was made.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/3">One of the top 10 most congested roads in the country, the A660, is in my constituency. In fact, there was much ironic hilarity when speed cameras were put in on a section of the road in Headingley where, even outside the rush hour, people are lucky to do more than 5 mph. There is a pressing and urgent need for a light rail system to deal with the ever worsening congestion problems in Leeds. Such a system has the support of the council, the local business community, the local trade unions, the public sector, the hospitals trust and the general public. More significantly for Government finance, its cost-benefit analysis ratio was 2.5:1. According to Department for Transport guidance, that means that the scheme should probably have been granted approval, as the guidance says that at that level,</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/4" class="indent">&quot;most if not all schemes should be approved&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">The hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> touched on the divide that we in the north of England perceive. I share his view that there is something of a north-south divide. However, we as northerners must be careful to point out that in fact, the divide is between Greater London and the regions. I tabled a question yesterday to ask the Secretary of State if he could give categorical assurances that the granting of the Olympics to London had not and would not impact on transport and other infrastructure systems in the rest of the country. Perhaps we will get the answer a little earlier than I had expected, but the fact that the Government would not grant &pound;355 million to Leeds, the fastest growing city in this country, but are prepared to invest &pound;11 billion in Crossrail, speaks for itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/6">I need to pick up some of the issues surrounding the supertram bid, as the Government's arguments and figures simply do not add up. It was decided in 2001 that the supertram scheme would be a private finance initiative scheme. A public allocation of &pound;355 million was approved but, because of the complexity of the scheme and the length of the contract&mdash;in this case, 32 years&mdash;and the complex concept of net present value, revised costs of &pound;348 million were presented on the same basis as for the original funding. The Department said, entirely inaccurately, that the costs had risen by nearly 40 per cent. The reality is that the call on central Government funding was not above the original sum approved in 2001, yet the scheme was turned down.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/7">Notably, the promoters, the PTA and the local authority offered to provide &pound;30 million. The idea was that that would delay the call on central Government funding for another few years, but the offer was not even acknowledged in the announcement telling us that we would not get our tram.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/8">The Department for Transport said that the supertram figures were seriously misleading. There was much that was seriously misleading, but it was in the Department's conclusions. I am concerned that the Government are seriously failing on transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/9">The 10-year transport plan announced in 2000 boldly proclaimed that we would have 25 new light rail schemes in this country. At the recent CBI conference, the Secretary of State said:</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/10" class="indent">&quot;One of the biggest threats to economic expansion . . . in the next 10 to 15 years is congestion&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/11">That is exactly what we have been saying in Leeds, and I am sure that people have said it in Manchester, Liverpool, south Hampshire and the other areas where congestion is being ignored by the Government. In Leeds, developments are already under threat since the decision to turn down supertram was made. There is a feeling that that decision makes a mockery of regional economic policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/12">My hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale touched on the crucial point: we are talking about how we do things in this country. I have to explain to people in Leeds why we did not get the supertram. They say, &quot;I believe it was too expensive.&quot; I ask them, &quot;What do you think was too expensive?&quot; They reply, &quot;The tracks and digging up the road, and the vehicles.&quot; I have to explain to them that those things were not too expensive; the expense was the fact that the Government are forcing 30 years of risk into the cost. People find that very hard to understand, and I find it very hard to understand, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/13">In Lyon, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley, two light rail systems were provided in less than four years. In this country it took 15 and a half years to get one in Sheffield, and in Manchester, after 28 years, we still do not have a line to Oldham and Rochdale&mdash;18 years after parliamentary approval was given for it. There is clearly something wrong in the way we do things. Our system does not allow local people and local authorities to borrow or to take risks in their cities. We have split responsibilities: PTAs are asked to come up with money, but if schemes do go ahead, they lose all control over them.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/14">Under this Government, Isambard Kingdom Brunel and George Stephenson would probably have given up and taken jobs in the City. In this country we have lost sight of what public transport is for. It is there to provide the best possible transport for local people to get around their areas as cost-effectively as possible. We need integration, re-regulation and vision.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/15">In conclusion, the transport policy of this Government has been probably the biggest area of failure. We have seen road building but little in the way of integrated, modern, 21st-century public transport systems. Policy has been categorised by short-termism, over-centralisation and timidity; we need long-term vision, local control and accountability, and courage. We need those qualities before our regional cities clog up. I am pleased to be taking part in this debate, and I am sure that the House, including MPs from all parties, will not stand by waiting for transport improvements that will not happen. Otherwise, the economic cost will be too dear for the Government to bear.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.3/1">No. I am sorry, but I will not give way, in view of the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.3/2">On funding, the Supertram in Sheffield covers its costs in terms of revenue, but it will never cover its capital costs.

Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase>: we should see those capital costs as permanent long-term investments in the infrastructure of our cities, facilitating the economic and social life of those cities. Unlike other forms of subsidy, at least that brings a long-term benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.3/3">If the Department for Transport believes that the costs of some schemes are over the top, perhaps it should take the lead in doing an analysis, with transport authorities, of the comparisons between costs in the United Kingdom and costs on the continent. Some of the transfers of requirements from heavy to light rail may be forcing our costs up, and we should take a look at that.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.3/4">As for the benefits of the Sheffield Supertram, people regard it as a quality form of transport. Passenger numbers are going up on the tram, as they have dropped by 30 per cent. on buses during the past 10 years. There is regeneration; one can see it happening. There is even a major landowner who wants to pay to reroute the tram and increase regeneration benefits. The tram is environmentally friendly, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.3/5">In South Yorkshire we are considering extensions to Rotherham, the Royal Hallamshire hospital and Broomhill. One benefit of extension is that it opens up the tram not merely to other areas and other potential passengers, but to existing areas and passengers, who have more routes and more areas to access. It is important to bear in mind the fact that capacity and passenger use goes up on those routes.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.3/6">I understand the Government's concerns about the cost. They have to bear down on costs and be vigilant about them, but one gets a sense that the mood music in the Department for Transport has changed&mdash;that it was pro-tram and willing to consider schemes favourably, but it is now resistant to the idea. Given the likelihood that there will always be long lead-in times for the development of tram schemes&mdash;although I hope that future lead-in times will be shorter&mdash;we need a certainty and consistency in Government policy that has been lacking in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.3/7">I have two final points. The Supertram was built for an integrated system with buses linked to it. We ended up with a tram that was built in a deregulated environment in which bus routes changed to compete with the tram. Because First runs the buses and Stagecoach runs the trams, there is not even any proper through-ticketing policy in South Yorkshire, 15 years on. If the Government are saying that there will be no bus regulation and no tram extension, I ask my hon. Friend the Minister the following question: what public transport policy are the Government offering cities such as Sheffield?</p>

	<p pid="a.92.0/1">I am interested in the parallel with the railways in this context; Railtrack's cost per mile has risen by four times since privatisation. The costs are not to do with problems inherent to tramways, but are something to do with the way that we build things.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.1/1">There were extra expectations of the Merseyside political community that did not exist in Manchester, but I will come to that later.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/2">There is another view of the Merseytram scheme: that the Government are looking for a way out of a scheme that they are not convinced provides value for money. The Northwest Development Agency would have preferred the projected route to Liverpool John Lennon airport to be the first route, because that would have guaranteed obvious regional benefits, but it would also have lost some of the equally obvious social exclusion benefits. Such a scheme might have been more broadly supported across the political community. I simply do not know.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/3">I would like to know what advice the Government offered at the early stage about how to proceed. The Government's tone throughout the scheme has been largely that of a bank manager rather than a partner. They have not taken a proper partnership approach. The supposition that local authorities, which are, after all, capped, can take on board whatever liabilities come their way, and that the Government are just stuck at the figure of &pound;170 million does not reflect, for example, the experience in Edinburgh with the Scottish Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/4">The experience on Merseyside has been traumatic, wearing and deeply discouraging. People on Merseyside want to know where the &pound;170 million is actually going to go, because at the moment Merseyside is a net loser in real terms. Significant amounts of money have already been spent on the scheme, with no result so far.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/5">Many Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase>, have said that there is a north-south split in the debate, and there genuinely is. Most Members present are from the north. Looking ahead, do we really think that schemes such as Crossrail, and the billions that will be spent on them, will be subject to same rigour as schemes that are far less expensive in real terms? Why, for example, did the Government change their attitude in the negotiation with the Merseyside passenger transport authority and the Merseyside political community and insist that the local authority, not the PTA, underwrite the scheme? Was that advice given right at the start, and if not, should it have been?</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/6">That leads us to the big question: are the Government trying to give up on trams, full stop? What will they do to make tram schemes proceed better in the future? What will they do to reduce the costs of such schemes&mdash;the cost associated with the utilities and so on? What will they do to respond to the criticism made of them in April 2005 by the Public Accounts Committee? Why are they taking such a non-negotiable stance on tram schemes? That stance is not applied to road schemes, and it is not found in Scotland, where the Scottish Executive consider light rail and other schemes. How will the Government evaluate and weight subsequent schemes? What advice will they offer? Why does it take them so long to give a clear steer to local authorities that are progressing the schemes? That refrain has been repeated many times during the debate. There are appreciable transactional and contractual costs involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/7">What do the Government expect of future schemes? How do they think that they will be progressed? Will they all be progressed as part of a regional priority list? I saw a speculative list for regional transport for the north-west quite recently, and &pound;825 million&mdash;of an overall figure of about &pound;1.4 billion, I think&mdash;was allocated for future transport schemes. Will transport schemes in the future require the assent of the region rather than being progressed through PTAs? For example, what is the future for major projects not in the Minister's in-tray, such as the Blackpool tram scheme? What of future schemes? What about alternatives to our big-scale schemes? Is there any future, for example, for trolleybuses and the like?</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/8">With so much confusion and uncertainty around, we need specific answers from the Minister. At the moment, there is collective unhappiness across the north-west region&mdash;and the north region in general&mdash;which I hope that the Minister can do something to assuage.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.94.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1825" speakername="John Hayes" colnum="94"  time="10:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h01.htm#51130h01_spnew27">
	<p pid="a.94.0/1">Trams were once used extensively in the UK, and at the peak there were 300 systems, but by the modern age the number reduced and eventually only the one in Blackpool survived. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> on bringing this matter to the attention of the Chamber, and I congratulate all hon. Members who have contributed to this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/2">Seven new systems have opened in England since 1980, with an average of 138 million passenger journeys being made each year on approximately 235 km of track. However, there has been a degree of pathos about this debate&mdash;frustrated hopes, faded dreams, disillusioned communities and disappointed representatives&mdash;because there is doubt about the Government's commitment to light railways, and about their understanding of how such systems can play a vital part in regenerating communities. We heard about that from hon. Members from all parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/3">The six new systems outside London are the Tyne and Wear Metro, Manchester Metrolink, Sheffield's Supertram, Midland Metro, Croydon Tramlink and the Nottingham Express Transit. In April 1991, the Select Committee on Transport pointed to six main advantages of light rail: it reduces traffic congestion, has positive environmental impacts, conserves energy, assists urban regeneration, generally provides a high-quality service, is often conducive to better access for disabled people, and has a prestige value for a host city.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/4">Light rail schemes should be encouraged where they will be of particular benefit&mdash;that is, in busy city centres. The great advantage of light rail is, as the Transport Committee said, that</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/5" class="indent">&quot;it can increase the number of people coming into a&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/6">city</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/7" class="indent">&quot;centre without increasing congestion.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/8">According to the Committee, light rail and tram systems could carry more than 3,000 passengers per hour in vehicles containing up to 350 people. Trams are more environmentally friendly than buses and cars and they are safer, as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/9">There are also regeneration benefits. The docklands light railway and Manchester Metrolink have boosted the prestige of their cities and are attractive to visitors. The experience of the Nottingham Express Transit in its first year of operation, with 8.5 million passenger journeys above target and a &pound;23,000 operating profit, shows the potential of good light rail schemes. The Nottingham scheme has applied to the Government to be able to construct an additional line. No doubt the Minister will give us some information on that application when he winds up.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/10">The main barriers to light rail schemes are affordability, and the potential of the system to integrate with the rest of the local transport network. The only reservation that I have about tramways is the question of their beauty. I wonder why, in the modern age, we cannot build more beautiful things. One thinks of the Routemaster bus and trains from ages past. Why can we not make trams look better? We should not strip life of all its elegance and style, should we, Mr. O'Hara? I offer this small caveat in relation to my general support for these schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/11">Cost is the most significant factor discouraging further development of light rail, but as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> said, when cost comparisons are measured in terms of passenger journeys, they are more positive than might generally be suggested. The emphasis is often on the construction cost&mdash;the infrastructural up-front capital cost&mdash;but when one takes into account costs over time, which the hon. Member for Rochdale mentioned, those considerations can be seen in a different light.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/12">More could be done to overcome that barrier. For example, there are no Government grants available to develop innovative, energy-saving light railway technologies, because that tends to cost less than &pound;5 million, which is the qualifying threshold for a scheme to receive financial support.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/13">There are other issues that the Government must address, and I hope that the Minister will touch on them: the poor financial performance of some existing light railway systems, which is discouraging interest in future schemes, and how the Government can assist in respect of that; local authority funding for schemes; the issue of time, and uncertainty over the granting of powers to local authorities; and insufficient in-house expertise.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/14">Above all, as the Public Accounts Committee recommended in March:</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/15" class="indent">&quot;The Department should develop a strategy for the development of light rail as part of an integrated transport network. The Department has maintained an arm's length approach to the development of light rail, leaving local authorities to decide whether light rail was appropriate for their areas, and not prioritising in value for money terms which schemes should be allocated funds and built. It should take a more active role in the development of light rail by, for example, indicating the types of urban areas where it would be most receptive to local authorities' proposals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/16">As a Transport Committee report this year stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/17" class="indent">&quot;The Department has failed to give a strategic lead in the development of light rail.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/18">In 2000, Labour pledged to double light rail use in England by 2010, measured by the number of passenger journeys. In 2000&ndash;01 there were 124 million journeys, and in 2003&ndash;04 there were 147 million journeys&mdash;an increase of 18.5 per cent. It seems unlikely that the Government will achieve their target. Since 1997, only one new system has commenced outside London&mdash;the Nottingham Express Transit Scheme. I know that scheme well. As the Minister is aware, like the Sunderland extension to the Tyne and Wear Metro and other lines that have opened since 1997, the Nottingham scheme was a proposal whose funding and planning were inherited from the Conservative Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/19">Only yesterday we learned from the Government that they have cancelled funding for two light rail schemes&mdash;Merseytram and the south Hampshire rapid transit scheme. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1596" name="Peter Viggers">My hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers)</phrase> made a strong and bold case for that scheme; he is a great champion for local people in that respect, as in many others.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/20">The Government have now spent &pound;284 million developing rail projects that have come to nothing. That was revealed by a question asked by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1795" name="Alan Duncan">my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan)</phrase>. I will mention each of those schemes, because they have been repeatedly defended in t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1664" name="George Howarth">his Chamber by the right hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth)</phrase>, the hon. Members for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd), for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland) and for Manchester, Blackley, and by my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport. The following sums were spent on them: &pound;199 million on Manchester Metrolink phase 3; &pound;36 million on Merseytram; &pound;39 million on the Leeds supertram; and &pound;10 million on the south Hampshire rapid transit scheme. All that money was invested in schemes that will not now go ahead; hence the pathos, disappointment and disillusionment that I described earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/21">I have several questions for the Minister. Does the extension to the Nottingham Express Transit have Government approval? If so, when will we know? Will local authorities be entitled to money from the transport innovation fund for light rail schemes if they are not accompanied by road charging proposals? There was something about that in the national press yesterday; the Government's enthusiasm for congestion charging is clear. I make no point about that, except to ask how it would be integrated with applications for light rail schemes. What guarantees can the Government give that light rail remains a priority, and that they will meet their target of passenger numbers doubling by 2010? What proportion of the transport innovation fund does the Minister envisage offering to light rail schemes, given the other priorities that the Government have announced?</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/22">What is the Government's response to the recent urban task force report? It argued:</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/23" class="indent">&quot;the root of the problem is that decisions on urban transport are taken piecemeal, in apparent isolation from their impact on regeneration; indeed, there appears to be next to no evaluation of the broad regeneration benefits that investments would help bring about.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/24">There are competing public priorities, which often obscure the holistic benefits of this kind of innovation. The Government need to engage in joined-up thinking; the only thing that is joined-up at present is the traffic on congested roads. They have created a debilitating culture of encouraging schemes into the development and planning stage and putting in taxpayers' money, then pulling the plug before construction begins. The Minister needs to make it clear where the Government stand on future projects, and how committed they are to light rail. I described the pathos that has characterised this debate; the Minister now has an opportunity to prove that neither he, his Department nor the Government are pathetic.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> on securing this important debate. It is not possible to deal with all the points that have been raised in the short time available, so I will try to deal with as many as possible in my speech. I ask hon. Members to be patient.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/2">From what one or two Members have said, one would think that we had done nothing for transport, but we have seen record investment in public transport after years of neglect, major regeneration of our main cities, and major success stories in transport generally.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/3">I shall use the short time available to deal with the issues before us, and I welcome the opportunity to debate this matter and set out the Government's position. As we all know, and as hon. Members have said, we have had a difficult time in the past few weeks in terms of taking decisions. I want to make it clear that light rail has a future in Britain in the right places and as part of the right overall package, but that we will not support schemes at any cost. The success of light rail has been partly due to the Government's contribution of about &pound;700 million to light rail schemes since 1997. Six such schemes have opened across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/4">Light rail journeys have increased by 130 per cent. in the past 10 years. In 2005, journeys increased by 8.4 per cent. compared with the previous year&mdash;more than on national rail and London Underground. In all, 155 million journeys were made on light rail systems in England last year. Light rail is a small contributor, given the increasing use in public transport, but its share is increasing.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/5">Obviously, lessons can be learned from past experiences. Too many light rail schemes have seen their costs increase substantially after we have approved them. With the Manchester Metrolink phase 3 extensions, the public sector funding requirement almost tripled between our first approval in 2000 and the end of 2004. For the scheme in south Hampshire there was a 50 per cent. increase, and for the Leeds supertram and Merseytram, the public sector cost increased by 40 per cent. We need to have full confidence in a scheme's cost, viability and cost-effectiveness before giving it the go-ahead, and we must be satisfied that the procurement approach proposed is appropriate and offers the best value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/6">If light rail is to be successful, it needs to be part of an integrated approach. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> and others have said, last year light rail came under the scrutiny of the National Audit Office. Recent reports by the Select Committee on Public Accounts and the Select Committee on Transport have made several valid suggestions about how the Government's role in light rail might be strengthened.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/7">Under the new approach, we will be more rigorous, and will not give final approval until final prices have been received through a competitive procurement process. That will mean that schemes' promoters will need to develop more robust proposals, and provide evidence of their certainty regarding the risks and estimated costs and of the fact that the scheme is deliverable on time and on budget. They will also have to demonstrate that it is a high priority for the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/8">The Department has been considering how success can be built upon and best practice shared. It has been working closely with promoters through a programme of work streams and with the passenger transport executive light rail group. We are working to ensure that better specific guidance about developing a light rail scheme is available to promoters and local authorities, and have recognised the importance of working with industry. We are also working closely with UKTram, which has set up working groups to take forward streams of work, which include the development of technical, operational and safety management standards and best practice guidelines. We will continue to support UKTram in that work.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/9">We also want to improve project delivery. We will make sure that, where necessary, major transport schemes go through the formal gateway process run by the Office of Government Commerce, to ensure that projects at critical stages are in a fit state to move forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/10">I reiterate the fact that light rail does have a future in the UK. In areas of heavy traffic it might be the best solution to transport problems, as it can be the most effective way of getting people out of their cars.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the plight of Altrincham general hospital. I am sorry that it is the second occasion on which proposed closure of this well-used and much-loved hospital has prompted me to seek such a debate. I believe that the Adjournment debate that I secured on the subject in July 1999 was instrumental in saving the hospital. I hope very much that the same will prove true today.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/2">Since 1870, when Altrincham general hospital was built through the generous support of local people, it has served the community well. In recent years its services have included intermediate care beds for the elderly, located in a convenient place where friends and relatives, who are frequently elderly and dependent on public transport, can easily visit in-patients. There is also a busy minor injuries unit, serving 11,000 patients a year, and a large number of clinics providing 20,000 out-patients with blood tests, diabetes services, cardiology, audiology and much more.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/3">For 20 years or more, there have been questions over whether to refurbish the existing buildings or to build a new hospital for the people of Altrincham and Sale. Under the previous Government, a clear commitment had been given that no closure would take place unless and until a new hospital was in place. As recently as July this year, the local NHS was giving clear commitments that a review of community hospitals would not mean closure of Altrincham general hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/4">Mr. David Cain, the Trafford Healthcare NHS Trust chief executive, sent a letter to Councillor John Lamb in July, in which he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/5" class="indent">&quot;I write to confirm that the board of the Trafford Healthcare NHS Trust have no plans to close the wards at Altrincham General.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/6">He went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/7" class="indent">&quot;I understand that my Chair has responded to a letter from Councillor Susan Fildes, as leader of Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council in an email of July 15, to advise that our board has no plans to close Altrincham General Hospital or individual wards.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/8">That followed the statement from the primary care trust last November, when consultation was launched on how to invest in the community hospitals in Altrincham and Stretford. Leslie Robertson, the then chairman of the Trafford South primary care trust, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/9" class="indent">&quot;This exercise is not about closing the hospital but developing our services on the site. We know that many people have a vital interest in the future development of services at Altrincham general hospital. We want them, as well as staff and other partners, to take a full and active role in the development of proposals for change. These options will then go forward to formal public consultation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/10">The chief executive of the Trafford South primary care trust, Dr. Tim Riley, added:</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/11" class="indent">&quot;We are delighted with the response from local people, staff and others. We know that both these hospitals are much valued by the local community and we are pleased to be working so closely with everyone to gather your ideas for change.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/12">It was all very positive and consensual.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/13">Just six weeks ago, I met the trust's chief executive to discuss concerns about local health care provision, including ways in which services at Altrincham general could be expanded. I left that meeting feeling optimistic and positive. I felt that Altrincham had a good, expanding future with investment, refurbishment and more services. It came as a sickening blow on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-15">15 November</phrase> when, faced with a public interest report regarding the trust's deficit, the board adopted an emergency proposal that included the closure of the hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/14">On Friday of last week, I had further discussions with David Cain and Professor Robert Tinston, who has been asked to conduct a rapid review, to be concluded by Christmas, of the options for health care provision in the area. I urged Professor Tinston to take a genuinely open-minded approach and to try to find a better solution than that proposed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-15">15 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/15">What do I seek from the Minister? I do not want to be over-simplistic and I do not want to be drawn too far into the wider financial problems of some NHS trusts, including Trafford. It seems astonishing, however, that with all the extra money being pumped into the NHS, we face hospital closures and service cuts rather than expansion and improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/16">I have two straightforward objectives. First, the trust is consulting the public regarding its cost-saving proposals. I want to leave the Minister in no doubt whatever: my constituents and people elsewhere in south Trafford are united in their determination to keep our local hospital. A few days ago, I saw more than 3,000 people sign a petition to save Altrincham general in the space of just three hours. I have never before seen people queuing to sign a petition in that way. In the two weeks since the trust board proposed closure, 720 constituents have contacted me by post or e-mail to support the hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/17">If Ministers and NHS bosses are serious about consulting the public there is only one message that they can possibly take out of the consultation: my constituents are not mildly irritated by the proposed closure of Altrincham general; they are furious. They insist on keeping the excellent local facility that was built by the local community and for which our taxes now pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/18">My second objective is to ask the Minister to intervene to ensure that the trust moves away from its knee-jerk panic response to its deficit. On calm reflection, there are many reasons why it would be counter-productive to close Altrincham general hospital. The figures speak for themselves. Tens of thousands of patients make use of a local health facility. Altrincham general is not just an asset for the community; it also brings a revenue stream into the trust, as the Minister well knows. Its closure could therefore exacerbate the problems of the deficit rather than help to solve them.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/19">The problem with Altrincham hospital is not that it is inherently unviable, but that it needs a significant capital sum spent to update it. The trust and the health authority should be examining ways to secure the necessary capital and to increase the revenue streams coming through the hospital. The trust tells me that that primary care trust has approximately &pound;2 million of capital funding available, which could be directed towards the project. The recent closure of St. Anne's hospital in Altrincham also raises the prospect of a significant capital receipt in due course, which could, and should, be spent within the community to ensure proper health provision in Altrincham and Sale.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/20">I mentioned the 20,000 out-patients using clinics at Altrincham, but further possible services could be brought to Altrincham to increase the revenue flows. Perhaps the most obvious would be to use Altrincham as the location for a local breast care unit, for which there is a desperate need, as the Minister knows, following the recent closure of the unit at Trafford general. We were told that that closure was temporary, but in the current climate of the deficit at the trust, I am concerned that it might get lost in the midst of the wider problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/21">However, that does not remove the fact that there is a need within the Trafford and south Manchester area for a proper dedicated breast care unit that brings together all the services and facilities needed for patients suffering from that type of illness. Given the amount of space available at Altrincham general, it would be possible to have such a unit there rather than shoehorning it into other facilities, such as those at Wythenshawe hospital, which might be the alternative.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/22">When the local NHS published its proposals to close Altrincham general, local people felt shocked, angry and betrayed. It is not a failing hospital, but a much-loved, well-used hospital which has dedicated staff and massive reserves of good will in the community. I hope that the Minister can reassure my constituents that the fate of their hospital will not be decided by a panic reaction to the trust's deficit and that, instead, real efforts will be made to find an imaginative solution to secure the long-term future of this vital institution.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1371" name="Graham Brady">the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady)</phrase> on securing a debate on the future of Altrincham general hospital. He has taken an interest in it over a number of years, and I welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/2">I want to separate three different lines of argument. The first is the future funding available to the global health economy. The second is how we take forward and build stronger services in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. The third relates to the process for making decisions about health services in his constituency in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/3">The starting point for the debate must be to reflect on how far we have come. I read, with some interest, the <i>Hansard</i> of the hon. Gentleman's Adjournment debate in 1999. He attacked remorselessly what he described as spin on investment and waiting lists. I hope he will now join me in congratulating the NHS in his area on the way in which local health professionals have gripped record investment and the opportunity offered by our reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/4">I looked at some of the figures late last night and, along with the rest of England, fewer people in Altrincham have to wait for treatment. In September, 336 people waited more than 13 weeks for their first out-patient appointment, compared with 968 in 1997. There is also some pretty impressive progress on in-patient treatment. In September, only 112 patients at the trust had to wait more than six months, compared with nearly 1,000 in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/5">When we consider the number of people who have to wait more than nine months for in-patient treatment, we see some of the great strides that have been taken. In 1997, 380 people had been on a waiting list for more than nine months in the trust that serves the hon. Gentleman's constituency. As of September this year, no one was waiting more than nine months.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/6">There is a similar story to tell about the improvements in access to health care in the case of primary care. In September, every patient in the Trafford South primary care trust area could be offered an appointment to see their GP within two working days. The result of the extra investment and of bringing down waiting lists is quite simple: more lives are being saved in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. Cancer mortality rates in the Trafford local authority area have fallen by around 15 per cent. in the period between 1995 to 1997 and 2001 to 2003. That is higher than the national average of about 13 per cent. Death rates from circulatory disease in the same period have fallen by around 28 per cent. The extra investment is not only delivering better front-line care, but saving lives. Those are examples of how one community is benefiting in the same way as the rest of the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.1/1">The backlog maintenance costs at Altrincham general hospital amount to about &pound;5.8 million. It is the trust's view that the hospital is not suitable for the provision of modern health care. Dr. Frank McKenna, the divisional clinical director of medicine in Trafford, said of Altrincham:</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/2" class="indent">&quot;The inpatient wards are no longer an acceptable standard for the treatment of our patients. We have a superb, modern rehabilitation unit at Trafford General which is not only more comfortable for patients, but is also safer. Transfer of the rehab beds from Altrincham General Hospital is long overdue and should be welcomed by patients or relatives who need this service.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/3">So the hospital is providing services for which there is a strong case for a different kind of provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/4">More importantly&mdash;this is the real point&mdash;when we are putting more money into the NHS and writing cheques for &pound;36 million, it is not unreasonable to say that we need that money to be spent well, in the way that best benefits the hon. Gentleman's constituents. We are happy to write a big cheque, but we are not happy to write a blank cheque. There is potentially a strong case for the alternative siting of services that are based at Altrincham general hospital. Under any scenario, however, I have to be assured that the out-patient services, clinics and minor injuries units currently based at the hospital will be provided in alternative accommodation in Altrincham.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/5">It is important that any reforms are seen against the backdrop of our commitment to community hospitals. As the hon. Gentleman will know, we made a manifesto commitment to develop a new generation of modern NHS community hospitals and to bring on line 50 new or refurbished community hospitals over the next five years. Those need to be state-of-the-art centres because we made a big promise in our manifesto to cut waiting times from the scandalous year and a half that we inherited to just 18 weeks. That means that the new centres have to provide diagnostics, day surgery and out-patient facilities much closer to where people live and work. That is essential if we are to deliver our manifesto commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/6">We made that commitment because we know about the potential of community hospitals, which will help us to move care and diagnostic services outside acute hospitals and much closer to where patients live&mdash;they will provide care around the clock and around the corner. The Department is working out how to deliver that manifesto commitment in detail, and the outcomes of the major consultation exercise &quot;Your health, your care, your say&quot; will be fed into the process around the turn of the year. We are listening to the public to develop health services in a direction that is set by them.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/7">What does all that mean for the hon. Gentleman? The third line of argument that I promised to discuss was the process by which decisions are made. He referred to commitments made earlier this year and cited a letter based on comments from Trafford Healthcare NHS Trust about investing in Altrincham general hospital. I am told that those plans, which were at a preliminary stage, must now be considered against the question of how to spend the extra &pound;36 million in his constituency in a way that strengthens front-line care in Altrincham. The right approach is surely for the local health economy to have the opportunity to review the provision of services across not only his constituency, but the whole of Trafford. It is vital to stress that, at this stage, any proposals to re-site services are only proposals for debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/8">The local health economy accepts that it has to take the actions set out in the auditor's report. Greater Manchester strategic health authority has announced, and has informed local MPs, that it will take a lead in the process of outlining a way forward for the Trafford health system. That will build on the work carried out to date and will involve the local NHS, local politicians, patients and other stakeholders. That work has started and will continue over the next two months.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/9">The SHA has commissioned Robert Tinston to undertake that work, and I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has met him. He is a former NHS manager and was the regional director of the north-west office of the Department of Health until 2002. He has been tasked with producing a report that will unpick different levels of support for different options. He will also set out options for further consideration and decision, as well as making recommendations about the way forward. His report will be used for further discussion with the SHA and with the NHS in Trafford and Greater Manchester as a precursor to any public consultation. Such consultation is, of course, statutory and will be undertaken by Trafford PCTs in spring next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/10">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bringing the debate to the Chamber. It is an important issue and there are great opportunities ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.1/1">May I welcome you, Mr. O'Hara, to the Chair and thank you for chairing today's proceedings? I am delighted to have the opportunity to open this debate on London and the 2012 Olympics. We all remember that great day in July when we won the Olympic bid. I was at Stratford with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1921" name="Lyn Brown">my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown)</phrase> and our legs nearly collapsed beneath us with surprise and delight that we had won. We now know, however, that there is a large challenge ahead. <i>[Interruption.] </i>I hope that that was not a rude comment from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase>. It is obvious that I shall have to visit Weight Watchers.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/2">We all now know the importance of the next steps for London to ensure that we secure the long term benefits. To summarise what the Olympics are about, if we think of the five Olympic rings, we also think of the five key challenges of the London 2012 Olympics for our capital city and our nation. We need world-class venues. We need world-class, record-breaking Olympic and Paralympic games. We need a step change in local employment opportunities so that the east end of London in particular is transformed once and for all. We all look forward to a leap forward in participation in sport and physical activity in the United Kingdom from now on and, crucially, after 2012. The most important thing is a living legacy for the 21st century both for my area of London and the wider nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/3">I want to highlight some of the issues and challenges within those five themes, and then I will touch on the key issues for east London and Hackney in particular. First, great venues are clearly a must. We now have Jack Lemley and David Higgins, formerly of the channel tunnel rail link and English Partnerships respectively, as chair and chief executive and bringing their useful and welcome experience to the Olympic agencies. We also need to see the London Development Agency's procurement and job brokerage schemes working for local people so that now, up to and beyond 2012 local people and businesses gain from the jobs that are available and we do not lose contracts to the wider world. I will touch more on that later.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/4">Secondly, we will have a great games. I have no doubt about that. Rightly, that is the major focus for the International Olympic Committee and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic games. We have a good team in Lord Coe, Lord Moynihan, Keith Mills and their colleagues to ensure that the games are an enormous success. I wish to raise a local issue, however. I met some nine-year-old schoolchildren and one of the key issues they raised was whether they would get tickets. The Minister should focus particularly on that. Those local nine-year-olds will be 16 at the time of the Olympics and they do not want to lose out to international visitors, much as we will welcome them.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/5">Thirdly, we want to see local jobs. The London Development Agency is working to deliver a procurement chain so that for every large contract that is delivered, a chain of smaller local businesses from the east end of London, London as a whole and the rest of the UK can benefit from the job and business opportunities that arise from the Olympics. The agency is launching a job brokerage scheme to match people to jobs in the east end in particular, which is something we need to see work if the people in my area are to benefit in the long term. It is also developing a business club so that when the big contracts are let, the businesses involved can go to local businesses to find someone to match the skills they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/6">Those are all good ideas, and I have no doubt that the London Development Agency is committed to them. However, as Members of Parliament and others with an interest in the Olympics and east London, we must keep a close eye on those ideas to ensure that they deliver. We have to raise a question about the Learning and Skills Council and the London Development Agency: which has the lead role in delivering jobs and training locally? We must make sure that there is no confusion and territorial land grabbing while local people lose out.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/7">Groups of businesses must also help themselves. I recently chaired a meeting of creative and voluntary groups in Hackney. Those individuals and organisations were keen to be involved in the Olympics and were talking about ways in which they could get involved as they were worried that they might get left behind. I am delighted that the Olympic Delivery Authority, in its early form, has told me that it is willing to engage with businesses, and is keen that the groups organise together and approach it to see what they can gain by working together.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/8">Creative businesses are big business in Hackney, and they can help us to create now and for the long term London's new east bank, a cultural and creative quarter for our city and our nation. We will see that culminate in a vibrant national and international creative hub in the form of the Olympic institute, which is a welcome development. It will include facilities for sport, sports medicine, ecology, biodiversity and cultural and creative industries. The project is supported by all five local boroughs and builds on Hackney's well deserved reputation as a centre for creative business.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.109.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" speakername="Meg Hillier" colnum="109"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h03.htm#51130h03_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.109.1/1">I bow to my hon. Friend's expertise in this matter, but I think that the most crucial thing is to establish the institute and get it grounded before we develop further ideas about building on it. The main thing is to get the foundations in place. His suggestion would therefore be something to build on in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/2">I have touched on some of the positive aspects of the subject. Key issues also arise affecting job creation and skill development, and I have some stark facts to outline about employment in my constituency. Unemployment in Hackney, South and Shoreditch is the 12th highest in the UK. Yet the ratio of jobs to people of working age is 1.1, which is above the UK and London average. In my constituency, 22.7 per cent. of people of working age have no formal qualifications. London-wide, the figure is only 13.9 per cent.&mdash;that is still too high, but Hackney's rate is considerably higher. Also, 28.3 per cent. of unemployed people in the constituency are aged between 18 and 24.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/3">Those figures show that the issue is not just jobs. There are jobs available and it is important that local people are skilled for the long term, and that any training that is offered is matched to jobs that are or will be available. Who, however, will care whether local people get those jobs? I am pleased that work is already going on in the Olympic Delivery Authority, in its early form, both to develop a local employment framework, so that main contractors and their subcontractors&mdash;they are crucial to what is happening&mdash;will consider local people and to establish a London living wage policy. I am delighted that J. Murphy and Sons, which has one of the first major contracts, for work bearing the power lines, has signed up for that. The Mayor of London has led the way in championing that approach at the Greater London authority. Hon. Members should all support it. The agency is also working on a community involvement framework, which is of key significance, so that people will not feel that the Olympics have landed on their doorsteps from outer space, but rather will feel that the games are truly theirs.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/4">The fourth key issue affecting the Olympics is sports engagement. In Newham the engagement that has been part of the bid&mdash;and my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham will no doubt know more about the detail&mdash;has produced a reduction in some youth crime. Involving young people in physical activity can be seen to bring about a direct benefit and reduce crime. In Hackney, Councillor Nargis Khan, the lead member for communities and voluntary groups, is leading a project to get young people involved, through the Future Olympian programme. Those and many other initiatives, that I do not have time to go into today, will be critical if we are to engage people of all ages and backgrounds in more sport and physical activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/5">There are many strands to the legacy of the enterprise. First, the venues must be usable; they must not be white elephants. We need money to be set aside for continuing maintenance. We do not want, in 50 years, a legacy that is a crumbling, paint-peeled symbol of a past success. We want a well used and well loved venue that is fit for its purpose and is part of the community as well as being among our national treasures.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/6">We also want a greener area of London. Last Friday, in the nearly snowy weather of east Hackney, I had the delight of planting trees on Mabley green with nine-year-old children from Daubeney school. Form 5D had many strong opinions about the Olympics, but it was apparent that, apart from wanting tickets, they wanted the games to be environmentally friendly. They wanted more trees and fewer roads&mdash;that was a point that they constantly repeated.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/7">Hackney is now infamous for the car park that will be on east marsh. Will the Minister, together with other local MPs and me, use any influence that he has with the London Development Agency and others, to try to preserve at least some of the 350 mature trees around the edge of the marsh? Predictably, architects' models show that curtain of trees, some of which are more than 100 years old, and which include the native black poplar&mdash;a rare tree in London. Yet when the plan is examined in more detail, it emerges that there is a real prospect of those mature trees disappearing. Surely, if we have to suffer there being a car park there, we can at least retain some of those trees. If we in Hackney have to suffer the indignity of the car park, it would be better to leave the trees that are there rather than to wait until 2112, which is how long it would take some of the replacement trees to grow to maturity.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/8">We are awaiting news from the London Development Agency about the land that will replace the common land at Arena field and White Hart field, and part of east marsh, which the LDA is buying through compulsory purchase. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will join me in seeking reassurances that all land currently designated as metropolitan open land or that is promised as new metropolitan open land will have the full protection of that status and that there is no risk of its ownership being transferred to another body after the ODA's demise.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/9">We all welcome the creation of a linear park linking Hackney marshes through Hackney Wick to the Thames via the River Lea. It will be a much-appreciated green lung for the east end; we need it as a long-term legacy. We also look forward to seeing cleaner, greener and more pleasant waterways. The development brings real opportunities. During the development of the park, an estimated 5 million tonnes of material could be moved by barge, saving 500,000 lorry journeys through London. After 2012, which is the time on which I want to focus, 125,000 tonnes a year could be moved by barge, saving more than 12,000 lorry journeys a year. We should grab that opportunity while we can. Also, many new homes will be built, including 3,600 new apartments in the athletes' village, and many others on the Olympic site.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/10">I want to highlight the issue of the Travellers at Waterden road in my constituency, whom I last visited 10 days ago. We hope to hear concrete news about their relocation by January. I mention them, in particular, because they are among the handful of residents who will be affected. Businesses will also be affected, which is important, but we are talking about people's homes and future, so we need to ensure that their futures are secured and that in a few months' time they will be certain of where they are going.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/11">A key legacy for Hackney is the way in which transport will be affected, but that is a win only if we secure the changes for after 2012 as well as for the games. If Londoners pay &pound;20 a year for the Olympics, a turn-up-and-go service on the North London line, which will be a major boost, will be worth that contribution. It will effectively convert Hackney's key transport spine into part of the tube network and, along with the East London line extension, will put Hackney on the tube map for the first time.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.113.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" speakername="Mark Field" colnum="113"  time="14:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h03.htm#51130h03_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.113.2/1">I shall speak briefly, Mr. O'Hara. First, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> on having secured this important debate. I know that she has been trying to do so for some weeks and that one opportunity clashed with a sitting of a Standing Committee of which she was a member.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/2">I start with a confession. I had very grave doubts about whether London should even have bid for the Olympic games and, until that wonderful day on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-06">6 July</phrase>, I felt that our chances of winning were limited. It was a great achievement, particularly on the part of Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Prime Minister and Lord Coe, that we managed to squeeze out the last few votes and win the chance to host the games. My concerns were not about sport&mdash;I am a great sports fan and it will be a marvellous opportunity for sport to be showcased in our capital city&mdash;but about cost and about whether there is sufficient commitment to turbo-charge the transport links to which we have heard reference to ensure that London gains real benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/3">My concerns about cost remain. The hon. Lady referred to some &pound;20 per head per annum. The figure that was quoted in this House in early June was some &pound;30 per head. I am glad that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" name="Hugh Robertson">my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson)</phrase> has said that he is going to table a new clause to the London Olympics Bill to try to cap the cost for Londoners to the &pound;625 million that was agreed at the time of the bid. That reflects a grave concern of many Londoners. After all, the games are a national, not a London, event. As has been pointed out by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">the hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase>, many in the capital see it as an east London event. We have heard reference to five rather than the remaining 28 boroughs, which will have their part to play.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/4">My other fundamental concern is about other redevelopment and regeneration projects. The Kings Cross phase 2 redevelopment, which is worth some &pound;250 million to &pound;300 million, has effectively been put on hold indefinitely. We also have concerns about the Thames gateway. The Mayor of London's projection of two or three years ago for the coming 15 years to 2016 envisaged massive redevelopment in the east of the city, adjacent to the Thames. That would, of course, take place not only through London, but into Kent and Essex. As all the focus&mdash;the sexy focus&mdash;will understandably be on the Olympic games, we are concerned that many other important regeneration projects in other bits of east London and other parts of the capital will be put on hold indefinitely.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/5">We are worried about what will happen in respect of Crossrail, given the disruption that would be caused if it were built in the period up to 2012&mdash;for example, Shaftesbury avenue in my constituency would have to be closed for about 18 months. A number of projects will have to be delayed. One hopes that they will only be delayed, and that the funding will still be in place. Some concerted thinking needs to take place within London governance&mdash;I suspect that the London governance I am thinking of will be the Mayor of London and the Olympic Delivery Authority. Those organisations need a timetable that goes well beyond 2012 to put in place all such infrastructure projects, which are of great importance to London, but which may or may not be of importance for 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/6">The hon. Lady highlighted the importance of legacy, and it was interesting that she took a more broad-ranging view of the definition of that term than many would. One of the greatest disappointments in respect of what happened in Greenwich almost six years ago and the Greenwich millennium village is the failure of the legacy that we were all promised at that time. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase> shakes his head, and he perhaps has more direct knowledge of this matter than I do. However, many of us are concerned not only that the dome was a white elephant, but that much of the development that could have taken place to create a real sense of community in the GMV has not happened to the extent that many would have hoped. Apart from anything else, it would have been useful to link up Woolwich&mdash;which I often think of as being a bit like a northern town on the banks of the Thames&mdash;with the centre of Greenwich and into the docklands light railway network. I know that plans have been afoot, but there was a tremendous opportunity, and it has not been entirely fulfilled.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.2/1">I will come on to my final point, which is about the businesses in the lower Lea valley. After receiving what I am bound to say was a number of invitations, I visited businesses on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-17">17 November</phrase>. I would be the first to say, in all honesty, that the issue is not simple. I tried to approach it with an open mind and came away with considerable sympathy for the plight of the businesses. It seems that three key issues are worrying them.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/2">The first, which was referred to earlier, is the lack of action by the LDA. One can understand why that happened. I do not believe that the LDA expected us to win the bid, and there are grounds for thinking that that expectation was not unreasonable. However, as a result, some of the preparatory work that needed to be done was not done early enough, and we are now experiencing problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/3">There is also the particularly nasty issue of some surveyors and conflict of duty. There are, apparently, firms of surveyors that are acting on both sides of the fence. They are carrying out compulsory purchase valuations and then acting as agents for the resulting sites. From my experience of working in an investment bank before coming here, I know that that is a clear breach of every established professional practice. I hope that the Minister will be able to guarantee that he will write to the LDA and ensure that strict guidelines are in place to prevent that from happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/4">The final point&mdash;in many ways, the most contentious one&mdash;is that the Olympic site is the last industrial site in London. That, of course, is why it is the Olympic site. Therefore, as there is no comparable replacement of that size, any settlement must be based on post-bid, not pre-bid, land values. It is clear that land values have risen dramatically and the stock of available land has shrunk. Unless we can get over that hurdle, a settlement will be difficult to find.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/5">The encouraging thing about my visit was that I found a real willingness on the part of the businesses to accept that the games are coming to London in 2012 and that they will have to move. However, a feeling is brewing up that they have not been treated fairly by the LDA, and it will not take a great deal for that to turn to militancy, with all the unfortunate consequences that that will entail.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/6">I shall leave it there, not least because I want to give the Minister the maximum time to reply. I would like to finish where I started, by once again congratulating the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch on securing the debate. I also reaffirm my party's support for the Olympics, which we backed all the way through. I wish the games all the best.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.0/1">It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Hara. I would like to start, as everybody else has, by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> not only on securing the debate but on introducing it in such a clear-sighted and effective way. She has already proven herself to be a fantastic campaigner on behalf of her constituency and has made this subject one of her key issues&mdash;that is absolutely clear to everybody. She and I were councillors together many years ago in what seems like another life, and she was just as effective then as she is already clearly becoming in this place.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/2">During a recent round of interviews about licensing, I was introduced on LBC with the words, &quot;James Purnell, Minister for London, you are launching this consultation today and consulting Londoners about their views. What is that about?&quot; That was not what I had been asked to talk about, and I am not the Minister for London. I had similar feelings today when delving into the details of London Olympics policy. I therefore start by saying that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Sport and Tourism is disappointed not to be able to be here today as a result of other unavoidable engagements.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/3">Hackney was an invaluable partner in our bid for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games, along with all the other London boroughs, and we look forward to working closely with them over the next few years. I reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch that the Minister for Sport and Tourism will be delighted to meet the representatives of the five boroughs. She said that one of her amendments to the London Olympics Bill would have added them to the membership of the LDA. I understand that we have not yet requested formal representation for anyone on that body, but when making appointments we will have to have regard to those places that will be affected by the games. We therefore expect there to be appropriate representations to deal with her concerns. We imagine that the planning committee in particular would have such representation.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/4">The 2012 games give us a unique opportunity to transform huge swathes of our national life. It is an opportunity not only for 29 days of world-class sport, but to leave a real legacy. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" name="Andrew Love">my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love)</phrase> said, it will lead to thousands of new jobs and homes and generate billions of pounds of public and private investment, which together will create a genuine physical and social infrastructure. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase> was right to say that we should be thinking not only about buildings but about the social infrastructure, and about the people involved in ensuring that our standards of training are top-notch, so that we can deliver a legacy.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.1/1">I endorse what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">my hon. Friend says. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> was right to say that, if Queensland benefited from the Olympics in Sydney, his constituency and constituencies throughout the country should benefit. The games will provide inspiration not only for developing sports participation but, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" name="Laura Moffatt">my hon. Friends the Members for Crawley (Laura Moffatt)</phrase> and for West Ham (Lyn Brown) so eloquently said, for lifting the aspirations of people in general.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/2">I have little time, so I shall try to answer as many of the specific points made during the debate as I can. First, however, I echo what the hon. Member for Bath said about the importance of cross-party support. Tremendous progress has been made in the House and outside. It has been much helped by cross-party support from all sides, and we want that to continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch mentioned the children in form 5D at Daubeney school. I can reassure them about their ability to access tickets. We have already made it clear that the ticket pricing policy will be fair; more than half of the tickets will cost &pound;20 or less, and that will include free transport. On top of that, Keith Mills recently made it clear in evidence to the Select Committee that he would develop a scheme for local young people, and I hope that that will provide the members of form 5D with the opportunity not only to watch the games on television but to watch them in person.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/4">I listened to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1819" name="Derek Wyatt">the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Derek Wyatt)</phrase>, and I agree about the ambitions for the hub. However, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham that we must focus on ensuring that the Olympic institute is well grounded and that it will be doing something achievable. We will consider what she said about community involvement in those facilities once the games have finished&mdash;I will be sure to mention that to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Sport and Tourism&mdash;in order to ensure that such a fantastic facility will also be available to local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/5">An essential point which Members on both sides of the Chamber mentioned was the issue of local communities and businesses. Local businesses stand to benefit significantly from real opportunities presented by the games. We want to ensure that we can deliver many opportunities, particularly for local people, to work in delivering those benefits. The lower Lea valley and the areas around it have enormous untapped potential, with one of the youngest and most culturally diverse populations in Europe. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham said so eloquently, they also have real issues of poverty. One in three people are unemployed on some local estates. There is, therefore, a real opportunity to use the games to regenerate that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/6">We have already made headway on that crucial objective. I hope that I can reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch by saying that the LDA has already announced an initial funding package of &pound;9 million. That covers the job brokerage scheme that she mentioned, as well as specialist construction employment support, which should reassure my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/7">That, of course, is just the beginning. We are happy to commit to working with the five Olympic boroughs to ensure that we develop further plans for local people genuinely to benefit from the job opportunities arising from the Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/8">Regarding the relocated businesses which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" name="Richard Ottaway">the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway)</phrase> mentioned, local businesses recognise the value of the Olympics. About 78 per cent. of them said that they supported the games. I am aware that the LDA is seeking to engage with all those businesses individually. I have of course heard the concerns raised by a number of people. While we cannot comment on individual cases, we will be sure to write to the LDA, so that it knows of the concerns expressed in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/9">I heard the points on funding made by both the spokesman for the official Opposition and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field)</phrase>. We are committed to ensuring that there is effective project management, and that costs are clearly kept under control. In doing that, we will make every effort to minimise the cost to the London taxpayer, who, under the plans submitted as part of the bid for the games, will be asked to contribute less than a quarter of the total of the public sector funding package. Should there be any unavoidable shortfall, our memorandum of understanding with the Mayor provides for the increase in funding to be shared between the Mayor and the lottery.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/10">Finally, in the two minutes remaining, I want to turn to the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/11">Hugh Robertson: Will the Minister give way?</p>

	<p pid="a.134.3/1">I absolutely agree. I do not know whether the strategic health authority has lost its maps or its ability to measure distances. Perhaps its staff do not use local public transport in the way that many of my constituents do. It is an appalling idea.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.3/2">The Labour Government have done much for the health service, reversing 18 years of Conservative neglect. People's trust and faith in the national health service has been restored and I am determined that their excellent work on health will not be undermined by unelected officials acting autocratically. However, I want to convey a stark message to the Minister: all the good work will be shattered unless we say no to merger in west Lancashire.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.3/3">I resent the small cabal of health service executives, each of whom may have a personal vested interest in the merger. They fail to make decisions and suggestions in an open, honest and transparent way that listens to and involves local people. It could be suggested that they are more concerned with future jobs or handsome redundancy packages. Over the past few weeks, since I highlighted the fact that I was having the debate, I have been inundated with stories from local health service staff. They are further demoralised by stories of change and now merger. Many have asked how I can prevent the merger from happening, because it is being presented to employees as a fait accompli. Their chief executive says that it will happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.3/4">The power lies with the people, in whose name and with whose money the NHS is paid for. When local people and health service staff lose their voice in such a way, health services just happen to them. Rather than being empowered and enabled, patients are marginalised and staff demoralised. We must also not forget that people in west Lancashire face the possibility of being merged into a single primary care trust, which will include 1.1 million people. That would further dilute their voice.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.3/5">Health service executives are treating people and the Government contemptuously. They did not even bother to tell the Secretary of State of their intentions or discussions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.135.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1667" speakername="Rosie Cooper" colnum="135"  time="16:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h04.htm#51130h04_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.135.1/1">I do. I understand that the strategic health authority is currently issuing press releases on various subjects, and there may very well be all sorts of news stories, which I believe would be intended to confuse the public. People do not know which level of the health service they are dealing with and who is responsible for what.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/2">The public are hearing on the grapevine that services will be reduced or transferred, in particular from Ormskirk, and that there will be future involvement of the private sector at Ormskirk, while wards, such as the rehabilitation ward at Ormskirk hospital, are threatened with closure. They are also hearing that the Liverpool women's hospital will take over maternity services and that Alder Hey will take over children's services. There is rumour upon rumour upon rumour. That is not the way to communicate with our employees, and it is certainly not the way to communicate with our constituents and hospital patients. Confusion reigns.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/3">I question whether there is a commitment to the Ormskirk site. When there is a positive story or action&mdash;such as in respect of the minor injuries unit at Ormskirk&mdash;there is little publicity to tell people about it. Is it any wonder, therefore, that when they need an accident and emergency service, they bypass Ormskirk and use the services at Southport unnecessarily? What is the long-term future of that minor injuries unit? Indeed, as my constituents ask me, what is the long-term future of the Ormskirk site?</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/4">It is the Government's intention that all hospital trusts are to become foundation hospitals by 2008. Monitor recently concluded an assessment of the possibility for individual trusts in the Cheshire and Merseyside strategic health authority area to move to foundation status by 2008. The financial position of Southport and Ormskirk trust makes it unlikely that it can achieve that. The ever-increasing historical debt is now of the order of &pound;17 million. In discussions, I asked why that was not tackled in the past. I suppose that there has not been the appetite to deal with the problem head-on, as it would have been on top of the already unpopular measures in the Shield review. The proposed merger would be yet another step in letting people down.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/5">An assumption is also being made that a merger is the solution to the debt problem. That is not the case. Merger would address the problem by running services across Merseyside&mdash;across the larger area&mdash;to reduce costs. So patients would probably have to travel further for treatment and visitors would have to travel further to visit in-patients. If there were a Liverpool-centric merger, Southport and Ormskirk would have a very junior role to that of Liverpool, with its greater population and university teaching hospitals. Over time, that situation would only get worse as medicine continued its move towards providing more specialist services.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/6">We need to concentrate our efforts on getting the financial situation resolved. If the debt and the cause of it are dealt with, Southport and Ormskirk could be viable. That, along with any relevant partnership working proposals, should be put to the SHA and the Department of Health. We would then be tackling real problems, keeping a voice and keeping health services as local as possible. That is the argument that we should be putting to McKinsey and Co. That should be its brief.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/7">McKinsey has done some good work for the NHS, but we must guard against any natural bias in favour of mergers. I understand that mergers is one of the growth areas of its business. Merging trusts would not be the solution but the easy option. It would be tantamount to throwing up our hands and saying that there is nothing we can do. I cannot accept that as a solution, and my constituents will not.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/8">Merging will not provide the solution to the challenges of Government policy either. It will not result in debt being reduced or services being enhanced, and it is not in the interests of the people of west Lancashire or those of any of the other people affected by the proposal who live in the constituencies represented by my hon. Friends from the region. We have only to look at the experiences of merged hospitals: the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust and Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust have been a disaster.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/9">The arguments against merger in the case of Airedale NHS Trust in Bradford apply equally to Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust, and no doubt to the other hospitals under threat of merger. Under a merger, there will be no improvement in clinical standards that could not be achieved by the hospitals remaining separate. A management merger would not achieve any significant improvement in access to services; it could even reduce accessibility. Mergers do not lead to a greater access to funds; in fact, they could prevent high-quality staff from joining the hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/10">It has to be said clearly: mergers do not increase the capacity to meet Government-set targets. We need to concentrate our efforts on getting hospitals to concentrate on the patients and the financial situation. The Government say that services have to be good, safe, timely and convenient for patients. The merger idea, which comes from the three chief executives involved, without any consultation, does not meet those standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/11">Where does patient choice come in the agenda? If hospitals across Liverpool, west Lancashire and the wider area are merged, where will people go to get patient choice? They will have to travel to Manchester, Preston and beyond, which very possibly will be too far. It would be nigh-on impossible for west Lancashire residents to make regular journeys to visit in-patient family members and friends, never mind receive treatment themselves. Ormskirk is 22 miles from the Broadgreen site, 18 miles from the Royal Liverpool university hospital and 11 miles from Aintree hospital. From Skelmersdale, it would be even further. We already ask people to travel further and further to access specialist services such as cancer services, and that is medically right, but should we ask them to do the same to access general services? Like the Government, I do not believe that we should.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/12">In my constituency, there are below-average levels of car ownership. In west Lancashire, we have public transport difficulties in getting to Southport and Ormskirk hospitals. I know that because I have done it: it takes one hour and 20 minutes on a bus from Upholland to the hospital in Southport. To have to go even further would necessitate what amounts to a day trip, which is ridiculous in this age. Vulnerable groups are left reliant on a public transport system that is failing people in west Lancashire.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/13">It is the same if we travel from Skelmersdale to the Broadgreen site. Theoretically, that should take two hours, but in practice it would probably take closer to two and a half. It involves three bus rides, two walks to make the changes and one train ride. That is just one way&mdash;double it for a return trip. What if a person is ill? That is just one of the many examples of problems that my constituents would face in accessing health services if the new model were adopted.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/14">Not merging would not preclude any partnership working across clinical specialisms, although that argument will be the excuse and the ruse used by people who just want to merge and get on with it. Those things could still happen, but the difference would be that Southport and Ormskirk would be a full partner and have a voice at the table. As the Minister will be aware, many other hospitals have partnership arrangements that offer the best service options for their local residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/15">Partnership working should not be confined to Liverpool. Why did that only happen there, because perhaps services could be delivered by Wigan, Preston and Chorley hospitals? If we believe in in-patient choice, let us construct a creative, innovative and enabling set of partnerships and relationships that deliver the highest standards of health care for our communities and local residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/16">Having heard the proposals in Gill Dolan's report on the future shape of health services, members of west Lancashire patient and public involvement forum have issued a press release in which they express many, if not all, of my concerns about securing a sustainable, accessible health service. I have to tell my hon. Friend the Minister that we need solutions that do not include merger. The agenda of those solutions can only be to provide the best possible local, accessible care in a patient-centred NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.0/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1667" name="Rosie Cooper">my hon. Friend the Member for West Lancashire (Rosie Cooper)</phrase> for allowing me a couple of minutes in this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/2">The merger that my hon. Friend describes is not the only one on which the strategic health authority is working: it is also working to merge North Cheshire Hospitals NHS Trust and Whiston hospital. Such mergers are undertaken by stealth, without any community engagement. More than that, the SHA is skewing the evidence that it presents to McKinsey on the merger in order to achieve the outcome that it wants, saying that it must explore organisational configuration issues. It has misrepresented the results of a MORI poll on choice carried out by the primary care trust in Warrington, and totally ignores the needs of local people in favour of bureaucracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/3">The centre of my constituency has a relatively low car ownership. It is a 20 mile round trip to Whiston hospital. As the private finance initiative for Whiston is larger than its current needs, the inevitable result of any merger would be the transfer of services away from Warrington. Like my hon. Friend, we are not opposed to partnerships or to improving clinical standards. However, concentrating on a merger is diverting attention away from those matters and on to the bureaucratic issues that suit the health authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/4">My hon. Friend the Minister has to get a grip on our SHA. It must be much more patient focused and concerned less with structures. As for the merger, I tell him clearly that my constituents do not want it, and I do not believe that the hospital board wants it. The proposal comes from the SHA and it needs to be stamped on at birth, because it is not in the interests of the people whom I represent.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.1/1">Let me start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1667" name="Rosie Cooper">my hon. Friend the Member for West Lancashire (Rosie Cooper)</phrase> on having secured the debate. May I begin by saying that she has displayed two of her great talents this afternoon? The first is her ability to fight on behalf of her constituents, and the second her deep experience of the national health service. She was not only vice-chair of Liverpool health authority between 1994 and 1996, but chair of Liverpool women's hospital between 1996 and 2005. I was also very glad to hear <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1907" name="Helen Jones">my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones)</phrase> intervene, not least because I was born in Warrington hospital. It is always a pleasure to hear it mentioned in this Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/2">The starting point for this debate is simple. In the past few weeks, I have had the pleasure of visiting a number of hospitals in and around Liverpool, including Whiston and Alder Hey hospitals and Liverpool women's hospital. I have seen the transformation of the NHS in and around Liverpool, and I know that that is benefiting my hon. Friends' constituents. That has not happened by accident. It has happened because we have increased the funding of the NHS from around &pound;35 billion to around &pound;70 billion. Cheshire and Merseyside strategic health authority has benefited greatly from that investment, with 400 extra consultants since 1997, nearly 5,500 extra nurses and more than 3,800 health care assistants. That has made a huge difference to the quality of care in my hon. Friends' constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/3">My hon. Friend the Member for West Lancashire has a PCT that sits in the Cumbria and Lancashire SHA area where, I am told, the number of people waiting more than six months for in-patient treatment has dropped by an extraordinary 95 per cent. since 1997, and the number of people waiting 13 weeks or more for out-patient treatment has dropped by an almost as impressive 86 per cent. The result of that, of course, is that people are living longer. The mortality rates in my hon. Friend's local authority area show that there have been extraordinary advances since 1997: the mortality rate from coronary heart disease has fallen by more than a quarter, and the death rate from cancer has fallen by 8 per cent. We should congratulate front-line NHS staff on those achievements and the way in which they have gripped and exploited our investment and reforms.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. I hope that he is pleased by what my noble friend Lord Warner writes to SHAs and hon. Members later today about our proposals to strengthen front-line services in and around his area.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/2">The backdrop for today's debate is the funding increases that are to come. Although advances have been made, we want to go further. In the local PCT area of my hon. Friend the Member for West Lancashire that means about &pound;24 million more going into front-line health care in the next few years. The choices available to local health professionals are extraordinary&mdash;how much extra should be spent on hospitals, primary care services and community care services? It is a long time since front-line professionals working in the NHS have had such a rich array of choices.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/3">My hon. Friend was right to stress the importance of localism in advancing services in this country. That is precisely why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will produce a White Paper in the new year on how to strengthen services that are not just around the clock but around the corner. We do far too much work in acute hospitals, and we can do a great deal more to move that care closer to where people live.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/4">As we put more money into the NHS, it is only right that we should ask its managers to manage their books effectively. That is why we have asked hospitals to go for foundation status: it is a badge of effectiveness. My hon. Friend well knows that because she was instrumental in getting Liverpool women's hospital foundation status recently. To facilitate that process, we asked a few areas to pilot the whole health community diagnostic project, which is our way of ensuring that financial management in the NHS is as strong as it should be. My hon. Friend's area was one of those that piloted that project. That was done simply to ensure that NHS managers do not have the luxury of ducking the kind of tough financial decisions that she talked about so eloquently, or the opportunity to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/5">The agenda of expanding hospital services is important, but it needs first-class financial management to go with it. The programme of expanding and improving acute hospitals would be much easier if Liverpool metropolitan borough council raised its game and started to work slightly more effectively with the NHS. My visits to Alder Hey, Liverpool women's and Whiston hospitals were instructive, and I was disappointed to hear of concerns that the council might have dragged its feet in taking decisions that were needed to expedite the arrival of those new, first-class facilities. The diagnostic project on finances in my hon. Friend's constituency is ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/6">However, I must confirm that the Department of Health has not agreed how it will proceed from the outcome of the pilot involving Cheshire and Merseyside SHA. There is still work to be done exploring the options that should be made available. As part of that, I understand that NHS trusts in Liverpool, Sefton, Southport and west Lancashire have begun formal discussions to review the configuration of trusts in their area to determine whether the current organisational structure is best placed to provide services to meet patients' needs. I know that in my hon. Friend's area McKinsey was hired. After this afternoon's debate, I wonder why they did not hire her&mdash;they could perhaps have obtained a slightly better result for less money. However, that is a decision that has passed us by.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.142.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" speakername="Philip Hollobone" colnum="142"  time="17:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h05.htm#51130h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.142.1/1">First, I thank Mr. Speaker for enabling me to secure the debate, the Minister for attending, and all the police officers, staff and associated civilians of the Northamptonshire police force for their good work and the tremendous efforts they put into policing matters in the county. They deserve our thanks and praise, and I am happy to put that on the record on behalf of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/2">The purpose of my contribution to this debate is to leave the Minister in no doubt about the importance of policing, crime, antisocial behaviour and general law-and-order issues to my constituents. It is extremely important and I have done my best to raise the matter through every parliamentary device. I have asked the Prime Minister a question at Prime Minister's Question Time. I have participated in correspondence with him and even received a reply from him on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June</phrase>. I have joined the parliamentary police scheme and will spend 22 days with the Northamptonshire police to find out at first hand about policing issues on the ground. I want to leave four points with the Minister&mdash;my conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/3">First, there are not enough police officers in Northamptonshire. It is not just me or my constituents who say that. The chief constable also says that. Secondly, Northamptonshire police force suffers persistent long-term underfunding. It is not just me or my constituents who say that. The chief constable also says that. That underfunding will get worse because Northamptonshire is included in the Milton Keynes and south midlands growth area and will experience the fastest growth of house building in the country up to 2021 and 2031.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/4">Thirdly, there are huge local concerns about the performance of Northamptonshire police who are, according to the Government's measures, an underperforming force. Fourthly and lastly, there is strong and growing local opposition to the proposal to merge Northamptonshire police force with neighbouring forces and perhaps even to make it part of a new, grotesque east midlands police force.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/5">On the first point about there not being enough police officers, in Northamptonshire there are 1,264. If we had the national average number of officers per head of population, Northamptonshire would have 1,479. There are 938 full-time-equivalent police service staff, which is one of the highest rates of civilianisation in the country. There are 192 special constables, compared with 314 eight years ago. There are some 39 community support officers and I am pleased to say that Kettering borough council, on which I am a councillor, funds in part eight community support officers for Kettering.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/6">There has been a doubling of the number of police officers retiring or resigning in the past eight years. Eight years ago, 37 officers left the force and 74 left in 2003&ndash;04. Of the constables in the force 25 per cent. have been in service for less than three years and 20 per cent. of those on the beat are probationers.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/7">On crime statistics, in 2003&ndash;04, 123 crimes were committed for every 1,000 people in the county compared with an average in England and Wales of 113 for every 1,000 people. That is the highest crime rate among Northamptonshire's family of eight most similar forces where the range was 86 to 123 for every 1,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/8">On population per officer, in 2003&ndash;04 in Northamptonshire there were 506 people for every constable and 461 in England and Wales. On the average number of crimes per officer, there were 62 in Northamptonshire and 48 among its family of most similar forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/9">Everyone in Northamptonshire from the chief constable downwards&mdash;plus Northamptonshire's elected parliamentary representatives taking part in this afternoon's debate&mdash;wants the Minister to know that there are not enough police officers in the county.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/10">The second point is about persistent, long-term underfunding. I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1742" name="Brian Binley">my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley)</phrase> wants to catch your eye later, Mr. O'Hara, to expand on that point. Over the past three years, the formula funding for the Northamptonshire police service has meant that the force has received &pound;5.5 million less than it ought to have done. Last year&mdash;2004&ndash;05&mdash;the police budget was nominated. In the three previous years, the police precept had to go up by 26 per cent., 23 per cent. and 14 per cent. to try to address, at least in part, the systematic failure to deliver the funding that the county needs to provide proper policing.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/11">In terms of the formula grant per head of population, Northamptonshire gets &pound;101 a year compared with the average in England and Wales, which is &pound;139. The police force with the highest figure in the land gets &pound;248. Northamptonshire is the third worst authority in the country in respect of falling victim to the damping formula applied to the funding formula mechanism.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/12">There is growing concern about the performance of the Northamptonshire constabulary. The police standards unit has been engaged with the force since spring 2004. A new policing model was introduced in October 2004 and is beginning to tackle some of the underlying problems. The difficulty is that the forces in Northamptonshire's family of most similar forces are beginning to tackle their difficulties more effectively than the Northamptonshire force is tackling its own.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/13">In the recent statistics published by the Home Office, the Northamptonshire police force came out&mdash;on the Government's figures&mdash;as the third worst-performing police authority in the country, with an overall aggregate score of one in a range of minus three to plus 16. Recorded crime for every 1,000 people is 22 per cent. higher than in comparable forces. House burglary is 60 per cent. higher, robberies are 84 per cent. higher and vehicle crime is 42 per cent. higher. House burglary detection is the worst in the most similar family of forces and vehicle crime detection is almost the worst. Only 35 per cent. of the Northamptonshire public think that the criminal justice system is effective in bringing people to justice compared with 43 per cent. for the east and west midlands on average. Fear of crime is among the worst in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/14">There is strong and growing opposition to the prospect of merging the Northamptonshire police force with neighbouring forces. The National Association of Retired Police Officers has written to me to say that</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/15" class="indent">&quot;there are only people like us still around and actively connected with the Force who can still remember the aftermath of the 1966 amalgamations and their terrible effect on Force efficiency which took ten years to get back to the pre-1966 efficiency.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/16">The local National Farmers Union has written to me to say that it is worried that the regionalisation of the local police force could mean that rural crime is tackled even less effectively than heretofore</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/17">There are problems with policing in Northamptonshire and they basically stem from insufficient funding being given to the local force. Local people feel that the issue is very important. I hope that the Minister will take on board these points and come up with some constructive solutions so that policing can be properly addressed in the great county of Northamptonshire.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.144.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1742" speakername="Brian Binley" colnum="144"  time="17:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h05.htm#51130h05_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.144.0/1">I thank the Minister for kindly allowing me this privilege, for which I am grateful.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase>, not only on securing this debate, but on the work that he does for his constituents and the wider Northamptonshire population. I am grateful for that and many others are, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.0/3">I wish to talk for two to three minutes about the funding formula, which has impacted so heavily on Northamptonshire. When the new formula was first announced more than three years ago, we were rather pleased because it showed that we were one of the main underfunding constabularies in the country&mdash;underfunded by way of the previous formula&mdash;and the new formula would correct that underfunding. If the Government had not changed the new formula, we would have expected more than 22 per cent. extra funding over the past three years. My hon. Friend has explained how much that added up to; in truth, it would have meant 50 permanent officers for Northamptonshire constabulary.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.0/4">Sadly, the formula realisation did not occur. I understand why the Government put a damping formula on their own formula: it would have meant serious difficulties for them at the other end of the process. However, be that as it may, we were left with a reduced grant of some 13 per cent., adding up to &pound;5.5 million, which has had a massive effect on the performance that our force in Northamptonshire can achieve. There is a link between funding and performance in that respect. I am not arguing that that is the only explanation, but it is one factor that has meant that we have underperformed&mdash;and we and the Government have been disappointed.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.0/5">I appeal to the Minister to consider seriously the funding formula as it impacts on Northamptonshire, because the Government said fairly that we deserved more. However, they then dampened the impact and we did not get what they said they thought we deserved. In the light of that, I ask the Minister to consider the issue again.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.147.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="147"  time="17:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h05.htm#51130h05_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.147.2/1">In a little while I shall come on to the shortlist of options for the hon. Gentleman's region and emphasise again that we are talking about a consultation. The Home Secretary wants to develop the new structure from the bottom up and not create a blueprint from the top down. I know that hon. Members will be involved in the consultations, and they will be able to make the points that they wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/2">In order to ensure that the two issues could both be dealt with adequately by a police structure, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary asked HMIC to examine whether the current 43-force structure was still fit for purpose. It examined in particular what are called the &quot;protective services&quot;, which I mentioned: dealing with organised crime, counter terrorism and murders, which rightly draw in huge police resources when they occur in a community; tackling domestic extremism&mdash;we are determined to tackle and overcome animal rights extremism; and dealing with civil contingencies of different kinds, critical incidents, public order incidents and so on. All forces have to be able to deal with those kinds of pressures.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/3">HMIC's findings in the &quot;Closing the gap&quot; report are pretty stark. It concluded that the existing force structure, which has been established for more than 30 years, is</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/4" class="indent">&quot;no longer fit for purpose. In the interests of the efficiency and effectiveness of policing it should change.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/5">HMIC felt strongly that in this particular case size matters. It suggested that as a minimum there should be 4,000 police officers or 6,000 staff in a strategic police force that is able both to deal with level 2 threats and the issue of neighbourhood policing. Faced with such clear, unequivocal, professional and independent advice from the inspectorate, I put it to the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues that it would be irresponsible for the Government not to respond to that by trying to provide a structure that was more up to the task.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/6">The inspectorate considered several possible options for the way forward, including that of greater collaboration between forces and the creation of federations between forces for the provision of protective services, but it felt that all those options had significant drawbacks. On the federal option, for example, it commented that clarity of responsibilities and governance would be an enduring challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/7">The inspectorate concluded that the establishment of strategic forces with sufficient critical mass to meet all the demands of modern policing was the best business solution. We agree. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has repeatedly made it clear that he has no blueprint. We want the new structure to be developed from the ground up, with local communities and local police authorities very much in the driving seat.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/8">We have made it clear that we want the proposals to be submitted to the Home Office by <phrase class="date" code="">23 December</phrase>, and I am pleased to be able to report that that consultation is well under way.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.1/1">The Home Secretary does not want to carve up existing police force structures, because he believes that that would over-complicate the process. I can confirm, however, that all five police authorities and their chief constables in the east midlands have now made a joint submission that proposes four options. They conclude, as we do, that the two stronger options were for Northamptonshire to join Leicestershire and Lincolnshire and for Derbyshire to join Nottinghamshire, or for all five forces to combine into an east midlands force.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/2">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has said he agrees that those two options are the most sensible ones at this stage. He has emphasised, however, that it is ultimately a matter for each police authority to decide which option to propose in December. Northamptonshire police authority is now engaged with others in a wide-ranging consultation, and I am sure that hon. Members who are in the Chamber today will make their views known very strongly.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/3">I should add that the option of Northamptonshire police as a stand-alone force does not meet the inspectorate's criterion on the size of force. The force has only 1,267 officers, which is well below the threshold of 4,000 officers that the inspectorate recommended, and it is unlikely to deliver sufficient capacity and capability to meet the requirements for protective services to national standards.</p>
