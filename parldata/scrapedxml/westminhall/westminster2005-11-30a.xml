	<p pid="a.77.3/1">I thank the House for agreeing to debate light rail. The subject is certainly timely, given yesterday's Government statement, which effectively killed off the Liverpool and the south Hampshire light rail schemes. Although it is not what I originally envisaged, the debate might more appropriately be entitled &quot;What future for light rail in the UK?&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/2">As I am the Member for Rochdale, my constituency has in it the Oldham-Rochdale loop line, which is included in the Manchester Metrolink phase 3 scheme. I seek an assurance from the Minister that that scheme will not be next for the chop. Since the Transport Committee reported earlier this year we have seen several light rail schemes picked off and dropped&mdash;those in Leeds, Merseyside and south Hampshire. Outside London, only the Manchester Metrolink and the Edinburgh scheme&mdash;the latter is funded differently&mdash;remain on the table. No doubt many hon. Members will want to comment on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/3">How different that is from the 10-year transport plan of 2000, which envisaged 100 per cent. growth in the number of people using light rail, with Government support for 25 new schemes. Since then, we have seen the abandonment of the Department for Transport's 2002 growth target, the 2004 National Audit Office report on light rail, and the White Papers on rail and transport policy. The Government used the National Audit Office report selectively in order to justify retreating from giving approval to new light rail schemes, as yesterday's announcement demonstrates.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/4">The prime reason cited in all cases is cost. The Secretary of State for Transport has repeatedly said that tram schemes cannot be funded at any cost. Why does the Department not apply the same logic to other transport schemes? The Hampshire and Liverpool light rail schemes are scrapped because of cost overruns of 26 per cent. and 40 per cent, yet I understand that trunk road schemes are now averaging a 53 per cent. cost overrun, and local authority approved schemes have an average 42 per cent. cost overrun. For example, the Kiln Lane link in Epsom showed a 76 per cent. increase on its 2001 approved cost, and the costs of the Rugby western bypass increased by 32 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.4/1">I want to follow up the point about Government encouragement for light rapid transit system schemes. Is the hon. Gentleman aware that local authorities in Hampshire&mdash;Gosport and Portsmouth&mdash;were encouraged to spend many millions of pounds developing a light rapid transit system? It would have been extremely viable, and was widely regarded as being one of the most cost-effective schemes in the country. Road schemes were delayed while that system was being discussed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.78.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" speakername="Paul Rowen" colnum="78"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h01.htm#51130h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.78.0/1">Yes, preparation for light rail schemes is often expensive, and local authorities and passenger transport authorities are expected to undertake a great deal of preparatory work. Why are the standards and criteria being applied to light rail not applied to road schemes? The same argument could be applied to many heavy rail schemes, welcome though they are. The Department for Transport does not seem to subject them to the same rigorous cost-benefit analysis.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/2">The Select Committee on Transport concluded in April that</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/3" class="indent">&quot;light rail has the potential to be an important part of the transport mix . . . It needs to be part of an integrated transport system.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/4">I hope that in the light of recent announcements, the Select Committee will have another look at the Department for Transport's support for light rail schemes. Why is the reverse happening on the continent? More light rail schemes are being developed there, yet in the UK we seem to be going backwards. The reason is partly cost, but some bureaucratic obstacles are being placed in the way of developing light rail schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/5">South London Trams has listed some of the advantages of the tram system in Croydon. Unemployment has been reduced; in New Addington, for example, it was reduced by 40 per cent. Congestion has been reduced, with about 20 per cent. of journeys being taken by tram that were previously taken by car; and road traffic has been reduced by 4 per cent. Trams can carry more than 200 passengers, which is the equivalent of three double-decker buses or two bendy buses. Trams use less fuel and do not emit fumes, so air quality is improved. More importantly, all sections of the community like them, unlike buses. Greater Manchester passenger transport authority has produced similar arguments to show the benefits of Metrolink&mdash;a subject to which I shall return.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/6">South London Trams has produced a costing annualised over 30 years comparing the cost of conventional buses, bendy buses and trams. A conventional bus works out at &pound;46 million, a bendy bus at &pound;32 million and a tram at &pound;20 million. There are different ways of measuring the cost, but although the initial cost of trams is higher, trams are cheaper over 30 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.1/1">The hon. Gentleman rightly talks about the long-term costs and benefits, but other social, environmental and wider economic costs must be taken into account, and when they are, trams seem to be a very good buy.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.78.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" speakername="Paul Rowen" colnum="78"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h01.htm#51130h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.78.2/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman. There is no doubt that where trams are used regeneration has occurred and, as in Manchester, areas have been developed and improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/2">Before considering what action should be taken to put light rail back on track, I want to look at the Manchester Metrolink scheme. As I said during my maiden speech in the House, the Rochdale-Oldham line was first proposed in 1987 and was expected to be completed and running by 1992, but we are still not there. Since their election in 1997 the Government had given every encouragement to the development of the Manchester Metrolink. Indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister, and then the Prime Minister, suggested that the passenger transport authority should submit all three schemes at once. However, that changed on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-20">20 July 2004</phrase>, when the Secretary of State effectively withdrew funding for the Metrolink scheme. Many hon. Members will be aware that that produced what has probably been the most successful all-party, all-community campaign in Greater Manchester, which resulted in the Secretary of State putting the &pound;520 million back on the table in December 2004. I also understand that he has confirmed that the budget could be supplemented with additional local resources and with bidding under the transport innovation scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/3">Since then, Greater Manchester passenger transport executive officers have worked hard with Department for Transport officials to produce a viable scheme. The transport plan was submitted in June 2005 and funding has been agreed for phase 1 and 2 renewals. The original plans have been reworked and a detailed assessment of the non-transport innovation fund and the transport innovation funding implications of phase 3 expansion is reaching a conclusion, which includes a new approach to procurement and risk sharing.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/4">I have no doubt that the plans for the Oldham-Rochdale loop line are sensible, and the costs stack up. For example, the heavy rail line currently has a &pound;5 million annual subsidy which, if costed over 30 years, produces &pound;150 million. The line needs urgent upgrading of track and signalling, some of which would not be needed if it were converted for light rail. That cost has been estimated at up to &pound;60 million. Putting those two costs together would bridge the gap and make the line viable.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/5">I want to ask the Minister three questions. Is the Department for Transport committed to the three Manchester Metrolink lines? Does he accept that the scheme is now an integrated transport solution, which will require additional transport innovation fund resources, and is the Department committed to giving the authority those resources? Finally, when does he expect an announcement to be made on when the third phase can proceed?</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/6">What can and should be done to get light rail back on track? Five things could improve the viability of light rail. First, the procurement method should change from design, build, run and maintain to splitting up the contract so that more companies and more people can be involved. Secondly, we should allow ROSCOs&mdash;rolling stock leasing companies&mdash;or similar operating companies to purchase and lease rolling stock, spreading the cost over the life of the tram rather than treating it, as we do currently, as an up-front cost. Thirdly, we can achieve economies of scale by commissioning two standard tram designs, low-front and high-front, and ordering enough of them to make it worth while. For example, Madrid recently ordered 70 Citadel 302 trams and got a 15.7 per cent. reduction, bringing down the cost of each tram to &pound;1.4 million. That was a considerable saving.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.0/1">I am very supportive of the hon. Gentleman, but he talks about ROSCOs buying trams, and on the railways ROSCOs charge extortionate amounts&mdash;up to 30 per cent. per year. Surely trams can be bought by the public sector at a reasonable return. It would just take the Government to agree that that borrowing could go on the public account rather than the private account to overcome the problem. The charges that ROSCOs make to the railways are out of all proportion.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.1/1">I agree that the costs are high. However, I am trying to suggest a way forward in case the Government are not prepared to commit any more public money. I would far rather they treated light rail as they treat road schemes, on which it does not seem to matter how much costs overrun, but if they will not do that, we need some alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/2">The fourth matter to consider is the cost of the public works. At the moment, a promoter has to pay 92.5 per cent. of such costs. For the Manchester Metrolink scheme, that is &pound;45 million. In France the limit is 30 per cent. and in Germany it is zero. Public utilities are expected to bear the cost just as we here expect them to bear the cost of restoring any roads that they dig up.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/3">The final change needed is to reduce the time that the Department for Transport takes to approve a scheme. We need a speedier and simpler process with more support from the Department for Transport so that, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1596" name="Peter Viggers">the hon. Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers)</phrase> suggested, some of the expenses that authorities currently incur could be saved and used in other areas where the money might be better spent.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/4">Everybody wants to see the inexorable rise in road traffic halted. Light rail is popular with the public, and can deliver if the Government have the will to support it. I am in no doubt that many hon. Members want that happen, as we can see from the recent formation of the all-party group on light rail. Now I seek a similar commitment from the Government&mdash;or has everything that we have heard recently been just warm words?</p>

	<p pid="a.80.4/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> on having secured the debate. Let me remind the House that in October last year we held a similar debate on the future of light rail after the Secretary of State announced the cancellation and withdrawal of funds from three tram systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.4/2">Since then, two important things have happened. First, during the general election, the Prime Minister announced in the hon. Gentleman's constituency that the big bang solution, as it is known in Greater Manchester&mdash;the three and a half extensions to Metrolink&mdash;would go ahead. I have no reason to doubt that the Prime Minister will ensure that that happens. Secondly, in April this year the Transport Committee presented its report, &quot;Integrated Transport: the Future of Light Rail and Modern Trams in the United Kingdom&quot;. It is worth going over some of its conclusions, because it puts into context many of the hon. Gentleman's comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.4/3">Six important conclusions came out of the evidence presented to the Committee. The first, which will surprise hon. Members, is that Metrolink, trams and light rail are a million times safer per billion passenger miles than either buses or heavy rail. That surprised me when I worked through the figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.4/4">Secondly&mdash;the hon. Gentleman made this point&mdash;if we look properly at the figures, we see that although the up-front capital costs of light rail have been increasing, over the period of use light rail is actually cheaper than buses. There are two ways of working that out. The first is in the Select Committee report. The cost per passenger mile for trams is 2.4p; for buses, it varies from 3.5 to 6.5p, so trams are cheaper. The second way, which hon. Members will not find in the report unless they look very hard, is that if we capitalise all the subsidy that goes into buses annually&mdash;the bus service operator grant, the money that subsidises fares for the elderly and children, and other public money going into buses via county councils and passenger transport executives&mdash;we find that it is more than all the capital investment that has gone into trams and light rail so far. What do we get at the end? No capital, and not the transport infrastructure that we need, but fat bottom lines for the major bus operating companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.4/5">Thirdly, light rail and trams have been the most important transport facility in getting people out of cars and on to public transport; they have been much more effective at that than buses. Fourthly, all the Committee's evidence showed that cities and major conurbations want trams, and that trams lead to regeneration. Shockingly, the Department for Transport and Ministers admitted that they were considering spending between &pound;10 million and &pound;15 million on a study enabling us to understand how regeneration works with light rail. That work really should have been done beforehand, because any city leader or mayor will tell you that light rail is vital to regeneration and future investment in cities.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.4/6">Fifthly, the hon. Gentleman made it clear that trams are environmentally better, and that is absolutely true. Sixthly, people sometimes say that buses can do the job of trams more cheaply; however, they cannot provide the same capacity. Ten trams running at six-minute intervals will take between 3,000 and 4,000 passengers to the centre of a city. Buses simply do not have that capacity.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.0/1">On my hon. Friend's point about regeneration, if we take a city or conurbation such as Greater Manchester, it is obvious that the existing Metrolink has had a regenerative effect there, and that it is a vital part of plans for the future. The lack of joined-up government on this issue is always a bit of a paradox; the Government, who are genuinely investing heavily in the regeneration of Greater Manchester, have not seen the logic of making Metrolink an integral part of the regeneration process.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.82.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" speakername="Graham Stringer" colnum="82"  time="09:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h01.htm#51130h01_spnew11">
	<p pid="a.82.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a profound and important point, which the Transport Committee has made to Ministers a number of times. Local transport plans have four objectives, and not one of them is regeneration. It clearly should be, because the people who run our great cities say that regeneration is their top priority, and transport should be fitted into that.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/2">My next point is about an interesting connection. The Secretary of State and other Ministers have explained that the costs of tram systems have increased, and that is true. However, during its study the Committee found that the Department was part of the problem. It had persuaded and supported a procurement system that, as the hon. Member for Rochdale says, is expensive. The cheapest system would have been public sector procurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/3">The Department had been a problem because of its response times to different tram schemes. There were two delays of more than 18 months in its response to one scheme, and all the time inflation was increasing in the building industry, and the banks and finance houses were getting more and more risk-averse because of the problems with Network Rail and one or two of the tram systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/4">When we looked at the Department's evidence to the Select Committee, it was almost impossible to come to any conclusion other than that there was serious bias in the Department in favour of deregulated buses and against trams and light rail. I refer hon. Members to the evidence from FirstGroup, on page Ev 173 of the Select Committee report, and the Department's evidence on page Ev 185: the criticism of light rail is almost identical. However, most of the other evidence across the board presents a much more balanced view of where trams and light rail are appropriate. They are not appropriate in every case, but trams provide solutions that cannot be provided by anything else where there are heavily populated corridors in large urban conurbations.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/5">While the Department was delaying its responses, in Greater Manchester it was encouraging FirstGroup and Stagecoach, in a deregulated bus system, to run in competition with trams. That was unhelpful. When there is such encouragement via quality bus corridors, that often means that feeder bus routes, both to the tram system and into those corridors, get worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/6">I am aware of the time, so I want to finish with three quick points. Where has all this left us? As the hon. Member for Rochdale said, the &pound;520 million is back on the table and the passenger transport executive in Greater Manchester is now going through a bidding process for the first phase of what would have been the big bang solution, which is refurbishment. However, the tram system in Manchester is not working as it has done and is not attracting so many passengers.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/7">I phoned the deputy director general of the Greater Manchester passenger transport executive yesterday, and he said that the system works better when there are 32 trams, although they can get by with 28. However, because of the delays, often only 25 trams are in service, which means that my constituents&mdash;the people whom I represent&mdash;often have to wait in the cold weather at rush hour, finding that trams are not turning up. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister whether the process can be speeded up.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/8">I shall suggest how that that could happen. There is a &pound;102 million contract; 10 trams that could move on to the system and improve the situation would cost only &pound;16 million. What sort of centralised country are we living in? Not only can a great city such as Manchester not make such decisions itself, but it has to wait for the Department for Transport and the Secretary of State to make a decision to invest in a relatively small number of trams. We need those trams now. We need the final decision as soon as possible, because the travelling public are getting impatient; they like the system but it is not operating as well as it could, because of the delays.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/9">The hon. Member for Rochdale, in a comprehensive speech, made the point that we must ask ourselves about the centralisation in this country. Not only that, he said that we should consider how things happen in Lyon in France, and why a relatively small place in France&mdash;Clermont Ferrand, whose exact population I do not know&mdash;can put together a &pound;190 million, 14 km tram system in four years from the decision to finance it, not the 15 years it is taking us to put tram schemes together in this country. That indicates that we have too much centralised decision making, which delays the process and is bad for the cities and regions of this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/10">I will finish with a point that will not be controversial in Manchester, but might be here in London. The last time we had this debate, a number of us made the point that this subject illustrated the fact that the north-south divide existed, because at the same time as the money was stopped for the three tram schemes, one third of a billion pounds was announced for London transport&mdash;and since then, there has been the decision to hold the Olympics in London. I think that that is a disastrous decision for the cities and regions of England.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/11">The Minister has a terribly difficult job, and is regularly conveying bad news to parts of England. I want assurances that the &pound;3.5 billion now being talked about for a new sewerage system for east London and the Olympics will not&mdash;as <i>The Guardian</i> reported last Friday&mdash;influence the financing of the Manchester Metrolink. I would also like the assurance that none of the other extra resources going into transport in London that we have heard about on the Transport Committee will come out of the Manchester scheme.</p>

The link between Gosport and Portsmouth is across a narrow 4,600 yd channel. The whole area is regarded as being ideally suitable for a light rail transit system, because road access is difficult. For decades some have thought that there could be a tunnel under the harbour at Portsmouth and some form of special transport system.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/2">Such thinking was encouraged in 1997, when the present Government came to power, and there was much talk of integrated transport systems. Hampshire county council, Portsmouth city council, and Gosport and Fareham borough councils were encouraged to spend many millions of pounds of council tax payers' money investigating the possibility of a light rapid transit system.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/3">Eventually the scheme was proposed, and it was indeed expensive. However, it was thought that it would comply with Government requirements, because the Government were talking so much about environmental issues being taken into account in cost analysis. Therefore, the local authorities felt justified in continuing. There was a public inquiry in Portsmouth, at which I made the first speech. I stressed that while there was the short-term disadvantage that roadworks in the area would cause congestion, the longer-term impact would be considerable, and future generations would have the benefit of this long-sighted planning, which the Government were encouraging and which the local authorities were undertaking.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/4">Eventually, the scheme was given approval and was put through to Government. There was a long delay, at the end of which the Government rejected the scheme as too expensive. The local authorities went back to the drawing board and cut the scheme back to make it affordable. It went back to the Government for approval a long time ago. We were hoping for approval at the beginning of this year, and then we were pressing for it in July. I have tabled many parliamentary questions and written many letters to the Minister pleading for an answer, because all the time the local authorities are incurring expense. There have been months of delay. I tabled a question on Monday for priority answer next Wednesday&mdash;and now we have the announcement that the Government will not back the south Hampshire scheme. That will be greeted with great disappointment and anger in south Hampshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/5">Hampshire county council&mdash;all credit to it&mdash;understands the problems of south Hampshire. The residents of north Hampshire have supported those in south Hampshire in putting forward this imaginative scheme, and the whole county has put a large number of eggs in the basket of light rapid transit in south Hampshire. As a result, all local road schemes, such as the Stubbington bypass and the improvements to the A32, have effectively been put on hold. Everything has been hanging on the decision on the light rapid transit system, and now we get this slap in the face.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/6">I find it deeply disappointing that the Government have encouraged local authorities to spend so much money on such schemes. I find it equally disappointing that the Government failed to give the answer earlier, for I know not what reason. It would even have helped if they had been brave enough to give a negative decision earlier, rather than allowing the local authorities to continue to waste so much time and energy. Time and money have been lost. It is deeply and profoundly disappointing, and I can only ask the Minister whether he will take account of all those factors, and what special circumstances he will take account of to help south Hampshire come back to a new system of transport now that he has rejected our preferred option.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.0/1">I shall confine my remarks to Merseytram line 1 and lines 2 and 3, which would have followed had it gone ahead. The line has been in the making for the past five or more years, with strong support from Liverpool city council&mdash;in principle, at any rate&mdash;and huge support from Knowsley metropolitan borough council. A enormous amount of work, most of it imaginative, went in from Merseytravel, the passenger transport authority for Merseyside. After a great deal of work, we were told yesterday by my hon. Friend the Minister that the scheme would not get Government approval.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/2">It is important to get the context right. Line 1, which would have had a profound effect on my constituency, was routed in a particular way for particular reasons. Of the 20 most deprived electoral wards in England, 11 are in Merseyside and Merseytram line 1 would have run along six of those. As a result of that deprivation, Merseyside has qualified for European Union objective 1 status since 1994 and 81 per cent. of the people in the catchment area of Merseytram line 1 live within the objective 1 area. It was deliberately sited along that route for that reason.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/3">In figures published in July 2004, unemployment in Liverpool and Knowsley were, respectively, 96 per cent. and 59 per cent. above the average for the north-west. There is a clear need for the tram to make employment and education much more accessible for people in some of the poorest areas on Merseyside. Access to health and shopping facilities would also be a benefit. It is not just me saying that. The inspector at the public inquiry that was held last year recorded in his report:</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Line 1 would have a very significant impact in socio-economic terms, greatly enhancing the prospects, networks and life chances of people living in areas of extremely high social and economic deprivation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/5">He also said:</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/6" class="indent">&quot;especially for the majority of Line 1 corridor residents who are without a car, the presence of the tram would significantly improve access to jobs, opening access to the additional 12,000 city centre jobs which are an Objective One target and improving access to 55,000 jobs overall.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/7">Line 1 would have had a huge impact on the local economy, especially in some of the poorest areas of Merseyside. The route would have hugely enhanced Kirkby in my constituency. Indeed, line 2, which would have terminated in your constituency, Mr. O'Hara, would have had a similar effect, and line 3 would have had a huge effect on south Liverpool.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/8">Where are we now? I find the whole thing bitterly disappointing and I am perplexed by the way in which the Government have dealt with the main local authorities and Merseytravel. Back in June, when the Government started to get cold feet about the scheme, we had meetings with the Minister. There were also many discussions between the local authorities and Merseytravel. He set certain conditions, which were fair. With the benefit of hindsight, I understand why he did so.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/9">The principal condition was that the local authorities would agree to fund any cost overruns, and a lot of work was done on that. However, I take slight issue with something that the Minister said in an interview on Radio Merseyside yesterday, at which I was also present. He said that no due diligence work had been carried out since June, but that is simply not true. Investec was commissioned by the local authorities to carry out that work and it came up with a figure that it felt reasonably represented the likely quantum of any cost overrun.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.0/1">May I make it clear that that reflected Liverpool city council's legal advice? It said that it could not rely on assurances from the PTA without further due diligence work. It was in respect of that that I made my comment.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.86.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1664" speakername="George Howarth" colnum="86"  time="10:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h01.htm#51130h01_spnew14">
	<p pid="a.86.1/1">I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification, but if he goes back to the transcript of his interview on Radio Merseyside, he will see that he did not give that qualification and that he incorrectly said that no due diligence had been carried out since June. If I am wrong about that, I shall apologise, but I followed him on the radio and clearly heard what he said. In fact, due diligence work was carried out, and the scale of likely cost overruns was identified as &pound;24 million. A great deal of work went into finding a way to fund that overrun, and the consequence was that Knowsley council and Liverpool city council gave an undertaking to take out loans of up to &pound;24 million to bridge the likely gap.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/2">That still was not enough for the Minister and the Department for Transport, which asked for guarantees over and above the amount identified by Investec. The scheme's promoter, Merseytravel&mdash;it had the idea and put in all the work&mdash;then gave an assurance that it would meet any costs over and above the likely &pound;24 million overrun. Indeed, it also gave an undertaking to do so within its &pound;250 million annual budget. The likely cost overrun over the &pound;170 million made available by the Government would therefore be covered by a loan guaranteed by Liverpool city council and Knowsley council, and Merseytravel undertook to meet any costs above that &pound;24 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/3">That was about as reasonable an offer as one could get. Although I have a slight criticism of Merseyside's attitude in general, which I shall discuss in a moment, I strongly feel that the guarantees offered to the Department should have been acceptable. Indeed, if the scheme had been proposed elsewhere, they would have been. A prejudice against Merseyside, or at least Merseytravel, seems to be at work in the Department, although that is not necessarily true of the Minister. That prejudice has played a part in this outcome, and that is wholly unacceptable. I am concerned that the Department will not allow us a fair crack of the whip in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/4">Criticism can be levelled at Merseyside, as the Minister will no doubt point out, and I share that criticism to some extent. Like you, Mr. O'Hara, I have been an elected politician for part of Merseyside for a very long time&mdash;in my case, almost all my adult life. I used to argue that we have always been unfairly compared with Greater Manchester. However, when Greater Manchester's section 151 officers&mdash;that is, officers with financial responsibility&mdash;were asked to give their assurance that it was within the means of the local authorities to meet any costs involved, they did. When Merseyside was asked the same, two of the local authorities&mdash;St. Helens and Wirral&mdash;turned their backs on it completely. They were not prepared even to risk any cost falling on the levy, and therefore on the council tax payers in the case of Wirral. They were not prepared to let anything affect tunnel tolls.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/5">Sefton was far more generous, but in the end it did not think that it could go along with what was being asked of it. It was left to Knowsley, the smallest local authority on Merseyside, Merseytravel and Liverpool city council to provide as much guarantee as possible. Liverpool city council undertook to guarantee to meet most of the &pound;24 million, but the officers of the council, as distinct from its members, have done everything possible to sabotage the scheme, even to the extent of commissioning legal advice on the eve of the end of the decision-making process, which in effect blew the whole scheme out of the water. I do not know why those senior officers set out to do that. Nor do I know why they defied the wishes of their elected Labour and Liberal Democrat members.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/6">I am sorry to say that that shows yet again that Merseyside is politically dysfunctional compared with Greater Manchester. I am not blaming any one political party, because no one political party was pitted against another. Without being offensive to Conservative representatives in the Chamber, there are no Conservative representatives on Merseyside, so they did not figure in the decision-making process.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/7">I conclude by making two criticisms. First, the Government should have accepted the case, which was a strong one, and the assurances that they were given. Secondly, Merseyside should have united to back the scheme, as Manchester did in the case of the Metrolink, instead of doing everything that they could in some quarters to undermine it.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> on securing this debate, on an occasion that is more timely than he could have possibly known when he requested it. That leads me to offer my condolences to the people of Liverpool and south Hampshire for the very bad news that they received yesterday about their two schemes. We in Leeds can empathise, after the decision to turn down the supertram a few weeks ago. One of the only positive things to have come out of that very disappointing process in the past few months&mdash;a process that was probably very similar to the experiences of the people of Liverpool and south Hampshire&mdash;is that it led to my first appearance in <i>Private Eye</i> as a result. Unfortunately, however, it was in &quot;Colemanballs&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/2">My parents live in Altrincham, which is at one end of the Metrolink. In 1992 I saw commuters start to take shiny new trams into Manchester, as they never would have taken buses. Since I have been in Leeds, I have been a proponent of the Leeds supertram scheme, first as a member of the West Yorkshire passenger transport authority, Metro, and more recently as an MP. The decision itself has been a bitter blow, as has the way in which the city and its people have been treated. The decision was delayed and delayed, until finally it was made.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/3">One of the top 10 most congested roads in the country, the A660, is in my constituency. In fact, there was much ironic hilarity when speed cameras were put in on a section of the road in Headingley where, even outside the rush hour, people are lucky to do more than 5 mph. There is a pressing and urgent need for a light rail system to deal with the ever worsening congestion problems in Leeds. Such a system has the support of the council, the local business community, the local trade unions, the public sector, the hospitals trust and the general public. More significantly for Government finance, its cost-benefit analysis ratio was 2.5:1. According to Department for Transport guidance, that means that the scheme should probably have been granted approval, as the guidance says that at that level,</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/4" class="indent">&quot;most if not all schemes should be approved&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">The hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> touched on the divide that we in the north of England perceive. I share his view that there is something of a north-south divide. However, we as northerners must be careful to point out that in fact, the divide is between Greater London and the regions. I tabled a question yesterday to ask the Secretary of State if he could give categorical assurances that the granting of the Olympics to London had not and would not impact on transport and other infrastructure systems in the rest of the country. Perhaps we will get the answer a little earlier than I had expected, but the fact that the Government would not grant &pound;355 million to Leeds, the fastest growing city in this country, but are prepared to invest &pound;11 billion in Crossrail, speaks for itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/6">I need to pick up some of the issues surrounding the supertram bid, as the Government's arguments and figures simply do not add up. It was decided in 2001 that the supertram scheme would be a private finance initiative scheme. A public allocation of &pound;355 million was approved but, because of the complexity of the scheme and the length of the contract&mdash;in this case, 32 years&mdash;and the complex concept of net present value, revised costs of &pound;348 million were presented on the same basis as for the original funding. The Department said, entirely inaccurately, that the costs had risen by nearly 40 per cent. The reality is that the call on central Government funding was not above the original sum approved in 2001, yet the scheme was turned down.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/7">Notably, the promoters, the PTA and the local authority offered to provide &pound;30 million. The idea was that that would delay the call on central Government funding for another few years, but the offer was not even acknowledged in the announcement telling us that we would not get our tram.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/8">The Department for Transport said that the supertram figures were seriously misleading. There was much that was seriously misleading, but it was in the Department's conclusions. I am concerned that the Government are seriously failing on transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/9">The 10-year transport plan announced in 2000 boldly proclaimed that we would have 25 new light rail schemes in this country. At the recent CBI conference, the Secretary of State said:</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/10" class="indent">&quot;One of the biggest threats to economic expansion . . . in the next 10 to 15 years is congestion&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/11">That is exactly what we have been saying in Leeds, and I am sure that people have said it in Manchester, Liverpool, south Hampshire and the other areas where congestion is being ignored by the Government. In Leeds, developments are already under threat since the decision to turn down supertram was made. There is a feeling that that decision makes a mockery of regional economic policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/12">My hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale touched on the crucial point: we are talking about how we do things in this country. I have to explain to people in Leeds why we did not get the supertram. They say, &quot;I believe it was too expensive.&quot; I ask them, &quot;What do you think was too expensive?&quot; They reply, &quot;The tracks and digging up the road, and the vehicles.&quot; I have to explain to them that those things were not too expensive; the expense was the fact that the Government are forcing 30 years of risk into the cost. People find that very hard to understand, and I find it very hard to understand, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/13">In Lyon, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley, two light rail systems were provided in less than four years. In this country it took 15 and a half years to get one in Sheffield, and in Manchester, after 28 years, we still do not have a line to Oldham and Rochdale&mdash;18 years after parliamentary approval was given for it. There is clearly something wrong in the way we do things. Our system does not allow local people and local authorities to borrow or to take risks in their cities. We have split responsibilities: PTAs are asked to come up with money, but if schemes do go ahead, they lose all control over them.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/14">Under this Government, Isambard Kingdom Brunel and George Stephenson would probably have given up and taken jobs in the City. In this country we have lost sight of what public transport is for. It is there to provide the best possible transport for local people to get around their areas as cost-effectively as possible. We need integration, re-regulation and vision.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/15">In conclusion, the transport policy of this Government has been probably the biggest area of failure. We have seen road building but little in the way of integrated, modern, 21st-century public transport systems. Policy has been categorised by short-termism, over-centralisation and timidity; we need long-term vision, local control and accountability, and courage. We need those qualities before our regional cities clog up. I am pleased to be taking part in this debate, and I am sure that the House, including MPs from all parties, will not stand by waiting for transport improvements that will not happen. Otherwise, the economic cost will be too dear for the Government to bear.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.1/1">I shall be brief, Mr. O'Hara. I am a complete enthusiast for light rail, because of the experience of Sheffield. Before the Liberal Democrats get too critical of the Government, I remind them that it was the Lib Dems in Sheffield who petitioned Parliament against the Sheffield Supertram, and they opposed it for a number of years. At least the Labour party in South Yorkshire has been consistent on the matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.3/1">No. I am sorry, but I will not give way, in view of the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.3/2">On funding, the Supertram in Sheffield covers its costs in terms of revenue, but it will never cover its capital costs. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase>: we should see those capital costs as permanent long-term investments in the infrastructure of our cities, facilitating the economic and social life of those cities. Unlike other forms of subsidy, at least that brings a long-term benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.3/3">If the Department for Transport believes that the costs of some schemes are over the top, perhaps it should take the lead in doing an analysis, with transport authorities, of the comparisons between costs in the United Kingdom and costs on the continent. Some of the transfers of requirements from heavy to light rail may be forcing our costs up, and we should take a look at that.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.3/4">As for the benefits of the Sheffield Supertram, people regard it as a quality form of transport. Passenger numbers are going up on the tram, as they have dropped by 30 per cent. on buses during the past 10 years. There is regeneration; one can see it happening. There is even a major landowner who wants to pay to reroute the tram and increase regeneration benefits. The tram is environmentally friendly, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.3/5">In South Yorkshire we are considering extensions to Rotherham, the Royal Hallamshire hospital and Broomhill. One benefit of extension is that it opens up the tram not merely to other areas and other potential passengers, but to existing areas and passengers, who have more routes and more areas to access. It is important to bear in mind the fact that capacity and passenger use goes up on those routes.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.3/6">I understand the Government's concerns about the cost. They have to bear down on costs and be vigilant about them, but one gets a sense that the mood music in the Department for Transport has changed&mdash;that it was pro-tram and willing to consider schemes favourably, but it is now resistant to the idea. Given the likelihood that there will always be long lead-in times for the development of tram schemes&mdash;although I hope that future lead-in times will be shorter&mdash;we need a certainty and consistency in Government policy that has been lacking in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.3/7">I have two final points. The Supertram was built for an integrated system with buses linked to it. We ended up with a tram that was built in a deregulated environment in which bus routes changed to compete with the tram. Because First runs the buses and Stagecoach runs the trams, there is not even any proper through-ticketing policy in South Yorkshire, 15 years on. If the Government are saying that there will be no bus regulation and no tram extension, I ask my hon. Friend the Minister the following question: what public transport policy are the Government offering cities such as Sheffield?</p>

	<p pid="a.90.1/1">Thank you, Mr. O'Hara, I shall be watchful of the time. May I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase>? This is an important debate, as we have heard from today's contributions, and this is an important matter throughout England and the large conurbations.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/2">Manchester has demonstrated that its own Metrolink is a success, and I want to refer to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the remarks that my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> made about the regeneration impact. I am bound to find this frustrating, representing as I do the inner-city constituency in Manchester, where regeneration, inspired by this Government&mdash;frankly, it would not have taken place without the efforts of this Government&mdash;has been frustrated by the slowness and delays in bringing forward the Metrolink scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/3">Metrolink is a vital part of that regeneration. It brings to bear part of the infrastructure that is necessary to deliver the high-quality transport links that that regeneration needs. We have seen in Greater Manchester how existing Metrolink schemes have impacted on places that would have traditionally been seen as less than fashionable. Those places are now economically and socially successful, and Metrolink has played an important part.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/4">My question to the Minister is whether we can break through the &quot;departmentalitis&quot; on this matter. I share <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1809" name="Clive Betts">the concern expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts)</phrase> that the mood seems to have changed&mdash;and changed perversely and paradoxically. The benefits of Metrolink, even relative to other transport systems, seem to be fairly obvious&mdash;at least to a lay person such as myself. Because of the inability to compare like with like in terms of the total spending, we have come to the illogical conclusion that Metrolink is too expensive.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/5">I am at one with the Minister about wanting to bear down on the costs of the Metrolink scheme. It is in the interests of the taxpayer and the council tax payer. However, when the greater benefits of the Metrolink scheme's wider impact are added, the case for tram schemes in Greater Manchester and elsewhere is proven. I hope that we can grapple with that idea both in Manchester and in general, so that we can force through the rapid development of light trams. I have tried to keep within your time frame, Mr. O'Hara.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> on securing a timely and important debate. I shall begin with a slight declaration of interest, because my grandfather was an inspector when Liverpool had trams, and my great-grandfather played a part in building them.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/2">We are all aware that the period from the 1950s to the 1990s was a bad one for such transport. We seem to be on the cusp of a new dawn, however, because people have realised the benefits in terms of a modal shift: getting the business man out of his car, the reduction in pollution, the regeneration, and the reduction in congestion. But to many of us, that new dawn is turning out to be a false dawn. The Leeds scheme has gone belly up, the Hampshire and Liverpool schemes are not to proceed, and Metrolink is still in some doubt. The supposition is that that is all a response to escalating costs and a new tough Treasury stance, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale pointed out, does not apply to road transport schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/3">On average, the costs of local transport plan schemes are 42 per cent. more than what was predicted. Only one recent Highways Agency scheme has come in under cost. None the less, it must be acknowledged that some newer schemes are more expensive than some of the initial ones. The estimated cost per kilometre was about &pound;10.2 million for completed schemes and it is about &pound;13.2 million for those that are projected. That is a real difference. However, it is not a linear difference&mdash;an obvious, continuous escalation. For example, there is a significant difference between the cost per kilometre for Sheffield and Manchester. There is no clear pattern at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/4">The Minister is on record as saying something to the effect that we must find out why it costs twice as much to build trams&mdash;</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.92.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" speakername="Kelvin Hopkins" colnum="92"  time="10:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h01.htm#51130h01_spnew23">
	<p pid="a.92.0/1">I am interested in the parallel with the railways in this context; Railtrack's cost per mile has risen by four times since privatisation. The costs are not to do with problems inherent to tramways, but are something to do with the way that we build things.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.92.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="92"  time="10:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h01.htm#51130h01_spnew24">
	<p pid="a.92.1/1">Yes, there is a genuine reason to drill down into the costs and find out why they are as they are. My hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale wants the Department to go down that route. However, perhaps we should consider simple continental comparisons for capital costs. I mentioned the figure of &pound;13.2 million per kilometre for projected costs in the UK. The Bordeaux tram scheme is coming in at about &pound;18 million per kilometre. The Paris scheme, the T3, is coming in at about &pound;15.4 million per kilometre. Even quite modest schemes in Portugal and Barcelona are coming in at between &pound;8 million and &pound;10 million per kilometre.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/2">Across the board tram schemes are pretty expensive, and the British ones do not necessarily compare as unfavourably as we might think with those on the continent. The Merseytram scheme was to be 19 km in length and the projected Paris scheme is much shorter. Were it to be extended to the same length as the Mersey scheme would have been, it would come in at about &pound;400 million. That will give hon. Members an idea of the comparative costs&mdash;even with the high consultancy costs and utility costs for British schemes, and the significant local subsidies that go into continental schemes in addition to Government subsidies.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/3">Some of the schemes that we are developing have, none the less, unique features. I want to dwell briefly on an aspect of the Merseyside scheme that died the death yesterday. It was unique in some ways compared with many of the continental models, because it would have joined a series of wards and constituencies where there are large numbers of people who might be described as socially excluded in many ways. It was advanced primarily as a regeneration scheme. Many of the continental schemes do not do that, but tend to link together areas of high economic activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/4">While we are going through the blame-laying exercise for the Merseyside scheme we may ponder what the Department's take on that would be. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1664" name="George Howarth">The right hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth)</phrase> put forward the view that the local authorities in Liverpool were not united. I have been present at some meetings at which they were very united, but had slightly different takes on the matter. Authorities such as Knowsley and Liverpool city council, which stood wholly to benefit, would obviously be, on balance, more enthusiastic than those such as Wirral, which needed to worry about the repercussions such as the cost of tolls and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/5">I reject what the right hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East said about Merseyside political culture being dysfunctional, because that is not true across the board in relation to all kinds of schemes.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.93.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1664" speakername="George Howarth" colnum="93"  time="10:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h01.htm#51130h01_spnew25">
	<p pid="a.93.0/1">The hon. Gentleman should be more accurate about what I said. My comparison was specifically with Greater Manchester, where each section 151 officer gave the assurances necessary. That did not happen on Merseyside, although there may be good reasons why it did not.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.93.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="93"  time="10:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h01.htm#51130h01_spnew26">
	<p pid="a.93.1/1">There were extra expectations of the Merseyside political community that did not exist in Manchester, but I will come to that later.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/2">There is another view of the Merseytram scheme: that the Government are looking for a way out of a scheme that they are not convinced provides value for money. The Northwest Development Agency would have preferred the projected route to Liverpool John Lennon airport to be the first route, because that would have guaranteed obvious regional benefits, but it would also have lost some of the equally obvious social exclusion benefits. Such a scheme might have been more broadly supported across the political community. I simply do not know.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/3">I would like to know what advice the Government offered at the early stage about how to proceed. The Government's tone throughout the scheme has been largely that of a bank manager rather than a partner. They have not taken a proper partnership approach. The supposition that local authorities, which are, after all, capped, can take on board whatever liabilities come their way, and that the Government are just stuck at the figure of &pound;170 million does not reflect, for example, the experience in Edinburgh with the Scottish Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/4">The experience on Merseyside has been traumatic, wearing and deeply discouraging. People on Merseyside want to know where the &pound;170 million is actually going to go, because at the moment Merseyside is a net loser in real terms. Significant amounts of money have already been spent on the scheme, with no result so far.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/5">Many Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase>, have said that there is a north-south split in the debate, and there genuinely is. Most Members present are from the north. Looking ahead, do we really think that schemes such as Crossrail, and the billions that will be spent on them, will be subject to same rigour as schemes that are far less expensive in real terms? Why, for example, did the Government change their attitude in the negotiation with the Merseyside passenger transport authority and the Merseyside political community and insist that the local authority, not the PTA, underwrite the scheme? Was that advice given right at the start, and if not, should it have been?</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/6">That leads us to the big question: are the Government trying to give up on trams, full stop? What will they do to make tram schemes proceed better in the future? What will they do to reduce the costs of such schemes&mdash;the cost associated with the utilities and so on? What will they do to respond to the criticism made of them in April 2005 by the Public Accounts Committee? Why are they taking such a non-negotiable stance on tram schemes? That stance is not applied to road schemes, and it is not found in Scotland, where the Scottish Executive consider light rail and other schemes. How will the Government evaluate and weight subsequent schemes? What advice will they offer? Why does it take them so long to give a clear steer to local authorities that are progressing the schemes? That refrain has been repeated many times during the debate. There are appreciable transactional and contractual costs involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/7">What do the Government expect of future schemes? How do they think that they will be progressed? Will they all be progressed as part of a regional priority list? I saw a speculative list for regional transport for the north-west quite recently, and &pound;825 million&mdash;of an overall figure of about &pound;1.4 billion, I think&mdash;was allocated for future transport schemes. Will transport schemes in the future require the assent of the region rather than being progressed through PTAs? For example, what is the future for major projects not in the Minister's in-tray, such as the Blackpool tram scheme? What of future schemes? What about alternatives to our big-scale schemes? Is there any future, for example, for trolleybuses and the like?</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/8">With so much confusion and uncertainty around, we need specific answers from the Minister. At the moment, there is collective unhappiness across the north-west region&mdash;and the north region in general&mdash;which I hope that the Minister can do something to assuage.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.94.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1825" speakername="John Hayes" colnum="94"  time="10:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h01.htm#51130h01_spnew27">
	<p pid="a.94.0/1">Trams were once used extensively in the UK, and at the peak there were 300 systems, but by the modern age the number reduced and eventually only the one in Blackpool survived. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> on bringing this matter to the attention of the Chamber, and I congratulate all hon. Members who have contributed to this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/2">Seven new systems have opened in England since 1980, with an average of 138 million passenger journeys being made each year on approximately 235 km of track. However, there has been a degree of pathos about this debate&mdash;frustrated hopes, faded dreams, disillusioned communities and disappointed representatives&mdash;because there is doubt about the Government's commitment to light railways, and about their understanding of how such systems can play a vital part in regenerating communities. We heard about that from hon. Members from all parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/3">The six new systems outside London are the Tyne and Wear Metro, Manchester Metrolink, Sheffield's Supertram, Midland Metro, Croydon Tramlink and the Nottingham Express Transit. In April 1991, the Select Committee on Transport pointed to six main advantages of light rail: it reduces traffic congestion, has positive environmental impacts, conserves energy, assists urban regeneration, generally provides a high-quality service, is often conducive to better access for disabled people, and has a prestige value for a host city.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/4">Light rail schemes should be encouraged where they will be of particular benefit&mdash;that is, in busy city centres. The great advantage of light rail is, as the Transport Committee said, that</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/5" class="indent">&quot;it can increase the number of people coming into a&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/6">city</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/7" class="indent">&quot;centre without increasing congestion.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/8">According to the Committee, light rail and tram systems could carry more than 3,000 passengers per hour in vehicles containing up to 350 people. Trams are more environmentally friendly than buses and cars and they are safer, as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/9">There are also regeneration benefits. The docklands light railway and Manchester Metrolink have boosted the prestige of their cities and are attractive to visitors. The experience of the Nottingham Express Transit in its first year of operation, with 8.5 million passenger journeys above target and a &pound;23,000 operating profit, shows the potential of good light rail schemes. The Nottingham scheme has applied to the Government to be able to construct an additional line. No doubt the Minister will give us some information on that application when he winds up.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/10">The main barriers to light rail schemes are affordability, and the potential of the system to integrate with the rest of the local transport network. The only reservation that I have about tramways is the question of their beauty. I wonder why, in the modern age, we cannot build more beautiful things. One thinks of the Routemaster bus and trains from ages past. Why can we not make trams look better? We should not strip life of all its elegance and style, should we, Mr. O'Hara? I offer this small caveat in relation to my general support for these schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/11">Cost is the most significant factor discouraging further development of light rail, but as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> said, when cost comparisons are measured in terms of passenger journeys, they are more positive than might generally be suggested. The emphasis is often on the construction cost&mdash;the infrastructural up-front capital cost&mdash;but when one takes into account costs over time, which the hon. Member for Rochdale mentioned, those considerations can be seen in a different light.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/12">More could be done to overcome that barrier. For example, there are no Government grants available to develop innovative, energy-saving light railway technologies, because that tends to cost less than &pound;5 million, which is the qualifying threshold for a scheme to receive financial support.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/13">There are other issues that the Government must address, and I hope that the Minister will touch on them: the poor financial performance of some existing light railway systems, which is discouraging interest in future schemes, and how the Government can assist in respect of that; local authority funding for schemes; the issue of time, and uncertainty over the granting of powers to local authorities; and insufficient in-house expertise.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/14">Above all, as the Public Accounts Committee recommended in March:</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/15" class="indent">&quot;The Department should develop a strategy for the development of light rail as part of an integrated transport network. The Department has maintained an arm's length approach to the development of light rail, leaving local authorities to decide whether light rail was appropriate for their areas, and not prioritising in value for money terms which schemes should be allocated funds and built. It should take a more active role in the development of light rail by, for example, indicating the types of urban areas where it would be most receptive to local authorities' proposals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/16">As a Transport Committee report this year stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/17" class="indent">&quot;The Department has failed to give a strategic lead in the development of light rail.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/18">In 2000, Labour pledged to double light rail use in England by 2010, measured by the number of passenger journeys. In 2000&ndash;01 there were 124 million journeys, and in 2003&ndash;04 there were 147 million journeys&mdash;an increase of 18.5 per cent. It seems unlikely that the Government will achieve their target. Since 1997, only one new system has commenced outside London&mdash;the Nottingham Express Transit Scheme. I know that scheme well. As the Minister is aware, like the Sunderland extension to the Tyne and Wear Metro and other lines that have opened since 1997, the Nottingham scheme was a proposal whose funding and planning were inherited from the Conservative Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/19">Only yesterday we learned from the Government that they have cancelled funding for two light rail schemes&mdash;Merseytram and the south Hampshire rapid transit scheme. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1596" name="Peter Viggers">My hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers)</phrase> made a strong and bold case for that scheme; he is a great champion for local people in that respect, as in many others.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/20">The Government have now spent &pound;284 million developing rail projects that have come to nothing. That was revealed by a question asked by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1795" name="Alan Duncan">my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan)</phrase>. I will mention each of those schemes, because they have been repeatedly defended in t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1664" name="George Howarth">his Chamber by the right hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth)</phrase>, the hon. Members for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd), for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland) and for Manchester, Blackley, and by my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport. The following sums were spent on them: &pound;199 million on Manchester Metrolink phase 3; &pound;36 million on Merseytram; &pound;39 million on the Leeds supertram; and &pound;10 million on the south Hampshire rapid transit scheme. All that money was invested in schemes that will not now go ahead; hence the pathos, disappointment and disillusionment that I described earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/21">I have several questions for the Minister. Does the extension to the Nottingham Express Transit have Government approval? If so, when will we know? Will local authorities be entitled to money from the transport innovation fund for light rail schemes if they are not accompanied by road charging proposals? There was something about that in the national press yesterday; the Government's enthusiasm for congestion charging is clear. I make no point about that, except to ask how it would be integrated with applications for light rail schemes. What guarantees can the Government give that light rail remains a priority, and that they will meet their target of passenger numbers doubling by 2010? What proportion of the transport innovation fund does the Minister envisage offering to light rail schemes, given the other priorities that the Government have announced?</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/22">What is the Government's response to the recent urban task force report? It argued:</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/23" class="indent">&quot;the root of the problem is that decisions on urban transport are taken piecemeal, in apparent isolation from their impact on regeneration; indeed, there appears to be next to no evaluation of the broad regeneration benefits that investments would help bring about.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/24">There are competing public priorities, which often obscure the holistic benefits of this kind of innovation. The Government need to engage in joined-up thinking; the only thing that is joined-up at present is the traffic on congested roads. They have created a debilitating culture of encouraging schemes into the development and planning stage and putting in taxpayers' money, then pulling the plug before construction begins. The Minister needs to make it clear where the Government stand on future projects, and how committed they are to light rail. I described the pathos that has characterised this debate; the Minister now has an opportunity to prove that neither he, his Department nor the Government are pathetic.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> on securing this important debate. It is not possible to deal with all the points that have been raised in the short time available, so I will try to deal with as many as possible in my speech. I ask hon. Members to be patient.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/2">From what one or two Members have said, one would think that we had done nothing for transport, but we have seen record investment in public transport after years of neglect, major regeneration of our main cities, and major success stories in transport generally.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/3">I shall use the short time available to deal with the issues before us, and I welcome the opportunity to debate this matter and set out the Government's position. As we all know, and as hon. Members have said, we have had a difficult time in the past few weeks in terms of taking decisions. I want to make it clear that light rail has a future in Britain in the right places and as part of the right overall package, but that we will not support schemes at any cost. The success of light rail has been partly due to the Government's contribution of about &pound;700 million to light rail schemes since 1997. Six such schemes have opened across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/4">Light rail journeys have increased by 130 per cent. in the past 10 years. In 2005, journeys increased by 8.4 per cent. compared with the previous year&mdash;more than on national rail and London Underground. In all, 155 million journeys were made on light rail systems in England last year. Light rail is a small contributor, given the increasing use in public transport, but its share is increasing.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/5">Obviously, lessons can be learned from past experiences. Too many light rail schemes have seen their costs increase substantially after we have approved them. With the Manchester Metrolink phase 3 extensions, the public sector funding requirement almost tripled between our first approval in 2000 and the end of 2004. For the scheme in south Hampshire there was a 50 per cent. increase, and for the Leeds supertram and Merseytram, the public sector cost increased by 40 per cent. We need to have full confidence in a scheme's cost, viability and cost-effectiveness before giving it the go-ahead, and we must be satisfied that the procurement approach proposed is appropriate and offers the best value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/6">If light rail is to be successful, it needs to be part of an integrated approach. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> and others have said, last year light rail came under the scrutiny of the National Audit Office. Recent reports by the Select Committee on Public Accounts and the Select Committee on Transport have made several valid suggestions about how the Government's role in light rail might be strengthened.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/7">Under the new approach, we will be more rigorous, and will not give final approval until final prices have been received through a competitive procurement process. That will mean that schemes' promoters will need to develop more robust proposals, and provide evidence of their certainty regarding the risks and estimated costs and of the fact that the scheme is deliverable on time and on budget. They will also have to demonstrate that it is a high priority for the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/8">The Department has been considering how success can be built upon and best practice shared. It has been working closely with promoters through a programme of work streams and with the passenger transport executive light rail group. We are working to ensure that better specific guidance about developing a light rail scheme is available to promoters and local authorities, and have recognised the importance of working with industry. We are also working closely with UKTram, which has set up working groups to take forward streams of work, which include the development of technical, operational and safety management standards and best practice guidelines. We will continue to support UKTram in that work.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/9">We also want to improve project delivery. We will make sure that, where necessary, major transport schemes go through the formal gateway process run by the Office of Government Commerce, to ensure that projects at critical stages are in a fit state to move forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/10">I reiterate the fact that light rail does have a future in the UK. In areas of heavy traffic it might be the best solution to transport problems, as it can be the most effective way of getting people out of their cars.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.0/1">In my constituency, a major benefit would be the resulting modal shift from car to tram. A local developer developing a site in the constituency has been heavily promoting the fact that people will be able to use the tram to get to and from the city centre&mdash;but now, given the uncertain future of Metrolink, the same developer is offering people cars as an incentive to buy flats in that development. Surely the fact that Metrolink has been delayed in south Manchester is increasing congestion in the area.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.1/1">I will come on to Metrolink in a bit more detail later, but it is clearly an attractive way to get people out of their cars. That is part of the strong case that Members of Parliament for Manchester have made to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/2">Given its high cost, light rail will not be the right solution in every location. We expect scheme promoters to explore all the options for meeting their transport problems, especially the possibility of delivering better bus services, before they approach us for funding for a light rail scheme. For instance, work that we did with Leeds suggested that high-quality buses could deliver most of the benefits, and at a lower cost. We look forward to working with Leeds to develop a showcase high-quality bus system that may well provide a model for other cities.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/3">Where light rail is the best solution, it will need to be developed as part of an integrated approach to tackling an area's problems. Light rail schemes will need to be supported by commitments to complementary measures that will deliver the benefits of increased public transport usage and reduced congestion, and that will support the viability of the light rail system.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.1/1">I will not, if the hon. Gentleman does not mind, as time is limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/2">Through the transport innovation fund, we have undertaken to provide support for such innovative packages of measure. Those packages should combine demand management and better public transport, which might include light rail in some cases. The funding will be available from 2008&ndash;09, and on Monday my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced seven areas that have been successful in securing pump-priming funding to help with the development of schemes. They include Greater Manchester, which will assess the potential for demand management measures to complement its tram extension proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/3">The existing Manchester Metrolink has been a success. The first phase opened in 1992, and the second in 2000. Today it carries more than 19 million passengers a year, and there are times when it suffers from overcrowding. I am in no doubt that the system has helped in Manchester's economic success, and that improvements to the system are worth making. The plans for extensions to the system were dogged by cost increases, as I said earlier. Last year, the Department worked closely with the Manchester authorities to understand what the proposals would now cost. In December 2004, the Secretary of State announced that he was committing more than &pound;500 million&mdash;the sum previously agreed for funding phase 3&mdash;to Manchester's transport network.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/4">Manchester could also bid for additional funds from the new transport innovation fund. In June, I went to Manchester and announced that the Government were committing &pound;58 million to enhancing capacity and refurbishing parts of the existing system. We are continuing to work with the Greater Manchester passenger transport executive to finalise details of the scheme. As my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley, said, we are still discussing those proposals with it. We will be in a position to say something about that when those discussions are completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/5">The Department is also in discussion with the PTE about its strategy for extensions to the system as part of an integrated transport package for the area. That includes the extension to Oldham and Rochdale. The GMPTE has given us an integrated transport strategy document as a basis for dialogue on a transport innovation fund bid that would incorporate the extensions and other measures. Discussions are at an early stage, and we are working closely with the PTE to take them forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/6">We will continue to support tram schemes if they are the right solution for a particular area, and if their costs can be justified by bringing wider benefits. Certainly, we expect to fund some light rail schemes in future, but only as part of an integrated approach, to maximise the benefits.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the plight of Altrincham general hospital. I am sorry that it is the second occasion on which proposed closure of this well-used and much-loved hospital has prompted me to seek such a debate. I believe that the Adjournment debate that I secured on the subject in July 1999 was instrumental in saving the hospital. I hope very much that the same will prove true today.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/2">Since 1870, when Altrincham general hospital was built through the generous support of local people, it has served the community well. In recent years its services have included intermediate care beds for the elderly, located in a convenient place where friends and relatives, who are frequently elderly and dependent on public transport, can easily visit in-patients. There is also a busy minor injuries unit, serving 11,000 patients a year, and a large number of clinics providing 20,000 out-patients with blood tests, diabetes services, cardiology, audiology and much more.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/3">For 20 years or more, there have been questions over whether to refurbish the existing buildings or to build a new hospital for the people of Altrincham and Sale. Under the previous Government, a clear commitment had been given that no closure would take place unless and until a new hospital was in place. As recently as July this year, the local NHS was giving clear commitments that a review of community hospitals would not mean closure of Altrincham general hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/4">Mr. David Cain, the Trafford Healthcare NHS Trust chief executive, sent a letter to Councillor John Lamb in July, in which he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/5" class="indent">&quot;I write to confirm that the board of the Trafford Healthcare NHS Trust have no plans to close the wards at Altrincham General.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/6">He went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/7" class="indent">&quot;I understand that my Chair has responded to a letter from Councillor Susan Fildes, as leader of Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council in an email of July 15, to advise that our board has no plans to close Altrincham General Hospital or individual wards.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/8">That followed the statement from the primary care trust last November, when consultation was launched on how to invest in the community hospitals in Altrincham and Stretford. Leslie Robertson, the then chairman of the Trafford South primary care trust, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/9" class="indent">&quot;This exercise is not about closing the hospital but developing our services on the site. We know that many people have a vital interest in the future development of services at Altrincham general hospital. We want them, as well as staff and other partners, to take a full and active role in the development of proposals for change. These options will then go forward to formal public consultation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/10">The chief executive of the Trafford South primary care trust, Dr. Tim Riley, added:</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/11" class="indent">&quot;We are delighted with the response from local people, staff and others. We know that both these hospitals are much valued by the local community and we are pleased to be working so closely with everyone to gather your ideas for change.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/12">It was all very positive and consensual.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/13">Just six weeks ago, I met the trust's chief executive to discuss concerns about local health care provision, including ways in which services at Altrincham general could be expanded. I left that meeting feeling optimistic and positive. I felt that Altrincham had a good, expanding future with investment, refurbishment and more services. It came as a sickening blow on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-15">15 November</phrase> when, faced with a public interest report regarding the trust's deficit, the board adopted an emergency proposal that included the closure of the hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/14">On Friday of last week, I had further discussions with David Cain and Professor Robert Tinston, who has been asked to conduct a rapid review, to be concluded by Christmas, of the options for health care provision in the area. I urged Professor Tinston to take a genuinely open-minded approach and to try to find a better solution than that proposed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-15">15 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/15">What do I seek from the Minister? I do not want to be over-simplistic and I do not want to be drawn too far into the wider financial problems of some NHS trusts, including Trafford. It seems astonishing, however, that with all the extra money being pumped into the NHS, we face hospital closures and service cuts rather than expansion and improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/16">I have two straightforward objectives. First, the trust is consulting the public regarding its cost-saving proposals. I want to leave the Minister in no doubt whatever: my constituents and people elsewhere in south Trafford are united in their determination to keep our local hospital. A few days ago, I saw more than 3,000 people sign a petition to save Altrincham general in the space of just three hours. I have never before seen people queuing to sign a petition in that way. In the two weeks since the trust board proposed closure, 720 constituents have contacted me by post or e-mail to support the hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/17">If Ministers and NHS bosses are serious about consulting the public there is only one message that they can possibly take out of the consultation: my constituents are not mildly irritated by the proposed closure of Altrincham general; they are furious. They insist on keeping the excellent local facility that was built by the local community and for which our taxes now pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/18">My second objective is to ask the Minister to intervene to ensure that the trust moves away from its knee-jerk panic response to its deficit. On calm reflection, there are many reasons why it would be counter-productive to close Altrincham general hospital. The figures speak for themselves. Tens of thousands of patients make use of a local health facility. Altrincham general is not just an asset for the community; it also brings a revenue stream into the trust, as the Minister well knows. Its closure could therefore exacerbate the problems of the deficit rather than help to solve them.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/19">The problem with Altrincham hospital is not that it is inherently unviable, but that it needs a significant capital sum spent to update it. The trust and the health authority should be examining ways to secure the necessary capital and to increase the revenue streams coming through the hospital. The trust tells me that that primary care trust has approximately &pound;2 million of capital funding available, which could be directed towards the project. The recent closure of St. Anne's hospital in Altrincham also raises the prospect of a significant capital receipt in due course, which could, and should, be spent within the community to ensure proper health provision in Altrincham and Sale.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/20">I mentioned the 20,000 out-patients using clinics at Altrincham, but further possible services could be brought to Altrincham to increase the revenue flows. Perhaps the most obvious would be to use Altrincham as the location for a local breast care unit, for which there is a desperate need, as the Minister knows, following the recent closure of the unit at Trafford general. We were told that that closure was temporary, but in the current climate of the deficit at the trust, I am concerned that it might get lost in the midst of the wider problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/21">However, that does not remove the fact that there is a need within the Trafford and south Manchester area for a proper dedicated breast care unit that brings together all the services and facilities needed for patients suffering from that type of illness. Given the amount of space available at Altrincham general, it would be possible to have such a unit there rather than shoehorning it into other facilities, such as those at Wythenshawe hospital, which might be the alternative.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/22">When the local NHS published its proposals to close Altrincham general, local people felt shocked, angry and betrayed. It is not a failing hospital, but a much-loved, well-used hospital which has dedicated staff and massive reserves of good will in the community. I hope that the Minister can reassure my constituents that the fate of their hospital will not be decided by a panic reaction to the trust's deficit and that, instead, real efforts will be made to find an imaginative solution to secure the long-term future of this vital institution.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1371" name="Graham Brady">the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady)</phrase> on securing a debate on the future of Altrincham general hospital. He has taken an interest in it over a number of years, and I welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/2">I want to separate three different lines of argument. The first is the future funding available to the global health economy. The second is how we take forward and build stronger services in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. The third relates to the process for making decisions about health services in his constituency in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/3">The starting point for the debate must be to reflect on how far we have come. I read, with some interest, the <i>Hansard</i> of the hon. Gentleman's Adjournment debate in 1999. He attacked remorselessly what he described as spin on investment and waiting lists. I hope he will now join me in congratulating the NHS in his area on the way in which local health professionals have gripped record investment and the opportunity offered by our reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/4">I looked at some of the figures late last night and, along with the rest of England, fewer people in Altrincham have to wait for treatment. In September, 336 people waited more than 13 weeks for their first out-patient appointment, compared with 968 in 1997. There is also some pretty impressive progress on in-patient treatment. In September, only 112 patients at the trust had to wait more than six months, compared with nearly 1,000 in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/5">When we consider the number of people who have to wait more than nine months for in-patient treatment, we see some of the great strides that have been taken. In 1997, 380 people had been on a waiting list for more than nine months in the trust that serves the hon. Gentleman's constituency. As of September this year, no one was waiting more than nine months.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/6">There is a similar story to tell about the improvements in access to health care in the case of primary care. In September, every patient in the Trafford South primary care trust area could be offered an appointment to see their GP within two working days. The result of the extra investment and of bringing down waiting lists is quite simple: more lives are being saved in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. Cancer mortality rates in the Trafford local authority area have fallen by around 15 per cent. in the period between 1995 to 1997 and 2001 to 2003. That is higher than the national average of about 13 per cent. Death rates from circulatory disease in the same period have fallen by around 28 per cent. The extra investment is not only delivering better front-line care, but saving lives. Those are examples of how one community is benefiting in the same way as the rest of the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.0/1">I am happy to respond to the Minister's invitation to congratulate local health care professionals. I also want to be able to congratulate him after the debate, which I will do if he gives some reassurance that we will keep our excellent local hospital and have a proper breast care unit in south Trafford to serve my constituents.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.104.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" speakername="Liam Byrne" colnum="104"  time="11:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h02.htm#51130h02_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.104.1/1">I shall come on to that question directly. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman is able to join me in congratulating local NHS staff. It is, after all, their hard work and dedication, backed by the reform and extra resources secured by the Government, that have been harnessed to such good effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/2">The debate is not about the past; it is about the future. The Government do not plan to sit on their laurels. We want to take the services provided by local health care in Altrincham much further, much faster. Let us start with the money. Further progress will be made. In the current financial year, Trafford South primary care trust is receiving an allocation of about &pound;128 million, which is nearly 6 per cent. up on last year. By 2007&ndash;08, that will have increased to &pound;164 million. With that level of funding, we fully expect the local health service to continue to improve and NHS organisations to deliver substantial changes for the better in front-line care.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/3">The increase in money over the next two years is &pound;36 million. That is four times the projected year-end deficit of Altrincham general hospital. Although about 25 per cent. of NHS trusts up and down the country are currently in deficit, when we set those deficits against the projected increases in funding, we see that they are a small part of the picture. The real question and the quite fantastic choice that confronts the local NHS in the hon. Gentleman's constituency is how it is going to spend that unprecedented increase in resources over the next couple of years. What should it spend on hospitals, primary care and community services? How best can it spend that extra &pound;36 million to benefit his constituents? How much should be spent on, for example, Altrincham general hospital?</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/4">Let us consider the hospital in some detail. As the hon. Gentleman says, it was built in 1870. It is currently used by about 20,000 out-patients a year, across a range of specialties. There has been a fall of about 14 per cent. in out-patient activity at the hospital over the past three years. There is a nurse-led minor injuries unit that treats 10,000 people a year and a 26-bed rehabilitation unit for elderly patients. However, the beds are based in two Nightingale wards and there is no resident medical support for those patients. The doctors that support the service are based at Trafford general hospital. Last year, 242 patients were admitted to the ward. In-patient activity at Altrincham has declined by about 30 per cent. over the past three years. The hon. Gentleman will probably know this, but about three quarters of Altrincham residents receive their in-patient treatment at neighbouring trusts.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.0/1">I do not dispute the Minister's figures, but I am sure that he knows that the reduction in in-patient activity is due to the fact that wards were closed by the trust in previous years and that the reduction in out-patient activity is not because of a reduction in demand, but because of the way in which patients are being channelled and directed to clinics at Trafford general which are less convenient and less local.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.105.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" speakername="Liam Byrne" colnum="105"  time="11:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h02.htm#51130h02_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.105.1/1">The backlog maintenance costs at Altrincham general hospital amount to about &pound;5.8 million. It is the trust's view that the hospital is not suitable for the provision of modern health care. Dr. Frank McKenna, the divisional clinical director of medicine in Trafford, said of Altrincham:</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/2" class="indent">&quot;The inpatient wards are no longer an acceptable standard for the treatment of our patients. We have a superb, modern rehabilitation unit at Trafford General which is not only more comfortable for patients, but is also safer. Transfer of the rehab beds from Altrincham General Hospital is long overdue and should be welcomed by patients or relatives who need this service.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/3">So the hospital is providing services for which there is a strong case for a different kind of provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/4">More importantly&mdash;this is the real point&mdash;when we are putting more money into the NHS and writing cheques for &pound;36 million, it is not unreasonable to say that we need that money to be spent well, in the way that best benefits the hon. Gentleman's constituents. We are happy to write a big cheque, but we are not happy to write a blank cheque. There is potentially a strong case for the alternative siting of services that are based at Altrincham general hospital. Under any scenario, however, I have to be assured that the out-patient services, clinics and minor injuries units currently based at the hospital will be provided in alternative accommodation in Altrincham.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/5">It is important that any reforms are seen against the backdrop of our commitment to community hospitals. As the hon. Gentleman will know, we made a manifesto commitment to develop a new generation of modern NHS community hospitals and to bring on line 50 new or refurbished community hospitals over the next five years. Those need to be state-of-the-art centres because we made a big promise in our manifesto to cut waiting times from the scandalous year and a half that we inherited to just 18 weeks. That means that the new centres have to provide diagnostics, day surgery and out-patient facilities much closer to where people live and work. That is essential if we are to deliver our manifesto commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/6">We made that commitment because we know about the potential of community hospitals, which will help us to move care and diagnostic services outside acute hospitals and much closer to where patients live&mdash;they will provide care around the clock and around the corner. The Department is working out how to deliver that manifesto commitment in detail, and the outcomes of the major consultation exercise &quot;Your health, your care, your say&quot; will be fed into the process around the turn of the year. We are listening to the public to develop health services in a direction that is set by them.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/7">What does all that mean for the hon. Gentleman? The third line of argument that I promised to discuss was the process by which decisions are made. He referred to commitments made earlier this year and cited a letter based on comments from Trafford Healthcare NHS Trust about investing in Altrincham general hospital. I am told that those plans, which were at a preliminary stage, must now be considered against the question of how to spend the extra &pound;36 million in his constituency in a way that strengthens front-line care in Altrincham. The right approach is surely for the local health economy to have the opportunity to review the provision of services across not only his constituency, but the whole of Trafford. It is vital to stress that, at this stage, any proposals to re-site services are only proposals for debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/8">The local health economy accepts that it has to take the actions set out in the auditor's report. Greater Manchester strategic health authority has announced, and has informed local MPs, that it will take a lead in the process of outlining a way forward for the Trafford health system. That will build on the work carried out to date and will involve the local NHS, local politicians, patients and other stakeholders. That work has started and will continue over the next two months.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/9">The SHA has commissioned Robert Tinston to undertake that work, and I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has met him. He is a former NHS manager and was the regional director of the north-west office of the Department of Health until 2002. He has been tasked with producing a report that will unpick different levels of support for different options. He will also set out options for further consideration and decision, as well as making recommendations about the way forward. His report will be used for further discussion with the SHA and with the NHS in Trafford and Greater Manchester as a precursor to any public consultation. Such consultation is, of course, statutory and will be undertaken by Trafford PCTs in spring next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/10">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bringing the debate to the Chamber. It is an important issue and there are great opportunities ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.0/1">I have a sense that the Minister is moving towards a conclusion and I am keen to press him on a couple of points. I think he has given a commitment that the closure of Altrincham general hospital is not a foregone conclusion and that it is possible to avoid it. I also think that he has given a commitment that the local NHS may choose to spend the money that he says is available in whatever way is deemed to be appropriate locally, including the possibility that it may keep Altrincham general hospital. If he is prepared to confirm both those things, I shall be very happy.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.0/1">It would be quite wrong for any Minister to prejudge the results of any consultation. Robert Tinston was given the job of coming up with options, of testing different degrees of local support and of making recommendations. That will form a working document, which must be subject to a consultation thereafter. I do not rule any option in or out at this stage. It would be wholly inappropriate to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.0/2">The hon. Gentleman referred to the importance of breast screening to his constituents. I am advised that the SHA has temporarily suspended the service at Trafford, and patients go to Withington hospital for diagnosis and to Wythenshawe hospital for treatment. A review of that service is being conducted, and it should be completed in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.0/3">Important consultations will be carried out in the next three or four months. This is a time of extraordinary opportunity to strengthen front-line care yet again in the NHS. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman will, I am sure, bring this debate to his constituents' doorsteps in Altrincham.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.1/1">May I welcome you, Mr. O'Hara, to the Chair and thank you for chairing today's proceedings? I am delighted to have the opportunity to open this debate on London and the 2012 Olympics. We all remember that great day in July when we won the Olympic bid. I was at Stratford with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1921" name="Lyn Brown">my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown)</phrase> and our legs nearly collapsed beneath us with surprise and delight that we had won. We now know, however, that there is a large challenge ahead. <i>[Interruption.] </i>I hope that that was not a rude comment from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase>. It is obvious that I shall have to visit Weight Watchers.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/2">We all now know the importance of the next steps for London to ensure that we secure the long term benefits. To summarise what the Olympics are about, if we think of the five Olympic rings, we also think of the five key challenges of the London 2012 Olympics for our capital city and our nation. We need world-class venues. We need world-class, record-breaking Olympic and Paralympic games. We need a step change in local employment opportunities so that the east end of London in particular is transformed once and for all. We all look forward to a leap forward in participation in sport and physical activity in the United Kingdom from now on and, crucially, after 2012. The most important thing is a living legacy for the 21st century both for my area of London and the wider nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/3">I want to highlight some of the issues and challenges within those five themes, and then I will touch on the key issues for east London and Hackney in particular. First, great venues are clearly a must. We now have Jack Lemley and David Higgins, formerly of the channel tunnel rail link and English Partnerships respectively, as chair and chief executive and bringing their useful and welcome experience to the Olympic agencies. We also need to see the London Development Agency's procurement and job brokerage schemes working for local people so that now, up to and beyond 2012 local people and businesses gain from the jobs that are available and we do not lose contracts to the wider world. I will touch more on that later.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/4">Secondly, we will have a great games. I have no doubt about that. Rightly, that is the major focus for the International Olympic Committee and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic games. We have a good team in Lord Coe, Lord Moynihan, Keith Mills and their colleagues to ensure that the games are an enormous success. I wish to raise a local issue, however. I met some nine-year-old schoolchildren and one of the key issues they raised was whether they would get tickets. The Minister should focus particularly on that. Those local nine-year-olds will be 16 at the time of the Olympics and they do not want to lose out to international visitors, much as we will welcome them.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/5">Thirdly, we want to see local jobs. The London Development Agency is working to deliver a procurement chain so that for every large contract that is delivered, a chain of smaller local businesses from the east end of London, London as a whole and the rest of the UK can benefit from the job and business opportunities that arise from the Olympics. The agency is launching a job brokerage scheme to match people to jobs in the east end in particular, which is something we need to see work if the people in my area are to benefit in the long term. It is also developing a business club so that when the big contracts are let, the businesses involved can go to local businesses to find someone to match the skills they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/6">Those are all good ideas, and I have no doubt that the London Development Agency is committed to them. However, as Members of Parliament and others with an interest in the Olympics and east London, we must keep a close eye on those ideas to ensure that they deliver. We have to raise a question about the Learning and Skills Council and the London Development Agency: which has the lead role in delivering jobs and training locally? We must make sure that there is no confusion and territorial land grabbing while local people lose out.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/7">Groups of businesses must also help themselves. I recently chaired a meeting of creative and voluntary groups in Hackney. Those individuals and organisations were keen to be involved in the Olympics and were talking about ways in which they could get involved as they were worried that they might get left behind. I am delighted that the Olympic Delivery Authority, in its early form, has told me that it is willing to engage with businesses, and is keen that the groups organise together and approach it to see what they can gain by working together.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/8">Creative businesses are big business in Hackney, and they can help us to create now and for the long term London's new east bank, a cultural and creative quarter for our city and our nation. We will see that culminate in a vibrant national and international creative hub in the form of the Olympic institute, which is a welcome development. It will include facilities for sport, sports medicine, ecology, biodiversity and cultural and creative industries. The project is supported by all five local boroughs and builds on Hackney's well deserved reputation as a centre for creative business.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on obtaining the debate, but I wonder whether she has set her sights too low for the institute. We do not have a sports university; we have no deposit for our digital sports rights; we have no centre of training, coaching, psychology and history. Would not it be better if we set our sights higher?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.109.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" speakername="Meg Hillier" colnum="109"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h03.htm#51130h03_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.109.1/1">I bow to my hon. Friend's expertise in this matter, but I think that the most crucial thing is to establish the institute and get it grounded before we develop further ideas about building on it. The main thing is to get the foundations in place. His suggestion would therefore be something to build on in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/2">I have touched on some of the positive aspects of the subject. Key issues also arise affecting job creation and skill development, and I have some stark facts to outline about employment in my constituency. Unemployment in Hackney, South and Shoreditch is the 12th highest in the UK. Yet the ratio of jobs to people of working age is 1.1, which is above the UK and London average. In my constituency, 22.7 per cent. of people of working age have no formal qualifications. London-wide, the figure is only 13.9 per cent.&mdash;that is still too high, but Hackney's rate is considerably higher. Also, 28.3 per cent. of unemployed people in the constituency are aged between 18 and 24.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/3">Those figures show that the issue is not just jobs. There are jobs available and it is important that local people are skilled for the long term, and that any training that is offered is matched to jobs that are or will be available. Who, however, will care whether local people get those jobs? I am pleased that work is already going on in the Olympic Delivery Authority, in its early form, both to develop a local employment framework, so that main contractors and their subcontractors&mdash;they are crucial to what is happening&mdash;will consider local people and to establish a London living wage policy. I am delighted that J. Murphy and Sons, which has one of the first major contracts, for work bearing the power lines, has signed up for that. The Mayor of London has led the way in championing that approach at the Greater London authority. Hon. Members should all support it. The agency is also working on a community involvement framework, which is of key significance, so that people will not feel that the Olympics have landed on their doorsteps from outer space, but rather will feel that the games are truly theirs.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/4">The fourth key issue affecting the Olympics is sports engagement. In Newham the engagement that has been part of the bid&mdash;and my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham will no doubt know more about the detail&mdash;has produced a reduction in some youth crime. Involving young people in physical activity can be seen to bring about a direct benefit and reduce crime. In Hackney, Councillor Nargis Khan, the lead member for communities and voluntary groups, is leading a project to get young people involved, through the Future Olympian programme. Those and many other initiatives, that I do not have time to go into today, will be critical if we are to engage people of all ages and backgrounds in more sport and physical activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/5">There are many strands to the legacy of the enterprise. First, the venues must be usable; they must not be white elephants. We need money to be set aside for continuing maintenance. We do not want, in 50 years, a legacy that is a crumbling, paint-peeled symbol of a past success. We want a well used and well loved venue that is fit for its purpose and is part of the community as well as being among our national treasures.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/6">We also want a greener area of London. Last Friday, in the nearly snowy weather of east Hackney, I had the delight of planting trees on Mabley green with nine-year-old children from Daubeney school. Form 5D had many strong opinions about the Olympics, but it was apparent that, apart from wanting tickets, they wanted the games to be environmentally friendly. They wanted more trees and fewer roads&mdash;that was a point that they constantly repeated.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/7">Hackney is now infamous for the car park that will be on east marsh. Will the Minister, together with other local MPs and me, use any influence that he has with the London Development Agency and others, to try to preserve at least some of the 350 mature trees around the edge of the marsh? Predictably, architects' models show that curtain of trees, some of which are more than 100 years old, and which include the native black poplar&mdash;a rare tree in London. Yet when the plan is examined in more detail, it emerges that there is a real prospect of those mature trees disappearing. Surely, if we have to suffer there being a car park there, we can at least retain some of those trees. If we in Hackney have to suffer the indignity of the car park, it would be better to leave the trees that are there rather than to wait until 2112, which is how long it would take some of the replacement trees to grow to maturity.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/8">We are awaiting news from the London Development Agency about the land that will replace the common land at Arena field and White Hart field, and part of east marsh, which the LDA is buying through compulsory purchase. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will join me in seeking reassurances that all land currently designated as metropolitan open land or that is promised as new metropolitan open land will have the full protection of that status and that there is no risk of its ownership being transferred to another body after the ODA's demise.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/9">We all welcome the creation of a linear park linking Hackney marshes through Hackney Wick to the Thames via the River Lea. It will be a much-appreciated green lung for the east end; we need it as a long-term legacy. We also look forward to seeing cleaner, greener and more pleasant waterways. The development brings real opportunities. During the development of the park, an estimated 5 million tonnes of material could be moved by barge, saving 500,000 lorry journeys through London. After 2012, which is the time on which I want to focus, 125,000 tonnes a year could be moved by barge, saving more than 12,000 lorry journeys a year. We should grab that opportunity while we can. Also, many new homes will be built, including 3,600 new apartments in the athletes' village, and many others on the Olympic site.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/10">I want to highlight the issue of the Travellers at Waterden road in my constituency, whom I last visited 10 days ago. We hope to hear concrete news about their relocation by January. I mention them, in particular, because they are among the handful of residents who will be affected. Businesses will also be affected, which is important, but we are talking about people's homes and future, so we need to ensure that their futures are secured and that in a few months' time they will be certain of where they are going.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/11">A key legacy for Hackney is the way in which transport will be affected, but that is a win only if we secure the changes for after 2012 as well as for the games. If Londoners pay &pound;20 a year for the Olympics, a turn-up-and-go service on the North London line, which will be a major boost, will be worth that contribution. It will effectively convert Hackney's key transport spine into part of the tube network and, along with the East London line extension, will put Hackney on the tube map for the first time.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that it is important that the Olympics should be seen not simply as the east London Olympics, but as the all-London Olympics, and that improved transport in London is the key to involving south Londoners in the excitement and joy of the Olympics rather than their feeling cut off by the difficulty of travelling through central London? Does she agree with the East London Line Group that the current phase of the East London line is the key to putting the Olympics within the reach of people in south-east London and that</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.112.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" speakername="Meg Hillier" colnum="112"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h03.htm#51130h03_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.112.0/1">We in Hackney would certainly welcome further extensions to the East London line. We all know the challenges of delivering this transport project, and how long it takes for such projects to reach fruition, but we in Hackney do not want to have just our little bit of the East London line: we want it to take us places. It would be fantastic if that could be delivered by 2012, or if we could at least have a timetable by then.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.0/2">There is also a sports legacy on the horizon, of which we should be proud. Hackney's major legacy will be Arena 3&mdash;a national basketball centre. I have already mentioned the Olympic institute. There are other legacies in the offing, such as the food academy&mdash;a training centre for jobs in hospitality and catering&mdash;and other mixed use developments on the sites. The key question on legacy is: who will run and fund such establishments? That burden must not fall on local taxpayers of the five boroughs.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.0/3">We would all agree that the Olympics should focus on each of the areas that I have talked about, and that there is a need for clear leadership. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and her Ministers, the Mayor of London, Lord Moynihan, Lord Coe, Jack Lemley, David Higgins and others are each taking a lead in various aspects of the delivery of the Olympics. However, when we think about what is needed for London as a whole and east London in particular, we see that one part of the jigsaw is missing, and I ask my hon. Friend to take the matter very seriously: who is in charge of the legacy? In a sense, we all are. However, we know that once the venues are built, the medals have been won and the short-term gains have been delivered, most people will go off with their happy memories of a successful Olympics and, I hope, of having seen our team with a haul of gold medals. Those who have lived through the upheaval and the construction of the sites will be left with the legacy. Who is to speak now for local people to ensure that their post-2012 needs and desires are reflected in the current plans?</p>
	<p pid="a.112.0/4">Of course, I would expect the Government and the Mayor to focus on delivery. That is right; the last thing that we want is a games that does not happen. However, for Hackney residents, delivery is about maintaining and enhancing our green space and ensuring that the legacy includes Arena 3, the London Olympic institute, the food academy, the long-term improvement to the North London and East London lines, cleaning up the canals and waterways in and around Hackney Wick and, crucially, jobs and skills. Hackney cannot deliver that legacy alone. The five-borough partnership of Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Greenwich, Newham and Waltham Forest should be invited to the table now. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to consider better ways of engaging with that excellent group of boroughs. Locally elected representatives know best what works locally. The five-borough partnership is there and willing. Local people's voices need to be heard because they will have to live what is left in 2012 and beyond. Would my hon. Friend the Minister consider an amendment to the Bill that is to have its Third Reading next week, to allow for borough representation on the London Olympics organising committee?</p>
	<p pid="a.112.0/5">We are all looking forward to the Olympic games. The nine-year-old children to whom I spoke in Hackney last week were clear what they wanted. They want to go to the games and they want a long-term legacy for themselves and for all of us. We can learn from our children. In the next stages of the process, we must ensure that all the legacy issues that I have outlined are as much a part of the current thinking as are the inevitable pressures of what has to be delivered by 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.2/1">I shall speak briefly, Mr. O'Hara. First, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> on having secured this important debate. I know that she has been trying to do so for some weeks and that one opportunity clashed with a sitting of a Standing Committee of which she was a member.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/2">I start with a confession. I had very grave doubts about whether London should even have bid for the Olympic games and, until that wonderful day on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-06">6 July</phrase>, I felt that our chances of winning were limited. It was a great achievement, particularly on the part of Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Prime Minister and Lord Coe, that we managed to squeeze out the last few votes and win the chance to host the games. My concerns were not about sport&mdash;I am a great sports fan and it will be a marvellous opportunity for sport to be showcased in our capital city&mdash;but about cost and about whether there is sufficient commitment to turbo-charge the transport links to which we have heard reference to ensure that London gains real benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/3">My concerns about cost remain. The hon. Lady referred to some &pound;20 per head per annum. The figure that was quoted in this House in early June was some &pound;30 per head. I am glad that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" name="Hugh Robertson">my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson)</phrase> has said that he is going to table a new clause to the London Olympics Bill to try to cap the cost for Londoners to the &pound;625 million that was agreed at the time of the bid. That reflects a grave concern of many Londoners. After all, the games are a national, not a London, event. As has been pointed out by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">the hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase>, many in the capital see it as an east London event. We have heard reference to five rather than the remaining 28 boroughs, which will have their part to play.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/4">My other fundamental concern is about other redevelopment and regeneration projects. The Kings Cross phase 2 redevelopment, which is worth some &pound;250 million to &pound;300 million, has effectively been put on hold indefinitely. We also have concerns about the Thames gateway. The Mayor of London's projection of two or three years ago for the coming 15 years to 2016 envisaged massive redevelopment in the east of the city, adjacent to the Thames. That would, of course, take place not only through London, but into Kent and Essex. As all the focus&mdash;the sexy focus&mdash;will understandably be on the Olympic games, we are concerned that many other important regeneration projects in other bits of east London and other parts of the capital will be put on hold indefinitely.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/5">We are worried about what will happen in respect of Crossrail, given the disruption that would be caused if it were built in the period up to 2012&mdash;for example, Shaftesbury avenue in my constituency would have to be closed for about 18 months. A number of projects will have to be delayed. One hopes that they will only be delayed, and that the funding will still be in place. Some concerted thinking needs to take place within London governance&mdash;I suspect that the London governance I am thinking of will be the Mayor of London and the Olympic Delivery Authority. Those organisations need a timetable that goes well beyond 2012 to put in place all such infrastructure projects, which are of great importance to London, but which may or may not be of importance for 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/6">The hon. Lady highlighted the importance of legacy, and it was interesting that she took a more broad-ranging view of the definition of that term than many would. One of the greatest disappointments in respect of what happened in Greenwich almost six years ago and the Greenwich millennium village is the failure of the legacy that we were all promised at that time. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase> shakes his head, and he perhaps has more direct knowledge of this matter than I do. However, many of us are concerned not only that the dome was a white elephant, but that much of the development that could have taken place to create a real sense of community in the GMV has not happened to the extent that many would have hoped. Apart from anything else, it would have been useful to link up Woolwich&mdash;which I often think of as being a bit like a northern town on the banks of the Thames&mdash;with the centre of Greenwich and into the docklands light railway network. I know that plans have been afoot, but there was a tremendous opportunity, and it has not been entirely fulfilled.</p>

It is happening because there was investment in infrastructure, the Jubilee line and the millennium exhibition. We must do exactly the same in respect of the Olympics legacy.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.0/1">I beg to differ with the right hon. Gentleman about Greenwich, and time will tell which of us is right. However, it is important that focus is placed on the architectural legacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/2">The other legacy to which the hon. Lady rightly referred is in respect of human capital. One of the great current disappointments in London is that it is impossible to go to any bar, restaurant or pub without being served by someone who comes from outside the UK. There is an enormous inflow of people coming to work in London&mdash;many are young people who work on a short-term basis, to make their way and earn some money before heading back to Poland, Lithuania or wherever. That is an exciting part of London living. However, there is also a very large residual unemployment rate in London. I am greatly concerned that many of the 7 per cent. of people who are unemployed are almost unemployable, and the hon. Lady is right to identify that we need to focus part of the legacy on some of the poorest London boroughs and on trying to ensure that young&mdash;and, indeed, middle-aged&mdash;people have sufficient skills not only for the 2012 Olympics but for the time ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/3">I wish to end by mentioning the environmental legacy in the Lea valley. I again run the risk of treading on a Member's ground&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" name="Andrew Love">the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love)</phrase> might have cause to disagree with what I have to say. The lower Lea valley site requires major redevelopment. I walked there in March because I was aware that debates such as this one were likely to take place. There is Marshgate lane, and a plethora of goods yards and canals. It is clearly an area that is worthy of significant redevelopment, not least because of its proximity to central London. However, the upper Lea valley should also be considered. Only a fortnight ago, I walked to the Springfield park area in the north of the borough that the hon. Lady represents. I know that Springfield park is not in her constituency but in that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" name="Diane Abbott">her neighbour, the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase>. Tremendous work has been done at Springfield park and marina. It is important that those great benefits to the environment are translated one, two or three miles further along. I hope that all parts of the Lea valley will be integrated. In a post-industrial world, it offers a tremendous opportunity for great benefits in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/4">Again, congratulations to the hon. Lady, who made a good speech. I hope that the junior Minister is able to answer the questions, and that his private office has been in touch with her in the past couple of days, as important and specific questions need to be asked and answered.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/5">Obviously, we all wish everyone involved in the Olympics God speed at the earliest opportunity. There is little doubt that work must begin now. Nothing would be worse than for us to twiddle our thumbs or perhaps engage in internal disagreements in the next 12 or 18 months and then find ourselves in a mad rush in the run-up to an event that is taking place in only six and three quarter years.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.1/1">I am delighted to take part in this debate. It may seem strange to hon. Members that a Member from Sussex would wish to contribute, but I am truly delighted to be able to do so. I hope to explain why I believe that London's sustained success will be helped by support from communities not only directly touching London but throughout the United Kingdom. London's success is success for all of us.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/2">All hon. Members will agree that it is absolutely delightful that we are able to have this debate. I am not sure that this time last year we thought that we would be having a debate to consider the sustainability and legacy of the Olympic games in the UK. We are in a privileged position. Wherever we come from, we must take this opportunity and do our utmost to ensure that the games are a success.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> rightly focused on employment, sustainability and ensuring that local companies derive benefits from the Olympic games. That was right and proper, and I congratulate her on her clear understanding of how all those facets come together to secure success. I wish to concentrate on the sustained aspiration that the Olympic games has given us and what it has done not only for communities in London but for those close by.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/4">Hon. Members may know that Crawley is a new town, built immediately after the second world war to give new opportunities to people from south London. We have a very London-centric view in Crawley. We watch the London news and what is going on in London. In fact, we are often described as a London borough in the heart of the Sussex countryside. Therefore, Crawley will not allow this subject to pass it by. We wish to play our part in ensuring London's success in the Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/5">Long before we in the UK decided wholeheartedly to support the bid&mdash;never underestimate the power of the Prime Minister, who galvanised everybody to ensure success and to win the bid&mdash;and long before the bid was in place, there were authorities that had aspirations for their communities. London's success in winning the Olympic bid has raised opportunities and aspirations in my town a hundredfold. We have done that not only by encouraging young people to take part, by closely examining what is happening in London and by examining how to ensure that the plans are sustainable, but by building an infrastructure in my town to ensure that its facilities are second to none and that young people can take part in the Olympic games.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/6">I hope that all hon. Members in the Chamber today share the aims of ensuring that we get all the employment matters right, and that young people today have an eye to being competitors in the 2012 Olympic games, so that they can become ambassadors for sport and secure sustainability for London.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/7">Several years ago in Crawley, we envisaged a new leisure facility, which has recently opened. It is something to behold. It has a 50 m Olympic pool and other facilities that are second to none. It will ensure that local people can take part in sporting activities and literally raise their game when they consider the future. It troubles me that there will be no legacy unless we enthuse our young people and work in and around London to ensure that they feel this excitement for the games. All hon. Members must work to ensure that their communities understand the importance of the games for London and outside.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> on securing the debate and on introducing it so eloquently.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/2">Does the hon. Member for Crawley agree that, even though the Olympic games are some years away, there is an urgent need to ensure that the enthusiasm is sparked now? Does she agree that the work needs to start now if the plans are to be put in place, local businesses are to benefit and sports clubs are to gear up to produce their next generation of Olympic champions?</p>

	<p pid="a.117.1/1">The hon. Lady is entirely right. I hope that I am spreading the word about the urgency of reaching young people. We need to deal with all those matters, not only with sustainability, employment and job opportunities. Everyone who is keen on sports needs the highest possible level of training and, as I was trying to say, the best facilities. It is no good wishing that our young people will be successful if we do not provide them with the facilities that enable them to be successful.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.2/1">The hon. Lady has spoken on behalf of her constituency, and has described the aspirations of her constituents and the benefits that the Olympics can bring to them. If she expects benefits from the Olympics, however, is she prepared to share the burdens? The people of London must chip in to meet the costs of the Olympics. Is she volunteering the people of Crawley to pay for them?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.117.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" speakername="Laura Moffatt" colnum="117"  time="14:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h03.htm#51130h03_spnew16">
	<p pid="a.117.3/1">I firmly believe that the people in Crawley have already contributed to the Olympics by paying for &pound;37 million of sports facilities to try to prepare some of our young people for them. I call that a town that is contributing to London's success. We do not have to step away from the games and feel ashamed. We want to help London to be successful, and we want to ensure that we have top-flight competitors who use all the facilities in a way that can make us proud.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/2">As I said, we should provide those facilities, encourage people to take part and nurture young people. On the site of the fantastic facilities that I mentioned, we now have a brand new school with sports status. The whole thing is beginning to come together so that we can ensure that the Olympics in London are a success and are sustainable. I hope that hon. Members are looking to their constituencies throughout the UK to see how we can help London to be a success. With openness and dialogue, that can happen. I am so looking forward to the Olympic Delivery Authority's visit to our facilities to see whether we can play our part and be an Olympic village. We are extremely close to London&mdash;just forty minutes away&mdash;and would desperately like to contribute.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/3">We can do our work in all sorts of ways. We need urgently to get on the job, focus on our work and assist London Members to make the London games the best Olympics ever. I have no doubt that they will be.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.117.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" speakername="Richard Ottaway" colnum="117"  time="15:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h03.htm#51130h03_spnew17">
	<p pid="a.117.4/1">As time is short, I shall concentrate on the issue of the businesses on the Olympic site that are facing relocation. I speak on behalf of my constituent, Mr. Brundle, a freehold proprietor of a site just about where the main stadium is located. That is causing him and his business huge problems. He has been told that he has to be out just 18 months from now.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.4/2">There is a complete lack of transparency about the process for his relocation. There is no clear view on what that process is or on whether alternative land is available, and there is no clarity on the compulsory purchase process. The other day, the Mayor of London appeared before the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport. He said that no one would be worse off and that reasonable costs would be paid. What on earth does that mean?</p>
	<p pid="a.117.4/3">As a freehold proprietor, my constituent first has to find another freehold site. Without any help from the London Development Agency, he has found one at Rainham marshes. He now has to convert, rebuild and refurbish an old building and adapt it to his business. He is in the wire mesh, metal and scrap metal business, so his stock is not lightweight, but it has to be moved from one side of London to the other. His business is primarily based on the white van traffic that comes in from the east end of London on the way to building sites in central London. That business will be lost. He has to relocate and retrain his staff and relaunch and market his business. He is a sole proprietor and has gone to the LDA to ask, &quot;Will you help me?&quot; It said yes, but has done absolutely nothing.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.4/4">I do not know why the situation has arisen. I mean no disrespect to this Minister, but the Minister for Sport and Tourism, who has answered all previous debates on this issue, has always come up with splendid words such as, &quot;I take a keen interest in this. I do not want people to lose out. I will make sure that compensation is paid.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.118.0/1">Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that the LDA has offered funding for legal and surveying costs and its own sites for relocation? In particular, has it not tailored support packages to help businesses such as the one that he describes to move?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.118.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" speakername="Richard Ottaway" colnum="118"  time="15:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h03.htm#51130h03_spnew19">
	<p pid="a.118.1/1">I wish that that were the case. The LDA has offered to pay the legal and surveying costs, and if that were all that was involved it would be wonderful. However, I say to the hon. Lady, who introduced this debate very well, that there is much more to the issue than just legal and surveying costs, as I have spent the past few minutes setting out. It is not enough to go with an invoice to the LDA for those costs because they will be paid several months later, after the person has had to carry the cash burden themselves. That is not a help, but a hindrance. Hon. Members have to focus on that issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.118.2/1">Surely my hon. Friend agrees that this is a like-for-like situation. One advantage for companies that have been in the lower Lea valley for generations has been their proximity to central London. It might be difficult to get hold of sufficient land, but surely the LDA could compulsorily purchase other pockets of land in some of the neighb<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">ouring boroughs to which the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> referred and provide an opportunity for the businesses to relocate to an area as near to central London as they currently are.</p>

	<p pid="a.118.3/1">I wish that that were so. The hon. Lady said that land was available. However, it is not freehold land that is available, but leasehold land. If a business had been on a freehold site, it would expect to go to a freehold site. As my hon. Friend said, the land is not available.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.2/1">I was shaking my head because the hon.

	<p pid="a.119.3/1">I am surprised by the right hon. Gentleman, for whom I have huge regard. Frankly, what he said is a plain insult to the business. It is not a scrap metal business. It is a wire mesh business. It is contained inside warehouses; it provides cast metal fittings for building sites. To belittle a business man who is carrying the cost himself just because the right hon. Gentleman's political mates on the LDA cannot face political reality is disgraceful. It is an appalling state of affairs.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.9/1">The right hon. Gentleman shakes his head. Does he expect that, after a ministerial pledge and a pledge from the Mayor of London that no one will be out of pocket, that business man will have to take a loss of &pound;2 million from his own pocket? He has just bought a site in Rainham marshes. He is currently paying interest on that money of &pound;3,500 a week. He asks the LDA, &quot;Can I have compensation for the &pound;3,500 a week?&quot;, to which it replies, &quot;Not until you agree to sell your site at a value that we think is right, rather than at the market price.&quot; Why should he do that? Why is he not entitled to the market price?</p>
	<p pid="a.119.9/2">Such issues are not being addressed. A way in which to resolve the problem and the approach taken by Labour Members might be to appoint an independent arbitrator who can evaluate the loss for the businesses, audit the loss and present the details to whichever Department will pay the compensation. That will be the agreed transfer. That suggestion has all-party support.</p>

However, there are a number of thriving, internationally renowned businesses that we need to consider, not just the one wire mesh company that he is representing well today.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.3/1">I agree, but well known multinational companies, such as those that the hon. Lady is talking about, do not have the problems of a sole proprietor: they are all on leaseholds and can terminate leases, move, or relocate without any difficulty.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.4/2">As a result of the games, West Ham will look very different in 2012. Two thirds of the Olympic park and the majority of the facilities, including the athletes village, the main stadium, the swimming pools, media centre and the warm-up tracks will be in Newham, and 18 of the 26 events will take place within a 20-minute walk of Stratford station. The stadium will be built to accommodate 80,000 people&mdash;reduced to 20,000 after the event, which, to be honest with the Minister, disappoints me. I ask you to consider again the sweet deal that Manchester's residents got from the Manchester Commonwealth games.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.6/1">I apologise sincerely, Mr. O'Hara. I sometimes get carried away with my enthusiasm.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.6/2">I want the Government to reconsider the sweet deal done for Manchester after the demise of the Commonwealth games, to ensure that there is access for some of the poorest people in our communities to the world-class facilities that will be built in my area.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.6/3">I hope that hon. Members forgive me if I talk a bit about my constituency. It is poor, bordering other poor areas to the west and north. All Newham's key indicators with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister are in the bottom 10. Almost 7 per cent. of economically active residents said that they were unemployed, compared with just over the 4 per cent. average for London. Two thirds of Newham's children are considered to live in poverty. People in Newham die earlier than people anywhere else in London. We also have the lowest employment rate in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.6/4">Hon. Members may wonder why I am giving those statistics in a debate on sporting excellence and the Olympics. I am doing so because bringing the Olympics and Paralympics here is part of the solution to the poverty and disadvantage experienced by the communities of West Ham and other places with similar problems in east London.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.6/5">We said in our bid that we would radically transform London's east end by having a sporting spectacle to regenerate a poor inner-city area. That is the greatest challenge. I know that those responsible for the planning, designing, building and staging of the games must think that they have the hardest task, but the hardest task will go to those who are attempting to realise a legacy in the soft infrastructure&mdash;the soft regeneration&mdash;that is so crucial to that part of London.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.6/6">As my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch said, the hardest job will be securing jobs and retraining for those in our communities who are currently without them. The other hard jobs will be to raise the aspirations of our children in those communities for them to realise their full potential, to realise the health benefits for all those in our poorest communities, and to ensure that afterwards we narrow the gap between those who are living longer in richer, more affluent communities and those living in poorer communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.6/7">The potential social legacy is huge and complex, and we have not yet fully thought through the true extent of the detailed implications. I got a tiny sense of what we could achieve from the impact that the bidding process had on my constituency. As my hon. Friend said, the London borough of Newham has led a two- year programme of sporting, cultural and community activity, and by the end of the process there were tangible benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.6/8">Some 43 per cent. of those taking up free swims came from social groups D and E, and there were 64,000 attendances at Newham's Olympic summer of sport. The completion rates for exercise-on-prescription schemes for people suffering from ill health increased from 34 to 52 per cent. Some 40 new after-school clubs have been founded around sport and physical activity, and the number of sports coaches in my borough has doubled. For the first time, there has been a 25 per cent. drop in the number of young people who have been reported to the local magistrates court. I believe that that is because of the sporting and other interventions made under the programme. New disability sports clubs have also been established, and West Ham United's wonderful programme of football for Asian communities has expanded.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.6/9">Those schemes could not have taken place without additional money, and we used the neighbourhood renewal fund to pay for them. If we do not plan to secure such social benefits, or do not understand what social benefits we need to secure, we will not fund them or design interventions. At the end of the games, we will find that we have not secured a real legacy&mdash;the soft legacy&mdash;for the communities that desperately need one. The job before us is too big for just one tier of government and it cannot be done by local, regional or national Government alone. It can be carried out successfully only if we include all tiers, as well as the voluntary sector, the community sector and the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.6/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" name="Richard Ottaway">The hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway)</phrase> mentioned jobs and businesses. I ask the Government to oversee the development agency and to hold it to account to ensure that it discharges its duty to the local community and minimises the downtime to the sustainable, valuable businesses in the area so that they can remain there.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.6/11">The games will also result in the demolition of the housing co-op at Clays lane. I recently had representations from the tenants, who face a very uncertain future. Communication seems to have been sparse and not very comforting, with the LDA apparently watering down assurances that were made prior to the bid. I ask the Government again to see what they can do to offer some comfort and to hold the LDA to account.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.0/1">I agree with my hon. Friend and understand her passion for what the Olympic games will achieve. She mentioned the difficulties faced by the Clays lane housing co-op. Does she agree that one legacy of the Olympics will be the more than 4,000 units of housing accommodation? Does she also agree that it is important that those units are affordable for the people who live in the five boroughs?</p>

	<p pid="a.122.1/1">Indeed I do. In fact, that is mentioned in the longer version of my speech. I intended to talk about the fact that housing accommodation will be secured not only in London, but up and down the country, where visiting teams establish training camps. We need to ensure not only that that housing is affordable, but that it creates sustainable communities that people up and down the land can access.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/2">In conclusion, the legacy of the games could be amazing. For that to happen, however, we need to plan. To fail to plan is to plan to fail.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.2/1">I shall be brief. I start by declaring an interest as the deputy chairman of the Construction Industry Council. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> on securing the debate and presenting the case in such an eloquent and intellectually rigorous way.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/2">We all recognise&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1921" name="Lyn Brown">my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown)</phrase> put this across clearly&mdash;the huge opportunity to transform some of the most depressed and deprived communities in our country through the successful delivery of the Olympics. The gymnastics will be hosted in the dome, in my constituency, and the building is admirably suited to the purpose, despite <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the views of the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase>. Furthermore, the equestrian events will be held in Greenwich park and the shooting will be held at the former Royal Artillery barracks in Woolwich, so we in Greenwich have a real interest in the success of the games.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/3">There are a number of challenges. The chair and chief executive of the Olympic Delivery Authority have been appointed. I am delighted about the appointment of two very high-calibre people who have a good track record of delivering construction contracts. We must ensure that their focus is not diverted and that their energy is not dissipated by too many bolt-on requests for additional benefits. We have been partly guilty of that this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/4">It is understandable that we all want the best possible outcome on a range of activities, but there must be a single-minded focus on delivering the crucial things: the main infrastructure and the environment in which the games are held, and the legacy, which my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch highlighted.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/5">I want to focus on two issues concerning legacy. The first is the structure and the physical environment. We want high-quality buildings that have a viable post-2012 future. We want high-quality urban design and the transformation of the currently degraded environment in the lower Lea valley, to provide a world-class environment for the people of east London. Such design must mesh well with the Stratford city redevelopment and with the network of waterways that surrounds the site, to which the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster referred. That is important in order to create an attractive environment in which people will live long after the games in 2012. The physical legacy is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/6">My second point relates to the human and social infrastructure legacy, which is just as important. We must ensure, in this area of considerable disadvantage, that we seize the opportunities to give people the training, encouragement and support to obtain the employment that will come along as a result of the investment going into the Olympics and their associated activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/7">In part, that is to do with construction. Much work is already being done by CITB-ConstructionSkills on the development of appropriate training packages in construction skills. However, even in 2009&ndash;10, at the height of the construction programme, the latest estimate is that Olympic-related construction will account for only 3.7 per cent. of total construction in London. Although the construction will be important, we should not overestimate it. The important thing is to give a push to high standards and expectations about quality training, which will enthuse people to seek appropriate opportunities in the construction industry. That is where the development of the Olympic commitment will make a huge impact. It is being prepared by the strategic forum and is due to be published shortly. It will focus on proper site health and safety standards, good training opportunities and best practice by employers as part of the delivery of the Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/8">Other things are also important. We know what can happen from the experience of the dome in Greenwich, which, despite the comments made by the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, was a success; it has opened the door for regeneration on a scale that would never otherwise have been possible and it provided opportunities for a large number of people to secure employment during 2000&mdash;people who had previously been unemployed and who had not had such opportunities. The transformation to their lives was possible as a result of good training programmes, which we had in Greenwich, where local labour and business provided opportunities for disadvantaged people and others in need of jobs to secure the training and the employment on the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/9">We must pursue that approach by tailoring the needs to the job opportunities that come up. If done properly, it will transform the human and social infrastructure of the area for many years to come. The jobs will continue in the hospitality industry and the service sectors. Such provision is necessary because of the Olympics, but it will have a long-term future beyond 2012. This is a great opportunity, which we must take. We must focus on the things that matter and must not be diverted, or allow those responsible to be diverted, by other considerations, however desirable they might appear.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> both on securing the debate and on an excellent and wide-ranging speech. It was fantastic to hear the enthusiasm that she is giving to the Olympic games and Paralympics, which, I believe, is shared by people in her constituency and in the wider area. It was also good to hear other hon. Members referring to the importance of the benefit not only to the five boroughs but to the whole of London and the rest of the country. It is worth reflecting that had it not been for the support for the bid of people from all parts of the United Kingdom, it is unlikely that London would have succeeded.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/2">The hon. Lady made a number of crucial points about the Olympic games legacy that we hope to achieve. It was a speech mirrored by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">her right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase>. She pointed not only to the sporting legacy and its health implications, but to the employment, physical and wider human legacies that we hope shall be achieved.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.2/1">Having praised the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch, let me refer to some o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">ther contributions. The hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> rightly mentioned his concern about Londoners paying more than their fair share, and the importance of capping the amount of funding that is required from them. He will be delighted to know that I shall support <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" name="Hugh Robertson">the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson)</phrase> when we debate the London Olympics Bill next week.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" name="Laura Moffatt">The hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt)</phrase> made an important point. She is right that London's success is a success for all of us, and it is good that she is working in her local community to ensure that those whom she represents benefit from the Olympic games and the Paralympics. I take issue with her claim that Crawley's facilities are second to none. Those of us from Bath, Loughborough, Sheffield and various other places might wish to challenge that. However, not having visited Crawley, it would be unfair of me to make a judgment, although I know where my vote would go. None the less, her contribution illustrated the importance of recognising that the Olympics will benefit the whole nation, and that the whole nation should contribute and participate in them.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.2/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" name="Richard Ottaway">The hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway)</phrase> made important points about the problems of a particular constituent. Such troubles are reflected in a number of other businesses. He argued that we must ensure that those who are displaced get a fair deal. The idea of appointing an independent arbitrator or ombudsman is sensible, and I hope that it will be given serious consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.2/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1921" name="Lyn Brown">The hon. Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown)</phrase> spoke of the poverty and disadvantage in her constituency, and the role that the games can play in helping to lift people out of that situation. Importantly, she mentioned raising the aspirations of people in her community. Another important element of her speech was her observation that it was vital to bring community, voluntary and private sector groups together to work on issues relating to the Olympic games and Paralympics.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.2/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase> was right to remind us of the need for a single-minded focus on delivery and on legacy&mdash;I have already referred to his comments about both physical and social legacy&mdash;and I was delighted that he referred to the importance of training. One of the things that concerns me is that when we talk about the benefits that will accrue in terms of job creation, we cannot guarantee that jobs will be given to United Kingdom companies unless we can ensure that the people working for such companies are properly trained and have the skills to deliver the work and so earn the contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.2/6">I told the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich a few minutes ago that his defence of the dome reminded me of the defence that I continually make of my spa project in Bath. He pointed out that his was completed on time and to budget, whereas mine has not been. The difference is that his had content that was inordinately disappointing whereas I can assure the House that when mine is finished, the spa will deliver fantastic content of great benefit to the people of Bath.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.0/1">Thank you. Mr. O'Hara. I wish to return to the aside made by the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster right at the end of his remarks. He said that he hoped very much that people would not sit around for years twiddling their thumbs. I, too, hope that they will not. However, I can assure him that that is certainly not happening. A great deal of work is going on to ensure that we deliver the best ever Olympic games and Paralympics, and I am delighted at the progress already made.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/2">It is worth mentioning that in August, almost two months after we won the bid in July, Mr. Denis Oswald from the International Olympic Committee was able to say that the London Olympics could not have started on a better footing. He is absolutely right; rapid progress is being made, with the London Olympics Bill going through Parliament. I am delighted that, as a result of my suggestion, it is to be renamed the London Olympics and Paralympics Bill; that is an important point.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/3">I am delighted that there has been a smooth transition from the bid team to the London Organising Committee of the Olympic games&mdash;LOCOG. I am pleased that many of the same faces that helped to secure a successful bid will be involved in ensuring the delivery of the games, but I am also pleased that new people are being brought on board. The appointment of Jack Lemley and David Higgins&mdash;people with enormous talent and expertise in delivering major infrastructure projects&mdash;to the Olympic Delivery Authority is welcome, as has already been said. Although some people might be marginally critical of an American and an Australian getting the job of delivering the British games, I for one do not make that criticism. They have a good track record, and I am confident that they will help us to deliver.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/4">Many other things have been pleasing, too. There is the enormous success of the national lottery's &quot;Go for Gold&quot; scratch card, the fastest selling scratch card of its kind in the lottery's history. As long as that initiative continues to work as successfully as it does now, we might not have to deal with concerns that have not been mentioned yet; for example, it is predicted that other lottery distributors may lose out on money, but perhaps that will not happen if we continue to be successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/5">I am delighted that there is clearly acceptance that the games are for all parts of the United Kingdom. Projects are already under way in not only London, but Sunderland, Norwich, Weymouth, Edinburgh, Brighton and, as we have heard, Crawley. It is fantastic that that is already happening. Of course, we have to maintain the momentum and ensure delivery, not just in London but in all parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/6">As for those who ask how other parts of the United Kingdom will benefit, as I suggest they will, it is worth reflecting on the fact that, in Australia, the economy of the state of Queensland, which is about 1,000 miles away from the Sydney games, was boosted to the tune of 15 million American dollars as a result of the Olympic games. That, I believe, was due to tourism, hosting visiting teams, the cultural programme that was in place and infrastructure. I am confident that that will happen across the country, if, as the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich says, we continue with the focused approach that is so crucial.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/7">Of course, there are areas of concern. One of mine is that, although a major benefit of the London Olympic games and Paralympics will be the effect on tourism, tourism is not a key function of either LOCOG or the Olympic Delivery Authority. We have to make sure that tourism is tied in so that we genuinely find ways of benefiting. I gently tell the Minister that I have some concern that the constraints placed on, say, VisitBritain, in terms of how it can advertise this country and its connection with the 2012 games, may inhibit some of the tourism benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/8">Hundreds of new jobs&mdash;perhaps as many as 100,000, as some people have predicted&mdash;will be created as a result of the games. As I say, it is crucial that we provide the infrastructure of training and the skills uplift to ensure that this country gets the benefit of those jobs coming to the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/9">There are other areas of concern, but there will be an opportunity for me to rehearse them in more detail in other forums. However, I will share one with the Minister: if sporting aspirations are to be a key point&mdash;other hon. Members have touched on that&mdash;it is crucial that we are realistic about what we expect. I know that sport is not the Minister's main brief, but the Government have a target of getting 70 per cent. of the population active by 2012. That target is based on a mistranslation of documents from Finland; it is a crazy target. He will be aware that in the last few days, in response to the impact of the Olympics, Sport England has announced its aspirations of getting us up to a 50 per cent. activity rate by 2012. I say gently to the Minister that it would make a lot of sense for the Government to drop their crazy target and adopt the Sport England one. Then we would know that we were trying to achieve a realistic target and we could work on it together.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/10">People are more interested in hearing the Minister's response than more from me, but I hope that the all-party coalition that has existed in support of the games will continue and that the Government will continue to involve and consult all Members of the House from all parties to ensure that we go forward in the seven important years ahead in a way that delivers the most successful Olympic games and Paralympics the world has ever seen.</p>

She has been a regular and thoughtful contributor on Olympic matters ever since her election earlier this year and she has a grandstand seat as a local MP. She spoke well on Second Reading of the London Olympics Bill and I remember her speaking well in Committee about the football pitches on the Hackney marshes.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/2">The hon. Lady touched on two issues that are absolutely key: the legacy and the representation of the boroughs. As far as the second is concerned, she will remember the debate we had in Committee. I agree with her: that representation of the boroughs in this process is vital. They are not formally represented in any way at the moment, and I hope that the Minister will take that on board. She was also absolutely right to talk about <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">the legacy and the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase> made a very good point about that. We have to start being realistic. The right hon. Gentleman was absolutely right to say that as a local MP.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/3">A huge amount of hype has grown up around the 2012 games and people throughout the country are now expecting the games to solve all sorts of regeneration problems. The right hon. Gentleman is right: we have to focus on what is key, which is delivering the games in 2012. If a lot of the other things happen, that is all well and good. It would be terrific, but there is no finance available to do those things at the moment and the sooner we get that message across, the better.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/4">We have had good speeches all round t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">his afternoon. My hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> made some powerful points about managing the infrastructure and focusing on legacy issues, particularly for the poorest boroughs, and I entirely agree with him. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" name="Laura Moffatt">The hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt)</phrase> spoke up well about the raised aspirations in her town. She is right, but I just repeat that slight warning that we have to focus on the games.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" name="Richard Ottaway">My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway)</phrase> sensibly and reasonably raised a key issue to which I shall return in a moment concerning businesses and the effect that the games will have on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1921" name="Lyn Brown">them. The hon. Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown)</phrase>, another regular contributor to Olympic debates, spoke up extremely well for her constituents, as always. The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich made the absolutely key point about focus. He knows about that all too well from his ministerial experience. Finally, I come to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase>&mdash;it is always a pleasure. He made another sensible and well balanced contribution to the debate. After all these months, I could almost write his speeches for him and he could do the same for me.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/6">This is the latest of a number of debates we have had on the Olympics. There was a debate in Westminster Hall before the bid, one afterwards on elite sport that concentrated mainly on Olympic matters and the debates on the Bill. During all those debates, I have reiterated my party's support for the games and I do so again today. Once again, I congratulate the Government on their part in bringing them to London in 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/7">Normally, I go on to press the Government on my party's three key issues. First, there is the legacy for sport in general and, in particular, the reforms we want to be carried out to the structure of sport. I am sure that the Minister will have read the independent sports review, co-authored by a Labour MP, and the Government will undoubtedly be actioning that in the near future. Secondly, there is the question of cost overruns. I suspect we shall return to that question on Report of the London Olympics Bill in a week's time so there is no need to dwell on it today. Finally, there is the issue that we always raise concerning the &pound;320 million tax take that the Treasury is planning to take from the Olympic lottery. This is a one-off national event and the benefits are supposed to accrue throughout the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the biggest challenge involved in the delivery of the Olympics is the danger of division, particularly of a party political nature, over funding? If he does, will he have a word with the London borough of Enfield, which continues to make capital out of the funding of the project, even though, as I understand it, the Opposition Front-Bench team is totally in support of the Olympic bid?</p>

	<p pid="a.129.0/1">As the hon. Gentleman will know, my party leader, like the leader of the Liberal Democrats, was a key figure when the evaluation committee came over. The hon. Member for Bath and I went to Singapore to emphasise that cross-party consensus and every single time that I have spoken, I have made clear my party's commitment to securing the best games that London can deliver in 2012&mdash;I have done so again today. I cannot reasonably be expected to do more than that.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/2">No doubt we will return to the issue of cost overruns on Report. I want to finish the point about the tax take. Given that there are considerable financial constraints on the Olympics and given that we are talking about a one-off event, it is iniquitous that the Treasury will pocket &pound;320 million from the Olympic lottery games. There is a huge worry among the major sports&mdash;particularly football, cricket and the two rugby codes&mdash;that funds are being diverted away from the lottery.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.2/1">I will come on to my final point, which is about the businesses in the lower Lea valley. After receiving what I am bound to say was a number of invitations, I visited businesses on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-17">17 November</phrase>. I would be the first to say, in all honesty, that the issue is not simple. I tried to approach it with an open mind and came away with considerable sympathy for the plight of the businesses. It seems that three key issues are worrying them.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/2">The first, which was referred to earlier, is the lack of action by the LDA. One can understand why that happened. I do not believe that the LDA expected us to win the bid, and there are grounds for thinking that that expectation was not unreasonable. However, as a result, some of the preparatory work that needed to be done was not done early enough, and we are now experiencing problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/3">There is also the particularly nasty issue of some surveyors and conflict of duty. There are, apparently, firms of surveyors that are acting on both sides of the fence. They are carrying out compulsory purchase valuations and then acting as agents for the resulting sites. From my experience of working in an investment bank before coming here, I know that that is a clear breach of every established professional practice. I hope that the Minister will be able to guarantee that he will write to the LDA and ensure that strict guidelines are in place to prevent that from happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/4">The final point&mdash;in many ways, the most contentious one&mdash;is that the Olympic site is the last industrial site in London. That, of course, is why it is the Olympic site. Therefore, as there is no comparable replacement of that size, any settlement must be based on post-bid, not pre-bid, land values. It is clear that land values have risen dramatically and the stock of available land has shrunk. Unless we can get over that hurdle, a settlement will be difficult to find.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/5">The encouraging thing about my visit was that I found a real willingness on the part of the businesses to accept that the games are coming to London in 2012 and that they will have to move. However, a feeling is brewing up that they have not been treated fairly by the LDA, and it will not take a great deal for that to turn to militancy, with all the unfortunate consequences that that will entail.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/6">I shall leave it there, not least because I want to give the Minister the maximum time to reply. I would like to finish where I started, by once again congratulating the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch on securing the debate. I also reaffirm my party's support for the Olympics, which we backed all the way through. I wish the games all the best.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.130.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1836" speakername="James Purnell" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport"  colnum="130"  time="16:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h03.htm#51130h03_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.130.0/1">It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Hara. I would like to start, as everybody else has, by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> not only on securing the debate but on introducing it in such a clear-sighted and effective way. She has already proven herself to be a fantastic campaigner on behalf of her constituency and has made this subject one of her key issues&mdash;that is absolutely clear to everybody. She and I were councillors together many years ago in what seems like another life, and she was just as effective then as she is already clearly becoming in this place.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/2">During a recent round of interviews about licensing, I was introduced on LBC with the words, &quot;James Purnell, Minister for London, you are launching this consultation today and consulting Londoners about their views. What is that about?&quot; That was not what I had been asked to talk about, and I am not the Minister for London. I had similar feelings today when delving into the details of London Olympics policy. I therefore start by saying that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Sport and Tourism is disappointed not to be able to be here today as a result of other unavoidable engagements.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/3">Hackney was an invaluable partner in our bid for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games, along with all the other London boroughs, and we look forward to working closely with them over the next few years. I reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch that the Minister for Sport and Tourism will be delighted to meet the representatives of the five boroughs. She said that one of her amendments to the London Olympics Bill would have added them to the membership of the LDA. I understand that we have not yet requested formal representation for anyone on that body, but when making appointments we will have to have regard to those places that will be affected by the games. We therefore expect there to be appropriate representations to deal with her concerns. We imagine that the planning committee in particular would have such representation.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/4">The 2012 games give us a unique opportunity to transform huge swathes of our national life. It is an opportunity not only for 29 days of world-class sport, but to leave a real legacy. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" name="Andrew Love">my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love)</phrase> said, it will lead to thousands of new jobs and homes and generate billions of pounds of public and private investment, which together will create a genuine physical and social infrastructure. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase> was right to say that we should be thinking not only about buildings but about the social infrastructure, and about the people involved in ensuring that our standards of training are top-notch, so that we can deliver a legacy.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.0/1">As well <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1921" name="Lyn Brown">the constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown)</phrase>, who are 20 minutes' walk from the games site, people across the UK will benefit, including those in my constituency&mdash;although they would have a brisk walk of 150 hours. Will the Minister join me in commending the work of regional and national bodies including Sport Scotland and the nations and regions committee of the Olympic committee, which is chaired by a Scot?</p>

	<p pid="a.131.1/1">I endorse what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">my hon. Friend says. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> was right to say that, if Queensland benefited from the Olympics in Sydney, his constituency and constituencies throughout the country should benefit. The games will provide inspiration not only for developing sports participation but, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" name="Laura Moffatt">my hon. Friends the Members for Crawley (Laura Moffatt)</phrase> and for West Ham (Lyn Brown) so eloquently said, for lifting the aspirations of people in general.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/2">I have little time, so I shall try to answer as many of the specific points made during the debate as I can. First, however, I echo what the hon. Member for Bath said about the importance of cross-party support. Tremendous progress has been made in the House and outside. It has been much helped by cross-party support from all sides, and we want that to continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch mentioned the children in form 5D at Daubeney school. I can reassure them about their ability to access tickets. We have already made it clear that the ticket pricing policy will be fair; more than half of the tickets will cost &pound;20 or less, and that will include free transport. On top of that, Keith Mills recently made it clear in evidence to the Select Committee that he would develop a scheme for local young people, and I hope that that will provide the members of form 5D with the opportunity not only to watch the games on television but to watch them in person.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/4">I listened to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1819" name="Derek Wyatt">the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Derek Wyatt)</phrase>, and I agree about the ambitions for the hub. However, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham that we must focus on ensuring that the Olympic institute is well grounded and that it will be doing something achievable. We will consider what she said about community involvement in those facilities once the games have finished&mdash;I will be sure to mention that to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Sport and Tourism&mdash;in order to ensure that such a fantastic facility will also be available to local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/5">An essential point which Members on both sides of the Chamber mentioned was the issue of local communities and businesses. Local businesses stand to benefit significantly from real opportunities presented by the games. We want to ensure that we can deliver many opportunities, particularly for local people, to work in delivering those benefits. The lower Lea valley and the areas around it have enormous untapped potential, with one of the youngest and most culturally diverse populations in Europe. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham said so eloquently, they also have real issues of poverty. One in three people are unemployed on some local estates. There is, therefore, a real opportunity to use the games to regenerate that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/6">We have already made headway on that crucial objective. I hope that I can reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch by saying that the LDA has already announced an initial funding package of &pound;9 million. That covers the job brokerage scheme that she mentioned, as well as specialist construction employment support, which should reassure my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/7">That, of course, is just the beginning. We are happy to commit to working with the five Olympic boroughs to ensure that we develop further plans for local people genuinely to benefit from the job opportunities arising from the Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/8">Regarding the relocated businesses which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" name="Richard Ottaway">the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway)</phrase> mentioned, local businesses recognise the value of the Olympics. About 78 per cent. of them said that they supported the games. I am aware that the LDA is seeking to engage with all those businesses individually. I have of course heard the concerns raised by a number of people. While we cannot comment on individual cases, we will be sure to write to the LDA, so that it knows of the concerns expressed in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/9">I heard the points on funding made by both the spokesman for the official Opposition and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field)</phrase>. We are committed to ensuring that there is effective project management, and that costs are clearly kept under control. In doing that, we will make every effort to minimise the cost to the London taxpayer, who, under the plans submitted as part of the bid for the games, will be asked to contribute less than a quarter of the total of the public sector funding package. Should there be any unavoidable shortfall, our memorandum of understanding with the Mayor provides for the increase in funding to be shared between the Mayor and the lottery.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/10">Finally, in the two minutes remaining, I want to turn to the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/11">Hugh Robertson: Will the Minister give way?</p>

	<p pid="a.133.0/1">I will. Turning to the environment, that is an essential part of what we can do to put Britain in the world's shop window in 2012. We are committed to having the greenest Olympics ever, which, we believe, was a genuine selling point in our bid. We are committed to delivering a low-carbon and zero-waste games, conserving biodiversity and promoting environmental awareness and co-operation. The neglected waterways of the Lea valley will therefore be a key focus. I am told that, once the games precinct is replaced by the successor developments, it will give way to an open river valley landscape of semi-naturalistic parkland, with increased biodiversity. I hope that that will reassure the children of form 5D. The waterways will also be cleaned up to provide recreation, aesthetic pleasure and an ecological habitat. I can also confirm to my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch that we will look at the potential for transport using barges. There are clearly economic and practical implications that need to be looked at.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/2">In conclusion, we are firmly focused on the potential of the Olympic games to deliver a real legacy for my hon. Friend's constituents, for London and for the whole country. Tourism is central to that, and we will work with hon. Members on both sides of the House to ensure that we deliver.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.1/1">I am most grateful for the opportunity to raise this important subject in my first Adjournment debate. The health issues involved will have a major impact on my constituents. My personal commitment to, and involvement with, the health service has dominated more years of my life than I care to remember&mdash;latterly, for nine years as chair of the Liverpool women's hospital. Indeed, health was the subject on which I made my maiden speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/2">I care deeply about and believe absolutely in the national health service. Now, more than ever, that commitment has been reaffirmed because I no longer represent the aspirations of a single hospital but those of 74,112 people&mdash;my constituents. That brings with it a duty and a responsibility to fight to guarantee the best and safest health care services possible. I sought the debate on mergers in the Cheshire and Merseyside strategic health authority area because I believe that that guarantee is under threat from chief executives colluding over deals to merge trusts: namely the Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust, the Aintree Hospitals NHS Trust, the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, and the Walton Centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/3">Before I venture into specific issues, I want to revisit a document produced by the Department of Health in 2003. &quot;Keeping the NHS Local: A New Direction of Travel&quot; clearly states the Government's vision for health service reorganisation and how they will bring the voices of patients and the public to the heart of the debate. One of its key points is that the continued concentration of acute hospital services without sustaining local access to those services runs the danger of making services increasingly remote from many local communities. The mantra is no longer &quot;Big is best&quot;, but &quot;Small works too.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/4">Three fundamental principles should underpin every thought on how health services are reorganised. Change should be developed with people, not for them. The focus should be on redesign, not relocation. The view of the whole system should be taken, which requires working in partnership, with genuine integration and joint planning of services.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.2/1">I am grateful that my hon. Friend cited that part of the document. Given her knowledge of the north-west of England, does she agree that it is a little absurd for the health economy of Crewe to be co-located with that of Chester and Ellesmere Port? The distances are enormous. Proper patient liaison and customer focus will be impossible because of geography.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.3/1">I absolutely agree. I do not know whether the strategic health authority has lost its maps or its ability to measure distances. Perhaps its staff do not use local public transport in the way that many of my constituents do. It is an appalling idea.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.3/2">The Labour Government have done much for the health service, reversing 18 years of Conservative neglect. People's trust and faith in the national health service has been restored and I am determined that their excellent work on health will not be undermined by unelected officials acting autocratically. However, I want to convey a stark message to the Minister: all the good work will be shattered unless we say no to merger in west Lancashire.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.3/3">I resent the small cabal of health service executives, each of whom may have a personal vested interest in the merger. They fail to make decisions and suggestions in an open, honest and transparent way that listens to and involves local people. It could be suggested that they are more concerned with future jobs or handsome redundancy packages. Over the past few weeks, since I highlighted the fact that I was having the debate, I have been inundated with stories from local health service staff. They are further demoralised by stories of change and now merger. Many have asked how I can prevent the merger from happening, because it is being presented to employees as a fait accompli. Their chief executive says that it will happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.3/4">The power lies with the people, in whose name and with whose money the NHS is paid for. When local people and health service staff lose their voice in such a way, health services just happen to them. Rather than being empowered and enabled, patients are marginalised and staff demoralised. We must also not forget that people in west Lancashire face the possibility of being merged into a single primary care trust, which will include 1.1 million people. That would further dilute their voice.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.3/5">Health service executives are treating people and the Government contemptuously. They did not even bother to tell the Secretary of State of their intentions or discussions.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.0/1">On behalf of my constituents, I share many of the hon. Lady's concerns. Does she agree that not only is there talk of conspiracy, but there is rampant confusion and a complete loss of confidence in the local health authorities?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.135.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1667" speakername="Rosie Cooper" colnum="135"  time="16:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h04.htm#51130h04_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.135.1/1">I do. I understand that the strategic health authority is currently issuing press releases on various subjects, and there may very well be all sorts of news stories, which I believe would be intended to confuse the public. People do not know which level of the health service they are dealing with and who is responsible for what.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/2">The public are hearing on the grapevine that services will be reduced or transferred, in particular from Ormskirk, and that there will be future involvement of the private sector at Ormskirk, while wards, such as the rehabilitation ward at Ormskirk hospital, are threatened with closure. They are also hearing that the Liverpool women's hospital will take over maternity services and that Alder Hey will take over children's services. There is rumour upon rumour upon rumour. That is not the way to communicate with our employees, and it is certainly not the way to communicate with our constituents and hospital patients. Confusion reigns.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/3">I question whether there is a commitment to the Ormskirk site. When there is a positive story or action&mdash;such as in respect of the minor injuries unit at Ormskirk&mdash;there is little publicity to tell people about it. Is it any wonder, therefore, that when they need an accident and emergency service, they bypass Ormskirk and use the services at Southport unnecessarily? What is the long-term future of that minor injuries unit? Indeed, as my constituents ask me, what is the long-term future of the Ormskirk site?</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/4">It is the Government's intention that all hospital trusts are to become foundation hospitals by 2008. Monitor recently concluded an assessment of the possibility for individual trusts in the Cheshire and Merseyside strategic health authority area to move to foundation status by 2008. The financial position of Southport and Ormskirk trust makes it unlikely that it can achieve that. The ever-increasing historical debt is now of the order of &pound;17 million. In discussions, I asked why that was not tackled in the past. I suppose that there has not been the appetite to deal with the problem head-on, as it would have been on top of the already unpopular measures in the Shield review. The proposed merger would be yet another step in letting people down.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/5">An assumption is also being made that a merger is the solution to the debt problem. That is not the case. Merger would address the problem by running services across Merseyside&mdash;across the larger area&mdash;to reduce costs. So patients would probably have to travel further for treatment and visitors would have to travel further to visit in-patients. If there were a Liverpool-centric merger, Southport and Ormskirk would have a very junior role to that of Liverpool, with its greater population and university teaching hospitals. Over time, that situation would only get worse as medicine continued its move towards providing more specialist services.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/6">We need to concentrate our efforts on getting the financial situation resolved. If the debt and the cause of it are dealt with, Southport and Ormskirk could be viable. That, along with any relevant partnership working proposals, should be put to the SHA and the Department of Health. We would then be tackling real problems, keeping a voice and keeping health services as local as possible. That is the argument that we should be putting to McKinsey and Co. That should be its brief.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/7">McKinsey has done some good work for the NHS, but we must guard against any natural bias in favour of mergers. I understand that mergers is one of the growth areas of its business. Merging trusts would not be the solution but the easy option. It would be tantamount to throwing up our hands and saying that there is nothing we can do. I cannot accept that as a solution, and my constituents will not.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/8">Merging will not provide the solution to the challenges of Government policy either. It will not result in debt being reduced or services being enhanced, and it is not in the interests of the people of west Lancashire or those of any of the other people affected by the proposal who live in the constituencies represented by my hon. Friends from the region. We have only to look at the experiences of merged hospitals: the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust and Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust have been a disaster.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/9">The arguments against merger in the case of Airedale NHS Trust in Bradford apply equally to Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust, and no doubt to the other hospitals under threat of merger. Under a merger, there will be no improvement in clinical standards that could not be achieved by the hospitals remaining separate. A management merger would not achieve any significant improvement in access to services; it could even reduce accessibility. Mergers do not lead to a greater access to funds; in fact, they could prevent high-quality staff from joining the hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/10">It has to be said clearly: mergers do not increase the capacity to meet Government-set targets. We need to concentrate our efforts on getting hospitals to concentrate on the patients and the financial situation. The Government say that services have to be good, safe, timely and convenient for patients. The merger idea, which comes from the three chief executives involved, without any consultation, does not meet those standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/11">Where does patient choice come in the agenda? If hospitals across Liverpool, west Lancashire and the wider area are merged, where will people go to get patient choice? They will have to travel to Manchester, Preston and beyond, which very possibly will be too far. It would be nigh-on impossible for west Lancashire residents to make regular journeys to visit in-patient family members and friends, never mind receive treatment themselves. Ormskirk is 22 miles from the Broadgreen site, 18 miles from the Royal Liverpool university hospital and 11 miles from Aintree hospital. From Skelmersdale, it would be even further. We already ask people to travel further and further to access specialist services such as cancer services, and that is medically right, but should we ask them to do the same to access general services? Like the Government, I do not believe that we should.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/12">In my constituency, there are below-average levels of car ownership. In west Lancashire, we have public transport difficulties in getting to Southport and Ormskirk hospitals. I know that because I have done it: it takes one hour and 20 minutes on a bus from Upholland to the hospital in Southport. To have to go even further would necessitate what amounts to a day trip, which is ridiculous in this age. Vulnerable groups are left reliant on a public transport system that is failing people in west Lancashire.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/13">It is the same if we travel from Skelmersdale to the Broadgreen site. Theoretically, that should take two hours, but in practice it would probably take closer to two and a half. It involves three bus rides, two walks to make the changes and one train ride. That is just one way&mdash;double it for a return trip. What if a person is ill? That is just one of the many examples of problems that my constituents would face in accessing health services if the new model were adopted.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/14">Not merging would not preclude any partnership working across clinical specialisms, although that argument will be the excuse and the ruse used by people who just want to merge and get on with it. Those things could still happen, but the difference would be that Southport and Ormskirk would be a full partner and have a voice at the table. As the Minister will be aware, many other hospitals have partnership arrangements that offer the best service options for their local residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/15">Partnership working should not be confined to Liverpool. Why did that only happen there, because perhaps services could be delivered by Wigan, Preston and Chorley hospitals? If we believe in in-patient choice, let us construct a creative, innovative and enabling set of partnerships and relationships that deliver the highest standards of health care for our communities and local residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/16">Having heard the proposals in Gill Dolan's report on the future shape of health services, members of west Lancashire patient and public involvement forum have issued a press release in which they express many, if not all, of my concerns about securing a sustainable, accessible health service. I have to tell my hon. Friend the Minister that we need solutions that do not include merger. The agenda of those solutions can only be to provide the best possible local, accessible care in a patient-centred NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.0/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1667" name="Rosie Cooper">my hon. Friend the Member for West Lancashire (Rosie Cooper)</phrase> for allowing me a couple of minutes in this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/2">The merger that my hon. Friend describes is not the only one on which the strategic health authority is working: it is also working to merge North Cheshire Hospitals NHS Trust and Whiston hospital. Such mergers are undertaken by stealth, without any community engagement. More than that, the SHA is skewing the evidence that it presents to McKinsey on the merger in order to achieve the outcome that it wants, saying that it must explore organisational configuration issues. It has misrepresented the results of a MORI poll on choice carried out by the primary care trust in Warrington, and totally ignores the needs of local people in favour of bureaucracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/3">The centre of my constituency has a relatively low car ownership. It is a 20 mile round trip to Whiston hospital. As the private finance initiative for Whiston is larger than its current needs, the inevitable result of any merger would be the transfer of services away from Warrington. Like my hon. Friend, we are not opposed to partnerships or to improving clinical standards. However, concentrating on a merger is diverting attention away from those matters and on to the bureaucratic issues that suit the health authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/4">My hon. Friend the Minister has to get a grip on our SHA. It must be much more patient focused and concerned less with structures. As for the merger, I tell him clearly that my constituents do not want it, and I do not believe that the hospital board wants it. The proposal comes from the SHA and it needs to be stamped on at birth, because it is not in the interests of the people whom I represent.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.1/1">Let me start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1667" name="Rosie Cooper">my hon. Friend the Member for West Lancashire (Rosie Cooper)</phrase> on having secured the debate. May I begin by saying that she has displayed two of her great talents this afternoon? The first is her ability to fight on behalf of her constituents, and the second her deep experience of the national health service. She was not only vice-chair of Liverpool health authority between 1994 and 1996, but chair of Liverpool women's hospital between 1996 and 2005. I was also very glad to hear <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1907" name="Helen Jones">my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones)</phrase> intervene, not least because I was born in Warrington hospital. It is always a pleasure to hear it mentioned in this Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/2">The starting point for this debate is simple. In the past few weeks, I have had the pleasure of visiting a number of hospitals in and around Liverpool, including Whiston and Alder Hey hospitals and Liverpool women's hospital. I have seen the transformation of the NHS in and around Liverpool, and I know that that is benefiting my hon. Friends' constituents. That has not happened by accident. It has happened because we have increased the funding of the NHS from around &pound;35 billion to around &pound;70 billion. Cheshire and Merseyside strategic health authority has benefited greatly from that investment, with 400 extra consultants since 1997, nearly 5,500 extra nurses and more than 3,800 health care assistants. That has made a huge difference to the quality of care in my hon. Friends' constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/3">My hon. Friend the Member for West Lancashire has a PCT that sits in the Cumbria and Lancashire SHA area where, I am told, the number of people waiting more than six months for in-patient treatment has dropped by an extraordinary 95 per cent. since 1997, and the number of people waiting 13 weeks or more for out-patient treatment has dropped by an almost as impressive 86 per cent. The result of that, of course, is that people are living longer. The mortality rates in my hon. Friend's local authority area show that there have been extraordinary advances since 1997: the mortality rate from coronary heart disease has fallen by more than a quarter, and the death rate from cancer has fallen by 8 per cent. We should congratulate front-line NHS staff on those achievements and the way in which they have gripped and exploited our investment and reforms.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.0/1">Will my hon. Friend the Minister accept from me, as I have received acute services under the current structures, that there is integration across boundaries&mdash;between the Countess of Chester and Broadgreen hospitals, the ambulance trust and my GP, in my case&mdash;and that it is superb? That is within current structures. There is an old adage: &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.139.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. I hope that he is pleased by what my noble friend Lord Warner writes to SHAs and hon. Members later today about our proposals to strengthen front-line services in and around his area.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/2">The backdrop for today's debate is the funding increases that are to come. Although advances have been made, we want to go further. In the local PCT area of my hon. Friend the Member for West Lancashire that means about &pound;24 million more going into front-line health care in the next few years. The choices available to local health professionals are extraordinary&mdash;how much extra should be spent on hospitals, primary care services and community care services? It is a long time since front-line professionals working in the NHS have had such a rich array of choices.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/3">My hon. Friend was right to stress the importance of localism in advancing services in this country. That is precisely why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will produce a White Paper in the new year on how to strengthen services that are not just around the clock but around the corner. We do far too much work in acute hospitals, and we can do a great deal more to move that care closer to where people live.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/4">As we put more money into the NHS, it is only right that we should ask its managers to manage their books effectively. That is why we have asked hospitals to go for foundation status: it is a badge of effectiveness. My hon. Friend well knows that because she was instrumental in getting Liverpool women's hospital foundation status recently. To facilitate that process, we asked a few areas to pilot the whole health community diagnostic project, which is our way of ensuring that financial management in the NHS is as strong as it should be. My hon. Friend's area was one of those that piloted that project. That was done simply to ensure that NHS managers do not have the luxury of ducking the kind of tough financial decisions that she talked about so eloquently, or the opportunity to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/5">The agenda of expanding hospital services is important, but it needs first-class financial management to go with it. The programme of expanding and improving acute hospitals would be much easier if Liverpool metropolitan borough council raised its game and started to work slightly more effectively with the NHS. My visits to Alder Hey, Liverpool women's and Whiston hospitals were instructive, and I was disappointed to hear of concerns that the council might have dragged its feet in taking decisions that were needed to expedite the arrival of those new, first-class facilities. The diagnostic project on finances in my hon. Friend's constituency is ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/6">However, I must confirm that the Department of Health has not agreed how it will proceed from the outcome of the pilot involving Cheshire and Merseyside SHA. There is still work to be done exploring the options that should be made available. As part of that, I understand that NHS trusts in Liverpool, Sefton, Southport and west Lancashire have begun formal discussions to review the configuration of trusts in their area to determine whether the current organisational structure is best placed to provide services to meet patients' needs. I know that in my hon. Friend's area McKinsey was hired. After this afternoon's debate, I wonder why they did not hire her&mdash;they could perhaps have obtained a slightly better result for less money. However, that is a decision that has passed us by.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/7">This year Cheshire and Merseyside SHA assures me that it has not predetermined the outcome of the work and that any conclusions will be pursued if they are demonstrably in the patients' interest. I shall hold the SHA to that assurance.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.0/1">That is a first-class idea. The matter has been reviewed in some depth, and Ministers will need to see extremely good evidence to justify any change in the current configuration. The SHA must satisfy Ministers on three tests in particular. I should be grateful if my hon. Friends would, if they have the opportunity to meet the chief executive and chairman of the local SHA, remind them of those tests, which Ministers will treat as important and which will determine their stance. First, there must be consistency with the NHS plan and the White Paper on care close to home, which we shall publish at the turn of the year. Secondly, new proposals must unequivocally produce better standards of care. Thirdly, any proposals must be subject to a full public consultation. Managerial convenience is not one of the tests that the proposals must pass.</p>

	Policing (Northamptonshire)

	<p pid="a.142.1/1">First, I thank Mr. Speaker for enabling me to secure the debate, the Minister for attending, and all the police officers, staff and associated civilians of the Northamptonshire police force for their good work and the tremendous efforts they put into policing matters in the county. They deserve our thanks and praise, and I am happy to put that on the record on behalf of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/2">The purpose of my contribution to this debate is to leave the Minister in no doubt about the importance of policing, crime, antisocial behaviour and general law-and-order issues to my constituents. It is extremely important and I have done my best to raise the matter through every parliamentary device. I have asked the Prime Minister a question at Prime Minister's Question Time. I have participated in correspondence with him and even received a reply from him on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June</phrase>. I have joined the parliamentary police scheme and will spend 22 days with the Northamptonshire police to find out at first hand about policing issues on the ground. I want to leave four points with the Minister&mdash;my conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/3">First, there are not enough police officers in Northamptonshire. It is not just me or my constituents who say that. The chief constable also says that. Secondly, Northamptonshire police force suffers persistent long-term underfunding. It is not just me or my constituents who say that. The chief constable also says that. That underfunding will get worse because Northamptonshire is included in the Milton Keynes and south midlands growth area and will experience the fastest growth of house building in the country up to 2021 and 2031.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/4">Thirdly, there are huge local concerns about the performance of Northamptonshire police who are, according to the Government's measures, an underperforming force. Fourthly and lastly, there is strong and growing local opposition to the proposal to merge Northamptonshire police force with neighbouring forces and perhaps even to make it part of a new, grotesque east midlands police force.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/5">On the first point about there not being enough police officers, in Northamptonshire there are 1,264. If we had the national average number of officers per head of population, Northamptonshire would have 1,479. There are 938 full-time-equivalent police service staff, which is one of the highest rates of civilianisation in the country. There are 192 special constables, compared with 314 eight years ago. There are some 39 community support officers and I am pleased to say that Kettering borough council, on which I am a councillor, funds in part eight community support officers for Kettering.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/6">There has been a doubling of the number of police officers retiring or resigning in the past eight years. Eight years ago, 37 officers left the force and 74 left in 2003&ndash;04. Of the constables in the force 25 per cent. have been in service for less than three years and 20 per cent. of those on the beat are probationers.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/7">On crime statistics, in 2003&ndash;04, 123 crimes were committed for every 1,000 people in the county compared with an average in England and Wales of 113 for every 1,000 people. That is the highest crime rate among Northamptonshire's family of eight most similar forces where the range was 86 to 123 for every 1,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/8">On population per officer, in 2003&ndash;04 in Northamptonshire there were 506 people for every constable and 461 in England and Wales. On the average number of crimes per officer, there were 62 in Northamptonshire and 48 among its family of most similar forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/9">Everyone in Northamptonshire from the chief constable downwards&mdash;plus Northamptonshire's elected parliamentary representatives taking part in this afternoon's debate&mdash;wants the Minister to know that there are not enough police officers in the county.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/10">The second point is about persistent, long-term underfunding. I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1742" name="Brian Binley">my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley)</phrase> wants to catch your eye later, Mr. O'Hara, to expand on that point. Over the past three years, the formula funding for the Northamptonshire police service has meant that the force has received &pound;5.5 million less than it ought to have done. Last year&mdash;2004&ndash;05&mdash;the police budget was nominated. In the three previous years, the police precept had to go up by 26 per cent., 23 per cent. and 14 per cent. to try to address, at least in part, the systematic failure to deliver the funding that the county needs to provide proper policing.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/11">In terms of the formula grant per head of population, Northamptonshire gets &pound;101 a year compared with the average in England and Wales, which is &pound;139. The police force with the highest figure in the land gets &pound;248. Northamptonshire is the third worst authority in the country in respect of falling victim to the damping formula applied to the funding formula mechanism.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/12">There is growing concern about the performance of the Northamptonshire constabulary. The police standards unit has been engaged with the force since spring 2004. A new policing model was introduced in October 2004 and is beginning to tackle some of the underlying problems. The difficulty is that the forces in Northamptonshire's family of most similar forces are beginning to tackle their difficulties more effectively than the Northamptonshire force is tackling its own.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/13">In the recent statistics published by the Home Office, the Northamptonshire police force came out&mdash;on the Government's figures&mdash;as the third worst-performing police authority in the country, with an overall aggregate score of one in a range of minus three to plus 16. Recorded crime for every 1,000 people is 22 per cent. higher than in comparable forces. House burglary is 60 per cent. higher, robberies are 84 per cent. higher and vehicle crime is 42 per cent. higher. House burglary detection is the worst in the most similar family of forces and vehicle crime detection is almost the worst. Only 35 per cent. of the Northamptonshire public think that the criminal justice system is effective in bringing people to justice compared with 43 per cent. for the east and west midlands on average. Fear of crime is among the worst in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/14">There is strong and growing opposition to the prospect of merging the Northamptonshire police force with neighbouring forces. The National Association of Retired Police Officers has written to me to say that</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/15" class="indent">&quot;there are only people like us still around and actively connected with the Force who can still remember the aftermath of the 1966 amalgamations and their terrible effect on Force efficiency which took ten years to get back to the pre-1966 efficiency.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/16">The local National Farmers Union has written to me to say that it is worried that the regionalisation of the local police force could mean that rural crime is tackled even less effectively than heretofore</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/17">There are problems with policing in Northamptonshire and they basically stem from insufficient funding being given to the local force. Local people feel that the issue is very important. I hope that the Minister will take on board these points and come up with some constructive solutions so that policing can be properly addressed in the great county of Northamptonshire.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.0/1">I thank the Minister for kindly allowing me this privilege, for which I am grateful.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase>, not only on securing this debate, but on the work that he does for his constituents and the wider Northamptonshire population. I am grateful for that and many others are, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.0/3">I wish to talk for two to three minutes about the funding formula, which has impacted so heavily on Northamptonshire. When the new formula was first announced more than three years ago, we were rather pleased because it showed that we were one of the main underfunding constabularies in the country&mdash;underfunded by way of the previous formula&mdash;and the new formula would correct that underfunding. If the Government had not changed the new formula, we would have expected more than 22 per cent. extra funding over the past three years. My hon. Friend has explained how much that added up to; in truth, it would have meant 50 permanent officers for Northamptonshire constabulary.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.0/4">Sadly, the formula realisation did not occur. I understand why the Government put a damping formula on their own formula: it would have meant serious difficulties for them at the other end of the process. However, be that as it may, we were left with a reduced grant of some 13 per cent., adding up to &pound;5.5 million, which has had a massive effect on the performance that our force in Northamptonshire can achieve. There is a link between funding and performance in that respect. I am not arguing that that is the only explanation, but it is one factor that has meant that we have underperformed&mdash;and we and the Government have been disappointed.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.0/5">I appeal to the Minister to consider seriously the funding formula as it impacts on Northamptonshire, because the Government said fairly that we deserved more. However, they then dampened the impact and we did not get what they said they thought we deserved. In the light of that, I ask the Minister to consider the issue again.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> on securing this important debate and on attracting four of the six county Members of Parliament to it. I should like to put on record my high regard for the police force in Northamptonshire, particularly the chief constable.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.0/2">I want to make a brief point, and I hope that the Minister will appreciate that none of this is party political. I run a survey in Wellingborough, called &quot;Listening to Wellingborough and Rushden&quot;, and 20 per cent. of the residents tell me that they are scared to go out at night because of the fear of crime. When we asked what they would like to see done about that, they said, &quot;We'd like more police officers and more local policing.&quot; Nobody has suggested that they would like a police force covering a bigger area.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.0/3">With the aid of this map, I should like to demonstrate quickly the problem with my constituency, which is right at the tip of Northamptonshire. We already feel a little bit out on a limb. However, if we look at the proposed region, the map shows that we are 80 to 100 miles from Nottingham, for example. However, I could walk 100 yards in my area and I would find myself in Bedfordshire. We therefore look to Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes and, if there were a merger, I understand that there would be a large operational argument for us to go in with Bedfordshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.0/4">I urge the Minister to consider this matter again, give better guidelines to the police authority and examine the option of looking across Government regional boundaries.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> on securing the debate and thank his hon. Friends for ensuring that I have plenty of time to respond to it. We have had good participation and good visual aids, which are always helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/2">I commend the hon. Gentleman for the enthusiasm that he has shown for policing issues. They are important to all our constituents and, thus, to all Members of Parliament. It is right that he drew attention to them in this debate. I congratulate him on joining the parliamentary police scheme, which I am sure he will find an interesting experience. I share his interest and that of other hon. Members in effective policing, but I hope he will forgive me for drawing different conclusions from those that he drew.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/3">Let us consider first the performance of Northamptonshire police. As the hon. Gentleman is aware, the police standards unit&mdash;the PSU&mdash;within the Home Office has been engaged with Northamptonshire police since the spring of last year. That engagement arose from specific worries expressed by Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary. Because of the performance gap in reducing crime to which the hon. Gentleman referred between his force and its peers, at that time overall crime in Northamptonshire was about a third higher than it was for the comparable authorities.It is to the credit of the chief constable that he grasped the nettle and invited the PSU into the force. I am pleased that such action is already showing real dividends. Let us consider the most recent data for the force. In the 12 months to the end of October, it reduced its overall crime level by 11 per cent., domestic burglary was down by 18 per cent. and vehicle crime was reduced by 19 per cent. I join the hon. Gentleman in congratulating the police on the front line for making that difference in his community.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/4">Having said that, there is still further improvement to be made in performance. The scale of the challenge was reflected in the recent police performance assessments that were published last month by the Home Office and HMIC. For example, the assessment gave the force poor and deteriorating grades for investigating crime. While there has been some progress, there is room for further improvement. The role of the PSU is to share good practice, to provide expert knowledge and to bring in additional resources. About &pound;1 million in additional resources has been made available through the PSU intervention in Northamptonshire. That sum is in addition to the &pound;67.8 million in general police grants that was given for 2005&ndash;06, an increase of &pound;3.5 million on the year before, which is 5.5 per cent. and considerably more than the minimum increase of 3.75 per cent., which is guaranteed to all police authorities. The force continues to benefit from a range of specific grants for particular targeted programmes. In Northamptonshire this year, that amounts to &pound;7 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/5">In my time as a Minister, I have learned that financial investment is important. However, it is far too simplistic to say that poor performance by any public service is always the result of lack of investment. It is certainly too simplistic to say that in the case of Northamptonshire. The president of the Association of Chief Police Officers acknowledged recently that it is not only a matter of resources but how they are managed and directed that makes the difference. The PSU will continue to work with the force with the agreement of the chief constable and under the ultimate direction of Ministers. We have in place an agreed set of criteria, which will make it clear when is the right time for the PSU to end its engagement. We will keep such matters under review. Eventual disengagement by the PSU will happen when all parties are satisfied that the criteria have been met.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/6">The hon. Gentleman also referred to police numbers. We ought not to disagree about the fact that police numbers are at record levels in Northamptonshire. I have a slightly different figure from that of the hon. Gentleman, but as of March this year 1,267 police officers were in post, an increase of 90 since 1997. The force already has plans in hand to increase that number to 1,315 by March 2006. It is slightly more complicated than just the headline figure of police officers, because the number of police staff has increased by a fairly dramatic 73 per cent. since 1997&mdash;from 554 to 958. There has been an increase in the overall staffing of 21 per cent., which compares with a 13 per cent. increase nationally. If all the staff are considered&mdash;police officers, community support officers, traffic wardens and so on&mdash;the increase in Northamptonshire has been bigger than that across the whole country.</p>

	<p pid="a.146.0/1">Hon. Members representing constituencies in the county, and the chief constable, anticipated that the Minister would reply as he just did. The chief constable wanted us to make it clear to the Minister that although it is perfectly true that there has been an increase in the number of police officers, local residents in Northamptonshire still do not have the number of police officers required.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.147.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="147"  time="17:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h05.htm#51130h05_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.147.0/1">I freely acknowledge that if we were to go to any community in this country, people would say that they wanted more police officers. This Government have pledged, and are delivering, more police officers, but we have to manage the available resources. I commend the chief constable of Northamptonshire police and all those involved on managing a switch so that there are more back-up staff who are not police officers doing jobs that police officers used to do. That frees up police officers to get on to the front line and to add capacity to community policing, which the hon. Gentleman's constituents&mdash;all our constituents&mdash;want.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/2">The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of force restructuring, which I know is a matter of concern to hon. Members in his region and others. At the centre of the issue is how we ensure that we have police forces equipped to deal with the level 2 threats that we face&mdash;organised crime, terrorism and so on&mdash;while at the same time ensuring that there is reliable, stable, solid community policing in all our neighbourhoods.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.1/1">I understand where the Government are coming from on that. Operationally, in our area, looking outside these predetermined regions would be more sensible and efficient and would achieve better goals, which the Minister wants,</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-30a.147.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="147"  time="17:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051130/halltext/51130h05.htm#51130h05_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.147.2/1">In a little while I shall come on to the shortlist of options for the hon. Gentleman's region and emphasise again that we are talking about a consultation. The Home Secretary wants to develop the new structure from the bottom up and not create a blueprint from the top down. I know that hon. Members will be involved in the consultations, and they will be able to make the points that they wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/2">In order to ensure that the two issues could both be dealt with adequately by a police structure, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary asked HMIC to examine whether the current 43-force structure was still fit for purpose. It examined in particular what are called the &quot;protective services&quot;, which I mentioned: dealing with organised crime, counter terrorism and murders, which rightly draw in huge police resources when they occur in a community; tackling domestic extremism&mdash;we are determined to tackle and overcome animal rights extremism; and dealing with civil contingencies of different kinds, critical incidents, public order incidents and so on. All forces have to be able to deal with those kinds of pressures.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/3">HMIC's findings in the &quot;Closing the gap&quot; report are pretty stark. It concluded that the existing force structure, which has been established for more than 30 years, is</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/4" class="indent">&quot;no longer fit for purpose. In the interests of the efficiency and effectiveness of policing it should change.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/5">HMIC felt strongly that in this particular case size matters. It suggested that as a minimum there should be 4,000 police officers or 6,000 staff in a strategic police force that is able both to deal with level 2 threats and the issue of neighbourhood policing. Faced with such clear, unequivocal, professional and independent advice from the inspectorate, I put it to the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues that it would be irresponsible for the Government not to respond to that by trying to provide a structure that was more up to the task.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/6">The inspectorate considered several possible options for the way forward, including that of greater collaboration between forces and the creation of federations between forces for the provision of protective services, but it felt that all those options had significant drawbacks. On the federal option, for example, it commented that clarity of responsibilities and governance would be an enduring challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/7">The inspectorate concluded that the establishment of strategic forces with sufficient critical mass to meet all the demands of modern policing was the best business solution. We agree. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has repeatedly made it clear that he has no blueprint. We want the new structure to be developed from the ground up, with local communities and local police authorities very much in the driving seat.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/8">We have made it clear that we want the proposals to be submitted to the Home Office by <phrase class="date" code="">23 December</phrase>, and I am pleased to be able to report that that consultation is well under way.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.1/1">The Home Secretary does not want to carve up existing police force structures, because he believes that that would over-complicate the process. I can confirm, however, that all five police authorities and their chief constables in the east midlands have now made a joint submission that proposes four options. They conclude, as we do, that the two stronger options were for Northamptonshire to join Leicestershire and Lincolnshire and for Derbyshire to join Nottinghamshire, or for all five forces to combine into an east midlands force.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/2">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has said he agrees that those two options are the most sensible ones at this stage. He has emphasised, however, that it is ultimately a matter for each police authority to decide which option to propose in December. Northamptonshire police authority is now engaged with others in a wide-ranging consultation, and I am sure that hon. Members who are in the Chamber today will make their views known very strongly.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/3">I should add that the option of Northamptonshire police as a stand-alone force does not meet the inspectorate's criterion on the size of force. The force has only 1,267 officers, which is well below the threshold of 4,000 officers that the inspectorate recommended, and it is unlikely to deliver sufficient capacity and capability to meet the requirements for protective services to national standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.2/1">Will the Minister consider the fact that a force of that size could make sense if we had regional units that specialised in, for instance, terrorism? Does he accept that the two can be separated in that way?</p>

	<p pid="a.149.0/1">The inspectorate concluded that it would not be appropriate to split the two in that way, and that structures of accountability and so on would make that a very difficult structure to sustain in the long term. It recommended, and we agreed, that the two necessary elements of policing&mdash;the level that deals with the threat of terrorism, animal rights extremism and organised crime and the level that deals with neighbourhood policing&mdash;must come under the same force structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.0/2">I know that concern has been expressed that our proposals may detract from local neighbourhood policing, but the reverse is actually the case. We want greater strategic capacity to mean that resources will not be drawn from plans for neighbourhood policing in the event of major incidents. Indeed, we have made a commitment to have neighbourhood policing in every area by 2008.</p>
