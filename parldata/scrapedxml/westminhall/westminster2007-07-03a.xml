<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-03a.172.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1469" speakername="Hywel Williams" colnum="172"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070703/halltext/70703h0001.htm#07070329000463">
	<p pid="a.172.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman. Dwylo Da, which I mentioned, is in a new build. That was part of the problem that it faced&mdash;there was not a suitable place for the nursery. That was a major difficulty there, but in other places people might be able to deploy redundant buildings. I am sure that there is scope for that. There might be nimbyism, but I cannot imagine why.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/2">On the provision of workplace nurseries, there was an excellent employer in Bala, in the constituency neighbouring mine. It was a clothing company and, being of sufficient size, provided a workplace nursery. The economy in rural areas is often a series of small enterprises of one or two people that are not in a position to do the same, but the enterprise in Bala provided a nursery. It has recently closed, with the work going, I think, to China. With it, of course, went the workplace nursery. The size of enterprises can be a problem, particularly in rural areas, but there might be an opportunity for small companies to club together and provide jointly for their workers. That is the best standard&mdash;it is good practice, not general practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/3">I referred a moment ago to Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin, the Welsh-language pre-school playgroups association, and I now turn to bilingual childcare provision. The importance of language has been highlighted, not least by the Prime Minister. There are other providers in Wales such as Wales Pre-school Playgroups Association, but I focus on MYM because of the language issue. I should confess that I used to be the chair of the local MYM group and have a long-standing interest in its work. It provides traditional playgroups, full-time child care and, interestingly, what it calls ti a fi groups, which means &quot;you and me&quot;. There are about 1,000 groups throughout Wales, providing a service variously from birth to school age, with an emphasis on interactive, creative learning and playing to a purpose. We saw that in Sweden, where children follow such a curriculum up to the age of seven. The educational results at the end are excellent, no different from those of the more traditional methods of teaching employed in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/4">MYM uses methods consistent with the groundbreaking curriculum that is being brought in by the Welsh Assembly Government and will be in all schools in Wales by 2008. The ti a fi groups might appear a little different from mother and child groups or, perhaps more accurately in some circumstances, grandmother and grandchild groups, which are an increasingly common pattern. Given the Prime Minister's emphasis on language learning, I wish to say that 70 per cent. of the children and parents attending the ti a fi groups have English as their home language but attend Welsh-medium provision. Through those groups, MYM works with non-Welsh-speaking parents and grandparents, and with children, to introduce the language. That is a ready-made model; it perhaps does not quite fit circumstances elsewhere, but it is none the less interesting.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/5">The groups teach simple words and pronunciation to adults so that they can use them for bedtime reading to children from simple books. There is not enough emphasis on reading to children, which I used to enjoy enormously with my three daughters. The grandparents and parents are taught songs that they can sing with their children, although perhaps they do not understand them fully. The pay-off is that children learn in a participative, creative way and become bilingual at an early age. By default, the adults also learn elements of the language.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/6">I should contextualise that example by referring to broader trends in Welsh society, such as the growth in the number of adults learning Welsh and the availability and use of the language in education, television, newspapers and so on. In particular there is a project called &quot;twf&quot;, which means &quot;growth&quot;. It targets Welsh-speaking new parents and encourages them to pass the language on to their children. Broad tendencies are developing, and in ti a fi groups we have a successful model of how to pass on a language, which should be of interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/7">The later value of becoming bilingual, the better development of cognitive ability, is now clear and uncontested. Bilingual people have the edge&mdash;perhaps not this bilingual person, but there we are. I need not emphasise the importance of such techniques of second-language acquisition in apparently monoglot England. I say &quot;apparently monoglot&quot; because there is a huge, little-regarded richness of language. There is a great deal to learn on our own doorstep as well as from Scandinavia.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/8">I wish to mention parenting and promoting the involvement of extended families. It is important for us not to be too starry-eyed and stigmatise parents, particularly lone parents, who do a great job under difficult circumstances. I have no intention of looking back on some imagined, wholly unproblematic past when families cared for themselves, thank you very much, without the help of the nanny state. I have no doubt that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> will refer to issues around parenting later, rightly putting the emphasis on the value of early intervention and parental involvement. As the report, &quot;Every Parent Matters&quot;, states&mdash;perhaps it is stating the obvious&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Parental involvement has a significant effect on pupil achievement&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/10">A famous rugby coach&mdash;famous in Wales, at least&mdash;called Carwyn James used to say &quot;get your retaliation in first&quot;, so before the hon. Gentleman gets to his feet, I shall briefly refer to parenting and a project in my area.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/11">Throughout north Wales we now have the incredible years programme, which is fostered and promoted by colleagues at the university of Bangor. It works with children and parents and provides training and guidance to cope with problems in behaviour early on, with clear success. The person behind it is Judy Hutchins, who is a former colleague of mine from my time at Bangor. She has worked with a range of local agencies including my local authority, Cyngor Gwynedd, and with particular community initiatives such as a children's centre in my constituency called Plas Pawb. The parenting programme has been implemented in deprived housing estates, and, as a result, parents have been attracted to all sorts of other courses offered, such as cooking, financial management and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/12">I should confess to a small part in the programme: I handed out parenting course completion certificates to proud parents who recently completed the course, and, as we are talking about Wales, the local course was run by my sister, Bethan Hughes.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/13">Using carefully controlled scientific methods, the project has demonstrated that early intervention can be hugely successful in improving children's behaviour and, indeed, the relationship between parents and children. Such initiatives are not cheap. Cyngor Gwynedd, my local authority, won a grant to the tune of &pound;800,000 to take the work forward after 2008. We are talking about real money. It is a large amount, of course, but such programmes are hugely valuable. The dividend down the line is that young people's behaviour will be much improved and, as they may one day be parents, we are storing up a great deal of good for the future. A colleague involved in the project told me that in Norway the parenting part of the initiative is compulsory for all new parents and, interestingly, is available free of charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/14">My final point concerns informal care, mainly by grandparents. Again, I refer to the report, which highlighted some interesting conclusions. Care by near relatives was valued highly by parents as being flexible and trusted. It is their first choice, and it is low cost or even no cost&mdash;hugely valuable. Grandmothers in the study did not want to be registered, inspected or paid. They did not want to be child minders; they were providing out of love. There is a quote in the report along the lines of, &quot;we are the grannies, this is what we do&quot;. God help anyone who stands in their way.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/15">However, the grandparents did point to some of the costs of caring, and we must take account of those, particularly in respect of grandparents who might be on disability benefits or pensions and who may themselves be low-income people. It is problematic to think of paying people for doing what they would do anyway out of love, but provision of care by relatives in other contexts&mdash;disability, for instance&mdash;is acknowledged financially by the benefits system. This morning, I say only that the issue needs to be considered. The grandparents who we talked to were not looking for vast amounts of money but some recognition of the costs of caring for children, particularly over the summer holidays when they might be taking children to the swimming pool and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/16">The issue needs to be considered because the number of available grandparents is likely to fall in the near future because of demography, substantially, but also because some grandparents will stay in work longer and simply will not be available. Through more flexible working and other provisions, the contribution of relatives will need to be recognised or possibly replaced if parents are to be enabled to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/17">In that respect, proper child care is vital not only for families but for the economic development of deprived areas such as my constituency, where the rate of economic engagement is damagingly low. A very low proportion of my constituents are engaged in productive work. We need to look at the issue again. Child care and parenting are not only important for families and children; they are central to economic policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Olner. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1469" name="Hywel Williams">the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams)</phrase>, whom I call my hon. Friend, on securing this debate on behalf of several of us who went to Sweden. As I am in a congratulatory mood, I also congratulate the Minister on her job. I believe that it is similar to her previous one, but I hope that it will include even wider responsibilities, not least because the Prime Minister has replicated at national level what we have had at local level&mdash;a children and young people's Department, in effect. I hope that the Minister will attend many Cabinet meetings to fight the corner for children, schools and families.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.1/2">It is important that such a structure is in place. We are talking about is a central difficulty that we as policy makers must resolve if we are to make progress in our society. Members of Parliament have probably seen that many of the problems that we encounter&mdash;whether antisocial behaviour, failure at school, disruption in classes, criminality, drug abuse or a lifetime on benefits&mdash;stem directly from the failure to raise children in the right way, and that is a follow-on from parents not having the right parenting skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.1/3">To resolve some of those problems, our main strategy must be early intervention. We can spend billions chasing after problems once they are part of a human being and part of their personality, or we can intervene early and spend a little bit of money on children and mothers, so that both can fulfil their human potential. Early intervention should be the key strategic objective in Government policy making in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.1/4">Two years ago, I could not get anyone to talk about early intervention. Now everybody talks about it, and they are throwing in everything. On every policy, we are talking the talk on early intervention, but we must be careful. We need to define what early intervention is. To me, it is a policy that makes an impact on the inter-generational nature of problems, that seeks to break inter-generational cycles. I am sure every Member has had this experience. I have been in the House for quite a long time. I am now getting not the 16-year-old who came to my first surgeries in 1987, with a little babe in arms, but the babe in arms herself, bringing her child to my surgery to get advice on problems. That inter-generational cycle must be broken.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.1/5">That is not to say that we should not continue with our remedial policies&mdash;of course we should. We should be helping out at the sharp end. We should be helping to find remedies for those people who suffer because of neglect in the early years, but let us not confuse a package of early intervention measures with the continuing necessity for remedial policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.1/6">Early intervention is necessary because in so many areas we have lost the skill&mdash;the art&mdash;of parenting. I say that because in many senses we are a child-illiterate society. We have lost the trans-generational transmission of child-rearing practices. Parenting has never just been about one poor little 16&mdash;year-old girl on a tough estate in my constituency struggling to raise a child on her own. Parenting was traditionally something in which a whole group, or family, engaged. Work has been done on that by Bruce Perry who, by tracking back the family group size to the year 1850, has made it clear that it was typical to have 12 people in the family unit. If we go back further to 1,000 years ago, there were sometimes up to 50 people in a family unit&mdash;thus there was always a stimulus around, the ability to learn was developed and interaction took place. In a sense, we are trying to find a substitute for that in modern society, and we certainly do need to find a substitute because this problem will not get better.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.1/7">According the work of the Child Trauma Academy, the number of young people who we can say are generally at risk is around 10 per cent. but, because of differential birth rates and the fact that mums in those situations have their children earlier, in six generations, it will not be a 10 per cent. problem, but a 25 per cent. problem. Let us imagine the feral nature of our society if one in four children do not have opportunities in society and have all those terrible risks. This matter is not one of choice or of asking whether we do or do not take action; it is a matter of how fast we seek to act.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.1/8">The policy task is to provide early intervention and to reinvent and relearn effective parenting and child rearing. We also need to spread as standard the best parenting practices that are around. To do that, we must make the best use of the natural&mdash;biological&mdash;gifts that we have, which we are not doing at the moment. For example, we must make best use of the power of relationships and the ability of a mother to transmit empathetic parts of behaviour to a baby&mdash;the ability to care, to understand, to interact and to relate to others. Doing so will act like body-building for the brain. We must focus on the ability of the brain to interact, understand and mirror development, so that youngsters can develop to their fullest potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.1/9">The other biological gift is the brain's malleability, particularly in the early years. Oddly, a graph of expenditure on education would start quite low and build up to a massive amount of expenditure on those who go to university. That direction is obverse to the brain's development and its capacity to move quickly, which is very high in the first three years, but for most of us in this room has now tailed off to a level plateau.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.1/10">Child rearing at home by parents and socially through interaction at school and elsewhere is the bedrock of our society, and we neglect it at our peril. The issue is that important; it is the choice between a healthy or unhealthy society. I could provide examples from education, health or employment, but I will give just one example in relation to crime. I am talking to people in the Home Office and to Ministers in the Cabinet Office and the new Department of Children, Schools and Families about the issue. If empathy can be developed in children, it becomes the greatest inhibitor to crime&mdash;particularly violent crime. If someone is raised with an understanding of how other people feel&mdash;for example, how someone feels if they are hit&mdash;it is a great inhibitor to violent crime. We are creating large numbers of people who do not have that inhibition and who think nothing of using violence to further their ends, whether when they are in the playground at four years old, when stealing a mobile phone from a child when they are a teenager, or in relation to other even worse activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.1/11">Research has been done by George Hosking at the World Alternatives to Violence Trust on helping parents to introduce empathy and interaction and to resolve arguments without violence. We are trying to do that in my city by extending the &quot;social, emotional aspects of learning&quot; programme. If we can develop such qualities in people and, above all, do so early, we will put money in the bank in terms of crime prevention. In effect, ensuring that people act reasonably is the glue of our society, whether that relates to the awful extreme that we heard of yesterday where a family member raped and murdered a two-year-old girl or to the other trivial, superficial end of the spectrum where &quot;I'm not bothered&quot; culture is prevalent in society.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.1/12">We can do better, and to do so makes social and economic sense. The economic sense is an area on which I hope the Government always feel vulnerable. It is useful to demonstrate that early intervention saves masses of public money. Investment made in intensive health visiting and mother care centres before the birth is tiny relative to what it costs to get a youngster on to a drug rehab programme. It costs the taxpayer &pound;250,000 to keep a 16-year-old at a secure unit. However, Place2Be&mdash;a voluntary sector scheme that helps young people under the age of 10 talk about their problems, get their anxieties out and get the help that they need&mdash;costs my city &pound;100,000. We have a choice: &pound;100,000 to put dozens and dozens of young people on the right track or &pound;250,000 to pointlessly bang up a 16-year-old for a year. I know where my money would go.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-03a.178.0" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-03b.178.0" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-03a.178.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="178"  time="009:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070703/halltext/70703h0002.htm#07070329000467">
	<p pid="a.178.0/1">The figures bear out the hon. Gentleman's point. There is a tremendous correlation between the under-achievement that results from poor parenting and people's backgrounds, and criminality. Where people do not learn language skills, they invariably do not learn other skills, so the hon. Gentleman has hit the nail on the head.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/2">One of the problems in getting such a strategic view over to the Government is that they fear the public expenditure consequences. The Government often talk about the 3 or 4 per cent. that we need to help. In a constituency such as mine in Nottingham, North, which is possibly one of the most educationally deprived constituencies in the UK, it is not a 3 or 4 per cent. problem; it is probably a 30 per cent. problem. It is a volume problem; not a small slither problem. To tackle that and put it right, we cannot just have schemes, pilots and little projects&mdash;although, of course, they will pioneer where we need to go. Ultimately, we need a complete reorientation of public services and to move away from the massive expense of failure towards intervening early and inexpensively to ensure that youngsters benefit and reach their full potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/3">The hon. Member for Caernarfon also mentioned long-termism, which has been raised time and again. Whenever I take part in such a debate, I e-mail people locally, let them know what I am doing and ask them whether they have any bright ideas. I have been inundated with responses from people saying, &quot;Please tell them about long-termism. I am fighting now to save my job, which runs out in six months' time. I am getting a little bit of grant from somewhere, am begging money from the lottery and am trying to get some neighbourhood renewal funding to keep this work going&quot;, and, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, that is particularly the case in the voluntary sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/4">In Sweden, there has been a long-term approach, over 50 or 60 years, involving both parties&mdash;there has been an all-party consensus&mdash;which is the answer for us, too. We must do it long term. As the chair of the local strategic partnership, I am looking to create in Nottingham a 20-year prevention package, but I do not know whether there will be a local strategic partnership next April, or whether it will have any money to spend, because the comprehensive spending review has been delayed for so long.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/5">Very briefly, Mr. Olner&mdash;I am conscious of your words earlier&mdash;I shall finish by mentioning three specifics from Sweden. First, on maternity leave and pay, in Sweden a person is allowed 18 months of child-rearing leave, for 13 months of which they are entitled to 80 per cent. of their work salary. That time can be split between the partners. In the UK, maternity leave is for one year. Mothers and mothers-to-be can receive statutory maternity pay for up to 39 weeks, but the employer, not the state, pays 90 per cent. of the individual's average weekly earnings for the first six weeks, and then a mere &pound;112 for the remaining 33 weeks. How would one of us like to raise our children? Clearly, we would choose to do so in the system that allows us those 18 months, to keep body and soul together.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/6">Secondly, prenatal services&mdash;another facet of the Swedish system&mdash;are provided to pregnant mothers who register with a mother care centre, which allows the earliest possible contact, which continues throughout pregnancy, and early intervention for those who need it most. Again, that compares favourably with our own system. In Sweden, everyone is entitled to take time off from work for antenatal classes at their mother care centre, whereas here we need an absolute right for pregnant women to have antenatal classes and care. That should be specified in legislation. It should be a right, and there should be a duty to promote it within primary care trusts and local councils. That is not a matter of middle-class choice; it is essential that we get help to pregnant mums at the earliest possible moment and start them on that trail, so that they can access the necessary assistance as and when they need it. We need a more systematic effort to get to people at the earliest possible moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/7">Finally, I understand that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">the hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> will talk about child care provision. However, we need to ensure also that that is comprehensive. This is the most important aspect of our social policy. We need to learn the lessons from Sweden, which has been doing this for a long time. We need to do the same and ensure that our comprehensive spending review recognises that early intervention is good not just for society, but for our economy as well. If we do that, we will end up reducing the proportion of at-risk children from 10 per cent., but if we do not, we had better be ready to reap the whirlwind that will result if 25 per cent. of our children behave in a way that most of us do not feel is appropriate in a civilised society.</p>

	<p pid="a.179.0/1">I shall calibrate my remarks to the timetable that you set out, Mr. Olner.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/2">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1469" name="Hywel Williams">the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams)</phrase>, who is certainly a friend, for asking for this debate, and I congratulate the Minister, who has long been a champion of better parenting and child care. I am glad that her voice on these matters will now be heard in the Cabinet.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/3">Over the past 10 years, we have made immense progress on parenting and child care, but as everyone acknowledges, we started a long way behind the Scandinavian countries, and we are still catching up. I am sure that the Minister is aware of the situation in Sweden. The focus of the visit made under the auspices of the all-party group on Sweden was on comparing benefits to parents in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the two countries. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> took a very thoughtful and broad approach. I shall try to concentrate more on the details.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/4">The trip was organised by Christina Winroth, Anna Komheden, and others at the British embassy in Stockholm, and it was very helpful in giving us the background to the situation there. I shall go through chronologically the years from nought to six, starting before birth, because Sweden provides for mothers in physically strenuous jobs pregnancy benefits amounting to 80 per cent. of their salary for up to 50 days before the birth. I do not know whether we have an equivalent. When the child is born, the first issue is statutory maternity pay; as my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North said, it applies for 13 months in Sweden at 80 per cent. of salary. In the UK, it is available for nine months, starting at 90 per cent. but falling rather abruptly to &pound;212.75 a week. Sweden's 80 per cent. is not for unlimited salaries, but for those up to &pound;35,000, which still means that mothers can be paid up to &pound;28,250 a year, plus for another three months at &pound;105 a week. For most of the 18 months on statutory leave, therefore, they will receive a reasonable income.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/5">Another issue is what happens to fathers. In Sweden, they are entitled to 10 days on 80 per cent. of pay. I am glad to say that in the UK fathers can now take up to two weeks at &pound;112 a week. In a written answer, however, the Minister told my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North that the then Department for Education and Skills was</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/6" class="indent">&quot;developing a new entitlement for fathers&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-20">20 June 2007</phrase>; Vol. 461, c. 1875W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/7">I look forward to hearing about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/8">Probably the most important issue is statutory maternity leave, which is for up to 18 months in Sweden and is now 12 months in the UK, although before April, it was dependent on being with an employer for six months. I am glad that that condition has now been dropped. Another issue is whether a father can take parental leave. As I understand it, in Sweden, parental benefit can be taken by either parent, but the other parent must take at least two months. A single mother can take 13 months, but any other parent can take a maximum of 11 months, with the other parent having to take the other two. In the UK, however&mdash;I hope to be corrected if am wrong&mdash;parental leave is an individual right and cannot be transferred between parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/9">Another issue is whether a parent has to take the whole parental leave period in one stretch. In Sweden, it can be taken at the full rate for one year, at a half rate for two years, a quarter rate for four years or even at an eighth rate for eight years. Given that the leave has to be taken by the time that the child is eight, it is possible for parents to take the whole of the period off, electing to draw their parental benefit at a much lower level. More commonly, it is taken in bits, in the form of a shorter working week or working day&mdash;a six-hour day, for instance&mdash;at any time up to the child's ninth birthday. It is true that most parents take it in the first year, but many stretch it out over two or three. Some hold it back until later. Typically, Swedish parents take a two-month summer holiday when the child is four, five and six, using up their parental leave.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/10">Another issue is what to do when a child is sick. Often that is overlooked, but it is very important for parents of young children. In Sweden, if a child is sick, the parents want to take a child to the doctor or the child minder is sick, up to 120 days&mdash;roughly 17 weeks&mdash;of temporary parental benefit can be taken. That extends to when the child is 12. During such periods, the parent gets 80 per cent. of their salary, up to a lower ceiling of &pound;22,000, which still is much more than in this country. As I understand it, in the UK, we get up to 13 weeks of unpaid parental leave to take care of a child, but only until that child is five.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/11">There is a question about the age at which a parent can enrol their child in a nursery school. In Sweden, it is a legal entitlement to take children from the age of one. However, most local authorities refuse to take children before the age of one; that happens very often in this country. However, nursery provision is almost universal by the ages of four and five; 96 per cent. of Swedish children are in nurseries at that age.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/12">How much do people pay for nursery provision? Again, the comparison is interesting. Nursery school fees are much lower in Sweden than in this country. They are related to income. People pay 3 per cent. of their income for the first child, 2 per cent. for the second and 1 per cent. for the third, but all that is subject to the incredibly low maximum charge of &pound;92 a month, or &pound;23 a week. Many people in my constituency pay more than &pound;200 a week for one child&mdash;nearly 10 times the Swedish figure. Furthermore, the maximum charge for a second child is only &pound;15 a week; for a third child it is &pound;8 a week; and a fourth, fifth or sixth child goes to nursery free.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/13">The Social Democrats fought the last election in Sweden on a platform that included a promise to reduce the maximum charge from &pound;23 to &pound;17.50, which seems almost like never-never land to us&mdash;we would be happy with either sum. The Social Democrats lost the election and the charge remains at &pound;23, but either way it is much lower than ours.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/14">In the United Kingdom, as I am sure hon. Members know, the maximum available help with child care costs has gone up enormously in the past two years. People on working tax credit can now claim 80 per cent. of nursery costs up to &pound;175 a week. That increase was introduced explicitly to help families in constituencies such as mine in London, where nursery charges can be extremely high. In the 10 years since 1997, there has been a fifteenfold increase in help with nursery charges, but many parents in my constituency still feel that they cannot afford to have their children looked after.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/15">In Sweden, nursery places are so heavily subsidised that the average parent pays only 8 per cent. of the true cost. That has a clear implication for the system of taxation, which has to be much higher than in other places, but it means that no parent feels that they cannot afford to put their child in a nursery. In this country, even a couple with two children on maximum support will pay 16 per cent. of the true cost. That is the case even with the combined effect of the child care element and free nursery places.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/16">Another big difference is that, at the age of three, children in this country qualify for 12.5 hours of free nursery provision, whereas in Sweden it is 15 hours&mdash;which we will soon go to&mdash;but only for four and five-year-olds. In the UK, children start nursery school at three and have to go to primary school at five, although sadly many local authorities start them at four. Sadly, many children&mdash;I speak as someone who has been the governor of a nursery school for the past 20 years&mdash;stay in nursery school for only a year or even two terms because they are starting school, in some cases only a few days after their fourth birthday.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/17">In England, many people think that the earlier a child starts school, the better that child will do, but the truth is the complete reverse. In all Scandinavian countries, children learn through play and discovery until they start primary school, and the legal age for primary school is seven, although in practice most start at six. Children in those countries spend four or five years in nursery education learning through play and do not start formal education until they are seven, yet all four Scandinavian countries are in the top 10 for reading standards. Studies by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have shown that six-year-olds in England are ahead of their contemporaries in Finland in relation to the three R's&mdash;they can read, count and all the rest of it better than Finnish children&mdash;but by the time those children are 15, the Finns are at the top of the league, far ahead of British children. As a nursery governor, I have spent a long time campaigning, along with the Early Childhood Forum and others, on the importance of extending nursery education further into school careers.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/18">There is a tale of underachievement in this country and it is no coincidence, in my view, that that underachievement is found among precisely those two groups that, for developmental reasons, do not take well to an early start to formal education&mdash;that is, boys generally and children from deprived backgrounds. The fundamental issue is that we need to help children to spend time with their parents and with other children. If we want children to have a better childhood, the first step is to give parents a better parenthood. If we give them a better parenthood, we create the right conditions for a better childhood, and a better childhood will, in time, lead to a better parenthood.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-03a.185.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1896" speakername="Anne McIntosh" colnum="185"  time="010:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070703/halltext/70703h0003.htm#07070329000476">
	<p pid="a.185.2/1">The Minister is in a very weak position, because she and her Department do not actually know where the money is going. I do not think that any hon. Member in the room disputes the fact that a large amount of money&mdash;&pound;3 billion a year&mdash;is going into early years provision, and she said that there was an extra &pound;3 billion for the Sure Start programme. However, in her reply to me of <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-14">14 June</phrase>, we learn that the Government do not actually know where the money is going. People say that imitation is the greatest form of flattery. It is odd and very gratifying that, after I had sent out a questionnaire on behalf of the Conservatives, the Government should send out an almost identical one to exactly the same people.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/2">Yesterday, I chaired a meeting of private, voluntary and independent providers, and I should be very happy if the right hon. Lady would join me&mdash;she has been invited several times&mdash;in meeting a delegation. If she would respond to the invitation, we could take the matter forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/3">I was very taken by the remarks about parenting made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase>. It is something that we take for granted&mdash;that parenting has cascaded down the generations. I am concerned about what happens when children are seen to be misbehaving. The hon. Gentleman's idea of early intervention is positive and timely. With &quot;Breakdown Britain&quot;, we have seen that families are breaking up, perhaps fewer couples than before are marrying and there are more multiple relationships and more children coming from disjointed relationships. We are considering that aspect of the matter carefully. We would be doing the present generation of children a great service if we could intervene through schools, police and parents when children truant, and perhaps put less emphasis on putting them in custody. I think that the right hon. Lady will confirm that there are now more children in custody than there were 10 or 15 years ago. In that regard, prison orders have cut down on education, but that is a matter for a separate debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/4">As for parenting, obviously two parents are better than one. We would like greater access to fathers, with greater involvement and more shared parenting, but, for children who are not living in their natural home, will the Government recognise that children will flourish through access to the wider family? I am taken by the fact that, in this country, one in every 100 children lives with a grandparent. That is an average of 2.4 children in every primary school. Denmark has run with the idea of grandparenting, and in two municipalities, funding is received from the Ministry of the Family&mdash;the matter has also been allocated to the relevant consumer organisation&mdash;for the creation of a network of substitute grandparents when there are no real ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/5">We&mdash;and I expect the Minister, too&mdash;have received strong representations to the effect that children in care, and children at risk of a breakdown in a relationship and the possibility of entering the protection of the state, benefit from access to their wider family, such as grandparents, older siblings, aunts and uncles. I wonder what plans the Government have to consider the role of family conferencing.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/6">Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase>, we are concerned that, although the original concept of Sure Start children's centres was inherently good, we have heard from the National Audit Office that, of 30 centres that were visited, only nine were reaching out to the families most in need. Furthermore, it was never, in my understanding, intended that Sure Start children's centres would compete in the same neighbourhoods as existing private and voluntary nursery providers. That is the nub of the representations that are being received by hon. Members who have excellent private nurseries in their constituencies. We know that Sure Start children's centres are offering good quality early learning, combined with full care provision for children, for a minimum of 10 hours a day, five days a week, 48 weeks a year. Does the Minister accept that that is forcing some private nurseries to look carefully at their books?</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/7">I am delighted that the Minister is looking to local authorities and introducing the questionnaire that has been mentioned. Will she make the results available to hon. Members through the Library? In response to my question last week, at the Question Time of her previous Department, she replied to National Audit Office criticisms:</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/8" class="indent">&quot;We have made it clear in subsequent guidance that outreach must remain a fundamental element of the children's centre programme&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-28">28 June 2007</phrase>; Vol. 462, c. 467.]</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/9">Where is that guidance? Is it in publishable form, and can we have access to it? Many people are asking for it. Will the Minister confirm that she accepts a mixed economy provision and that no Government could roll out the child care programme that we would all like without input from private and voluntary associations? Will she also attend to the issue of strengthening the family? The family is the institution that, first and foremost, contributes to good behaviour, morals and manners.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/10">I want to conclude by referring to the emphasis on emotional well-being and social mobility in the responses to a YouGov poll commissioned by the children's charity NHC, which included the finding that</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/11" class="indent">&quot;adults were of the view that emotional wellbeing is twice as important as social class in their own social mobility; and that emotional wellbeing is seen as more important than family income, physical health and IQ.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/12">We therefore welcome the role of the family in providing the most natural form of child care, but we also want an enhanced role for the extended family.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-03a.187.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1849" speakername="Beverley Hughes" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for Children, Schools and Families"  colnum="187"  time="010:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070703/halltext/70703h0003.htm#07070329000477">
	<p pid="a.187.0/1">This has been an excellent debate. I congratulate those who sought such a debate, because it is a welcome opportunity for me to air important issues with hon. Members who are as passionate about them as I am. I hope that hon. Members will agree that there has never been such a strong spotlight on children and young people at the heart of Government policy as in the past 10 years. I welcome the support that hon. Members from all parties have given to that approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/2">It is important to understand the reasons for what we have done. It is a not just good thing to support children and families: doing so must be at the heart of the social and economic priorities for any progressive Government, in relation to the social objectives of reducing child poverty and inequality and ensuring that every child reaches their potential and to the economic objectives of ensuring that we can call on the talents of all our people, so that our economy will be well placed and so that families prosper. In addition, it is the job of a progressive Government to give strong support to families. They are the engine of our economy and the place where the next generation is raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/3">I am very pleased at hon. Members' comments about the restructuring of the Department in the recent governmental changes and its renaming, which deliberately puts children firmly first, as was noted by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase>. We all welcome that. Several hon. Members make the point, with which I entirely agree, that the way in which we support parents is critical. For Government, it is important always to stay on the right side of the line, by which I mean that we do not tell parents what to do. We should never diminish what ultimately must be parents' responsibility for their children. However, we have the job of providing the widest possible support for parents and making sure that, routinely, our big public services&mdash;health services, schools and children's services&mdash;see it as a core part of their job to involve parents closely in what is being provided for their children.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/4">Clearly, the trip to Sweden had a big impact on hon. Members, and to judge from their comments today, it influenced what further progress they would like here. There is no doubt that the investment in and commitment to children and young people in Sweden is a major reason for its deserved reputation as one of the most equal and mobile societies in the world. That is where we, too, are coming from, and why we want to invest in children and young people. However, I am grateful to hon. Members for their recognition that Sweden's achievement did not happen overnight. It took about 150 years. The first creche was opened, I am told, in 1854, and since then there has been investment on a huge scale over a long period.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/5">It is also salutary, in making the comparison with Sweden, to recall the starting point in this country in 1997, when there was little support for families. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> mentioned that. Paid maternity leave was just 14 weeks, and there was no paternity leave. There was no right to flexible working, no right to time off for domestic emergencies and no help whatever for adoptive parents. Provision for young children was very limited, patchy and unco-ordinated and there were no children's centres. There was no minimum wage, no protection against discrimination for part-time workers and single mothers were vilified. My first child was born in 1979, and my third in 1984, so my children grew up in that period, and I know from personal experience how difficult it was then for both parents to manage their work and bring up their children together.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/6">It is important to recognise how things have changed in a relatively short time compared with Sweden&mdash;we are learning from progress there&mdash;because of the huge investment that we have made. We are building many positive elements of the Swedish system into the changes that we have made, such as providing, for the first time, free nursery and early education for all three and four-year olds. At the moment, there is an entitlement to 12 and a half h<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">ours, but that will, as my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> said, increase to 15 hours and, we hope, beyond. Those changes have increased almost threefold the number of three-year-olds who access such places from 34 per cent. to 96 per cent. We are now piloting free child care and early education for two-year-olds, particularly to disadvantaged two-year-olds, because we know that that is how we can make the biggest difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/7">We are doubling the number of available child care places and are providing &pound;3 million a day to make child care more affordable through the tax credit system. There has been more than &pound;21 billion of investment over that period to establish an apparatus and level of service for children, particularly young children, and their families that was not there before.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.0/1">I do not think that we dispute the figures, but it is difficult, because there is no transparency to allow providers to see where that money has gone. The Minister must accept that local authorities take different amounts for administration. When the Conservatives left government, our nursery voucher was quite popular. It was a little bit more difficult to apply, administratively, but it was more transparent. How does she plan to introduce transparency, so that providers can see that there is a level playing field between different local authorities, as well as absolute transparency and accountability in the financing?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-03a.193.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1712" speakername="Dai Havard" colnum="193"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070703/halltext/70703h0004.htm#07070329000488">
	<p pid="a.193.0/1">This is part of a broader discussion of issues, be they PFI contracts for physical buildings or the price regimes that my hon. Friend mentioned. We need to assess what constitutes long-term value as opposed to short-term price. In terms of how we deal with medications and drugs, I agree that similar issues need to be carefully monitored. In such areas, proper controls and transparency are needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/2">One of the first things that I discovered in respect of this process was the lack of transparency. We started to get some of that through NICE in terms of evaluations of particular medical procedures, drugs and so on. That is becoming inconsistent. If we are to have the sensible debate about the rationing process in the NHS that is necessary, all those elements must be included. Today, I must concentrate on this particular issue, because otherwise you would discipline me, Mr. Olner. This is illustrative of a broader discussion that we need to have.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/3">I examined what was said about what the controls and transparency would be in this new process and what the architecture would be to achieve those things. There is a hangover from the privatisation of the original system. I might get some of the titles wrong, because the NHS is like the British Army, in that everything involves initials.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/4">The Purchasing and Supply Agency has a residual remit in relation to all this. I understand that its role was to set up procurement hubs, on a seemingly largely English regional basis, and to set up the Centre for Evidence-based Purchasing, which will be a central element in all this, and to examine compliance to some degree. From what I can see, that means compliance in the NHS or some way of finding a method of consensus, but it is not compliance in its general sense. One of the major elements of the body's intended role is to help to establish the Centre for Evidence-based Purchasing, which relates to evidence-based medicine. Apparently, that is supposed to establish what are described as nationally agreed protocols.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/5">That sounds all very well, but I thought that I would test the health and efficiency of it. The trouble that I have is that even if all those things were in place, what would the status of the protocols be, how would they come about and who would be involved in them? I understand that there are to be 12 dedicated evaluation centres in trusts and universities. Descriptively, it all sounds nice, but when the practice is examined, it starts to fall down. In order to achieve all those things, product councils are to be established. I asked further questions about that. Who will be involved? What will their deliberations be? What will the transparency be? The answer came back, &quot;There won't be any.&quot; These will not be open processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/6">The Medical Technology Group met Roger West, the procurement director of the NHS supply chain, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-27">27 June</phrase>. He talked about all these things. He said that these bodies will be set up, but their composition will not be public. There may be additional product taskforces. He was unable to give any more information about that. There are seemingly no mechanisms to consult either with patient groups or with clinicians.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/7">I am unclear about the situation. What seems to be being said to me is that patients and patient groups will in some way be represented by clinicians through the collaborative hubs or in the product councils. I examined how the product councils are to be set up. People could not really tell me how they are to be set up, but I have now seen the advert for the first one, which relates to nursing. That one is important to me, because it is where wound care and training comes in.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/8">I am told that the trusts will in some way be represented by the individual nurses who will be appointed through a system of self-nomination. Who will choose them? They will be chosen by the NHS supply chain. The NHS supply chain is DHL. I am not quite sure about that. The company running the contract seems to be choosing the people who are going to be on the product councils to do the evaluation of the evidence-based medicine. That did not appear to be a healthy, open or transparent process, so I continued my investigations.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-03a.194.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1712" speakername="Dai Havard" colnum="194"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070703/halltext/70703h0004.htm#07070329000490">
	<p pid="a.194.1/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman in that respect. One of the big issues that concerns me is the stifling of innovation. The new structure's very aims include promoting innovation. It is also meant to promote the involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises&mdash;SMEs, to use the jargon&mdash;in supplying the NHS, yet what I see is a process that seems to exclude more people than it will include. There will be a smaller number of larger fixed-term contracts. There is huge tension between fixed-term contracts and opportunities for innovation as well as for involving SMEs. I shall address those questions a bit further later.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/2">There is also the question of what is meant by the evaluations. I fail to understand how self-nominated people chosen by the company can represent NHS institutions such as trusts. That is unfair to the individuals chosen, who will be motivated by good reasons, such as wanting to make a contribution to the evidence-based process and to innovation. What will they be asked to evaluate? How will they evaluate it?</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/3">They will be asked to evaluate on the basis of this driver&mdash;whether it costs less. That is what they will really be asked to do. The description says that they will do a lot more than that, taking into account all the various considerations, including the non-financial aspects of any evaluation required. However, my difficulty is that that will be done, one way or another, by the company, using the product councils and liaising with the Centre for Evidence-based Purchasing. What are their formal relationships? How will the guidance, and the remit that we decided elsewhere in terms of clinically-based evaluations, figure in that?</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/4">I am told that all the non-financial aspects&mdash;quality of care, and issues such as assessing whether a treatment will save nursing time or keep people from having to go back to hospital again and again&mdash;can of course be overridden. The problem is that I am being told that the process of NICE guidance&mdash;a whole different architecture that we established for the very good reason that we needed to evaluate new and existing processes properly&mdash;will still run alongside that programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/5">I am told that once NICE decides that a treatment is safe and efficient&mdash;that includes both the health aspect and cost-effectiveness&mdash;it will accredit it and clinicians will want to prescribe it. However, another architecture will now evaluate it again to decide whether the NHS will buy it. The guidelines from NICE will be only guidelines. They will not run the structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/6">I am told that as far as NHS commissioning authorities are concerned, the money should follow the argument. If the treatment is agreed by NICE and prescribed by a doctor, the patient should get it, and it should be paid for. Well, they will order it, and the authorities will say, &quot;We're not going to buy it,&quot; because they will be able to override NICE. There will be no obligation for the authorities to have any consistent relationship to NICE advice, because it is only a guideline and the authorities' remit will be to consider only price. To be polite about it, other factors seem extremely incidental. The NICE technology appraisals&mdash;this will not apply just to drugs&mdash;can be overridden.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/7">How such non-governmental bodies will be established and run is crucial, as is their interrelationship. Ultimately, they might delay the introduction of good things. They might not destroy innovation, but they will not exactly stimulate or facilitate it. Maybe some people will get the right treatment, but they will get it later. Frankly, that is not good enough. It is inimical to the whole attempt to drive greater efficiency in the NHS. When the Prime Minister says to me, &quot;I want ideas about how to do it,&quot; I will say to him, &quot;One of the ideas that you have established in England is potentially deficient&mdash;this one. It needs re-examining.&quot; The Minister needs to establish some sort of ombudsman for that process in England. That is just a bit of advice from a boy from the valleys, but he ought to take it. It will have incidental effects on me, but it will also have direct effects on him.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/8">I have some quotes on the matter from industry representatives who have written to me. The company Bardex says:</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/9" class="indent">&quot;There is still a large gap between the aspirations of DH procurement policy and their practical delivery.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/10">That is nice and diplomatic. In particular,</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/11" class="indent">&quot;there is a continuing failure to distinguish between cheapest price and best value&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/12">I think that that is at the guts of the whole issue&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/13" class="indent">&quot;in the devices sector and prevarication about innovation resulting in slow uptake of new technology.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/14">Sir Christopher O'Donnell is apparently the retiring chief executive of Smith and Nephew and a man who has been running a large company in the sector. He has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/15" class="indent">&quot;the company's investment is now going into America, Germany and Japan&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/16">Why? Because</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/17" class="indent">&quot;the NHS is a slow adopter of innovation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/18">The new structure will only stimulate that.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/19">Another industry source says:</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/20" class="indent">&quot;Manufacturers have been forced to make drastic price cuts in order to be listed suppliers. As a result, valuable back up training and support which was previously provided free of charge has, in many cases, been withdrawn.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/21">That is crucial. When things are bought, they do not just come in a box. They come with support and training&mdash;training that the NHS cannot and does not offer. Perhaps the issue of how training in the NHS works is a debate for another day. I do not think that we have got it right at the moment. In 2006, ConvaTec, a company in my constituency, trained 10,500 nurses in the new wound care technology. If we are not careful, we will screw the manufacturer on price until he says, &quot;Okay, we'll meet your price by cutting the so-called incidentals.&quot; That will create another cost that we will have to meet in a different way. The Minister should be careful. He might appear to save &pound;1 billion, but he will end up spending not only that &pound;1 billion but a lot more in another way&mdash;the least efficient way.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a point that we all understand. We all have people coming to us saying, &quot;I want the best treatment. There is one available to me, but I have a difficulty in acquiring it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.196.1/2">That is the whole point. That is exactly why we established NICE. That is why we decided to have a process to evaluate treatments. NICE was slow in the products area, and I have had previous debates about that. It was faster in the drugs area than in the technology area, but patients often require both. They do not come in boxes or live their lives in compartments. The NHS may work in its little silos and compartments, but the world does not. The difficulty is how to make a value assessment that gives the true and total value of something, rather than the separate price or cost of an individual item?</p>

	<p pid="a.197.2/1">The hon. Gentleman asks an interesting question, and I do not know the answer. I cannot say whether it is yes or no, because it would be different in different places. That is another aspect. The Minister will say that in England there are GP commissioning processes and so on. Who does the ordering is an interesting question, and the hon. Gentleman may be correct. If a GP orders something, he may get it because it comes through a different process, whereas the same doctor working in the trust might have to order it through the procurement process and might not get it.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/2">NICE was set up to address postcode prescribing and to provide consistency, but not uniformity, in the process with rules that everyone understands and works to, but it seems that the guidelines have no force. Something may be excluded if it is ordered through one process, but may be available through another process, but that does not help us to square the circles relating to different practice and best practice across the piece. It seems that guidelines for specialist medical equipment will not be published, so how will we know what is best? Either there should be a structure&mdash;I would not have started from the present position, but as it exists the Minister should examine it&mdash;to provide consistency and to allow a contribution to the broader discussion, or there will be a contradiction, people will be excluded, and there will be no stimulation to prescribe and develop new products. That is the guts of the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/3">I may be ranging widely, Mr. Olner, but the matter must be seen in context. Either the Government want to reduce the number of suppliers, and to drive down prices, as Tesco does with baked beans, or they want to do something else. Descriptively, it looks very good, but when we drill into the process to see how it functions, it stops looking good.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/4">I received a worrying answer from the previous Minister when I asked how the procurement process will produce long-term savings for patient bed days, nursing time and repeat procedures in the NHS. The answer cometh back:</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/5" class="indent">&quot;The contract...will measure savings based on the reduction to buy price&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-16">16 April 2007</phrase>; Vol. 459, c. 373W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/6">I do not know whether that means, &quot;I don't know&quot; or &quot;It won't&quot;, but I think it probably means &quot;It won't.&quot; It is only part of something that needs to do all those things. Currently, however, it is deficient. That is extremely worrying because it cuts into other processes that we are trying to establish to introduce better practice into the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/7">The process will undervalue something that the NHS has taken for granted&mdash;the training and incidentals that come with contracts&mdash;and England will rue the day. At Currys, one can by cheap products from Taiwan. They come in a box, look similar to other products and will do the job immediately, but there will be no product support or training. The relative quality over time will be worse, and that must be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/8">I have asked the Minister questions, and he should consider value versus price. A decision should not be made nakedly on price. There will be inconsistencies, and I fear the consequences, such as lack of innovation and the effects in my constituency. For the Minister, however, the consequence will be litigation, and if I were a lawyer, I would be licking my lips. We have seen with NICE that when it makes a decision and there is a problem with the application, people resort to law.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/9">There will be inconsistencies. NICE will agree something, someone will try to buy it, but it will not turn up because they will be told that they cannot have it&mdash;the rules do not have to be abided by&mdash;so people will go to law, which is not the best place to resolve such issues.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-03a.199.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="199"  time="011:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070703/halltext/70703h0005.htm#07070329000499">
	<p pid="a.199.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1712" name="Dai Havard">the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Havard)</phrase> on having secured a debate on a very important subject. I must admit that he has put his case extremely well. I welcome the Minister, who must surely have been on a crash course in NHS procurement in the past few days. I hope that his new responsibilities make a pleasant change from landfill and saving the planet.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/2">NHS procurement is an enormous issue. It is not just about supplies but about buildings, staff services, drugs and medicines, and entire treatments. There is a huge volume of business and a huge number of transactions. There is a kind of urban myth that the NHS once spent without regard to anything&mdash;budgets were considered elastic, everything was affordable, the taxpayer was compliant, and success and cost were limited only by mortality and low expectations. According to the myth, the system spent funds without regard to cost. I am sure that such stories about the bad old days abound.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/3">Change in the NHS came when medicine became more successful, when longevity increased, and when expectations rose and the wages of people servicing the NHS rose with them. The ratio between the working population and the ailing population changed for the worse. Procurement then became a live issue, value for money became a big issue, and counting the pennies became an important issue. There has since been a downward pressure on procurement costs in many areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/4">Value for money has not been the only factor at play, however: other variables have contributed. For example, in the case of PFI, which was mentioned earlier, there was a need to keep capital expenditure off the balance sheet. There has been recognition also of the need to sustain a profitable British pharmaceutical industry with a big research base in this country. Furthermore, the NHS needs to retain highly qualified staff and requires cutting-edge equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/5">Not surprisingly, the result is that a variety of procurement solutions has been used in the NHS, depending on whether supplies, staff, buildings, drugs and medicines, or IT were being talked about. However, every NHS cost centre must now deal seriously in some way or another with procurement, and become&mdash;in current jargon&mdash;a smart procurer.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/6">There are across-the-board opportunities in each field. One that I am sure the Minister will mention is e-procurement, which involves the electronic inspection of the supply base. Everybody is now looking also at the possibility of shared services and commissioning. Outside that, every single area of NHS procurement has its own distinctive profile, most of which have been examined in some depth by the Public Accounts Committee, whose reports I have with me&mdash;although now is not the time to read them out.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/7">Supplies were the main thrust of the hon. Gentleman's speech. They cover everything from simple bandaging to complex imaging machines. There has been an essentially two-pronged attack in that area. One approach is to have customer clusters or procurement hubs, as I think they are called, and the other is to have DHL and the NHS supply chain, which is essentially catalogue shopping. Those are traditional solutions that have been used also in local government. The distinctive feature of the NHS variant is that it is linked to a sophisticated delivery network in the form of DHL.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/8">There are serious problems that the hon. Gentleman signposted well. First, the listing must be fair and open; at present there is no certainty that that is the case. Secondly, in whatever way the listing is done, there must at the end of the day remain a variety of suppliers. It is not obvious that that will be an effect of the new system. Some suppliers that are not listed and some of the smaller firms might simply be driven out of business, in which case we shall become dependent on the remaining core of firms.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/9">The system should not stifle local initiative. There must surely be some cases in which people might wish to venture outside the limits of NHS supplies and use a local supplier with whom they have a good relationship. The system should allow also for legitimate clinical discrimination&mdash;that is a genuine concern. If doctors prefer something that is not on the catalogue for which they can make a reasonable case, they should be able to get it. The hon. Gentleman highlighted a further crucial point: the system should allow for fair access to drugs right across the country that does not depend on the contractual arrangements that exist with the main supplier of the hospital or clinic.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/10">None of that can be achieved by concentrating just on the magic figure of &pound;1 billion savings. There is a need to build in safeguards, appeals and genuine transparency, and it is fairly self-evident that the so-called product councils do not currently provide those elements.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/11">There are similar wrinkles that need to be ironed out in other areas of procurement. There are appreciable savings to be made by the NHS on staff services.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.3/1">It is a congenital vice of mine to try to be fair, but whether I should be fair in this case, I shall leave for others to judge. In all honesty, the people who are endeavouring to run the project are receiving the message, because they see the system running into the ground. If they have non-compliant users who are appalled by what is happening, the system will become a catastrophic disaster of immense proportions.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.3/2">In sum, the NHS and every NHS cost centre must mind its costs. They should be, ought to be, and I think are motivated to be smart procurers. However, in the field that the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney laid out, and in all the other fields about which I have spoken, there is a sharp learning curve for individual hospitals, clinics and PCTs, and they have not always been assisted by the Government's advice, so in the situation before us, there will be a substantial and sharp learning curve for the Government, too.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes one of the conclusions that I shall draw later. That is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/2">It is worth noting the magnitude of the difference. The initial Official Journal of the European Communities procurement notice stated that the contract would cover procurement and delivery in respect of goods the value of which, in 2005, was projected to be &pound;715 million. Under the contract as it stands, DHL is managing non-pay spend in the NHS worth an estimated &pound;3.7 billion per annum. An explanation that has been given for the difference, which the Minister will no doubt repeat later, is that the &pound;715 million is the value of goods and services that went through the NHS Logistics Agency in 2005, whereas &pound;3.7 billion is the value of the market in those goods and services in the UK health sector and so marks the possibility of expansion for an enterprising supply chain contractor. Will the Minister now reveal what share of the market DHL has, and what percentage share he expects it to take by the end of the contract?</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/3">A number of concerns were expressed at the time about the involvement of the US company that has already been mentioned, Novation. It was certainly suspicious that it went from being in a consortium with DHL, and was therefore named up front as a prime party to the bid, to being relegated to a contractor when stories arose of the group purchasing organisation inquiries in the United States of America. Have the American investigations into Novation concluded, and have the results been communicated to the British Government, as the issues about the inquiry were communicated to Ministers at the time that the matter was considered? What decisions have been made in the United States and what decisions have our Ministers made as a result of the information that has come their way? If we do not have any news, when will we?</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/4">When will the product councils be established, and when will their terms of reference be published? Obviously, I make that point to reinforce those made by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-27">27 June</phrase> this year, Roger West, the procurement director of the NHS supply chain, stated that the composition of the product councils will not be made public. Why? How can the Minister suggest that that does not impede accountability in procurement decisions, particularly because the lack of transparency&mdash;a theme that has been clear throughout the debate&mdash;does not meet the Nolan principle? Under the new Prime Minister&mdash;never mind the last one&mdash;surely that is something on which a Minister would want to keep an extremely close and careful eye. In &quot;Transforming government procurement&quot;, the Office of Government Commerce states that</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/5" class="indent">&quot;each procurement should have a clear, fair and transparent process and evaluation criteria&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/6">Will that be fulfilled?</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/7">Let me make one more point about a subject that is often prayed in aid&mdash;I would not be surprised if the Minister were receiving a quick note to that effect at this moment&mdash;namely, commercial confidentiality. We are dealing with the private sector, and there must always be commercial confidentiality. The Cabinet does not contain one person with even an ounce of commercial experience&mdash;I do not know whether the Minister has a commercial background&mdash;and, of all the Members in this House, I have done commercial. The Minister knows that; everybody knows that. It has nothing to do with commercial confidentiality. It has to do with accountability and transparency to get a fair price that considers value as much as commoditisation. I fear and suspect that the words &quot;commercial confidentiality&quot; are used as a Harry Potter invisibility cloak to hide Ministers' embarrassment and ineptitude at every opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. The reason why I am sure that there are no commercial confidentiality issues is that it is not commercially sensitive and confidential to expose why someone is most competitive. Above all, someone would certainly not want that to be confidential&mdash;unless they had something to hide that showed that they were not the most competitive and that the system was failing the tax payer and the care of patients, who are the end users.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/2">If the Minister intends to persist in describing all that the NHS supply chain is purchasing for the NHS as commodities&mdash;we have had all sorts of examples, such as syringes and toilet paper, and various things can be thought of as commodities&mdash;what is the remit for a product council? Surely the only question is price, not quality&mdash;other than a minimum assurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/3">If, however, NHS supply chain is to procure unique medical supplies&mdash;perhaps the product that the hon. Gentleman mentioned from his constituency experience&mdash;is there not a role for a body akin to NICE, as was argued earlier, if not NICE itself? What do the product councils add to the cost-benefit mechanisms already available in the NHS?</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/4">The point has been made repeatedly that there are no mechanisms in NHS supply chain to consult patient groups and include their views and needs or those of the public in product councils and taskforce evaluations. Does the Minister support that, or does he regard his new appointment as a grand opportunity to have a jolly good, thorough review to ensure that we do not go down another cul-de-sac? We would thoroughly support him in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/5">In December 2003 the chief medical officer announced the establishment of the rapid review panel to assess new technologies in the fight against hospital-acquired infections. In August 2004 the panel was set up, following criticism of the delay from the National Audit Office. In December 2004 the panel announced its first set of results, including a top-level recommendation 1 for Bardex IC, which was mentioned earlier. Nevertheless, despite a favourable cost-benefit analysis from a departmental economist, the product was not even listed by the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency until September 2005. Two and a half years after the panel's recommendation 1, the net effect has been modest uptake of technology. I am putting that as generously as I can. It is patients who suffer from the delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/6">Will the Minister tell us why NHS supply chain not required to comply with the evaluative decisions of NICE, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the Centre for Evidence-based Purchasing to ensure that clinicians have access to the best equipment and medical technology and that patients are empowered to choose the treatment that benefits them most?</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/7">On savings and benchmarks, the Department of Health has given NHS supply chain a clear remit to make &pound;1 billion of savings in NHS procurement. That is the basis on which its success will be measured, and all of us will be thinking about it. What year-on-year targets has the Department set&mdash;goodness knows, it likes targets&mdash;and what savings has DHL delivered thus far?</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/8">Is the Minister, although new to his brief, in a position to deny the widely held understanding, which I share and which makes sense to me from my commercial experience, that the Department of Health signed up to all this in a rush, just before we all came back, to avoid our being in session? The vast majority of the &pound;1 billion that is promised over a 10-year period is projected to be saved only in the last two to three years of the contract. Who will be accountable? Will the Minister still be in position? His predecessor who made the original claim is not. If Parliament is to have genuine accountability, we need to ensure that we have benchmarks and milestones along the way. Otherwise, it will always be a promise for the future and never delivered.</p>

	<p pid="a.208.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who shows that my speech must at least have a thread of logic to it. The very next words in my prepared script are to ask the Minister whether he agrees that a counterbalance that measures both value and the competitive strength of the market is needed to make savings sustainable, and whether the performance of DHL is being measured in that way. To gain something just in price does not give sustainable supply for the future, nor necessarily best value for patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/2">I shall give an example from way back that we can all remember. When Freddie Laker set up his airline, my goodness it was the cheapest price, but where did he get his pilots? From among those who had been through the expensive of being trained by what was then British Overseas Airways Corporation and British European Airways. They were trained at those companies' expense and then poached by Laker. It was not sustainable, because over time a business owner must fuel the business and reinvest in it. Value requires the recognition that price cannot simply mean the cheapest contribution to the margin at the time of supply; the full lifetime costs must be recognised.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.1/1">The arguments are on the record, and I dare say that such a report will now be considered. It would be a useful and helpful addition to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/2">Perhaps the Minister, fresh from ducking badger problems and dealing with bovine TB in my constituency, could stamp his mark on his new job by being the first Health Minister with whom I deal who is open and transparent, not defensive, and who does not hide behind the false pretence of commercial confidentiality. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-23">23 January</phrase> just this year, Her Majesty's Treasury published &quot;Transforming government procurement&quot;, which explicitly recognises that good procurement is not just about driving down contract costs, but about championing the need for transparent processes that encourage innovation and take account of whole-life value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/3">The major question is around the lack of balance between value and price in the NHS supply chain set-up, which, of course, must be addressed. I hope that the new Minister will do so. I also hope that he has taken many clues from what I hope he will regard as constructive criticisms in this debate and that he takes account of the fact that perhaps a Government without any commercial experience should buy some in to ensure that the interests of NHS patients are properly and truly served.</p>

	<p pid="a.213.2/1">I am afraid that I do not know, but I will find out and let hon. Members, including the hon. Gentleman, know.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.2/2">On product availability, the contract with DHL enables the Department of Health to instruct DHL to list specific products in the catalogue and evaluated products will be made available. On range, because the catalogue will need to expand to achieve targets, more rather than fewer products will be available to the NHS. I hope that that will be of some comfort to my hon. Friend as he mentioned a company in his constituency that manufactures dressings for wound care. The question was asked whether, if a product is not listed in the supply chain catalogue, the NHS would still be able to obtain it. The answer was helpfully given by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase>: yes, people will still be able to obtain it because trusts are not mandated to use DHL and can purchase direct if they chose to do so. The second point is that it will not be in DHL's interest to limit products, as it is driven by volume and growth, so it will work with the NHS to secure what clinicians want and need.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.2/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and the hon. Member for Eddisbury raised the issue of value versus price and whether there is an inherent conflict between a price-driven approach and what real value is considered to be in a health context. We accept that there have generally been problems with public sector procurement in relation to that because it tends to be price focused. That is exactly why we established the health care industry task force, where we have been working with industry to do two things. The first aim is to create a centre for evidence-based purchasing to devise a common definition of value and to assess products from a value perspective, not simply a price perspective. Secondly, we will create a new integrated procurement framework that will ensure that value, rather than price, is properly assessed in the procurement process. Part of that framework is the development of a new benefits framework that will look at broader value issues, rather than simply price.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.2/4">On the relationship between the DHL and the NHS, the DHL must partner trust to deliver the contracted service. It has recognised that clinical engagement is essential to that process. The contract is only nine months old and, as I have mentioned, product councils will build on existing consultation mechanisms, such as the clinical nurse specialist group that already exists.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.0/1">It is perfectly reasonable that we should not expect the Minister to give us definitive answers, but it is, at last, very helpful for us to put these issues in his inbox. Perhaps he would like to reflect on why there was such a rush to get the whole thing going before the product councils were established, whether that was entirely wise and whether there might have been a more useful way to ensure that the process was kicked off in the right way?</p>

He mentioned the process of how the supply chain will involve itself with the NHS, and I will remind him of something that I said that he may have missed. As I understand it, the director of procurement of the supply chain says that he will be under no obligation to take notice of the guidance and technology appraisals of National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence or the recommendations that come from CEP, which is the organisation that he says has been established to do that.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.1/1">It is pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood. Before I start, I would like to welcome the new Minister in what I believe is her first parliamentary outing. I am sure that she will do very well and, hopefully&mdash;from her point of view&mdash;follow in the path of her predecessor's meteoric rise.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/2">The subject of my debate is the funding of public services in Gloucestershire and the comprehensive spending review. My objective is straightforward. A number of the public services in Gloucestershire, ranging through local government, health, policing, education and transport, are funded either directly or indirectly by central Government. Gloucestershire tends to appear at the bottom of funding league tables in most cases. In some cases, one would expect it to be towards the bottom, owing to the nature of the area relative to others, but in some cases one would not. I wanted the opportunity, therefore, to put my constituents' concerns on the record prior to the Government's conclusion of the comprehensive spending review in the autumn, in the hope that they will be addressed, at least in part, and that the disparities between Gloucestershire and other authorities will not get worse, even if we do not expect rapid improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/3">It is not always clear to people locally exactly what the Government spend in particular areas. If the Sustainable Communities Bill, which is currently in another place, gets through Parliament, central Government would be required to make clear how much they spend on local services in each area and, as my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition said, it would</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/4" class="indent">&quot;significantly alter the balance of power in favour of local councils and local communities&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/5">because the amount of money spent by central Government in each area would be much clearer. People would be able to see exactly how much of their tax was coming back to their local area.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/6">Given that that Bill has not passed into law yet, it is difficult to assemble all the data. However, I shall put some figures on the record and hope that the Minister can respond. I shall deal, first, with health, which I know is a matter close to her heart; in her constituency of Burnley, she has been involved in a number of local campaigns, as I have, to save local hospitals, and busloads of her constituents have come down to Westminster to protest about cuts in local services, which indeed has happened in my constituency. As a constituency Member, as well as a member of the Government, she will know how much such matters concern local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/7">Gloucestershire receives about 90 per cent. of the national average for health care funding, which, were we to receive it, would amount to an extra &pound;66 million. Over the last few years, we have been facing cuts in services at community-hospital level&mdash;I am pleased to say that we saved the hospitals at Dilk and Lydney in my constituency&mdash;and currently are trying to fight off cuts to mental health services. In part that is down to deficits and a lack of funding that does not represent properly the health needs in my constituency and Gloucestershire more widely.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/8">In this debate and the comprehensive spending review, I hope that the Government will address the health allocation formula, which divides health spending around the country. One of the reasons that Gloucestershire does rather poorly is that the current formula focuses more on deprivation than on rurality or the age profile of areas. However, I noticed a piece of good news in the constituency health profiles just published: given that, in the Forest of Dean, female life expectancy, as well as that for males, has risen, women now live longer there than in England as a whole. Although those two pieces of news are very welcome, they mean that the population is ageing, and older people use more health care than younger people. The overall prevalence of disease in my constituency and Gloucestershire will rise with that higher age profile, which will push up the cost of health care. The current formula does not represent that adequately, which will give us a problem in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/9">On policing, again, the bulk of funding for our local force, the Gloucestershire constabulary, comes from central Government. This year, the Government grant will give our police force the equivalent of &pound;97 per head of population, whereas across the country, that figure is &pound;122. That difference would equate to an extra &pound;14 million for our county's police. Even if we exclude the large metropolitan forces from that equation, we are still being underfunded to the tune of about &pound;7 million, which means in Gloucestershire that the police authority has had to put up the council tax precept rather higher than the rate of inflation.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/10">Most members of the public in my constituency will remember that, a few years ago, in 2003-04, there was a 51 per cent. rise in the police precept in order to create a large number of detective posts and firearms officers for the level 2 policing that the Government talked about in their review of the attempted mergers of police authorities. That was tackled locally in Gloucestershire. However, that huge increase was driven largely by the lack of funding from the centre. Dr. Timothy Brain, our chief constable, who is also the finance spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers, has been warning, both nationally and locally, that there will be a squeeze on the number of police officers in the coming years as costs rise ahead of Government grants. That will be a particular problem in Gloucestershire because of our relative lack of funding compared with other parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/11">The Conservative county council that gained control in 2005 promised broadly in its manifesto an extra police officer in each electoral division, which is being paid for by the council tax part of the overall council tax, rather than by the police precept. There are now a significant number of officers. In fact, all the increases in the number of police officers since 1997 have been funded, not by central Government, but either by the county council or the local precepts. We have more police officers, but the credit needs to go to the police authorities and local taxpayers, rather than central Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/12">I shall move on to education. It is extremely well known, in Gloucestershire and elsewhere, that our county is in the F40 group of education authorities, which are the worst funded in the country&mdash;Gloucestershire is the 11th worst funded. Our children get about &pound;315 less per head than the national average, which equates to &pound;25 million over the year, or about &pound;750,000 for a large secondary school. Clearly, governing bodies and head teachers in those schools would see the tremendous difference that they could make, if that funding were applied more evenly.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/13">On transport, there is a small specific issue, of which I gave the Minister prior notice, concerning the changes to taxi licensing in the Road Safety Act 2006, which will lead to higher costs for the county council in providing public transport. In Gloucestershire, there is a great deal of use of private hire vehicles on long-term contracts to transport children to school, particularly those with special educational needs. Drivers working on those long-term contracts used to be exempt from the licensing regime, but that is no longer the case. That will drop a cost straight on to the council that will not be covered by central Government funding. Again, that is just another example of how financial pressures hit constituents in my area and the county as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/14">It would also be helpful if the Minister could address the amount that local government is expected to get. For example, this year, Gloucestershire received an increase in its grant of only 2.7 per cent. when inflation was running at 4.2 per cent. The county council's allocation from central Government is &pound;163 per head, compared with the national average of &pound;170&mdash;a difference of &pound;4 million. If the county council got the national average grant, no rise in council tax would have been needed this year, which would have been very welcome, particularly for pensioners and hard-pressed families who find the council tax a real burden.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/15">The Government's changes to supported borrowing have hit the county council's funding as well. As the Minister will know, supported borrowing is a method whereby councils can borrow money to build and refurbish schools and to repair and develop roads, for example. The Government used to give the council a grant to cover the interest and repayment charges, and the charges therefore did not hit council tax payers. That grant has now been cut on future borrowing, meaning that councils will have to spend less capital, or they can continue borrowing the money but will have to meet the full cost of the interest payments, which will push up council tax, hitting local council tax payers. That is of particular concern to those in the community who have the most difficulty in paying the council tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/16">Despite all those financial pressures, the county council in Gloucestershire should be praised for its efforts in keeping the council tax down. That was the top priority in its 2005 manifesto and it kept the increase down to 3.4 per cent., which was excellent news for those on low incomes and pensioners, but it required a huge focus on efficiency savings, which are obviously easier to achieve in the initial stages and cannot be carried on for ever.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/17">It is worth noting that in the current year the Government have cut the funding for flood protection in the midlands. For the purposes of flood protection, my constituency is in the midlands, although it is in the south-west for all other purposes. Given the events of the past few weeks and the fact that my area and areas like it are very vulnerable to flooding, I hope that when the Treasury is examining flood protection in the future, it will ensure that those short-term cuts&mdash;frankly, they are short-sighted cuts&mdash;do not take place again.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/18">I touched on rurality&mdash;rural areas and the cost of delivering public services in those areas. Few of the funding formulas that are used to dish money out across the country take adequate account of that. Delivering services in a rural area is more expensive due to the costs of transport, a dispersed population and the time, and number of people, needed to deliver the services. That is not reflected adequately in those formulas, particularly for health. It is worth noting that the formulas used by certain devolved nations in the United Kingdom for distributing that money take more account of rurality and the difficulties of delivering services in rural areas than the formulas do in England. Perhaps the UK Government could, on devolved matters such as health and education, more adequately recognise that.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/19">Something that, to be fair, the Conservatives did to some extent when we were in government, but which the present Government have become past masters at, is loading extra responsibilities and costs on to local government and not adequately meeting those through central funding. The admittedly small example of taxi funding was an example nevertheless of a change in legislation leading to a direct cost on local government with no change in local government grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/20">I hope that in the comprehensive spending review the Minister will note the points that I have laid out and that action will be taken on some of the formulas that allocate funding across the whole range of public services. One does not realistically expect them all to be changed hugely overnight, but it would be helpful if the Government said what work they were doing on them, explained the extent to which the rurality of an area&mdash;the difficulty of delivering public services in rural areas&mdash;will be taken into account, and assured us that all the factors that drive cost, such as the age profile of the population, will be better taken into account in the future. If the Minister does that, the people of Gloucestershire and the Forest of Dean will have much more confidence when the Government finally announce their public spending proposals for the next three years when they publish the comprehensive spending review in the autumn.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-03a.224.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1622" speakername="Michael Jabez Foster" colnum="224"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070703/halltext/70703h0009.htm#07070329000544">
	<p pid="a.224.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. It is that which causes me to raise the concern today. Not only were cuts made; hon. Members were not involved in the process, or even told what was going to happen. They learned only after the event. That is what has been so damaging&mdash;it is not just that the amount of cash has been reduced, but that there has been an effect on the well-being of the partnership, and its confidence about what can happen, particularly given the Government's proud record of giving forward funding in all sorts of other areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/2">Examples of what has been done with the funding include the restorative justice scheme for teenagers, which introduces first-time offenders to their victims and takes them on prison visits, highlighting the consequences of their continued actions. Reoffending among those participants has gone down, according to some checks that have been made in my area, to 5 per cent. That is an amazing success story. Another example is the LIFE project, in which fire and rescue personnel, over a five-day course, train offending youngsters in fire-fighting skills, and challenge the reasons for antisocial behaviour. That has proved highly effective in instilling a new sense of personal values.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/3">An aspect of the Safer Hastings partnership's work on the perception of crime has been its innovative approach in providing a network of 11 community televisions in public places across the town, such as McDonald's, Tesco and doctors' surgeries&mdash;you cannot get away from it&mdash;telling residents that life is much better than they might have thought. That innovative approach has been credited with the achievement of a 20 per cent. increase in the number of people who believe that crime is falling. Of course, that figure should be 100 per cent., because crime is falling, but an increase of 20 per cent. is pretty good.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/4">The community television scheme that I mentioned was showcased in the House of Commons exhibition earlier in the year, when my noble Friend Baroness Scotland, who was at the time a Home Office Minister, and is now the Attorney-General, referred to the scheme as an exemplar, and one that she would want to spread wider. It has been so effective that not only has it achieved ministerial approval: Roger Fisher, the former head of the Home Office fear of crime team said that the Home Office currently views community partnership television as an example of best practice as a method of communicating with the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/5">The plaudits for the Safer Hastings partnership and other crime reduction partnerships go on and on. They are a real success story. For example, the Government Office for the south-east communications conference awarded the SHP the award for best new media initiative, as part of the community partnership television scheme. Just recently the partnership achieved international acclaim as a result of its varied programmes, funded by the Government's safer communities fund. Hastings has now been recognised by the Italian Association of Language Consultants as one of the best destinations for foreign students. In fact, later this year, in this very place, the managers of the SHP, David Furness and Mike Fagan, will receive an award from the Italian authorities recognising their success in achieving a safe town. To conclude the list of awards, the SHP has been shortlisted for the Tilley Award, which is a prestigious Home Office award for the most intelligent, courageous and effective approaches to the relevant problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/6">The reason I have told the House all this is because I want hon. Members to appreciate that the Safer Hastings partnership, and the crime reduction partnerships in my hon. Friends' constituencies, have been a huge success in helping to achieve the twin objectives of the Government&mdash;the right objectives of reducing crime and reducing the perception of crime, which is so debilitating. It is in that context that I am bewildered and puzzled to learn of a cut in funding for the current year, 2007-08. It is not a matter of future plans, but of the here and now&mdash;something that happened after the budgets had been fixed. Funding reviews will always need to reassess priorities, but in this case, without any consultation or warning, the funding has been cut after the financial year has begun. I also regret that, as I have mentioned already, Members of Parliament whose constituencies were affected by the cuts were not informed of the decision by the Department. It all came out by rumour; in my case an outraged police inspector called me on the telephone to say, &quot;What is this all about?&quot; Sadly, at the time, I was unable to tell him.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/7">In East Sussex the building safer community's budget has now been cut by &pound;102,000, or 14 per cent., and the Safer Hastings partnership takes its share of that. Having spoken with SHP officials I understand that that means that this year there will be cuts to initiatives targeted at reducing hate crime, domestic abuse and street crime. That is dreadful. Public reassurance initiatives will also suffer, and that could have a hugely detrimental impact on public confidence in our crime reduction programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/8">I am told that the reason for the changes is that the Home Office needs extra money for prisons and the prevention of terrorism. Obviously, those are both important programmes, especially in light of recent events, but there will always be competing demands, and it is short-sighted to address in that way issues that are priorities for people, namely street crime, local crime and local confidence that they are being dealt with. To do so means simply that many of our objectives, such as not having overcrowded prisons, will be lost if we do not also reduce the crime that leads to people being put in prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/9">There might even be a legal impediment to such late notification&mdash;I would welcome the Minister's comments on that&mdash;because the deal was done and the grant was agreed, but then withdrawn. I suspect that that is something for local authorities to consider, but the purpose of this debate is to ask the Home Office to reconsider. The decision was clearly made under the old regime, and I invite my hon. Friend to return to his colleagues, including the new Home Secretary, and ask whether it can be reconsidered. These are relatively small sums of money in the great scheme of things, but the cuts will have an effect on local crime reduction partnerships, both on the programmes that cannot be continued and on the morale of people who will be removed from their posts part-way through the year, after contracts have been entered into.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/10">The Government have made it clear, in their dealings with local authorities, that they will not simply say what next year's budget will be, but will try to give three-year funding projections. They are the first Government who have ever been prepared to do that, and that decision is to be applauded. In contrast, this in-year cut is contrary to all that the Government say is their intention and to what they are doing in all other respects.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/11">I have corresponded with the Treasury team about this matter, and have here a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-03">3 May</phrase> from the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury&mdash;now the Minister of State, Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform&mdash;telling me that the budget for the Home Office between 2005-06 and 2007-08 provided &pound;2.1 billion of extra resources, which is equivalent to an average real-terms growth of 2.7 per cent. for the period, so extra money has been provided. He also said in the letter that the Government's priority is to have a &quot;safe and secure society&quot;, and stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/12" class="indent">&quot;By the end of the current financial year Home Office spending will have risen by 75 per cent. in real terms since 1997&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/13">which is to be applauded.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/14">The Home Office has had reasonable settlements. Of course, it has enormous obligations, but it has the cash to avoid this lurching of cuts part-way through the year. I therefore ask that the in-year cuts be restored and that should changes be necessary in future, we do not adopt the across-the-board approach, but consider what works best. Clearly, the Safer Hastings partnership works well&mdash;I have given examples of its success&mdash;as do the schemes in Milton Keynes and Brighton, but schemes in other areas might work less well. Perhaps some objective assessment should be made as to where, if anywhere, reductions should be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/15">If reductions are made in the constituencies that have been mentioned today, services will be affected. The Minister might say that funding could be filled from other sources or could be dealt with differently, but that is not possible because it is ring fenced, so a reduction in the funding for particular projects means a reduction in those programmes. I regret that it has been necessary to raise this issue, and I am grateful for the opportunity to do so. I hope that the Minister will reassure my colleagues and me that he will reconsider.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-03a.227.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" speakername="Tony McNulty" colnum="227"  time="013:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070703/halltext/70703h0010.htm#07070329000547">
	<p pid="a.227.1/1">In the strictest sense, it was not agreed. It was not until mid-May/June that Home Office contributions to LAA budgets were confirmed. That was quite wrong, and I assure my hon. Friend that that cannot and should not happen again. Previously, from December onwards, any figure about the Home Office contribution to LAAs was indicative, so the notion that the deal was done by December simply is not accurate. I understand why my hon. Friend is frustrated, and I accept, as I had to on a range of other issues last year, that it is not appropriate to wait until after the start of a financial year to wait for confirmation of decisions or subsequent reductions before making such decisions. I shall do all that I can to ensure that that does not happen again.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/2">My hon. Friend will also know that Hastings is within the East Sussex BCU, which received &pound;190,000 from the Home Office for 2007-08, as it has for the past four years. In any partnership, partners bring some of their own funding and resources to the table, and funding streams feed into the Safer Hastings partnership to meet local priorities. I was pleased to hear, for example, that it is being awarded funding from the neighbourhood renewal fund to progress its already considerable efforts in tackling town centre violence and disorder. If my hon. Friend could tell me how he unlocks NRF money, I would be enormously grateful, because my constituency has not received a penny from it in the past 10 years, despite containing significant pockets of deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/3">The overall allocations of the SSCF grant were given to upper-tier areas, including East Sussex, and, given the nature of the pooled pot for LAAs, that allowed areas at that stage to plan their spend. I agree with the core element of my hon. Friend's point: it is unfortunate that the detail of the Home Office element of SSCF allocations came later than usual. I fully understand that that may have caused some local planning difficulties, and the Home Office is committed to ensuring that it is not repeated in future years. The reasons for the delay were complex, but we will learn from this experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/4">Collectively, &pound;10 million accrued to the Home Office in terms of its contribution. Rather like the &pound;27,000 lost in Hastings, that could, in the scheme of things, be conceived as being rather small beer in the Home Office's budget of billions. I take with a gentle pinch of salt the letter that my hon. Friend received from the Treasury saying how wonderfully generous it has been and that everything is fine because it gave 2.7 per cent. None the less, I appreciate and would not deprecate the notion that &pound;27,000 is huge in terms of Hastings's funding. The loss of such a sum would have a potentially significant impact if forewarned and planned for; it would have even more impact if not planned for.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/5">In the scheme of things, &pound;10 million does not help matters much in the Home Office's budget, but I have had to take &pound;10 million from one place, &pound;20 million from another and &pound;10 million from another to get funding for the key priorities at the time&mdash; prisons and the counter-terrorism budget&mdash;and we in Government must take such decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/6">I also take my hon. Friend's point about the notion of using needs-based assessment, rather than universality, if these things are reduced in future. It is no comfort to him, or to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">my hon. Friends the Members for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> and for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper), that they have all been hit by 14 per cent. cuts. The fact that they share the pain does not make it all okay.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/7">My hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye made the fair point that, if we were to recalibrate and lessen the moneys&mdash;I have no intention of doing this&mdash;that the Home Office puts into the LAA and SSCF pots as a matter of policy, it should be done more readily on either a success and performance-reward basis or a needs basis. I am entirely sympathetic to the challenges that the funding reduction causes and to the point that the Home Office elements were determined late and should have been done more readily&mdash;hopefully prior to the start of the financial year&mdash;so that people could have gone about their business.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/8">Hon. Members would expect this, but I should say that we would still expect areas to meet their agreed target on reducing crime and disorder and the harm caused by drugs. I hope for the continuation of the substantive success that has occurred across East Sussex broadly and certainly in Hastings, as my hon. Friend outlined.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/9">It is easy to talk about tough choices, appropriate priorities and targeting resources where they can have the most impact as things flatten out, rather than be reduced more generally, in terms of the Home Office. I am afraid that I cannot give my hon. Friend any satisfaction on restoring those elements that were reduced this year. However, I assure him that whatever the news, good or bad, for SSCF, LAAs, the BCU and all the key Home Office funding elements, it is incumbent on the Home Office to ensure that people know sooner rather than later what budgetary elements are coming from it. Such an approach would allow them to plan accordingly and to sustain&mdash;this is true in the case of Hastings&mdash;the good works that have been done through the partnership.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/10">I applaud not only the commitment, but the innovations, substance and evidence of results of the Safer Hastings partnership. Although I might deprecate and decry the manner of the process, largely because I was involved in it, given that I know what the &pound;10 million is being spent on elsewhere in the Home Office, I would defend the fact that cuts were made. My hon. Friend's anger and frustration at it being mid-May or June&mdash;well after the start of the financial year&mdash;before the funding was finally announced is entirely fair.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/11">I applaud what is happening in Hastings. East Sussex is wedded to the neighbourhood policing model that I see very much as the other part of the equation in terms of what people are achieving in partnerships such as Safer Hastings. I wish my hon. Friend and his colleagues in the partnership well in continuing the process, albeit, however temporarily, handicapped by the late confirmation of Home Office funding, for which I apologise. I shall seek to ensure, through him and my other colleagues, that that will not happen again. I therefore hope that we can maintain the good news and good success in crime and community safety, rather than discussing the unfortunate oversight of presenting the funding after the financial year has started.</p>
