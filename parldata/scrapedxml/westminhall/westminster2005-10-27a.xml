	<p pid="a.141.3/1">I am pleased to be able to open this debate on the Home Affairs Committee report, which was published earlier this year. I am also pleased that there is a good attendance, both by members of the Select Committee and by other Members. I will try to be as brief as I can in introducing the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/2">I am glad that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety is present to reply to the debate. There will be some criticism of Government policy in my comments, but it is intended to be helpful criticism, and no criticism of her role is intended.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/3">We have discussed terrorism a lot in the past few weeks, both in the Select Committee and in the House. In yesterday's debate in the House on the Terrorism Bill, a number of Members, including myself, stressed the importance of the broader strategy that we need to follow to reduce extremism and to tackle terrorism. Today's debate, far from providing us with too much discussion on terrorism, enables us to look at some of the broader issues that go beyond the legislation. This debate is also relevant because although our report was published before the general election, it specifically addressed the links that we need to make between any legislation that we pass and the wider strategy of tackling extremism and terrorism. I will return to that subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/4">The Committee set out about a year ago to look at what effects the rise of international terrorism had had on community relations in this country, and at the same time to try to identify how measures that might be adopted to strengthen community relations and community cohesion could play a role in fighting extremism and terrorism, and in tackling the consequences of world events.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/5">The report was published several months before the London bombing. It gives me no pleasure to stress that point, but the Committee deserves credit for having recognised the importance of these issues&mdash;which are now being debated much more widely in our society&mdash;long before there had been a terrorist attack on United Kingdom soil as part of the current wave of terrorism. When the Committee was preparing the report we attached great importance to certain recommendations and issues, and that stood in contrast to an apparent lack of urgency from the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/6">I am sure the Minister will refer to the big agenda that is now under way, and which tackles many of the issues in the report. We welcome that and look forward to hearing more about it&mdash;and I am sure that the Select Committee will want to discuss it in detail with Ministers in due course. However, the response before the London bombings lacked the urgency that was needed. The Government had not really grasped how central the issues of community relations and community cohesion were to our ability to tackle terrorism. I do not mean by that that there was some magic thing that the Government could have done. It would be ludicrous to say, &quot;If only they'd done this or that, or talked to this group of people, we would not have had the attacks,&quot; but we did not see then the urgency that we see now.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/7">For example, recommendation 14 of the report points out that the Government's own evidence to the Committee's inquiry about terrorism and community relations made no mention of the programme of work on community cohesion that had been launched in the wake of the riots in north-west England in 2001. The Home Office should have seen that as directly relevant; that it did not do so was a disappointment.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/8">In recommendation 36, we said that more needed to be done to support the Muslim community in tackling extremism. The only concrete thing that could be mentioned in the Government's response, which we received a few months after the report, was that</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/9" class="indent">&quot;The Learning and Skills Council worked with Muslim religious leaders to run a pilot management and community leadership course for Muslim faith leaders.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/10">Although I have great respect for the Learning and Skills Council, I am not sure that that amounted to the scale of response and support for Muslim leaders that was needed. We will hear from the Minister that a huge programme is now under way through the commission on integration to deal with these matters, but it should have started earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/11">I will make a couple of further observations. We raised the first with the Home Secretary on Tuesday, and it was also raised through the Liaison Committee of Select Committee Chairmen with the Leader of the House. I am talking about the Home Office's failure to provide our inquiry with accurate and relevant documents when we were examining these matters, particularly its failure to provide a Cabinet Office paper entitled &quot;Young Muslims and Extremism&quot; that was subsequently leaked to the newspapers. We subsequently obtained it.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/12">That is important because there is a marked contrast between the tone of the evidence that the Government submitted to our inquiry and the assessment that was made by officials for the Cabinet. Recommendation 4 of our report concluded that since 2001</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/13" class="indent">&quot;community relations have deteriorated, although the picture is by no means uniform&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/14">The Government's response said:</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/15" class="indent">&quot;The Government has no evidence that terrorism and the response to it has led to an overall deterioration in community relations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/16">Yet the documents we now have clearly show the situation. The Government's assessment of published opinion polls indicated that between 50 and 65 per cent. of Muslims thought that relations between Muslims and non-Muslims had got worse after <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>. Incidentally, that had not been affected by the Iraq war; it was clearly a result of the terrorist events of September 2001. That indicates a serious deterioration in relations, which means that our Committee was right to make the assessment that it did.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.0/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that the situation since the bombings in July has made the problem worse, and that many Muslims feel greatly under threat? That is because of a perceived sense of collective responsibility, which relates to the media and to Government policy because of stop and search powers and proposed powers to close mosques. There is a real sense of fear and of grief among the Muslim community about what has happened.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.3/1">I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. It is true that the violent crime statistics do not necessarily bear out such concerns. The available statistics, some of which have been gathered by community organisations, show, for example, an increase in anti-Semitic attacks that is at least as high as any reported increase in anti-Muslim attacks. The issue is complex.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/2">On a cautionary note, to some extent perception may be subjective, but it can be real. It can colour the way in which people feel that their lives are being lived. We said in the report that we had analysed the data&mdash;last year's data, of course&mdash;on the use of section 44 powers. We did not find evidence to show that they were being used disproportionately to target Asians&mdash;we did not refer to Muslims because the data had not been collected. Those powers are largely used in London, and pretty much in proportion to the London population. However, there is no doubt from the evidence that young Muslims feel that they are being targeted by the use of the powers. That is a substantive political issue. We cannot simply say that they are wrong, and that they will just have to lump it. We will have to deal with it. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but some care needs to be taken about what conclusions we draw from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/3">As for the documents that we did not receive, it was made clear there had been a fairly extensive assessment by the Government, which had not been shared publicly, setting out the reasons why some young people might be drawn into extremism and possibly terrorism. It is a lengthy assessment. I shall not read it all out, but the section on policy issues states:</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/4" class="indent">&quot;It seems that a particularly strong case of disillusionment amongst Muslims including young Muslims is a perceived 'double standard' in the foreign policy of western governments (and often those of Muslim governments), in particular Britain and the US.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/5">It said that there was</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/6" class="indent">&quot;Perceived Western bias in Israel's favour over the Israel/Palestinian conflict&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/7">and continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/8" class="indent">&quot;The perception is that passive 'oppression', as demonstrated in British foreign policy, eg non-action on Kashmir and Chechnya, has given way to 'active oppression'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/9">I shall not go into the merits of those issues, but it is significant that there has been an assessment inside the Government of the factors leading to potential involvement in extremism and terrorism that is different from what they said publicly about the same issues when they were raised in debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/10">The Government might sometimes think that points in their private assessment are difficult, controversial and not to be aired in public&mdash;but if there is a theme running through our report, it is that greater openness, and more open discussion of such difficulties issues, are essential. If some young people are alienated by foreign policy, we should admit it openly and then engage in the ensuing discussion. We do not say that the policy has to be changed, but we should say that it is on the agenda and open for debate. We must not say that it cannot be discussed. This is not only about whether the Committee gets relevant documents, although that is an important procedural point, but about how the Government discuss such matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/11">I have a final moan to make to the Minister. When preparing for today's debate, I tried to get Select Committee members further information about the commission on integration, but was told that the only document that could be made available to the Committee was a September press release. I must tell my right hon. Friend that such a response is not good enough, given the working relationship that Select Committees should have with Government Departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/12">I wish to make a personal point before turning to the report. It is my considered view that we need a dedicated Minister of State to deal with counter-terrorism. I mean no disrespect to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety. I used to resist the idea of having a homeland security Minister on the ground that our resilience structures for dealing with attacks did not need a shake-up or co-ordination. Indeed, the response of the emergency services in London&mdash;they have never been complacent&mdash;show the strength of our existing resilience structures. However, given the scale of the threat that we face, spreading a number of issues&mdash;from the Security Service and certain aspects of foreign policy to the matters that we are debating today&mdash;across a number of Departments makes things quite difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/13">The idea of having a Minister to deal with counter-terrorism was apparently floated in a Cabinet Office or policy unit paper that was leaked at the weekend. If such a post is created, it clearly should not be in the Cabinet Office, which is an elephants' graveyard from which nothing useful emerges. It should be a Home Office position; I hope that the Government will take that idea forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/14">The Committee's report is obviously lengthy, and many Members want to contribute to the debate, so I shall highlight a few points and try not to repeat what I have already said. We found an overall deterioration in community relations, although there were many positive points. We highlighted the fact that it went further than the Muslim community; there had been an increase in anti-Semitic attacks, and the Hindu and Sikh communities felt that their concerns had sometimes been neglected. However, the claim made during our inquiry that organisations based at Neasden Hindu temple were involved in terrorism were not substantiated&mdash;a fact that we recorded in our conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/15">We examined the use of stop and search powers, which is a major problem for the Government's stop and search group. It may be that young Muslims are not being disproportionately stopped using terrorist powers, but they are clearly stopped in large numbers under other stop and search powers, as are other young Asians. The way in which young Muslims perceive those searches is a problem: they perceive that they are being targeted because of terrorism. Whether that is really the case or not, we could not establish, but the Government need to deal with that problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/16">We also considered the role of the media. All media witnesses rejected the claim that the Government manipulated the media agenda in order to exploit or raise public concern over terrorism. However, we were highly critical of much media coverage. Some, perhaps, is obvious. For instance, it is no surprise to have heard that if tabloid newspapers linked asylum, terrorism and Muslims in one phrase or in one article, it would give rise to fear and hatred.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/17">More surprising was the extent of criticism of the broadcast media&mdash;or at least about their impact. Although the broadcast media rarely show the excesses of some of the tabloid press, we were told that apparently straightforward factual accounts of terrorist attacks involving people who claim to be Muslims can and do have a direct effect on community cohesion. That is a real challenge for broadcasters. I do not pretend to know the answers, but it was useful to highlight the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/18">There are areas in which positive action is needed. The agenda set out by the Cantle report on community cohesion in 2001&mdash;particularly with regard to bringing communities together, where people live separate lives&mdash;is as relevant today as in 2001. It is important that the Government should refresh that agenda and give it a new lease of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/19">Local leadership has a critical role. We saw impressive work by some local authorities here and in France and the Netherlands, in bringing communities together. The quality of leadership at local level often impressed the Select Committee more than the leadership of some national organisations&mdash;not necessarily Governments but faith organisations and others. There was much greater dynamism among faith leaders of all faiths at local level than among some of those at national level who came to the Select Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/20">Faith work is important, but inter-faith organisations at local level were patchy in their coverage and often did not reach beyond the small numbers of people who were currently involved with them. The Government cannot force such organisations to come into existence, but national and local government can do much to help. The good practice that we saw in local government was far from standard. Even in the best led areas there is still a struggle to involve the young people who might be most at risk of being drawn into extremism.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/21">By way of a brief aside on the Cantle agenda, I think that the events in Birmingham this weekend, linked to issues entirely other than those that we are discussing today, should reinforce the message for us that when communities in towns and cities appear to live side by side but do not interact successfully, we have a problem on which the Government need to act.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/22">Schools are enormously important, because they are places where a large number of young people from different backgrounds come together. We were worried by what we found out about schools. We commissioned a well-respected organisation called PeaceMaker, which is well known in the north-west, to work with school students and tell us what was happening among young white students and young Muslim students. Many schools were reluctant even to let PeaceMaker in to hold the discussion. I do not want to repeat the evidence, which is in the report, but when discussions did take place, the suspicions, mistrust and prejudice that we found were worrying.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/23">The Government have an important role in providing leadership to schools and giving them the confidence to handle such different discussions in schools. The response to the relevant point in our report was worrying. The Government told us that that was really a matter for schools and local education authorities. I was pleased that when the Home Secretary gave evidence to us on Tuesday he acknowledged that there is a more important role for central Government&mdash;and I hope that the Minister will tell us what is to be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/24">Another aspect of the Cantle report that we have pursued is the importance of a constructive debate about British identity and how it should work in the 21st century. That discussion needs to happen. An anecdote that is not in the Committee's record is about a group of young Muslim school students from the north-west of England who wrote to us towards the end of our inquiry ask if they could come to give evidence. It was far too late to add them to our official group of witnesses, but more than half the Committee turned up to an informal session one day, to hear them speak, and they gave us a wide range of useful insights into their experiences.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/25">It was the week after a young man from Gloucester had been convicted of planning to blow up an aircraft, and we asked the students why on earth a young man, apparently with a reasonably comfortable background and good academic success, should get into that position. With one voice they said, &quot;It's simple; it's about identity.&quot; It is about people who are not confident of who they are in a society where they are perhaps rejected because of their race and where their faith is not accepted, and with which they find it hard to identify, although they do not particularly identify with their parents, or with their parents' or grandparents' country or culture either. Who are they? They could turn, as a minority do&mdash;we say this in the report&mdash;to faith as an identity. Within that, a minority of a minority turn to extreme interpretations.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/26">It seems to the Committee that open discussion is needed, not just about how Muslims feel British, because that will not work, but about how we all, in future, can feel British in a multi-cultural society. The Government&mdash;I was a part of that Government at the time&mdash;missed the opportunity provided by the Cantle report in 2001 to push the debate forward. We now need to do that. That debate has broken out in the pages of the broadsheets and the intellectual political magazines, but to have any meaning, it needs to take place at street, community and local government level.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/27">The Committee thought it important that new legislation should be developed in close consultation with the Muslim community. I am not sure whether that is true of the Terrorism Bill, particularly the first two clauses, which are designed to help us to tackle extremist ideas. It is unclear whether the people in the Muslim community whom we expect to be in the front line of tackling extremist ideas find those clauses helpful. We said that there was a need, in such sensitive areas, to work in close conjunction with the Muslim community&mdash;although of course it is more than a community; it is a series of communities. Will the Minister tell us what endorsement of the proposals has been received from the Muslim community?</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/28">We now know that the Government's assessment of the situation a year ago warned against targeting organisations such as Hizb ut-Tahrir, on the ground that that is not right the way in which to tackle extremism. Why has that assessment changed?</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/29">I conclude on a clear and positive note. That is important, because these reports inevitably concentrate on shortcomings and things that need to be improved. Despite all that I have said about the Government having to do more, the need for greater urgency and being pleased about what the Government are doing now, our clear, unanimous assessment in March and April was that this country has done better, made more extensive preparations and approached the problems much more seriously than others whose representatives we met in France and the Netherlands. In the extent to which they have got to grips with these issues, they are some way behind us. The Government, and other organisations, involved deserve some credit for doing that.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/30">Our report was quoted extensively in the debate on these issues in the Netherlands Parliament a few months ago. We, as a Select Committee, want to continue our interest in these issues. At the end of November we will host a conference of our sister committees across the European Union to discuss the report and share experiences, and we are pleased that the Home Secretary will host the main dinner of the conference.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/31">I understand informally&mdash;this is not confirmed&mdash;that the Austrian presidency is likely to continue focusing on this issue, and that we will again meet our sister select committees in about six months' time to further our discussions. I hope that that will be useful. Although many such issues have to be discussed at Government-to-Government level, I hope that the regular engagement of serious parliamentarians from serious select committees across Europe will help us to share experiences and develop our understanding of how to tackle these important issues.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-27a.151.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1634" speakername="James Clappison" colnum="151"  time="14:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051027/halltext/51027h01.htm#51027h01_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.151.1/1">That is a good point. There are issues in the Muslim community and it is important to engage with all its strands, help it evolve its own strategies in response to such matters and enable as much impetus as possible to come from within the community, rather than its having something that it might not endorse in every respect dictated to it by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/2">Since the publication of our report and the Government's response, we have seen the tragic events of July, which produced a response from the Government in August in the form of the Prime Minister's 12-point plan. The measures that some of us were debating yesterday formed part of the Government's response, but I should like to ask the Minister about some other elements of the Government's 12-point plan that were not covered by the legislation yesterday&mdash;in particular, the Prime Minister's statement of <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-05">5 August</phrase> that the Home Secretary was publishing new grounds for deportation and exclusion. Indeed, that was the point on which the Prime Minister said that the rules of the game were changing. Will the Minister say whether there have been any deportations? I do not believe that there have, but she will correct me if I am wrong. When does she expect deportations to occur as a result of the grounds that the Home Secretary is introducing?</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/3">The Prime Minister also promised to consult on an extension of existing powers to strip citizenship from those who act in a way that is contrary to the interests of this country. What is happening about that? The Prime Minister mentioned the case of Rashid Ramda, and I share the views of the Home Secretary on that. Imagine the outcry in this country if things were the other way round; imagine if one of those responsible for an attack on the London underground went to France and we could not secure his extradition for various reasons. We should feel no less of a sense of urgency or outrage because the victims of the 1995 bombings were French citizens; the issue needs to be addressed. The Prime Minister promised to consult on setting a maximum time limit for future extradition cases, and we hope that that will prevent a case such as that of Rashid Ramda from occurring again. Will the Minister tell us what is happening?</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/4">During the inquiry, I was most struck by the evidence of Gerry Gable, the publisher of <i>Searchlight</i>. He was asked about the links between 9/11, the threat of terrorism, community tensions and the rise in anti-Semitic attacks. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/5" class="indent">&quot;I find this very interesting. If you look at the immediate period after 9/11 . . . there were far fewer incidents involving the Muslim community than any of us expected&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/6">He went on to say that there had, in fact, been a rise in anti-Semitic attacks. Nonetheless, the question of Islamophobia and attacks on the Muslim community is important, and we must be careful to ensure that any such attacks are properly addressed; there are no grounds for complacency. Indeed, one important conclusion in our report is that much more data on attacks should be collected. The Muslim community could draw on the experience of the Jewish community's Community Security Trust and keep a record of attacks, because it is important that we have objective information about them.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/7">Given the lack of information, our judgment is inevitably subjective, but I do not feel that there was an upsurge in Islamophobia after 9/11 or more recent attacks in this country. British public opinion is more sophisticated than it is sometimes given credit for, and people can see that these wicked terrorist attacks are carried out by a very small number of people. The overwhelming majority of this country's citizens distinguish between those people and the rest of the Muslim community, and they feel sympathy towards that community because of that small minority's activities.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-27a.152.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1634" speakername="James Clappison" colnum="152"  time="14:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051027/halltext/51027h01.htm#51027h01_spnew15">
	<p pid="a.152.1/1">Absolutely. My hon. Friend makes an extremely important point, which deserves wide circulation. If Islamophobic attacks are happening they must be dealt with very severely, but I do not feel that that is the general picture. Others may take a different view, but that is my feeling.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/2">However, the Committee heard a lot of evidence in the same vein as that from Mr. Gable about attacks on members of the Jewish community. That included worrying evidence about the problem of anti-Semitism on university campuses. We also heard quite a lot of worrying evidence of problems with anti-Semitism in other European countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/3">Our concerns are reflected in the report's conclusions. In paragraph 9, we express concerns about anti-Semitic incidents on campuses. I welcome the Government's response to that point and the fact that they deplore anti-Semitism on campuses. I ask the Minister to take a personal interest in the initiatives being undertaken by Universities UK, which the Government's response mentions, to ensure that they come to fruition. There is certainly no place for any form of racism or anti-Semitism on our university campuses.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/4">While I am welcoming parts of the Government's response, I warmly welcome their commitment to the continuation of holocaust memorial day, and their recognition that the day reinforces the message that racism and prejudice can have catastrophic consequences, and that there are still important lessons to be learned.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/5">Since our evidence-taking and our report it has, sadly, become evident that the problems that I described are still with us; in fact, more evidence of them has emerged. I have already referred to the Community Security Trust, which, as hon. Members will know, was established by the Jewish community. Today it is a well-respected organisation that gives advice and help to organisations in other communities. Sadly, last year it recorded 532 anti-Semitic incidents; that is a 42 per cent. rise since 2003. When I say &quot;incidents&quot;, I am referring to specific incidents, many of which included violence and damage. The Community Security Trust recorded that of those 532 incidents, 124 showed anti-Israel or anti-Zionist motivation, and 84 showed a far-right motivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/6">In this country there are two strands of anti-Semitism at work, as we have found is also the case in other European countries. One strand draws political inspiration from events in the middle east, and is in many cases fuelled by propaganda emanating from the middle east. The other is a form of anti-Semitism that harks back to the extremism and far-right fascist ideology of the last century. Both of them are to be deplored, and certainly need to be dealt with vigorously; the full force of the law should be applied to them. I am aware of at least three very unpleasant attacks on Jewish cemeteries so far this year in different parts of the country. These problems are still with us, and we still need to address them. There are no grounds for complacency about the tensions and problems that affect any of the communities in Britain today.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/7">I go back to the point on which I started: we should not allow ourselves to become too gloomy or despondent about this subject. There is a lot of vibrancy in this country, and much of it is due to the different cultures in Britain. I understand that while we are debating these issues, Diwali celebrations are taking place in another part of the House. Diwali is an event of great richness, and I draw much pleasure from attending Diwali and other celebrations, which are very colourful, with members of the Hindu community in my constituency. There is a great deal to learn from the Hindu community and others; we can learn from different faiths and cultures. That is a richness on which we can all draw, and which we can all share.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/8">Although there are tensions, this is a tolerant country. We have a strong tradition of religious and cultural tolerance stretching back to at least the 19th century. People in this country enjoy drawing on that rich tradition. Let us hope that it will continue to prevail over the problems of today, as it did over problems that we encountered in the past.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-27a.153.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1900" speakername="David Winnick" colnum="153"  time="15:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051027/halltext/51027h01.htm#51027h01_spnew16">
	<p pid="a.153.0/1">I shall follow up some of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1634" name="James Clappison">the points made by the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison)</phrase> and, like him, I praise the Chairman of the Select Committee, who looks after our proceedings impartially. We are all very pleased about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/2">We Select Committee members make it clear in the report&mdash;and we reiterate it today&mdash;that the overwhelming majority of Muslims in the United Kingdom totally reject terrorism in this country. That is made clear in a number of paragraphs in the report, particularly paragraph 177 on page 48, in which</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/3" class="indent">&quot;We reject any suggestion that Muslims are in some way more likely to turn to terrorism than followers of other religions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/4">As the Chairman of the Committee stated, it is important that anti-terrorist legislation should in no way be seen by the Muslim community as directed against it. Nevertheless, in the report we accept</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/5" class="indent">&quot;that there is a clear perception among all our Muslim witnesses that Muslims are being stigmatised by the operation of the Terrorism Act&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/6">That is undoubtedly extremely harmful to community relations. We go on to say that special efforts should be made by the police and Government to reassure Muslims that they are not being singled out unfairly. Any discrimination against Muslims because they are Muslims would be wrong in itself&mdash;like discrimination against any group&mdash;and counter-productive.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/7">Page 17 of the report, which is about stop and searches, is of interest. We must take into account the different numbers. The number of whites stopped in 2003&ndash;04 was 20,637, the number of blacks stopped was 2,704 and the number of Asians stopped was 3,668. One assumes that Muslims would be the main part of the latter category. Even those figures are not so excessive as to give the impression that Asians, whether Muslims, Hindus or Sikhs, are being stopped in such a way that unfairness is being applied by the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/8">It is interesting to note that a Muslim activist in my borough, if not in my constituency, was quoted recently in the local press as saying that, when he got on a train, he wanted to stay in one piece while travelling and to go home in one piece. My borough has a relatively large Muslim community, although there are more Muslims in the next door constituency. A young schoolgirl of 11 or 12 came up to London for the day with her teacher. It was <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase>. They were near Tavistock square. Fortunately, no harm was done to them. One can imagine the sheer relief, which, as parents, we would all feel, when the daughter came back safe and sound. That illustrates a point that has already been made: the victims of terrorist attacks can include anyone, including Muslims. That should not be forgotten.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/9">When the IRA was bombing Britain, there was a need to ensure that Irish residents were seen not as the enemy but, like the rest of us, as potential victims of the terrorists. A terrible tragedy occurred on <phrase class="date" code="1974-11-21">21 November 1974</phrase> in Birmingham, when 21 people were murdered in two public houses. Half of them were under the age of 25 and among the victims and seriously injured were people of Irish origin. The IRA could not care less. Why should it, given its distorted terrorist point of view?</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/10">Likewise, the small number of Muslim terrorists, who are totally isolated from their own community&mdash;let alone from British society as a whole&mdash;have no concern whether or not the victims are Muslims. Given their totally distorted point of view, they might even say that, if the victim is a good Muslim, they will just go to paradise earlier. That needs to be borne in mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/11">Just as during those 30 years of sustained IRA terrorism it was necessary to prevent, in any way possible, thugs attacking the Irish, so today there is no lesser need to ensure that Muslims are not subjected to attacks by thugs and hooligans. Clearly, that is the responsibility of all of us: the police, the local community and politicians at local and national levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/12">It is also a necessity, as stated in our report, for the Muslim community to ensure that those extremists are weeded out from mosques and community organisations, where they can spread so much harm and poison. That responsibility lies first and foremost, as it must do, with the Muslim community.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/13">The hon. Member for Hertsmere mentioned not only prejudice against Muslims, but anti-Semitism. That is highlighted in our report. I do not want to exaggerate the dangers of anti-Semitism in our country. I do not believe that the level of anti-Semitism is anywhere near what it was in the 1930s. Blackshirts are not marching through the streets of east London, causing mayhem and fear. The situation is different today.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/14">However, it is important to recognise that elements of international terrorism are bound up with anti-Semitism. Before the American journalist Daniel Pearl was murdered in Pakistan&mdash;his head was cut off&mdash;his captors made him say this: &quot;My father is Jewish. My mother is Jewish. I'm Jewish.&quot; Why did his killers force him to say that? The explanation is clear. In their eyes, he was not only an American. To them, the very fact that he was Jewish justified killing him. The poisonous anti-Semitism that led to the life of that American journalist being taken is the same sort of anti-Semitism that it is so important to combat at every opportunity, both in our country and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/15">Although I said that we must be careful not to exaggerate the dangers of anti-Semitism, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the evidence given to us by Gerry Gable, who has for so long been associated with the anti-fascist magazine <i>Searchlight</i>, and by representatives of the Union of Jewish Students showed that, in some places of higher education, such as the Open university, anti-Semitic remarks have been made, and that in certain cases anti-Semitic attacks have taken place.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/16">I again make the point that when I mention anti-Semitism I am not referring to criticism of Israel's policies. No one could be more critical of Israeli policies than I am. Indeed, last year, I initiated a debate on Israel's policies in the occupied territories, and along with colleagues demonstrated my total distaste about what was happening and my solidarity with the Palestinians, who are the victims. Therefore, when I mention anti-Semitism I am not referring to Israel, although those who spread anti-Semitism try to link them.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/17">It is important to recognise that in some institutions of higher education a very small number of extremists among Muslim students are spreading that type of poison. They use every opportunity to encourage anti-Jewish prejudice. The academic authorities have the important responsibility of stamping that out. We expect them to stamp out anti-Muslim sentiments. We are not going to tolerate that and I hope that the academic authorities&mdash;at the university of London or any other such institution&mdash;will not accept any of that either. Likewise, the academic authorities and others must not be complacent about anti-Semitism on their own doorstep, and where it is happening&mdash;they have a responsibility to know about that&mdash;they should take appropriate action.</p>

	<p pid="a.156.0/1">I appreciate the point that my right hon. Friend makes. One should never forget that, where discrimination started, it ended up in the extermination camps. Nobody should be under any illusion: there is a direct connection, and we should learn the lesson of what occurred over 60 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.0/2">Finally, I do not want to involve myself in controversy with the Mayor of London, but we are concerned here with good community relations. I find it difficult to understand how a cleric can come into this country as a visitor, whether or not he is a leading authority in religious matters, and express views that most of us would consider outrageous about Jews, homosexuals, whom he believes should be put to death, and women, saying, for instance, that if a wife does not behave properly one can smack her so long as one does it carefully. How can the Mayor of London, who, let us remember, some 20 years ago when it was not fashionable, particularly on the Conservative Benches, took a courageous stand on behalf of those who were sexually inclined to their own gender and on other issues, go to where such a person is speaking and embrace him warmly as a long-lost friend? How does that contribute to good community relations?</p>

	<p pid="a.156.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is making an important point. However, I would hazard the explanation that the Mayor of London did that because he perceived that the views being expressed by that individual, which I find every bit as abhorrent as does the hon. Member for Walsall, North, were not considered extreme in a large part of the community to which the Mayor wished to appeal, but were perceived to be mainstream. That is a subject that we are sometimes unhappy to talk about openly. I suggest that that is why the Mayor did it. His perception was that cleric was not an extremist, or at least not viewed as one within the community to which he went to preach.</p>

	<p pid="a.156.2/1">That might be the Mayor's view, and he has broadly indicated as much. That does not satisfy me. When we heard evidence recently from the Mayor of London, I tackled him on the issue. I asked him whether, if a rabbi from Israel&mdash;remember that Islam does not have a monopoly on extremism, and that Israel unfortunately has quite a number of rabbis whose views are equally bigoted and, in my view, downright evil, although I hope that they are a small minority&mdash;came to Britain and expressed views about Muslims, homosexuality and other matters that were as repugnant as those that that cleric expressed about Jews, he would warmly embrace such a person. I would hope not.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.2/2">I know what I would say about such a rabbi: I would denounce him at every opportunity, as I would a bigoted leader of any religion. Christianity has its bigots. In the American religious right, there are views that go against sanity so far as I can see. All of us have to be careful and that includes the Mayor of London. It falls to us humble MPs, in carrying out our duties, to ensure that, where community relations are concerned, we do not go overboard and cause antagonism with other community groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.2/3">The report is valuable, as the Chair of the Select Committee has indicated. No doubt we shall revisit the scene. Good community relations are extremely important, so anything that the House of Commons as a whole can do is welcome at a time of acute terrorism. We have only to look out of the window to see how the House is being protected for all of us&mdash;MPs, staff and everybody else. We know the dangers. We know that people committed atrocities on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase> and that, given the opportunity, others would do the same. It is important to ensure, as we did during the IRA terror campaign, that good community relations are upheld at every opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.157.0/1">I am neither an expert on community relations, nor, indeed, a member of the Committee and I am grateful for the opportunity to pursue various thoughts that have been stimulated by the uniformly excellent contributions of those hon. Members who are experts in community relations and members of the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/2">I start, optimistically, with a single rough statistic. There are well over 1 million Muslims in the United Kingdom. Yet as far as I know, the grand total of Muslim individuals who have been involved in terrorism or arrested for activities that were expected to get them involved in terrorism is not yet in more than double figures. That comparison speaks for itself. I entirely agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" name="Sarah Teather">the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather)</phrase> who said, in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1634" name="James Clappison">her first intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison)</phrase>, that those people should be seen not as Muslims per se but as a tiny minority of criminals in the Muslim community.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/3">The problem, however, is not, as the hon. Lady suggested, that members of wider British society tend to characterise those murderous individuals by their Muslim faith. It is that the people who subscribe to those extreme views and carry out the atrocities describe themselves as doing it in the name of Islam. Although they may be lacking in many qualities, they and those who send them on their mission possess in abundance one quality above all&mdash;that of expert propagandists.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/4">Those people do what they do precisely because they know that by operating beyond the bounds of what is acceptable in a free society against a free society they will have a good chance of subverting the pillars of that free society and driving wedges between the different communities that make it up.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/5">Insufficient stress has so far been given in the debate to two ways of tackling the problem. The first I have already mentioned: propaganda. If the people in question are such expert propagandists we need to set up the machinery of counter-propaganda, with the full support and essential co-operation of the leaders of the moderate Muslim community. How is it that young people may be brainwashed into sacrificing their lives in a belief that there is a religious basis for the view that they will be rewarded in the afterlife in some exaggerated way? They hold those views because someone has indoctrinated them.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/6">We need, desperately soon, people from the Muslim community&mdash;religious leaders with impeccable qualifications and immense depth of religious knowledge&mdash;to put forward the true interpretation of their religion, and to undermine the false vision that is given to impressionable young people capable of being indoctrinated.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/7">Secondly, an important factor that has not yet been mentioned is the accessibility of the political process. I am sure that all hon. Members look forward to the day when there will be as many Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members of Parliament who are Muslims as there are Members in those parties who are Roman Catholic.</p>

	<p pid="a.158.2/1">I noted what the hon. Gentleman said. Perhaps that will happen, in time, on both sides. We already have Muslim MPs on my side, although obviously there will be many more. When I first came to the House&mdash;39 years ago, for a different constituency&mdash;there were just two Jewish Members of Parliament. That was simply because it was difficult for anyone who was not white&mdash;and, probably, a Protestant, although there were a few Catholics&mdash;to be selected for a winnable seat, and therefore to sit on the Tory Benches. Now, of course, the situation is totally different. That shows that the Tory party can make progress, but very slowly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-27a.159.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1659" speakername="Ann Cryer" colnum="159"  time="15:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051027/halltext/51027h01.htm#51027h01_spnew30">
	<p pid="a.159.2/1">I know that we are supposed to say nice things, but today I really mean it: we are having an excellent debate and I have learned a great deal from hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber. I apologise to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1900" name="David Winnick">my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick)</phrase> for my departure during his contribution. I assure him that it was essential.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/2">I shall talk about the processes that we are going through with the legislation. The hearings of the Home Affairs Committee and its report, printed in April, before I joined the Committee&mdash;I am a new kid on the block&mdash;have already had an impact on Government thinking and on legislation in the form of the Terrorism Bill, which had its Second Reading last night. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will comment on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/3">I abstained last night because I cannot go along with the view that it is essential for the police to have up to 90 days to hold suspected terrorists before charging them. I shall not rehearse the arguments, as during the Committee stage next week on the Floor of the House, they will all be advanced when the amendments are discussed. However, changes have been made and I appreciate them.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/4">Those changes include a High Court judge rather than a district judge overseeing detention prior to charge. Proposals for the possible closure of mosques appear to have been dropped. They could have caused more problems than they would have solved. When there have been problems with mosques, they have usually arisen because the mosques have been taken over by radical groups not of the neighbourhood. Reinstituting the original mainstream local Muslims might have been more useful than closing the mosques entirely.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/5">Proposals to proscribe the radical Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir&mdash;sometimes described as a political party, sometimes as a cult&mdash;also appear to have been dropped. I welcome that, as its proscription could have created martyrs. Driving it underground would have meant that we could not keep an eye on its activities, and that would have been unfortunate.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/6">I was a little confused about Hizb ut-Tahrir, but last week's <i>Tribune</i>, of all things, described it as</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/7" class="indent">&quot;a cult that believes voting is haram&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/8">I apologise if I pronounced that wrongly; I am trying my best&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/9" class="indent">&quot;an act of disbelief, and that the return of the khalifah&mdash;an Islamic state headed by the caliph, the 'successor' to the prophet Muhammad&mdash;is the only answer to every problem faced by Muslims in the modern world. How can voting be an act of disbelief? Those such as members of Hizb ut-Tahrir, who insist that it is, claim it means participating in a democratic system that upholds the will of man over the will of Allah. For them, Islamic government is 'God's rule' and they reject democracy as 'people's rule'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/10">I must give credit for that piece. It was written by a Muslim called Murad Qureshi. I thank him for explaining why Hizb ut-Tahrir recommends to its members that it is unIslamic to vote. That is extremely unhelpful, especially in towns such as my own where 20 per cent. of the community is Muslim.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/11">To dispel any myth that all young Muslims are members of Hizb ut-Tharir, I will quote from a document that I received from a young man. He did not tell me his name or where he lived, so I have been unable to respond to it. He wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/12" class="indent">&quot;I am afraid in most cases the community leaders&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/13">he is talking about Muslim communities, of course&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/14" class="indent">&quot;do not have any influence over the youth due to them having such different points of view. In a town in West Yorkshire (Keighley) the local M.P. has raised the issue of forced arranged marriages. She has been condemned by some of the community elders, but has been applauded by the Muslim youth for standing forward and addressing the issue. So I believe it would be wrong for people to assume that they can communicate with Muslim youths through the community elders.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/15">That has long been my belief and it is, I think, where many Labour-controlled local authorities have gone wrong. They felt that they just needed to pick up the phone, ring a few known leaders and that was their contact with the community. It has been wrong all along and I hope that will start to change. We are now gaining another view of how our Muslim communities operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/16">Since we seem to have plenty of time, I will mention a number of things that happened to me in the recess from which I learnt a great deal about Hizb ut-Tahrir, young Muslims and, to some extent, my female constituents who are Muslim, although I already knew a great deal about them.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/17">At the beginning of the recess I was invited to the Leeds BBC studio, where I seem to spend a lot of time. I was doing a down the line interview and phone-in with the BBC Asian Network. When I arrived, a young man was sitting in the waiting area. He made himself known to me and said that he was one of my constituents. He was a very pleasant young man. He told me about the problems that he was having with neighbours dumping rubbish behind his house, and I said that I would help him as his MP. We then went into the studio and the interview started.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/18">The young lady who was the anchorperson in London&mdash;I believe that she was Hindu, although I am not sure&mdash;and managed the whole discussion asked that young man, who, although a little vague, seemed sympathetic to Hizb ut-Tahrir, whether it was true that in universities they bully women from their religion about their method of dress. He said, &quot;Oh no, we don't bully them. We explain to them what will happen to them in the afterlife if they continue to dress inappropriately.&quot; Even I was stuck for words. My jaw dropped and I did not know what to say to him or the anchorperson. That explains the attitudes that are prevalent in some of our universities.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/19">I went to another university&mdash;I will not mention its name, as I do not want to damage it. I was told that, during the previous Ramadan, members of Hizb ut-Tahrir went into the canteen and were forthright in condemning young Muslims who were eating there because they should have been fasting. Eventually, the university's security people had to be brought in to move them on. It was explained to the group's members that it was up to each Muslim to determine whether he or she fasted during Ramadan and that it was not up to that clique to tell them how to conduct themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/20">When I went to the university a few weeks ago, I was told that Hizb ut-Tahrir has taken over the Islamic society and was preparing to take over the students union. I am not sure what has happened about the students union, but I hope that it has not been taken over. Such events are really sad, because it is the hundreds of mainstream Muslims at the university&mdash;good, intelligent young men and women&mdash;who should be the guiding force in our communities. They have the correct ideas, they are enlightened and they are terrific people.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/21">I do not regard members of Hizb ut-Tahrir as fluffy bunnies or as nice, but I am still quite pleased that the organisation was not proscribed. That would have been the wrong the direction to go in, because it would have made them martyrs.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-27a.165.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" speakername="David Lidington" colnum="165"  time="15:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051027/halltext/51027h01.htm#51027h01_spnew39">
	<p pid="a.165.3/1">The hon. Lady obviously knows her area in a way that I do not. The answer to the dilemma that she poses will be in liberating parents either to find places at the schools to which they wish to send their children or to take the initiative to commission a new type of school that will provide the education that they seek. I understood that that lay behind much of the policy announced by the Government in yesterday's White Paper. We shall have to see whether it is delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.3/2">The hon. Lady performed a service to the country by the way in which she highlighted the importance of language and the importance of the role of women from the Muslim communities. Such issues are desperately sensitive. There is a real problem when children are held back. It is the last thing that the parents intend, but children might be held back because one parent has come from the subcontinent. The mother may go straight into a tradition of purdah. The language at home may not be English. In those circumstances, cultural isolation will be reinforced in a new generation. There might be tension between the pressure that the children come up against at school from their peer group and the mores that they are expected to adopt at home.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.3/3">As politicians, we should not be in the business of telling people how they should organise their marriages and private lives, but the Government must deal with certain issues, such as whether some proficiency in the English language should be required at the point of entry clearance rather than only at the point of naturalisation for citizenship.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.3/4">I shall not labour the point about foreign policy, but it is completely reasonable for a Minister from any party to say that the Government hear what foreign policy a particular group in Britain wants, but judge that, in the wider national interest, they will pursue action that the particular group does not wish them to take. To deny that foreign policy has had any impact on community relations in this country is to fly in the face of reality. The arguments that have been repeatedly put to me by my Muslim community have been twofold: first, that it was not being listened to and that the political system seemed unresponsive and, secondly, that a double standard was operating in western Europe and north America, that it was one law for Iraq and a different law for Kashmir or Chechnya.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.3/5">Without going into the merits or demerits of the arguments, there were deeply felt views within the Muslim community in my constituency, especially among the younger generation. It is for the Government of any party to find a way in which to engage in dialogue so that people know that what they say, how they vote and how they use the political system can make a difference. We have to accept collectively that issues such as Kashmir matter greatly to a large number of British people. We must alter our way of thinking and our notion of the British view of the world to take account of the fact that, for many British citizens now, what happens in the areas from where their families originally came will be important to how they frame their political judgments and how seriously they feel part of our mainstream society.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.3/6">Like almost everyone else who has spoken in the debate, I am conscious that I have been liberal with the gloom. However, I want to finish on a positive note. I remain an optimist about community relations in this country. I would sum my reasons for that approach in two ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.3/7">First, I look at history. I remember many years ago having reason to read the minutes of a Privy Council for the 1560s. I found reports coming into the Ministers of Elizabeth I of riots that were taking place in Essex because of the presence of communities of Dutch weavers. They had moved in as a result of Spanish rule in the Netherlands. There were the protests with which we are familiar today&mdash;the incomers were taking jobs, they were not speaking the language, and they were different. We have a record of being able to overcome such differences through time and through hard work. It is a mistake to think that there never were difficulties in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.3/8">Secondly, and most importantly, I am an optimist because of what I saw in Aylesbury this year. There was a feeling of shock, but I remember vividly standing in the market place the day after the police action in the town. I was there for the midday ceremony, which was mirrored nationwide, to commemorate the victims of the London tube bombings. We stood there and heard the local imam denounce al-Qaeda and terrorism in vehement and moving language. As I looked around, I saw a true cross-section of British society. I saw the local chief of police, a lot of local councillors from all parties, a large number of young men from the local mosque, the office holders of a local branch of the Royal British Legion and 200 or 300 others. That gave me hope and confidence for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.3/9">I believe that the challenges that the report has highlighted are grave, important and difficult, but with both political will and good will they can be overcome.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-27a.167.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" speakername="Greg Mulholland" colnum="167"  time="16:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051027/halltext/51027h01.htm#51027h01_spnew40">
	<p pid="a.167.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" name="John Denham">the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase>, the Chairman of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, on securing this important debate. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1659" name="Ann Cryer">the hon. Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer)</phrase> about the quality of today's contributions. The quality of the main debate yesterday in the House about the Terrorism Bill was similar, and it was carried out in an appropriate tone.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/2">This debate could not be any more timely. The report may well have been published before <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-12">12 July</phrase>, the date on which we came to the realisation of the significance of the events of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase>. We would all agree that the recommendations are even more pertinent in the current environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/3">I spoke yesterday in the main debate in the House, so I will not reiterate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">the points I made. I echo the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase>; I am pleased to speak both on behalf of my party and because of my personal experience from my constituency where a community is still dealing with the fact that the London bombs were made there by local lads. That is something we will take a long time to come to terms with.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/4">Less in response to the Committee's recommendations, but inevitably and rightly, the Government are seeking to engage with multi-faith and, specifically, Muslim communities in places such as Leeds, Keighley and Aylesbury. I take this opportunity to thank the Minister for her kind invitation to attend the meeting in Leeds. Alas, after the events of the summer, I was only at that time finally able to take a family holiday, or I would certainly have attended what I believe was a successful occasion.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/5">Despite that positive work, the Government have not made the link, which is obvious to me and my party, between terrorism in the community and the raft of Home Office legislation that they are publishing. If ever there were a time for joined-up thinking, it is surely now, and I hope that this important debate will contribute to the process. As I said yesterday, there is a real need for the Government to acknowledge and accept that there is real fear and mistrust in communities such as those in Hyde Park and Beeston in Leeds. It is precisely those feelings that will make it more difficult for us all to move forward to a situation in which we feel that events such as those of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase> are less likely.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/6">We must tackle all the issues involved; we cannot separate them. Many, including stop and search, are mentioned in the report, which was published before <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase>. However, other issues are regularly raised with me, such as the power to close mosques and the threat of deportation to countries that still practise torture, whatever guarantees might be given. There is also a real feeling that there is a threat to free speech and valid debate about Palestine, Chechnya and, of course, Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/7">Given my experience in local communities, I cannot mention Iraq without saying that the Government must acknowledge the truth about the damage that the Iraqi conflict has done in such communities. Can we all at least admit the simple reality that the disastrous conflict in Iraq has made it more likely that citizens from our own Muslim community will turn to terrorism?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-27a.168.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" speakername="Greg Mulholland" colnum="168"  time="16:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051027/halltext/51027h01.htm#51027h01_spnew42">
	<p pid="a.168.1/1">The hon. Gentleman has just highlighted the problem. Does the fact that no one could possibly justify what has happened mean that we cannot talk about it? That is a dangerous route for us to be going down, and we must stop doing so and acknowledge the simple truth, regardless of the right or wrong of going into Iraq or any of the conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/2">There is also the terrorist legislation, which we cannot but mention in the debate. Specifically, as I made clear yesterday, there are the plans to extend detention without trial to 90 days that are causing particular concern in some communities. We must be honest and ask what message the Government think those measures send in terms of the helpful dialogue that they are attempting to have.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/3">I want to pick up a point made by the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen about the message that we send out and to talk briefly about the influence of the media, based on my own experience. Following the situation that emerged in Leeds in the summer, and having been an MP for less than three months, I had to deal with the international and national media. From that experience, I can say that the international media in particular, including one United States television station that I shall not name, had decided why people from Leeds had bombed their own capital city, and tried to force that agenda on those of us who were trying to give a realistic picture of life in our communities. I am afraid that some national British newspapers were little better in their coverage. I mentioned yesterday that several people who lived at the property in Alexandra grove were tried and convicted by the media, including the Egyptian Dr. al-Nashar, who was too afraid to return to his job at Leeds university.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/4">In this House, we all believe strongly in the right to free speech, so unfortunately there is little we can do to stop the media exercising theirs. However, all of us have to acknowledge our responsibility to try to counter such negative messages, to resist the temptation to be macho to suit the agenda of some of the national media and to realise that this issue is very sensitive. I am glad that the Government have moved on some of the language that they have been using, and I hope that that continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/5">I reiterate the fundamental point that I made yesterday and several times previously. The solutions to what happened on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase> do not lie fundamentally in rafts of legislation&mdash;even good legislation that we would all support. The solutions come largely from the communities. I shall give some examples of the positive things that have happened since the appalling revelations of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-12">12 July</phrase>. Local leadership was mentioned as important in the Select Committee report, and such leadership has been fundamental in Leeds since 7 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-12">12 July</phrase>. I praise the local faith leaders, the inter-faith groups, the local representatives of all parties and Leeds city council for the firm and powerful leadership that they have shown in dealing with a very difficult situation. I hope that that has shown people nationally and internationally the true face of the great city of Leeds, which makes me very proud.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/6">Several speakers have picked up on the importance of schools, and there is no doubt that they are fundamental. We must look at how children are educated. To give a positive example, I should say that I am the governor of Brudenell primary school, which is about a mile from the so-called bomb factory. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-12">12 July</phrase>, when I was called back to Leeds, I was at the police cordon. A young girl, at that time in year 6, came up to me. She knew who I was, as I was a councillor before becoming an MP in May. She told me a little about what had been happening. She said, &quot;People are calling me and my friends terrorists&quot;. As part of my responsibility not only as an MP but a governor, I phoned the school to ask what it was doing to help the children through this. I am delighted to say that the excellent head teacher of the school said, &quot;Don't worry; we have already done it&quot;. There had already been a plenary session in the hall to talk to the children about what had happened and why. I am sure that there are other examples in different constituencies; schools are vital in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/7">As someone who is known to represent what is in part a multicultural area, I very much want to participate in the wider debate. There has been much discussion about multiculturalism as a concept and many commentators have said that it is dead in this country. I must say that a lot of debate on the subject so far has been very sterile. There is just one question that we should be asking: how do we make our diverse, multi-faith and, yes, multicultural communities work in 21st century Britain?</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/8">To pick up on something mentioned in both the report and our debate, we have to look at the whole issue of British identity today. I had a public disagreement in a newspaper with the Minister on this issue, but although I disagreed with her conclusion, I absolutely agreed with her sentiment and her attempt to raise the issue, because it is an important one that we must debate and try to work through.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/9">I have only one point of strong disagreement with anyone who has spoken today, and that is that I utterly reject the concept that a spouse who marries in a legitimate way should be forced to take any kind of test to find out whether they can speak English. The ramifications would be worrying. It would mean that a person could not meet someone in south America, fall in love quite genuinely and want their spouse to move over here and learn English. We have to be careful about going down that route.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.1/1">I absolutely agree. That is a strong, well made point, which echoes what has been said by several speakers, particularly the hon. Members for Keighley and for Aylesbury, who touched on genuine cultural difficulties. It is vital that all of us engage with and accept those cultural difficulties, often in the face of real barriers to acceptance of those difficulties in the communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.1/2">We must take on board the Committee's report and, more importantly, address the causes of riots, of ghettoisation in some northern towns and cities, and of the appalling events of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase>, which was when we all realised how serious some of the problems are. I want to reiterate a point first made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" name="Sarah Teather">my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather)</phrase>: she said that we would not be talking about the issue if we were not absolutely clear that it was not Muslims who attacked London on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase> but criminals and fanatics who happened to be from a small, fundamental fanatical minority of Muslims in west Yorkshire. One thing that has been inspiring to all of us&mdash;all the way up to Government, I hope&mdash;is the absolute and outright condemnation of the terrorist acts from all communities that were in any way associated with the events of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.1/3">Equally, we have to ask the question that we have had to ask ourselves in Leeds, Dewsbury and Aylesbury, which is why four young men from west Yorkshire went to bomb their own capital city. The Muslim community has to ask because the men were Muslims; people from Yorkshire, including me, because they were from Yorkshire; and all of us, as British citizens because they were also British citizens. The Minister is committed to the process of listening and understanding, so I would ask her to continue to do that and more.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.1/4">I strongly commend the hon. Member for Keighley for having said that we must reach out to the young and disaffected sections of communities, because they are the ones most likely to be tempted down the path of fanaticism and disillusionment. We must also&mdash;again, I pay tribute to the hon. Lady's work&mdash;connect with the women of Muslim communities. I share her belief that it is largely through the women that we will find solutions to the problems. I was delighted that she fought off the British National party threat so convincingly in the election. I was not threatened then by the BNP, but I must be doing something right now because after only a few months I am listed on its website as an enemy of the BNP.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.3/1">Thank you.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.3/2">We must ask questions, but some of the answers might be difficult to accept. Nevertheless, we must listen, and there will be economic, religious and political aspects to the answers that will be unpalatable. We need to break through and work with all sections of our ethnic minority communities, especially with the Muslim communities in our northern cities.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.3/3">One point that I should like to make strongly is that I realise, as we all do, that we cannot engage with those who have already taken the path of fanaticism. We cannot deal with people who have chosen the kind of thought process that was outlined by the hon. Member for Keighley, as we dealt with the IRA in the past. Therefore, we need to engage those who are vulnerable to the message before that message gets to them&mdash;that is the challenge for all of us. There must be more dialogue. There must be listening, as the Committee has said. I am sure that we would all agree.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.3/4">The terrorist attack on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase> came from one of our multicultural communities. It is to those communities that we must go to prevent it from happening again. It has been described many times as an attack on our way of life, and we would all agree that it was. Now we must ask ourselves, what is our way of life in 21st century Britain and what do we want it to be?</p>

	<p pid="a.174.1/1">I know of a number of examples, but it is difficult to comment on individual instances, particularly those that have taken place in prisons. I am more worried about examples that seem to verge on the barmy&mdash;for instance, banning hot cross buns in schools in east London, although Iqbal Socranie openly said that there was no basis for the ban. However, such things happen. That is unfortunate, because it conveys the impression that there is a constant urge to provide privileges to one group, rather than trying to address the issue of how they are to be brought into the mainstream.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.0/1">Considering that it is the Thursday afternoon of a busy week, I have enjoyed the opportunity to listen to Members from all parties, particularly in light of yesterday's debate on Second Reading of the Terrorism Bill. Today's debate has given us the opportunity to explore in more detail, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> said, some of the underlying issues that are part of the overarching strategy that will, we hope, enable us to deal with these problems. I shall take some of the points raised away but shall do my best to respond to them today.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" name="John Denham">My right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase> does an excellent job of chairing the Home Affairs Committee; we are often on the receiving end of a fairly intensive grilling, which is exactly as it should be. The Committee is absolutely on the ball and goes to the heart of issues that really concern us. I can genuinely say that both my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I find it useful to have our thinking and policy making tested and challenged in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/3">The Committee deserves credit for raising these issues before the events of 7 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase>. It was ahead of the Government on that. I shall go through all the things that we were doing, but hon. Members will realise that since <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase> and the Committee's sittings on this issues, there has been a renewed focus and extra energy. We have begun to see connections between work on community cohesion and on engaging Muslim communities that were not as prominent as they might have been before those events.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/4">Everyone acknowledges that the events of 7 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase> were horrendous, but something quite encouraging came out of them. Hon. Members have told us about what happened in their constituencies. The hon. Member for Aylesbury talked about the services that took place and the way in which there was a coming together of people from all faith backgrounds and those of no faith. There was a sense of solidarity that they were united, not just in condemning the atrocities but in saying, &quot;How do we go forward? How do we work together? How do we deepen and strengthen our relationships in this country in terms of the values that unite us?&quot; If we can build on that solidarity, we will make a big difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/5">We face these issues across the world, not just in this country, but internationally. My right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen talked about the meetings of the Committee in France and the Netherlands. There is to be a European seminar at the beginning of December on radicalisation and prevention. All Governments are hugely exercised by those issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/6">One big strand of our work on the counter-terrorism strategy is prevention. To prevent terrorism, we need to follow the path of individuals, to see at which points in their lives they are particularly vulnerable to the teaching and powers of extremists and to work out how we can increase the protective factors around people's experience so that they are less likely to be drawn into that kind of activity. Much intensive research and practical work is going on. Some points are to do with further education and some with the prison system. We need to work out how we can intervene, to ensure that the situation does not continue and how we can reverse it.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/7">Obviously, we have the Terrorism Bill, but today's debate is about wider issues. I assure the Chamber that the legislative measures that we are introducing are not aimed at any community, let alone the Muslim community; they are aimed at terrorists. We must be clear about that. The Bill's measures will be controversial and there will be debates in Committee over the coming weeks, but they are genuinely aimed at trying to prevent terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/8">That is the right approach, because people want us to have sufficient powers to tackle terrorism, but people also reject crude stereotyping and discrimination. Aiming our powers at a particular community would not be supported by the people of this country. We well understand that combating terrorism and having good community relations are intrinsically linked. Much of the work we need to do in gathering intelligence and information from local communities depends on having open channels of communication so that people feel secure and confident enough to come forward to give us information.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">The hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase> talked about how important it was for the security services to have communities involved, so that they can reach out and be more effective in their work. He will know that we are in the process of doubling the number of people in our security services, and our ensuring that we reach out to a range of communities in that recruitment process will be incredibly important.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/10">We recently brought in a statutory duty for police authorities to have a positive duty to examine the diversity of forces, to ensure that they are properly representative of the communities that they serve. Sir Ian Blair of the Metropolitan police has specifically said that he wants to recruit more Muslim men and women into our police service, so that we will have a much better and closer relationship with those communities. We are making progress, but it is not fast enough. We need to do more in terms of positively recruiting people into the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/11">We also have to ensure that we tackle the genuine feelings of many in communities about inequality and poverty. I do not for one moment think that that is a justification or an explanation for people getting involved in extremism and terrorism. However, feelings of inequality and alienation can sometimes provide the breeding ground and the basis for the extremist message to get through. We have to be conscious of tackling those issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/12">I will now discuss the matters that hon. Members have raised. First, I will deal head on with the failure of the Home Office to provide the Cabinet Office paper on &quot;Young Muslims and Extremism&quot;. Clearly, it was prepared some time ago&mdash;I think it was two years old&mdash;and I am sorry that members of the Committee did not have access to the full range of papers. There was no intention to hide the work that was going on. Perhaps there was feeling that it was more about the path of the individual and radicalisation, and not necessarily about community relations. With hindsight, we can see all too clearly that the path of the individual is connected to the effect on the wider community.</p>

	<p pid="a.181.0/1">When the road show gets going, and we select the Muslim scholars and experts, there are many very good Muslim scholars who are women. I can, for instance, suggest a professor at Glasgow university who would be very helpful.</p>
</speech>
<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-27a.181.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-27b.181.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-27a.181.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1802" speakername="Hazel Blears" colnum="181"  time="17:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051027/halltext/51027h01.htm#51027h01_spnew57">
	<p pid="a.181.1/1">I should be absolutely delighted; it is my intention to include women in the road show. The group that involved women was also excellent, with some good and constructive ideas. Women can reach people, including families, and have a huge influence.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/2">The second positive proposal that we are taking forward is a national advisory council of imams and mosques. Again, it will not be dictated to by the Government telling people how they should follow their religion, but led by the community and supported by Government. How do we get a proper curriculum and make sure that people have support for training? Many more imams are now trained in this country, and they not only express their religion in English but have a real understanding of the issues that face young people in particular in complex and difficult world in which they need to make their choices.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/3">The third idea that we are definitely taking forward is a national forum against extremism and Islamophobia, which will provide a forum for people to come together again and discuss how to tackle them. There is also the issue of how we give those involved capacity, and we recently announced a capacity-building fund for all faith communities; we have &pound;5 million, and a bidding programme is under way now. We will make it as simple as we can to ensure that we get the money out to people and build their capacity to engage with the mainstream political process. If we say that the way to resolve our problems is through democracy, which we do, and that there is never an excuse to resort to violence, it is absolutely key that we make our democratic institutions and systems accessible so that people see that it is worth while getting involved in the political process, whether at local, regional or national level, and that that is the way to ensure that action is taken. Strengthening that belief in democracy is hugely important.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1634" name="James Clappison">The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison)</phrase> raised some important issues. He asked whether we have shared the legislation with the community, and we have. We are in constant contact through many of the working groups that we have set up, and particularly the tackling extremism working group. We also have specific consultation going on about how we tackle extremism in places of worship. Again, that is predicated not simply on closing down places of worship, but on how we focus powers on the extremists and empower decent people in the community to take action. That consultation ends in just a couple of weeks' time, and we shall return to the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/5">The hon. Gentleman mentioned deportations and exclusions. There have been no deportations as yet, but a whole range of people are in custody on the basis that they are a threat to national security. We have signed two memorandums of understanding with Libya and Jordan and are keen to press on to ensure that we have sufficient undertakings so that we can make the deportations.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/6">On extradition, we shall try to agree protocols for strict time limits. We do not necessarily want a statutory time limit, because if we were one day over the limit on someone's extradition, they would have to be released. We are getting proper protocols for each stage of the process so that we get those time limits in place. That is really important.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/7">Many Members raised the issue of anti-Semitism, and I am pleased that they did, because it is absolutely unacceptable. My hon. Friend the Minister for Higher Education and Lifelong Learning has pursued the issue in relation to universities. Anti-Semitism, and indeed any similar action against a person, is clearly to be deplored. As my hon. Friends have said, academic authorities and student unions have a real responsibility, and we can help and support them in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1900" name="David Winnick">My hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick)</phrase> raised the issue of anti-Semitism and responsibility. He also raised the issue of clerics with outrageous views, and he will know that we have set out new guidelines on activities that we would consider not to be conducive to the public good. We will be taking those guidelines forward as well to ensure that people do not come here and peddle the kind of hate-filled views that we have heard all too often.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/9">My hon. Friend the Member for Keighley mentioned Hizb ut-Tahrir. Clearly, it does not fall within the current criteria for proscription and it was not included in the list of proscribed groups that we took through the House last week. One provision in the Terrorism Bill relates to whether glorification should be grounds for proscription, and other organisations will be examined, although I will not comment on particular ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/10">My hon. Friend made some very good points about involving women, and I pay tribute to her for the sometimes difficult stand that she has taken on such issues. She has been very honest and straightforward.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/11">I do not have time to comment on all the points made by the hon. Member for Aylesbury, but he has clearly thought carefully about the issues. He mentioned prisons, and I can tell him that we have more than 100 accredited imams going into prisons, and proceedings are monitored carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/12"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" name="Greg Mulholland">The hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> clearly takes a personal interest in these issues. I simply say that every one of us has a responsibility to ensure that we talk about them openly and honestly and tackle some of the difficult problems. When I went to my meetings during the summer, I was perfectly happy to engage on issues of foreign policy, and we cannot shy away from that. When we talk about Iraq, however, we must also remember that Muslims are killing Muslims there. Many Muslims were also killed under Saddam Hussein, so I cannot accept the hon. Gentleman's point&mdash;</p>

Whether the defendant and witnesses for the prosecution turn up determines my fee. I do not suppose that many of my former colleagues at the junior Bar would object if the Government came forward with a sensible proposal for payment of criminal barristers according to the work that they do. The problem is that that is not the proposal and the Government are making cuts without completing the wide-ranging Carter review. The Government promised a review in May but it did not materialise. The criminal Bar has been waiting a long time for the Government to explain their long-term vision.</p>
