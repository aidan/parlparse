<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-12-05a.2.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" speakername="John McDonnell" colnum="2"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061205/halltext/61205h0001.htm#06120550000521">
	<p pid="a.2.2/1">Thank you for your protection, Mr. Amess, but I thought the intervention was apposite. It prefigured some of the issues that I shall raise later. It is the role of the all-party group as well to assist in the promulgation of information about the Punjabi community in Britain and to enhance its reputation.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/2">To enable Parliament to examine issues that are of interest to the Punjabi community and, indeed, the issues that the hon. Gentleman raised, members of the all-party group have on a regular basis sought a general Adjournment debate on the Punjabi community in Britain. The last one was convened by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1937" name="Rob Marris">my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)</phrase> in March 2005, and I convened the first one four years ago. We seek to use such debates to measure progress on issues that were raised in past debates but, in addition to that, to ensure that there is a general overview and discussion of the issues that are of concern to members of the Punjabi community and that confront them in their everyday lives. We use the debates to analyse issues and to advocate the policies that are needed to address concerns. Each debate has proved useful in assessing progress, and the Government have responded extremely effectively to the issues that have been raised in them.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/3">On the hon. Gentleman's point, it is important to recognise the success of the Punjabi community in Britain and to celebrate its contribution to British society. Many members of the Punjabi community lead in the fields of business and commerce; law, where there are numerous barristers, QCs and judges; and politics and government at every level, from councillors to MPs and right through to a Government Minister. They lead in the arts and culture. Let me give a small plug for the filming of &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot; in my constituency. I congratulate the director of that film, Gurinder Chadha, on one of the most successful British films in recent years. The Punjabi community gave the world bhangra, the desi beat and the talents of Nitin Sawhney and Talvin Singh.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/4">In sport, come back Monty Panesar, all is forgiven. I congratulate him on the service that he has rendered to his country so far. May I also give a plug for my local Yeading football club and Nev Saroya, a footballer who is one of the most comfortable defenders I have ever seen on a ball? His talents have not been sufficiently recognised in the higher leagues, but he is an excellent player.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/5">Indeed, earlier this year, at about the time of the Punjabi traditional celebration of the spring festival of Vaisakhi, the all-party group launched its first annual awards ceremony to honour those who had contributed to the promotion of Punjabi culture. It proved to be an overriding success, and I invite all Members to next year's celebrations and awards ceremony, to be held at Millbank on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">Tuesday, 20 March</phrase>, at 6 pm. The awards ceremony is also an exceptional celebration of the cuisine of the Punjab. Food was supplied by the Punjab restaurant and Mr. Sital Singh Mann. I express my thanks for his assistance in hosting the event, and I also thank the Hounslow and other gurdwaras that assisted us throughout the year and supported our conferences and various campaigns.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/6">The members of the Punjabi community are concerned about the issues that concern us all: health, education, housing, crime, community safety and the environment. However, some concerns are of special interest to that community. Let me identify some that have been raised via the all-party group's consultations. They have informed our work throughout the past 18 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/7">The first is the issue of recognition. Hon. Members will know that we have consistently lobbied on behalf of the Sikh community in Britain to ensure that it has recognition in the census. That issue has not fully been resolved to everybody's satisfaction. It was dealt with in the last debate on the subject and there was some response from the Government about the measures that would be taken to address those concerns in the 2011 census. I would welcome further discussions on the issue at ministerial level and possibly a meeting between the all-party group and the relevant Ministers and civil servants to see whether or not we can resolve the matter in time for the next census.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-12-05a.27.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" speakername="Michael Fabricant" colnum="27"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061205/halltext/61205h0004.htm#06120550000577">
	<p pid="a.27.1/1">I used to represent Stone, before a boundary change, so I know the area. My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Indeed, there are many other areas like that in rural Staffordshire. At this point, I should like to heap praise on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> who has been only too aware of that very problem in her own rural constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/2">Why has the change taken place? The excuse given by Lake and Catling for withdrawing drugs and services is that their use is illegal under the Medicines Act. The Act prescribes which drugs can be administered by whom and under what circumstances, such as emergencies. It also outlines clinical governance for the storage and distribution of those drugs. That news first became public when on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-17">17 October</phrase>, NHS West Midlands head of special projects, Steve Coney, wrote to Members of Parliament and others informing them that all but three drugs previously available to save lives were to be withdrawn. Confusingly, the very next day, Staffordshire ambulance service issued a press release saying that, actually, six drugs remained available.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/3">The press release was supported by correspondence from acting chief executive, Geoff Catling, who wrote to MPs and others. In his letter from the Staffordshire ambulance service, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Following an initial investigation, I have taken the decision that certain drugs used by our community first responder (CFR) schemes are to be withdrawn...whilst the training of the CFRs is extensive&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/5">I am glad that he admits that&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/6" class="indent">&quot;and to a high standard, concern has been raised&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/7">by whom, we do not know&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/8" class="indent">&quot;that under the Medicines Act, it would appear that a number of drugs are not eligible for use by lay people under the national legal framework for medicines. Now that the status under the Medicines Act for certain drugs is clear, the consequence is that the Trust can no longer provide indemnity to CFRs who may be operating outside the legal framework of the safe and secure handling of medicines.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/9">The indictment is clear. He blames the Medicines Act and the Government. He is right that the Medicines Act is clear, but it is not as he misleadingly claims. The use of the drugs is entirely legal&mdash;an opinion consistently supported by the Department of Health and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. I have a letter from Victoria Milnes at the Department of Health's customer service centre:</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/10" class="indent">&quot;The view of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is that community first responders are in a similar position to Trust employees if they:</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/11" class="indent">a) are engaged by a Trust to provide emergency response services as part of the Trust's business&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/12">which they are,</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/13" class="indent">&quot;b) are trained by and subject to the direction and control of the Trust&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/14">which they are,</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/15" class="indent">&quot;and</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/16" class="indent">c) work on its behalf and are fully accountable to it&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/17">which they are. The letter goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/18" class="indent">&quot;This means that they can be supplied with appropriate drugs by the Trust without contravening the Medicines Act.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/19">I have a further letter from the MHRA, the executive agency of the Department of Health.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-12-05a.29.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" speakername="Michael Fabricant" colnum="29"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061205/halltext/61205h0005.htm#06120550000585">
	<p pid="a.29.1/1">Yes, but some of the CFRs are not doctors. They get to the scene first. Just as in other parts of the country, they were able to prescribe and give the drugs. They are not being allowed to do so now, and people will begin to die one by one in consequence. I repeat that there has not been a single improper incident involving the drugs during the past few years, and that many lives have been saved as a result.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/2">I move to the question of equipment. As if taking such medicines from the first people on the scene was not bad enough, the new management of Staffordshire ambulance service have also withdrawn from all their emergency response teams, including regular ambulances, equipment proven to save lives in serious heart attack cases. When someone has a cardiac arrest, there are just a few minutes to save their life. Defibrillation does not always work, so cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which I have used, must be applied directly to the heart. I can tell you, Mr. Amess, that it is hard work. It can crack the sternum and break ribs, but compressing the heart manages to circulate some of the blood supply. That circulation is only 25 per cent. of normal circulation, which often is not enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/3">ResQPOD is a device that artificially increases the amount of oxygen in the blood, thus getting more oxygen to the brain, heart muscle and other vital organs, and it increases the amount of oxygen that circulates under CPR by about 50 per cent. ResQPOD has been withdrawn, and again, our management friends, Mr. Lake and Mr. Catling, feature in this sad story. They cite safety reasons, but I have spoken personally to Dr. Keith Lurie, professor of internal and emergency medicine at the medical school at the university of Minnesota in the United States, and the reasons given for the decision taken in Staffordshire are spurious.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/4">Let us be clear; we are talking about dead people, those whose hearts have stopped. ResQPOD is a life-saving device, and Lake and Catling&mdash;alone it would seem&mdash;are claiming that it is not. Yet it is used by other ambulance services in the United Kingdom&mdash;although, interestingly, not by the west midlands ambulance service&mdash;and by ambulance services in the United States, whose legal system would soon see to it that it was quickly withdrawn from service if there were any doubts about its safety. It is also used in Canada, France, Germany and Scandinavia. I trust their judgment; I do not trust the medical judgment of Lake and Catling.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/5">The future of the LUCAS unit is also in doubt. It is a mechanical device that provides chest compression during CPR and it effectively does the job of a paramedic by compressing the chest at a rate of 100 compressions per minute, which is very difficult to achieve or sustain. Anyone who has tried CPR will know how hard it is to sustain that rate for a minute or two, but the device does it automatically and indefinitely. It has not been withdrawn yet, and I hope that it will not be.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/6">Each year, out of every 1 million people, about 1,000 suffer a cardiac arrest and will receive CPR. Fewer than 50 of those survive if manual techniques alone are used. If ResQPOD is used, the chances of a patient surviving a serious heart attack is doubled. If a LUCAS unit is used in combination with ResQPOD, and only if it is so used, the chances double again. Together the two devices keep blood flowing to and from the heart at 50 to 70 per cent. of the normal rate, which is much higher than the 20 per cent. figure achieved from the use of manual CPR alone. In Staffordshire, an average of 20 lives are saved; they will not be saved next year if the ban continues. That has all come about since plans for regional ambulance services were announced.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/7">I have said from the outset that I want the best for the people of Staffordshire, the west midlands and the UK. I do not mind in principle if services become regional, or even national, as long as the service is, at the very least, as good as it is in Staffordshire. However, because Staffordshire has been consistently at the top of the performance tables for all measures of good service, such as response times and survival rates, it is the regional service that must improve&mdash;not the other way round. Lake and Catling say that response times are still tops, and for once I agree with them. That is great, but arriving swiftly at the scene is just part of the equation: without the vital drugs and equipment, paramedics, CFRs and ambulance crews can do nothing.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/8">It is increasingly clear that the new management have an eye on the regional service, with the result that the people of Staffordshire are already beginning to suffer through the withdrawal of life-saving medicines and equipment. The morale of those who work so hard for the people of Staffordshire is already beginning to fall, through no fault of their own. I dread to think how many lives will be lost in Staffordshire when all the hard work they have put in to building a system that works simply evaporates because the regional service will not open its eyes to a common-sense approach. As I have said in this Chamber before, the Minister should be proud of what we have achieved in Staffordshire, and should want to repeat it elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/9">Before I close, I shall give you some statistics and an example. Each day since <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-18">18 October</phrase>, when Staffordshire ambulance service decided to restrict medicines, a CFR has been forced to wait helplessly with a patient, waiting for up to 45 minutes before a medicine that they could have administered on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-17">17 October</phrase> was administered. I shall read an extract from a message sent by &quot;call sign 699&quot;, who is a Brewood CFR group operator:</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/10" class="indent">&quot;job no:- 30/11/06/337 (Staffordshire Ambulance's 337th incident last Monday), time 17:39, age 83, trauma (shaft femur), (broken thigh bone, near the top, the jagged ends will have been pulled by her thigh muscles so they overlapped, shortening the leg by about three inches&mdash;making diagnosis easy and the pain terrible) drug required:- entonox (gas and air&mdash;50 per cent. nitrous oxide, 50 per cent. oxygen&mdash;it would have dulled the pain enough to have allowed the ambulance crew to move her onto the ambulance as soon as they arrived; instead there was a further delay of about ten minutes while they set about dulling the pain&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/11">That drug could previously have been administered by CFRs and it has been unilaterally withdrawn by the Staffordshire ambulance service, even though it is in use by other CFRs in other parts of the country. The message continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/12" class="indent">&quot;time for back up&mdash;14 mins (not bad: imagine an accident like this happening up in the Moorlands in a blizzard when the air ambulance can't fly and the land ambulance is stuck on the Leek to Buxton road. How long would the poor old lady have had to wait for pain relief then?)&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/13">That was sent by a community first responder called Ann.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/14">It can easily take an ambulance 30 minutes to reach some areas&mdash;longer in winter&mdash;and we should note that the air ambulance does not fly at night or in bad weather. It is telling that no one from the West Midlands strategic health authority or the West Midlands ambulance service has visited a Staffordshire CFR group to see how it operates or to see the nature of the terrain. CFRs and community paramedics get into remote areas and deliver life-saving support&mdash;the Minister should note that it is a success story. However, although they are still the first on the scene of an emergency, they are no longer able to help. In the worst cases, they will be forced to watch someone go into cardiac arrest before they can attempt to help, knowing that before vital medicines and equipment were removed by the Staffordshire ambulance service's management, they could have prevented it from happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/15">The merger or &quot;partnership&quot;, as it is called, between the Staffordshire and the West Midlands ambulance services is developing into one of our worst fears. No sensible explanation has been given as to why, in the build up to the merger, drugs and equipment still in use in other ambulance services in England and elsewhere were suddenly considered to be illegal or dangerous for use only in Staffordshire. The action by Staffordshire ambulance service to withdraw CFR drugs and ResQPOD is down to a major clash of cultures and, as it is neither practicable nor permissible for an ambulance service to operate different standards in a region, it is easier&mdash;and, I guess, cheaper&mdash;to restrict the medicine and equipment that Staffordshire's emergency medical services carry than it is to train its colleagues in the west midlands.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/16">It is disheartening to note that, perhaps uniquely, by merging the two and ignoring best practice there is a real risk that clinical care will be reduced and operating costs and deaths will go up. The question that I put to the Minster is this: if community first responders and paramedics cannot treat emergency patients with appropriate medicines and equipment, why is the ambulance service still dispatching them? If that is being done to meet response time targets, it is surely a despicable misuse of volunteers that cheats patients because, without the vital drugs that have been withdrawn, the CFRs can do little when they arrive.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/17">I started the debate with a figure. People in Staffordshire are nearly five times more likely to survive a heart attack than the national average. The people of Staffordshire in such circumstances are now five times more likely to die. I urge the Minister to use all the power of his office to sort this mess out because he will have a much more serious debate on his hands as soon as the first life is lost that could have been saved. The clock starts ticking with that first unnecessary death. I, for one, do not want that debate to be necessary.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-12-05a.33.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" speakername="Charlotte Atkins" colnum="33"  time="011:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061205/halltext/61205h0005.htm#06120550000588">
	<p pid="a.33.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase> on securing this important and timely debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.0/2">Passions have been running high in Staffordshire ambulance service over the past few weeks, especially since <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-17">17 October</phrase>, when the bombshell was dropped that the 13 drugs that were previously available to community first responders had to be restricted to just six. As acting chief executive Geoff Catling admitted, withdrawing those drugs was like cutting off one of their arms. However, his view was that he had no choice but to make that decision, to protect both the community first responders, and the trust and its legal position. He said that the issue was a legal minefield. The problem concerns the interpretation of the Medicines Act 1968 and who can be responsible for the safe and secure handling of medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.0/3">On the other side of the argument are people such as John Jones, team leader of the Biddulph Moor community first responders, who says that there is no legal reason why he and his fellow community first responders cannot be allowed to administer all the 13 drugs that they have used for the past seven years without any problems at all. I fully understand their frustration. Community first responders are not just gifted amateurs; they are professionally trained to ambulance technician standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.0/4">The community first responder schemes in Staffordshire operate under strict criteria for recruitment, personal specification, training, assessment and hands-on exercises. The schemes are maintained and managed by a qualified paramedic, and all community first responders, like trust employees, have 24-hour access to a trust doctor via the telemedicine desk in ambulance control. That allows online advice and a second opinion if appropriate, which ensures patient safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.0/5">Let us be clear about the vital role of community first responders. They are local volunteers, operating mostly in the more remote rural areas, which is important in my constituency. There, the ambulance response may be a little slower, so community first responders are nearly always the first on the scene. They do not know what they will find when they arrive, but they have the professionalism, the bravery and the commitment to assess the situation and to take control until the ambulance gets there.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.0/6">Staffordshire ambulance service emergency response times are the best in the country, and have remained so, but in remote rural areas such as mine, the weather, terrain and isolation can cause a delayed response. That means that those who volunteer to become community first responders are life savers. There is no doubt at all about that. Restricting the drugs that they can use has angered, demotivated and undermined the community first responders.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.0/7">The view of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is crucial. It has issued a statement&mdash;part of which the hon. Member for Lichfield read out&mdash;that says:</p>
	<p pid="a.33.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The view of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is that community first responders are in a similar position to Trust employees if they...are engaged by a Trust to provide emergency response services as part of the Trust's business...are trained by and subject to the direction and control of the Trust; and...work on its behalf and are fully accountable to it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.33.0/9">Community first responders clearly meet all three conditions. The MHRA continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.33.0/10" class="indent">&quot;This means that they can be supplied with appropriate drugs by the Trust without contravening the Medicines Act.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.33.0/11">However, as I indicated earlier, there is another paragraph, which is where the problem arises:</p>
	<p pid="a.33.0/12" class="indent">&quot;However, in addition to the specific legal restrictions, Trusts need to ensure that their clinical governance arrangements are sufficiently robust to ensure safe and effective practice. This would need to cover issues such as the training of community first responders, guidance on the use of medicines, storage and stock control&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.0/1">No doubt the Minister can make that clear, but it is certainly not commonly understood. Whether the West Midlands service manages to maintain such standards is crucial to how the operation would be conducted and how the merger would take place. I continue to oppose the merger, and it is not just a question of medical equipment and CFRs. There are profound reasons, to do with regional arrangements that preclude a proper service for Staffordshire people. I do not believe that it will be possible, in realistic terms, for the five-times proportional difference to be made up by an improvement in the West Midlands service as a whole. I would require an enormous amount of proof to be convinced of that. There is no evidence for it; it is just an assertion. I leave it at that for the time being.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/2">My hon. Friend raised extremely serious legal issues. To say the least, I have been extremely annoyed at the Government's responses. I am sure that my constituents have been as well, given that I have presented two petitions in this field of endeavour with something like 5,000 signatures from my constituency alone. For example, the Government's response to my <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-08">8 February</phrase> petition to Parliament was that no observations would be issued on the petition. I find that intolerable; the Government know perfectly well what is at stake.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/3">I repeat what I have said before, although Labour Members will take exception to it; they have in the past. During the <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-07">7 February</phrase> House of Commons debate, all nine Staffordshire Labour MPs failed to support the motion opposing the merger as expressed in the terms of reference. That is on record. I should also say that on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-26">26 February</phrase>, the Conservative-controlled Staffordshire borough council passed a motion opposing the proposed merger. All the Conservatives supported the motion; none of the Labour councillors present did so. That is the record. I find the behaviour of members of the Labour party somewhat disingenuous, although I understand the reasons for it. I do not want to deprecate the reasons for it in themselves, because I am sure that Labour Members have a proper sense of duty to their constituents. However, difficult dilemmas arise, and to my mind it is clear that when the test has come, members of the Labour party&mdash;in Parliament or the local council&mdash;have, in general, supported the Government's position. That remains a matter of record.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/4">On the question of legality and the important matters raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield and the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands in respect of the Medicines Act 1968, there may be a solution in the hands of Government. My hon. Friend mentioned correspondence from Mr. Catling, and the hon. Lady also mentioned correspondence that is on the record. I believe that there is a procedure that could be used in a serious dispute about whether the Medicines Act and other medical legislation is applicable, but it is open to the Government to determine to use it; that is, to go for a declaration in the High Court, as there is clearly risk of death&mdash;my hon. Friend made that clear&mdash;and the matter of five times proportionality is very serious. I do not believe that there is the slightest chance that the West Midlands arrangements will ever come up to the standard that has been set. These are questions of great importance; of life and death.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/5">The hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands said that people were no longer prepared to take the action that they took until quite recently. Apparently, some people are not taking up the voluntary activities that they did in the past. I suspect&mdash;I do not know for sure&mdash;that the authorities in question have acquainted them with questions about insurance and negligence, and exposure even to legal action if they were to continue to provide services. So we have not only the differential in respect of potential for death as a result of the failure to make proper arrangements&mdash;that is in the hands of the Government and the trust&mdash;but the question whether the people who could provide the service have been warned off.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/6">There are doubly good reasons why such matters should be taken up by the Government. Merely providing an opinion may or may not be sufficient. First, because the situation is serious, the Government should take leading counsel's opinion, and that may need to be tested in the courts if we do not get the right answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/7">I remain opposed to the merger. It will not work. I congratulate my hon. Friend on his expert analysis of the situation, and I concur with his conclusions. In this matter, the Labour party as a whole has failed the people of Staffordshire over an extended period. I await what the Minister has to say, but there is absolutely no evidence in anything that I have heard so far that the merger will be called off and/or that the situation for the people of Staffordshire will be materially improved in respect of the matters raised by my hon. Friend.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.0/1">I shall try to be brief, Mr. Amess. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase> on securing this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/2">Those of us who are not community first responders can only imagine how dispiriting it must be to attend an emergency and not be able to give the pain relief or other treatment that was available until the middle of October. My constituent David Holt, who is the secretary of the Staffordshire community first responders, is keeping a record of all incidents in the county in which patients suffer unnecessarily. In a briefing to Alex Fox, the chairman of the South Staffordshire primary care trust, he stated that, on average, once every day since <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-18">18 October</phrase> a CFR has sat helplessly with a patient for up to 45 minutes waiting for a paramedic to administer salbutamol, GTN or entonox. What is even more frustrating for David Holt and the first responders of Mayfield in my constituency is that over the border in Derbyshire, East Midlands ambulance service recently trained its CFRs in the use of salbutamol and GTN spray and issued those drugs to them. Mayfield and Ellastone CFRs used the drugs for four and a half years before <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-18">18 October</phrase> without any adverse incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/3">I understand from David Holt that no one from the strategic health authority or the West Midlands ambulance service has visited Staffordshire CFR groups to see how they operate. I would urge them to do so. Having said all that, I can well understand the actions that the Staffordshire ambulance service, faced with the advice that it received from the strategic health authority in October, took to ensure that the community first responders were acting legally. It now seems clear that the advice, which according to the press release issued by Staffordshire ambulance service concluded that some drugs</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/4" class="indent">&quot;were not eligible for use by lay people under the national legal framework for medicines&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/5">and that</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/6" class="indent">&quot;management policy falls outside the Medicines Act&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/7">was wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/8">In fact, even as long ago as July, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency stated in its e-mail to Staffordshire ambulance service that</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/9" class="indent">&quot;medicines legislation does not address the administration of non-parenteral medicines so there is nothing to prevent CFRs administering the remaining drug products in your letter&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/10">That e-mail was in response to a letter from the Staffordshire ambulance service that, I believe, listed a total of eight drugs, four of which are banned. All four of those drugs&mdash;entonox, salbutamol, GTN and diazepam&mdash;are non-parenteral and therefore are not covered by medicines legislation. Another two of the banned drugs that were not listed in the letter&mdash;Atrovent and Pulmicort&mdash;are also non-parenteral.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/11">In a recent reply that I received from the MHRA, Professor Kent Woods confirms that the MHRA was not involved in the trust's decision to withdraw the medicine. The letter clearly states:</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The Agency has taken the view that if community first responders in Staffordshire were engaged by the Trust to provide emergency response services as part of the Trust's business, are trained by and subject to the direction and control of the Trust, work on its behalf and are fully accountable to it, they are in a similar position to trust employees; i.e. they can be supplied with...drugs by the Trust without contravening the Medicines Act.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/13">Professor Woods went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/14" class="indent">&quot;The Trust's clinical governance arrangements relating to use of medicines, documentation etc. do need to be sufficiently robust.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/15">We have now gone from a question of legality to a question of the clinical governance that needs to operate. I know that the CFRs are willing to have tighter protocols if that means that they can relieve the pain or suffering of those they attend before a paramedic or ambulance crew arrives. I have urged Staffordshire ambulance service to reach a speedy conclusion to this unfortunate situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/16">We are grateful to Ministers for listening to our concerns earlier this year. I now urge my hon. Friend to press the strategic health authority for an urgent decision on the advice that they can give to Staffordshire ambulance service. It would also be helpful if he could give a clear reassurance that it is not about a dumbing-down of the service offered to Staffordshire people and if he could put an end to the conspiracy theories that seem to be circulating.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-12-05a.41.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" speakername="Steve Webb" colnum="41"  time="012:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061205/halltext/61205h0007.htm#06120550000598">
	<p pid="a.41.0/1">I join other hon. Members in congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase> on bringing forward the issue. As we have heard from all the Staffordshire Members who have spoken so far, it is clearly an urgent issue that needs to be resolved forthwith. As the first non-Staffordshire Member to speak in the debate, I have been convinced not only today but in previous months of the quality of the service provided by the Staffordshire ambulance service. Hon. Members from the other two parties have repeatedly pressed the fact of the quality of the service in expressing their concerns about the proposed merger and I want to put on record my appreciation of all the work that is done by the paid staff of the service and the volunteers about whom we have heard today.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/2">I find it strange, coming completely from the outside, that some fairly serious allegations are being made by the hon. Member for Lichfield, who has accused professional ambulance management of being liars and unprofessional. He clearly feels passionately about the matter. We have had some more measured contributions to the debate, too, but the key issue remains. In relation to the withdrawal of the drugs, has one ambulance service spotted something that no one else has? In a sense, that is sometimes the benefit of regional and local services; they can do things differently and if they have done so for a good reason, perhaps others should follow. I do not get any sense that, where Staffordshire ambulance service has led in terms of the withdrawal of drugs, any other ambulance trust has followed, although I am happy for the Minister to correct me on that. It seems that, although ambulance services are at liberty to consider the issue, it must not be allowed to go on.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/3">I was interested that no one has so far referred to the letter from the chairman of Staffordshire ambulance service to the Staffordshire media, which is dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-16">16 November</phrase>. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/4" class="indent">&quot;In regard to the actions taken to reduce the number of drugs that can be administered by CFRs in Staffordshire, the decision was taken...on the grounds of patient safety.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/5">He went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/6" class="indent">&quot;We have always said that this action is a temporary measure&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/7">I find that quite interesting. I did not pick up from the speech made by the hon. Gentleman that the ambulance trust was saying that the measure was temporary. Clearly, that is what the chairman was saying in writing two or three weeks ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/8">The chairman went on to say that</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/9" class="indent">&quot;we will re-introduce these drugs if, and when, it is legal and safe to do so.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/10">That is where the role of the Department of Health comes in. To some extent, the trusts are regional, devolved bodies that are charged with getting on with the job. If there is an inconsistency between what trusts are doing, if they are interpreting the law in different ways and if, potentially, patients in one part of the country are losing out, the Minister has a role to consider what is going on, the different practices and why different trusts might be getting different legal advice, and to try to provide some consistent advice to the trusts so that they can provide the same quality of care across the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/11">With regard to the withdrawal of the ResQPOD, there seemed to be some discussion as to whether that was a clinical judgment, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> suggested. One person has judged that there might be clinical issues, and I understand from the debate that the ambulance trust has sought expert clinical advice from other people and is now considering it. That seems to me to be an entirely proper procedure. It would be wrong if any of those changes, as was intimated by the hon. Member for Lichfield, had been motivated not by clinical care but by organisational fiat or some political agenda. I was trying to work out quite what he was alleging. There were lots of hints, nudges and suggestions. I think that he was saying that the decisions are not being made because they are the right things to do or because there is some uncertainty, either about the legal position or the clinical implications, but because of forced harmonisation with the larger trusts.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.1/1">I do not have the time, and the hon. Lady has already made her point in trying to defend the current management. Without taking the necessary steps to improve West Midlands ambulance service, the only way to speed up the process is actively to dumb down Staffordshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/2">As we have heard, the ResQPOD was withdrawn, apparently on safety grounds. Every ambulance and paramedic car in Staffordshire carried one, but the West Midlands ambulance service does not use them. In addition, there have been fears that the LUCAS, often called the thumper, will similarly be banned&mdash;another device not used by West Midlands ambulance service. According to the NHS, people are four and a half times more likely to survive a severe heart attack in Staffordshire than in the rest of the west midlands because of the speed of response of the Staffordshire ambulance service and the community first responders and because of the training and equipment available to Staffordshire ambulance paramedic crews. Attempts to portray that decision as clinical fly in the face of the evidence&mdash;and, frankly, of reason. To say that it was done for reasons of safety is plainly a smokescreen for the politics of merger.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/3">The latest development was the withdrawal on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-18">18 October</phrase> of seven of the 13 drugs administered by the community first responders. The trust invoked the Medicines Act 1968 to support that decision, but again a leaked e-mail from the Department of Health to the trust&mdash;I believe that it was sent on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-26">26 July</phrase>&mdash;saw no problem with all 13 medicines being administered by CFRs. My hon. Friend the Member for Stone mentioned an action for declaration if there was any question of doubt; the Minister has that within his gift and could order it today.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/4">My hon. Friends in Staffordshire, the volunteer staff of Staffordshire ambulance service and the people of Staffordshire are having to fight tooth and nail to protect their ambulance service and community first responders. Patient choice was ignored with a sham consultation, and it continues to be ignored by bureaucrats bent on delivering a political and financial agenda rather than a clinical one. The Minister's civil servants and the new chief executive of Staffordshire ambulance service need to account for the fact that they have not been able to keep the Minister's promise to protect the people of Staffordshire by keeping their ambulance service at the level that they have enjoyed in the past, without suffering compromise in order to merge with the West Midlands ambulance service. It is right to ask the Minister: what has changed?</p>

	<p pid="a.61.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> on securing this debate and on batting yet again on behalf of the people of Kettering.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/2">I welcome the Minister. It seems that, whenever the Government get themselves into a mess or are on a sticky wicket, they ask the Minister to come and bat. I am afraid that we will see a batting collapse in Government policy that is faster than that of the English in Australia this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/3">I want to talk about a letter that I received from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. I had asked a question about how far away post offices are from people, to which the Deputy Prime Minister replied that</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/4" class="indent">&quot;99 per cent. of people live within one mile&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-01">1 November 2006</phrase>; Vol. 451, c. 281.]</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/5">It would be wonderful if that were true, but I doubted it at the time. Promptly afterwards, I received a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-07">7 November</phrase> which stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/6" class="indent">&quot;Dear Peter,</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/7" class="indent">When replying to the question you asked on 1st November about the Post Office network, I said that about 99 per cent. of people live within one mile of a Post Office...I apologise that I should have made clear that 99 per cent. of the urban population live within one mile of a Post Office. I understand that 93 per cent. of the population as a whole live within one mile of a Post Office.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/8">That was followed by a squiggle and then John Prescott's name.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/9">I commend the Deputy Prime Minister for quickly correcting what was obviously an inadvertent slip in the House, but it raises an interesting issue. I know that that statement was wrong and he knows that it was wrong, but no one else knows that, because <i>Hansard</i> recorded the answer as the Deputy Prime Minister said it. If he was given wrong information, has the Minister also been given wrong information and have the Government's conclusions about the necessity of rural post offices been based on the wrong statistics?</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/10">The Deputy Prime Minister's answer in his letter of <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-07">7 November</phrase> states that</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/11" class="indent">&quot;93 per cent. of the population as a whole live within one mile of a Post Office.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/12">He also said that</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/13" class="indent">&quot;99 per cent. of the urban population live within one mile of a Post Office.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/14">By my calculation, that could mean that only 70 or 80 per cent. of those in rural areas live within one mile of a post office, and I have some specific questions that I would like the Minister to deal with in his response if he can. Does he know the distance that people in rural areas must travel to their post office? If 70 or 80 per cent. of the rural population live within one mile, perhaps the information on which the Government based their policy is based on misinformation. If the Minister has that information, on what date was it based? It may be that 90 per cent. of the urban population live within one mile of a post office. On what date is the information based? Many urban post offices have closed recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/15">I am worried that Government policy is being determined on statistics that may not be correct. When the Deputy Prime Minister stood up in the House and gave a statistic in reply to an oral question, he must have got that statistic from his officials, so I am worried that misinformation has been given to Ministers and is leading to incorrect conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/16">I want briefly to mention how people are affected. For me, it is inconvenient that a post office has closed in my area. In fact, post offices in London road, Bedford road, Avenue road and Newton road have closed, but all I do is to hop in a car and go to Little Irchester. However, what about people in my area who are elderly, vulnerable, such as single mums, or disabled? They cannot do that and their only alternative is to go to the one remaining post office in Rushton, which means that they must queue up, often outside the post office, for service.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/17">The Government may have adopted this policy on the basis of wrong information and they certainly did not realise the consequences. I do not believe for one moment that the Minister came into politics to make the lives of the vulnerable, the disabled and the elderly more difficult. I am sure that that is not the case but, unfortunately, that is what has happened. The whole country is praying and hoping that in the case of rural post offices, Jim really can fix it.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1766" name="Sarah McCarthy-Fry">my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry)</phrase> on securing the debate on the future of Portsmouth naval base and for giving me the opportunity to speak on this important issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/2">I acknowledge the strong links between the naval base and the city of Portsmouth, which go back for more than 800 years. The people of Portsmouth have provided unparalleled support to the Royal Navy in peacetime and in wartime. I am mindful of my announcement of the planning for next year's commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the Falklands conflict; the role that Portsmouth played in that conflict should be recognised. I believe that my hon. Friend had occasion to visit the Falkland Islands recently and no doubt witnessed at first hand the stability secured by our armed forces that is now enjoyed by the Falkland Islanders.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/3">My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Defence announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-18">18 September</phrase> that we were about to undertake an in-depth review of infrastructure requirements at the naval bases at Devonport, Portsmouth and on the Clyde. He pointed out that the defence industrial strategy published in 2005 laid down a challenge to the UK maritime industry to reduce its overheads and invest in the facilities and skills needed to meet the demands of the Royal Navy's future warship programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/4">We have also made it clear that we cannot expect to rely on the industry alone to achieve the necessary rationalisation to ensure the future affordability of the warship programme. We also need to look at our support capacity at the naval bases, to ensure that it is matched appropriately to the future needs of the Royal Navy. We need to ensure that every penny counts and that resources are rightly focused on the front line. We must not lose sight of the fact that the number of ships requiring maintenance and repair has been steadily reducing. As my hon. Friend has heard before, we must be realistic, and look to the future rather than dwell in the past. That is not to say that we should not celebrate the remarkable achievements of the past, but we need to take this opportunity to consider our future support needs in detail.</p>
