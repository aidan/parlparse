<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-24a.495.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1520" speakername="Gwyneth Dunwoody" colnum="495"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051124/halltext/51124h01.htm#51124h01_spnew11">
	<p pid="a.495.2/1">My hon. Friend is right to take me to task in as much as the Committee did not specifically include a paragraph about community rail. However, it stands to reason that whatever is done in the realm of road pricing and congestion charging will have a direct impact not just on the use of public transport, but on something as basic as emissions. The Government are obviously serious about trying to hit their targets on emissions, and we need to know whether they have considered the implications of those schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.2/2">If the Government model a revenue-neutral road-pricing scheme and say that that will increase the distance travelled and therefore add to climate change emissions, we need to know whether they intend to go ahead with a revenue-neutral system, or whether they would prefer to use a charging scheme to discourage the extra use and encourage people on to public transport. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> made that point earlier, and it remains one of the most important questions in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.2/3">I am not clear what analysis has been done of the potential impact of congestion charging on the strategic network. I am not clear why the Government are saying that the case has not been made without setting out why they have reached that conclusion. I do not know why the Government do not seem to recognise that there are congestion problems on inter-urban strategic roads&mdash;now&mdash;that need to be dealt with. I am not at all sure that the objectives that the Government set out at the beginning of the report have been accepted.</p>

	<p pid="a.496.0/1">As I said earlier, what worried the Committee was the feeling that the Government control the inter-urban road system. They say that they believe in congestion charging and they make many sensible arguments in favour of a road charging scheme, but they are also putting pressures on local authorities by saying, &quot;We want you to do this, but if you don't you won't get the extra support for the other schemes that concern you.&quot; However, they are not necessarily proceeding with something that would demonstrate that congestion charging works.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.0/2">I am a bear of little brain, but if one shows people something that works, most are more responsive. Local authorities face enormous pressure from their local population, who are ambivalent about congestion charging schemes, however presented. Even those who benefit from the schemes will still complain about London's congestion scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.0/3">Local authorities must be given positive signs that the report represents a way forward and that it can help. It is only a management tool, and I hope that my Committee has made it clear that congestion charging, whether inter-urban or local, can only be a management tool. If the United Kingdom continues to buy the combustion engine at the rate at which it does every week, we shall face considerable problems. However, the Government should at least have the honesty, clarity and confidence not to say, &quot;Well, we'll think about this for another two years and then we'll set out where our pilot schemes will be.&quot; They should be saying, &quot;We know that we cannot continue this way. We know that traffic is rising at rates that we find uncomfortable&mdash;in cities, in villages and on our inter-urban roads. This is a way forward, and this is what we intend to do.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.496.0/4">In the next six months, the Government could announce a timetable and a pilot area for the scheme. They could offer incentives to local authorities and positive encouragement to people to face up to difficult questions.</p>

	<p pid="a.497.1/1">Sir Nicholas, as may have become clear as a result of the time that elapsed between <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1520" name="Gwyneth Dunwoody">the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody)</phrase> sitting down and the next Member rising, I had not intended to intervene. I am attending the debate because I have a historic interest in it. A long time ago, when I was Secretary of State for Transport, it was an issue with which we had to grapple. I am slightly disappointed that so little progress appears to have been made since 1996, when a White Paper set out the broad approach of the previous Administration to road pricing.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.1/2">I am speaking from memory, because I have not come equipped with the relevant documents, but I recollect that subject to satisfactory trials of the technology at the Transport and Road Research Laboratory, and subject to getting the requisite legislation through the House of Commons, the previous Administration were broadly committed to the concept of road pricing. Again from memory, I think that we gave an illustrative price of 1p per mile on motorways as a means of starting the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.1/3">I find it disappointing that little appears to have happened since then. We have received several statements from the Secretary of State, one of which was almost identical to one made by Lord MacGregor when he was Secretary of State for Transport in 1992. There seems not to have been an heroic initiative from the new Administration. My brief speech is intended to give the Government some political cover, if they want it.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.1/4">I have no idea what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1825" name="John Hayes">my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes)</phrase> is about to say on behalf of my great party, and perhaps there will not be an absolute convergence between my approach and that of my party's Front Bench. However, for the strategic reason given by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1520" name="Gwyneth Dunwoody">the right hon.

	<p pid="a.499.4/1">Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I apologise for my earlier lethargy, which had more to do with the absence of lunch than the abundance of it. It may also have had something to do with my reticence to follow the powerful oratory of the Chairperson of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1520" name="Gwyneth Dunwoody">the Transport Committee, the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody)</phrase>, who I warmly congratulate on the report, which was extremely stimulating and touched on an issue of great interest to me as the Member of Parliament for Ruislip-Northwood.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.4/2">My seat is in the borough of Hillingdon, which enjoys, I think, one of the highest ratios of cars to households in the country, and its motorists express to me a number of the sentiments expressed by the hon. Lady.</p>

	<p pid="a.501.1/1">I thank the hon. Lady for that intervention, which was extremely helpful in reinforcing my point that the Government must make a case for value for money if the prime purpose of the scheme is to introduce a fairer system under which to charge motorists.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.1/2">The hon. Lady made some extraordinarily relevant remarks about the impact of a national road-pricing scheme on low-income drivers. The report is clear on the Committee's concerns about that. I hope that everybody would agree that it is highly undesirable&mdash;if I might create some mood music&mdash;to create a situation in which the roads are for the rich only. That would be wholly unwelcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.1/3">Is the reduction of congestion the main reason for introducing the scheme? Do we need a national system? It is worth considering the alternative of targeting hot spots with a pricing mechanism and, particularly, introducing road pricing on new capacity where that is practicable. Congestion is not a problem across the whole network, as my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire eloquently pointed out. Do we need a national system, given the huge costs involved?</p>
	<p pid="a.501.1/4">We need a solution now, not in 10 to 15 years, which the Government have made clear is the time when we can reasonably expect a national scheme to be introduced. In its understandable excitement about pursuing this huge project, the Department risks losing sight of the need for two things. The first is new roads. I am not talking about blanket coverage, but the Government acknowledge that they need to reboot their road-building programme to invest in selective new road capacity. The second is supporting soft measures. That, too, is clear in the report, and is suggested strongly in research that I have seen that suggests that, where soft measures have been introduced by imaginative local authorities, they have made a real impact. I am concerned that, as innovation funding flows into the system that is clearly earmarked for initiatives relating to road pricing, local authorities that have prioritised soft measures will believe that they need not bother applying those.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.1/5">My other concern about whether the measure will help to reduce congestion is: if it is to be revenue-neutral, will it make an impact if introduced on a national basis? My perception is that even the material petrol price increases that have occurred in the past year have not affected behaviour. British motorists still take their cars to the petrol pump and fill them up. I have not noticed a significant change in behaviour. That might be linked to my earlier point about the public's lack of faith in the public transport alternatives.</p>

	<p pid="a.502.4/1">I take issue with the hon. Gentleman's earlier comments. I understand that the congestion charge of &pound;5 led to a substantial reduction in traffic when it was introduced. More recently, concern was expressed that people were beginning to take to the roads again. One reason for increasing the charge to &pound;8 charge was not merely to deal with the revenue deficit but to maintain the impetus in getting people out of their cars. The hon. Gentleman's most recent comment&mdash;that only if the economic cost to motorists was significant would they use their cars less&mdash;was valid.</p>

	<p pid="a.502.5/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for reinforcing that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.5/2">Another concern is about the benefits. The list of benefits cited include environmental ones. Again, I reiterate my point. Are we sure that those benefits can be delivered on a revenue-neutral basis, given what has been said about the psychology of the British motorist and his sensitivity to price? If the Government are serious about reducing transport emissions, they would be better advised to focus their energies and political capital on reducing the cost of green cars and green fuels, whose market share is pitiful. Green fuels have about 0.5 per cent. of the market, and if we are to get a grip on the hugely important agenda of reducing emissions, the future lies in technology, not in demand management. To advance the debate, the Government need to be much clearer about why it will make a difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.5/3">Next, I echo the comments made by my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire. Where is the momentum behind the public debate that has been called for? In a speech in June 2005, the Secretary of State said that we needed to answer three questions. First, what sort of system did we need, and what sort of benefits would it bring? Secondly, was the technology available, and could we construct an affordable scheme that would work? Thirdly, what practical steps did we need to take in the meantime? That sounds great, but it seems that the ball has been passed to local authorities. Are they picking it up?</p>
	<p pid="a.502.5/4">Again, the Committee's report makes clear that guidance on local transport plans invited local authorities to contact the Department by January 2005 if they were interested in exploring a package of measures to tackle congestion. It reads:</p>
	<p pid="a.502.5/5" class="indent">&quot;The Secretary of State told us that he had received a positive approach from local authorities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.502.5/6">Can the Minister be a little bit more specific about how many councils have expressed enthusiasm about that? Has the Department decided who will lead the pilots, particularly the inter-urban pilot, which the Committee's report identified as being critical to advancing the debate? My sense is that local authorities have real concerns about the lead they are getting from the Government.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-24a.505.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="505"  time="15:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051124/halltext/51124h01.htm#51124h01_spnew44">
	<p pid="a.505.0/1">Had hundreds of hon. Members appeared here to speak about road user charging, many could have avoided the congestion charge on their way home by staying here until 5.30. I suppose the fact that they did not appear in droves proves that the charge is no significant deterrent to most people or at least not to people on MPs' salaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/2">If road user pricing is the answer, I would like to begin my little contribution by asking what the question is. It appears to be, &quot;What are we going to do about pollution and congestion?&quot; Both are thoroughly unacceptable. Pollution is unacceptable because of its connection with climate change, and congestion is unacceptable because individuals are inconvenienced and gross inefficiency is built into the economy. That will all be aggravated, according to Government statistics, by the projected 30 per cent. increase in road traffic; that will only make pollution and congestion worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/3">Pollution and congestion are related, but they are different problems, and solutions to pollution are not necessarily the same as solutions to congestion. For example, increased use of biofuels, which at least one hon. Member has mentioned so far, more efficient engines and so on provide a solution to pollution but do nothing for congestion. In fact, if there are fiscal incentives to use biofuels, the motorist may find that he can travel more cheaply.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/4">Similarly, solutions to the problem of congestion do not necessarily work for the problem of pollution. For example, one criticism made of road pricing in the Institute for Public Policy Research study mentioned in the Select Committee's report is that it runs the marginal risk of encouraging people to travel further, which will clearly do nothing for pollution. Road building is another solution to congestion that does nothing to ameliorate the pollution problem, although if cars wait longer because of congestion, whatever gain has been made by virtue of engine efficiency&mdash;and appreciable gains have been made over the last few decades&mdash;will be completely negated. The car will be sitting there with the engine revving over, going nowhere and at its polluting worst. There are, however, solutions that attack the problems of both congestion and pollution&mdash;for example, car sharing and boosting public transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/5">Before moving on to whether road pricing is the solution, may I make a few remarks about the Government's analysis? I would like some help, because they appear to be extrapolating figures for traffic growth from existing statistics and I wonder what that extrapolation is predicated on. A sceptic could argue that with demographic trends and the population becoming ever older&mdash;it is a known fact that older people are more reluctant to take long journeys and they travel less and use cars less&mdash;there will be disincentives in future for some people to travel. Is the projected 30 per cent. increase built on the optimistic assumption of economic expansion continuing as ever before? Is it based on increased car ownership? If we compare ourselves with other European countries, we see that there is scope for that. Compared with some other European countries, we have not yet maximised car ownership. Or is there an assumption that there will be a general increase in mobility due to the real cost of motoring remaining relatively static, and, perhaps, improving against people's net incomes?</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/6">Does the projection allow for the effect of congestion, which retards mobility to some extent? Clearly, if travelling around the country by car is a deeply frustrating experience and is much slower than one expects, one tends to do it less. This is in no sense a criticism, but I want the 30 per cent. projection to be analysed in a little more detail, or for the Government to share their modelling, which would equally help, as the figure is an important element in considering what should and should not be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/7">Apart from road pricing, there are other well known mechanisms for dealing with congestion, one of which is to increase road capacity. That is often lampooned under the heading, &quot;Predict and provide.&quot; Some people suppose that one has only to build a road and it will immediately fill up with cars, but anyone who has had the lonely experience of travelling up and down the M58 will know that that is not the case. There are examples of roads being built that nobody uses, or that people do not use much.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/8">When increases in road use are analysed, an interesting pattern emerges. Over the past decade, according to figures that I have obtained&mdash;presumably the Department for Transport has the same figures&mdash;there has been a 36.6 per cent. increase in motorway use and a 21 per cent. increase in rural A road use, but the increase in the use of urban A roads is only 5 per cent., so there is a variant pattern.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/9">When one takes into account the fact that we have fewer motorway miles per car per head of population and by gross domestic product, the case for never increasing capacity and simply taking measures to restrain demand or ration road space is not unassailable. I am sure that all hon. Members will say, when canvassed, that they are against road building per se, but if one speaks to any of them for any length of time, one will find that there is a scheme in their area that they consider to be good and not to have any of the vices that road schemes in general are thought to have.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/10">If one reads the Transport Committee report carefully&mdash;I hope that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1520" name="Gwyneth Dunwoody">the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody)</phrase> will correct me if I misrepresent anything&mdash;one finds that there is an element of hedging bets. Although the capacity issue is not ignored, the Committee says that a pure building capacity solution is not a solution in any sense. That consensus is shared across party divides.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/11">I agree with the Committee that there is still scope to reinvigorate Government support for softer measures, such as quality bus contracts and improved support for public transport as&mdash;I believe that this expression is used in the Committee's report&mdash;goods in themselves. I do not want to stray into the unfortunate issue of trams yet. That is a difficult issue because although modal shift is encouraged with trams, it is at an appreciable price, which the Government are increasingly reluctant to pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/12">There are other obvious solutions to the congestion problem that should be pursued in parallel with road user pricing, such as the better use of ports and port capacity. I am enthusiastic about the expansion of my local port, Liverpool. Freight and road access to that port is severely hampered, but many containers could be taken off the M6 and the motorway network in general if it were a thriving port with good access. Currently, that situation does not entirely prevail, but it is a mechanism that could be used to do something about congestion, as is freight transfer to rail. I think that the Minister will accept that there is scope for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/13">The broad, sensible view&mdash;I think it is the Transport Committee's and probably the Minister's view, too&mdash;is that road user pricing is part of a tool kit; it is not the sole item or a magic bullet. Indeed, it is not even particularly new or radical, although the Secretary of State for Transport said that it was radical when he introduced it and sought to excite the House with his proposals. As has been said, road user pricing has been on the stocks for a long time and goes back to the turnpikes. All my life, I have paid to go through the Mersey tunnel to the Wirral; at one time, I did not know that that was road user pricing, but that is precisely what it is. There is also the Greater London authority experiment with congestion charging, which has been broadly supported this afternoon. We all agree with the principle of road user pricing and we are all comfortable with it. We do not really have a difficulty with it and we accept it in various contexts, although we perhaps object to it in schemes that we dislike. However, the principle is well embodied in the thinking of all serious people who apply themselves to considering how we can better transport ourselves around the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/14">The big issues are how far that principle will be extended and, equally importantly, what the details will be. We can have a brilliant scheme, but if we get the detail wrong, we shall generate a very unfortunate, adverse public response. In years gone by, I was the council leader in Southport, which is the constituency that I now represent. At one stage, I rationed parking on the streets by means of pay and display. I did that against appreciable political opposition, and there were processions through the streets calling for my dismissal, even though I was just a simple councillor at that stage. The scheme had to be introduced, and somebody would ultimately have had to do that, but when it was introduced, some of the details were not quite right and needed fine tuning. Once they were put right, and people understood what the scheme involved and what the benefits were, they rapidly adjusted to it. Obviously, I have lived to tell the tale politically, in so far as the constituents of Southport have, in their wisdom, elected me as their MP in the past two elections. The issue, therefore, is over-extension and detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/15">As I understand their current thinking, the Government favour a high-tech and, to some extent, a high-risk solution. It is an historically unprecedented nationwide solution, and I am not aware of anybody in the world who has implemented or is implementing it. According to the Transport Committee's report, it will cost &pound;5 billion a year to run. It is based on new global positioning system technology, which is used voluntarily by Norwich Union customers. However, it is not used massively across the world and is not the traditional microwave number recognition tag and beacon system.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/16">There might be good reasons for using that system and the thinking might be that it will work extraordinarily well and that there will be no computer glitches. However, there are hitches. There are problems with synchronising what we are doing with what the European Union might want to do. There are privacy issues and issues related to who will own the satellites and what they will do with the information. I am not saying that those issues cannot be bottomed out, but they are complex.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/17">If I were the Minister, I would understandably want to learn more before going for the big-bang solution. Once we do that, it will be difficult to retreat. Like him, I would probably be encouraging pilots. The transport innovation fund perhaps involves some strong-arm tactics, but the Government are taking a carrot-and-stick approach to some extent. Word has gone out to local authorities that if they want to be splendidly rewarded by the Government, one thing they could do is pilot a measure of road charging. I can therefore quite see why the Government want to avoid a big-bang solution and wish to prepare the public, the motoring industry and the freight industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/18">As the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich said, the Government have not been helped by the collapse of the lorry charging system. I am a bit bemused by that. There are practical reasons agin it, some of which are in the Select Committee's report and some of which have been spelt out by Ministers. I wonder whether technical problems have been encountered that we might come across later if we opt for a massive scheme across the country. I reflect on the fact that Germany seems to have done something similar, although transport conditions and Government conditions are different in Germany. I wonder whether the Germans decided that there were serious technical problems of the sort that could well come back to bite us.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/19">Pilots have their place, but the cruel dilemma for the Government is that there are also arguments against them. It is often argued that pilots are unrepresentative because the procedure for charging people is not universal across counties, regions or countries, which results in all sorts of displacement effects that are not created if the scheme is nationwide. Some people would advance the different argument that if we keep setting up enough pilots, we may well resolve the real meat of the problem without having to opt for a fully fledged nationwide scheme. That was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" name="Nick Hurd">the line followed by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/20">The evidence so far is not terribly helpful. We have the examples of London and the M6 toll road. One decreased traffic and the other slightly increased it. It is, however, very difficult to draw obvious conclusions from those examples, because we may not have to the same extent in Manchester, Liverpool or Leeds what we have in London. A city might have a whole range of options&mdash;an excellent bus service, many trains and an underground system&mdash;and the people who need those options the most are probably the people who cannot pay the charges.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/21">I speculate on the predicament of a cleaner in Manchester under a road charging scheme who must go to work when the building needs cleaning, which is often early in the morning, and return in whatever congestion period has been set. That person does not have a lot of cash and cannot vary their behaviour by choosing to drive at a different time. Buses might not be running at the appropriate time or in sufficient numbers, or they may simply be inconvenient. All those factors could create the problems of social exclusion that the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich mentioned and that would affect ordinary city workers rather than people in the country. That point must be addressed in any scheme, and surely will be.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/22">People who have the opportunity to use the M6 toll road increasingly go via Birmingham. I am one of them, and I hope that I can give Department for Transport officials in the Chamber useful advice about what is actually happening. I used to avoid the M6 altogether. I would simply roll along in my car past the RAC building. It is a deeply unpleasant and tedious experience to be surrounded by large lorries.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-24a.510.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1825" speakername="John Hayes" colnum="510"  time="15:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051124/halltext/51124h01.htm#51124h01_spnew50">
	<p pid="a.510.3/1">What a good debate we have had, but that comes as no surprise when we are discussing a report prepared under <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1520" name="Gwyneth Dunwoody">the stewardship of the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody)</phrase>. I am delighted that she will be gracing the school with her presence tonight, as she graces us with her presence in the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/2">I welcome the debate on road pricing and the Transport Committee report on it. Road pricing is part of the wider debate on our transport system, the acute problem of congestion and the public policy decisions that have put such a strain on our transport infrastructure. In introducing the debate, the hon. Lady identified the effect on traffic; she talked about the displacement effect on smaller roads, and other possible results of road pricing. She dealt with the effect on individuals and communities, when she spoke about social exclusion. I want to deal with that in some detail. She also spoke about the effect on revenue, when she highlighted the tension between revenue-neutral and revenue-raising approaches. Those effects will permeate much of my speech, and they have permeated much of the debate so far. I am sure they will be central to the Minister's considerations.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/3">I am pleased that the Government and the Transport Committee recognise the severe problem of congestion. There is cross-party concern about it, and it is not a matter of partisan politics. I also welcome the willingness of the Committee and the Government to consider new ways of dealing with the problem of traffic on the roads. The Committee has done a good job of identifying the key difficulties, examining the possibility of a road pricing system and posing some key questions for the Government about such a scheme. I want to amplify some of those questions, and I hope to add some of my own.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/4">I intend to continue in this consensual vein, not just out of personal taste, but because we all want to support fair and effective measures that relieve the problems of congestion. However, I hope to ask some of the many remaining fundamental and critical questions about the Government's intentions.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/5">The Department for Transport anticipates a 30 per cent. increase in road traffic compared with 2000 levels by 2015. The Committee states:</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/6" class="indent">&quot;Congestion already has a strangle-hold on many of our towns and cities at rush hour and on important parts of the strategic road network.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/7">The danger of the Government's approach is that it fails to deal with the root causes of that extra demand. The answer cannot be simply to price the poorest and most vulnerable members of our society out of travel, when it is becoming increasingly difficult to go about one's everyday business without embarking on long and numerous journeys.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">My right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> said that there are two ways of dealing with congestion and, for once, I disagree with him to some extent. He said that the problem can be dealt with either by taking a non-interventionist approach and allowing congestion or by intervening and introducing what I think he described as a measured form of pricing. However, there is a further way of dealing with that problem&mdash;by examining and adjusting demand. Indeed, when the Government came to office, they were quite bold about that. In their early days, they recognised that transport policies were not simply a matter of reacting to an inevitable circumstance of ever-growing demand and were prepared to look at how that demand could be altered.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/9">I therefore want to talk a little about the change in traffic, travel and transport, and how public policy can affect demand. Although everyone recognises that growth in the opportunity to travel for pleasure has enriched our lives, the travel revolution has also had less desirable effects on necessary travel. People have become obliged to travel more and for greater distances than ever before in pursuit of everyday objectives. Government policy means that people have to travel further and for longer not only to work, but to access core public services. For example, policing has become increasingly remote: one in four police stations has closed since 1990, obliging people to travel ever greater distances to report a crime, or to deal with the police in an everyday way. The threat of regionalisation of health and other services is also likely to lead to greater demand for travel.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/10">There is also a greater obligation to travel to access shops. The average distance that we now drive to shop for food each year is 898 miles, compared with 747 miles a decade ago. The goods that we buy at supermarkets also travel for longer distances before they reach us. Although our lives have been enriched by the availability of exotic fruits&mdash;I imagine, Sir Nicholas, that you enjoy a star fruit or a kiwi fruit with the best of people&mdash;many products that could be produced locally now travel ever further to get to us.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/11">I represent a rural constituency in Lincolnshire where people grow a lot of vegetables. If I went into the supermarkets in Holbeach and asked for a cauliflower grown in Holbeach, I suspect that people there would look at me as though I was mad. They would not know where the cauliflower had come from, and even if it had been grown in Holbeach, it is quite likely that it would have been transported to a distribution centre and then sent back to the supermarket close to where it originated.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/12">We therefore have a serious problem not simply with access to shops, but with the distance travelled by the products sold there. The official figures show that the distance that food travels&mdash;known as food miles&mdash;increased by 15 per cent. in the 10 years to 2002. The use of heavy goods vehicles to transport food has doubled since 1974, and food transport accounts for 25 per cent. of all miles driven by heavy goods vehicles on our roads. As a result, the CO <sub>2</sub> emitted by food transport has risen dramatically. Some 19 tonnes of CO <sub>2</sub> were emitted in 2002 as a result of the transport of food&mdash;an increase of 12 per cent. since 1992.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/13">According to a Government report, time lost through traffic congestion, wear on roads, ill-health caused by air or noise pollution and accidents&mdash;all caused by food transport&mdash;cost the UK &pound;9 billion a year. That is half the value of the food and drink manufacturing sector, which is &pound;19.8 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/14">The amount that we are obliged travel has risen also as a result of the Government's housing, planning and employment policies. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">My hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> is a doughty defender of the interests of his constituents, and is known in his area as someone who will stand up against Government plans to create unsustainable communities. He will know that the Government plan to build 200,000 houses in four growth areas in the south-east of England.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/15">To drive that new development through, the Deputy Prime Minister is taking control of planning away from local communities and giving it to unaccountable and distant regional bodies. Incredibly, however, the Government have failed properly to assess the environmental and infrastructural impact of those decisions, despite repeated warnings from Committees of the House. The Environmental Audit Committee recently reported:</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/16" class="indent">&quot;It is astounding that despite the clear need for an assessment of the environmental impacts of the proposals for the Growth Areas as a whole, nothing has been done to date by ODPM or DEFRA to address this issue.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/17">In short, it is important that the debate on road pricing and congestion is seen in the context of a broader debate&mdash;one about the impact of public policy on the need to travel. It is important that we consider the effect that obligatory travel has on quality of life. We want the Minister to liaise, co-operate and collaborate with other Ministers to ensure that decisions made by Government&mdash;the problem is not peculiar to this Government&mdash;are consistent in respect of their impact on transport and infrastructural costs, and the environmental consequences of those costs. That is the nature of the fundamental and wide-ranging debate that needs to take place, and I welcome the opportunity to contribute to it briefly.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/18">Early in this splendid report, the Committee says:</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/19" class="indent">&quot;What we urgently need is a proper evaluation of the costs of congestion and an understanding of the impact congestion has on the UK economy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/20">The Committee recognised the wider context that I have tried to highlight. An effective road pricing scheme will obviously depend on the evaluation that the Committee suggests. The Government's response to that is that they are</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/21" class="indent">&quot;taking forward a research programme to look into this area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/22">Will the Minister elaborate on what that programme is, and to what timetable it is operating? Can we have a proper debate on finances&mdash;the taxation and revenue aspects of the subject?</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/23">There is a fundamental difference between revenue-neutral schemes and tax-raising schemes, as the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich made clear. A revenue-neutral scheme would replace existing taxation with a new form open to more subtle manipulation, although the possible effect of displacing traffic from trunk roads to rural and smaller roads has already been highlighted. The logic of a revenue-raising scheme is that the ever-increasing demand for road use can be suppressed only by higher taxation. To tax road use is to treat a symptom, not the disease. The real issue is that we are obliged to travel more as part of our everyday lives. If we do not deal with that, we will be punishing the poorest and most vulnerable of our citizens; we will be restricting their ability to travel, even when it is essential that they travel to maintain a decent quality of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/24">I make a special plea to the Minister on behalf of rural motorists. As I have said, I never waste an opportunity to advance the interests of my constituents&mdash;something I have in common with you, Sir Nicholas. You will know that I represent a rural constituency with a sparse population, many of whom do not have of the luxury of easy access to public transport. For them, the subject is vital. Imagine if they were charged to do the basic things&mdash;getting to school, work or the most fundamental facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/25">Compare that to the example of the citizens of leafy Ruislip-Northwood, who, we understand from the excellent speech made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" name="Nick Hurd">my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)</phrase>, have more cars than they know what to do with and easier access to all sorts of local services. I have nothing against Ruislip&mdash;I do not want to suggest that for a moment&mdash;but the challenges and difficulties are entirely different in the two areas described in my speech and that of my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/26">Let us be clear: it is impossible to have a meaningful debate about road pricing if the Government do not set out their position on the fundamentals. Would road pricing be revenue-neutral or an additional tax? The Government response to the report makes no mention whatever of the Committee's conclusion, which states:</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/27" class="indent">&quot;There are strong arguments behind introducing road pricing on a revenue raising, rather than a revenue neutral, approach, if a national system were to be implemented.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/28">Why have the Government failed to respond, or will the Minister respond today? This is not a question of detail; it is fairly central. It is vital to address it if we are to inspire confidence in the Government's intentions and if we are to have the clarity of purpose mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood as well as an open and honest debate on the difficult issues and the related challenges they throw up.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/29">There is an ethical issue, which the Committee described as an issue of social exclusion. It is perhaps even bigger than that: how do we regard freedom to travel and where is it on the scale of importance? What do we believe people's rights and opportunities should be?</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/30">As a Conservative, Sir Nicholas, like you, I do not hold much truck with natural rights, but having said that people have become accustomed to having the opportunity to travel freely and in a way of their own choosing. We need to take the broader ethical question of the balance between obligation and freedom into account as part of this important debate. I know that the Minister takes such matters seriously, and, as I have said, much of the subject goes beyond the partisan Punch-and-Judy politics that sometimes characterises our exchanges in this place and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/31">The report also notes that</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/32" class="indent">&quot;without complementary planning restrictions, cheaper road travel in rural areas could promote out-of-town land-use development, and would further reinforce car dependency&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/33">I would be interested to hear what discussions the Minister has had with the planning Minister about out-of-town shopping and related planning decisions, which will have an impact on road use and maybe on road pricing.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/34">The Committee also expressed concern that a road pricing scheme would hit the poorest hardest, as I suggested, stating:</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/35" class="indent">&quot;While improvements in public transport and car sharing options would undoubtedly be an advantage to many people, there will still be disadvantages for people with low income who have no option but to continue to drive on congested roads at peak times.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/36">To be successful, road pricing must be part of a coherent strategy that addresses the number and length of journeys we are obliged to make as part of our everyday lives. If that is not the case, road user charging will simply displace traffic on to rural roads or make it impossible for vulnerable members of society to go about their business.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/37">There is some doubt in this Chamber, which has been expressed by a number of hon. Members, about whether the scheme would be national or local. The Committee reported in paragraph 58:</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/38" class="indent">&quot;If road pricing were introduced, the business and haulage sectors would want to see a single, seamless interoperable system with single billing. Without some co-ordination the administrative burden for businesses which had to deal with a number of different systems could be significant.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/39">In paragraph 62, it went on:</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/40" class="indent">&quot;Local and regional authorities must be involved in determining design and charges, but an overriding national framework would provide consistency for the user, as well as lowering the costs of implementation for the local authority.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/41">Will the Minister address in his winding-up speech the fundamental point of whether the charging scheme would be a single, national programme or a variety of local schemes? Is there any guarantee that the Government would use the revenue raised by road pricing to benefit motorists? Would that money be hypothecated? Would it be ring-fenced? Would it be ploughed back into the many important causes that are dear to our hearts and which assist travel?</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/42">We expect one of the coldest winters in recent years, yet the Government are consulting on a proposal to remove the tax exemptions enjoyed by snow clearers and gritters. That is shocking, and surely not a responsible action. I cannot believe that this sensible Minister would have any truck with such a policy. It must be an error, which I hope his words in this Chamber will put right.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/43">The Association for Public Service Excellence has warned that</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/44" class="indent">&quot;the move to remove exemption from winter maintenance vehicles in particular will have a considerable impact on budgets in what is a crucial and highly visible local authority service. The effect will range from authority to authority but could be as high individually as &pound;125,000 . . . With limited budgets the implication is that the financial resources would result in a reduction in the mileages of treated roads . . . It is estimated that the cost of a single fatality on the roads is over &pound;1.5 million. There is therefore a substantial risk that the suggested &pound;0.5 billion savings in fuel fraud will be less than the cost to the wider economy and the proposals will have an adverse effect on the overall economy of UK . . . the actual cost of these proposals will be borne by the public by either increased Council Tax or reduced services&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/45">I digress a little, Sir Nicholas, and I am grateful for your indulgence.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/46">I shall conclude by posing serious questions: some are amplifications of what the Committee has said while some give further weight to hon. Members' comments. First, as we have heard during the debate, the Government support the development of local and regional demand management road pricing schemes through their transport innovation fund. Will not that give rise to a plethora of schemes that are based on different technologies? If so, those schemes will do little to inform a nationwide scheme that uses one technology only. How will the results be judged and then scaled up for a nationwide scheme?</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/47">Secondly, which of the several road pricing schemes around the world have the Government studied? Will the results of those studies be published? Thirdly, what risk is there of the Government abandoning any future national road pricing scheme, as they did the lorry road user charging project? Abandoning that scheme cost the companies that were working to implement it tens of millions of pounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/48">I must take the opportunity to say what a powerful point the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich made about foreign heavy goods vehicles escaping the legal obligations that British hauliers endure. It is not really appropriate for our hauliers to be put at a commercial disadvantage because of the Government's inability or unwillingness to create a level playing field on which they could compete with foreign hauliers.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/49">The hon. Lady also said that that is a matter of great concern to her and to her Committee. It is of great concern to the Opposition, too. I hope the Minister can satisfy us that he is on the ball and dealing with that problem; I hope he urgently introduces proposals in the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/50">What assessment have the Government made of the possible effect that the local trials will have in displacing shoppers and traffic to neighbouring areas? How will businesses that find themselves suffering inside local congestion charging areas be compensated? Most will be familiar with what is often known as the cliff edge problem, whereby a business is located just inside a congestion charging area, but most of its customers and clients are outside&mdash;for example, a shop or a nursery. Where the scheme begins and ends is a real problem, although the Minister will have thought about that and, with his usual ingenuity, will devise an appropriate solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/51">Will any local or regional scheme under which drivers, at their own cost, volunteer to have positioning satellite receivers in their cars produce skewed and irrelevant results? Will car-tracking data be held? If so, by whom and for how long? What work is being done to ensure the compatibility of road pricing schemes across frontiers in the European Union? That matter was mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase>. How much will the GPS box cost? How can drivers predict how much they must pay for a given route? Will hire cars and foreign cars be treated in the same way as UK ones? We know that in London, for example, within the congestion-charge area, some embassies pay the charge and some do not, or so I am told. Does the Minister know anything about that, and might that precedent spread alongside congestion charging?</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/52">It is right in principle to discuss this matter&mdash;the Secretary of State has called for a debate, the Transport Committee has examined the issue, we are having this debate and we will have an ongoing discussion on these aspects&mdash;but I suggest to the Minister that the debate would be better informed if it were clearer where the Government stand and if they answered some of the questions posed by me and the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/53">The Minister will not be able to answer all those questions today, in the short time available to him, nor would I expect him to. I am happy for him to write to me, and he will wish to take the matter further in future debates. He might wish to adopt the style of inductive reasoning, whereby he starts with a theory and tests it. At the moment, we must deduce the outcome from sometimes disparate information and from uncertainties, rumours, hints of what might happen and the line that the Government might take. That is no way to hold a meaningful and productive debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/54">I hope that the Government can go some way to correct that. We must take these matters seriously: they involve the UK economy, the UK's communities and the well-being of our constituents&mdash;the citizens of the United Kingdom.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-24a.516.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" speakername="Stephen Ladyman" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for Transport"  colnum="516"  time="16:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051124/halltext/51124h01.htm#51124h01_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.516.0/1">I begin by thanking the Liaison Committee and the Transport Committee for promoting the debate and for giving us the opportunity to discuss these important issues. I seldom get to my feet with the opportunity of speaking uninterrupted for an hour and a quarter. However, since <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1825" name="John Hayes">the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes)</phrase> is anxious to be at home for his little boy's birthday&mdash;and I am rather anxious that he should get to that party and pass on the whole House's good wishes&mdash;I shall try to speak for somewhat less than an hour and a quarter.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/2">One of the dilemmas that the Government face is that when we come forward with a firm plan and a set of proposals, everyone says, &quot;You should have consulted more. Why did you not come to us to ask our views before you came forward with a plan?&quot; When we do exactly that and come forward with a blank sheet of paper indicating that there is an issue that we must address together, and that we need to grope our way to a solution, we are accused of not having put a plan in place. I rather feel that that has been the theme of t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1520" name="Gwyneth Dunwoody">his debate; it began with my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody)</phrase> saying that we needed to offer more of a plan and to include a timetable, a point at least partly reiterated by the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/3">We recognise that, as several hon. Members have said, the scheme will only move forward if we can get public agreement that it should move forward. Also, we have to get the public to understand how it will work. We have to deal with the complex problems that people are raising on how the scheme will work and the effects that it will undoubtedly have on social and economic policy. Unless we can deal with all those questions and come up with answers on which there are broad agreement, the scheme will not go ahead. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> said that he was offering a certain amount of &quot;political cover&quot;; I would not call it that, but he is absolutely right that we will not go ahead with the scheme unless there is political consensus.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/4">We have made it clear that if, ultimately, we end up with a national system of road pricing&mdash;and there is still a question as to whether we will, but we have to accept it as a possible objective&mdash;it will take at least 10 years to do it. That means probably two, perhaps even three, general elections between now and then. If we do not work together on the scheme, and if there is no political consensus and political understanding on the issue, there will be a temptation for somebody to say to the people, at some point during that time, &quot;If you vote for me, I won't do it.&quot; By that point, we may have spent billions of pounds on moving towards the scheme, so it is absolutely vital that we work together across the parties to resolve the matter. I am grateful that the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings has suggested willingness to do so, and that the Liberal Democrats have indicated a willingness to share ideas. I welcome that, whether it means corresponding or meeting. The Secretary of State has said that he is prepared to have discussions with Front-Benchers&mdash;shadow spokesmen&mdash;from other parties to try to get some understanding on the problems that confront us and the difficulties that we will face in resolving them.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/5">I must say that I do not know the answers to many of the questions posed today, and I am probably closer to the problem than anybody. I do not have answers to all these questions, but I know what many of the questions are, and I have some idea about potential answers to them. I know which questions do not yet have a full answer, and frankly probably never will. We have to accept that if we move along this road, some problems will be caused by the policy, and others will be solved by it. Nothing will be easy. We have to grope towards a solution that we can all buy into. Anything that I say in the next few minutes, and anything that the Government have said in recent weeks, has to be put in that context.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/6">We have started a debate that we genuinely want to hold. We genuinely want to identify the problems and come up with answers that everyone can buy into. We have some ideas and are putting them in the public domain&mdash;I will put some more before the House today&mdash;but I do not want anyone to think that anything in the debate is locked down or decided yet. None of it is decided; all of it is open to debate, discussion and moving forward. That will also apply to those councils chosen to move forward with us in developing pilots, and those that are involved in the pilots that have applied for money from the transport innovation fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/7">I told <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" name="Nick Hurd">the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)</phrase> that more than 30 councils have shown an interest in working with us on pilots and in being involved in transport innovation funding projects. We are narrowing that number down to a much smaller group that we would like to work with in the immediate future, and we will make an announcement on that shortly. I am sure that hon. Members will forgive me if I do not go into detail now; clearly we have to notify the House first. We will work closely with the short-listed authorities on recognising local issues, identifying how a pilot in their area might contribute towards answering the questions that have been asked today and clarifying the bigger picture.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-24a.521.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" speakername="Stephen Ladyman" colnum="521"  time="16:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051124/halltext/51124h01.htm#51124h01_spnew58">
	<p pid="a.521.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right and we must keep that possibility in mind. As we conduct the pilots, we may identify the ability to solve some local problems, and that may deal with the issue sufficiently well to enable us to slow down the progress towards national road pricing, or to decide that we will never need it. On the basis of our projections&mdash;I shall come to his point about projections shortly&mdash;the Government expect the increase in traffic in the next few years, and the increased congestion that that will cause, to require us seriously to consider the possibility that 10 years from now we will need a national road pricing system for all roads to change people's behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/2">That is our current conjecture. If it proves to be wrong and we do not need a national road pricing scheme, I have no doubt that we can slow down our progress towards it. That is one reason that it is important that we grope slowly towards such a scheme, using pilots to answer questions, using discussion and trying to establish consensus each step of the way, so that we can be open-minded about where it is necessary for us to go in the long term, but we need the scheme to be a clear possibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/3">The hon. Gentleman asked about our figures and whether our modelling is based only on vehicle numbers, or whether we took other factors into account. We take into account a wide range of factors, such as economic growth, demographics, the age distribution of the population and predictions about people's behaviour. When making any long-term projection, we are somewhat in the area of futurology, so we have to make some simplifying assumptions to come up with any answers at all, but we try to take a range of factors into account. If he wants to consider them in detail, they are on the Department for Transport website for all to see. If he has any questions about them, I shall do my best to clarify the matter for him.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/4">On the question asked by the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings about technology and how much the bit that will go into people's cars will cost, I do not have an answer. I am pretty sure that I do not want the Government to be in the business of designing it. As I have said many times in public, I suspect that if the Government designed it, it would probably be the size of a suitcase and cost several thousand pounds. It would be much better if we identified the standards&mdash;what information cars will need to exchange with the road pricing system&mdash;so that the private sector can become involved in designing the systems and building in added value.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/5">If and when we have a system of national road pricing, an obvious benefit would be to build the technology alongside satellite navigation, which is increasingly installed in cars as standard, so that the additional cost of providing the required information to the road pricing system might be negligible. People might want to ask not only, &quot;How do I get from A to B?&quot; or &quot;What is the quickest route from A to B?&quot;, but &quot;What is the cheapest route from A to B?&quot; They might also want a system that provides them with route-planning advice such as, &quot;You can do this journey most quickly if you do it at this time of day.&quot; The private sector would be well equipped to build that added value into the system if one were prepared to pay for it. Therefore, the Government should try to come up with standards that we can publish, which other people can then make equipment for.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/6">The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings asked about privacy, which is an important point. When the Secretary of State first announced what we were considering, there were all sorts of comments about the spy in the sky knowing where people are all the time. That is absolute nonsense and technological buffoonery. The spy in the sky is not a spy; the satellite does not know where people are. All that a positioning satellite does is to beam a signal that anyone in the world can pick up at any time, which tells the receiver the position and identity of the satellite and when it was beamed. Based on the satellite signals that the car receives, the equipment in the car carries out a process rather like triangulation to work out where the car is. Therefore, the equipment in the car knows where someone is, but the satellite and the Government do not.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/7">Of course, if we specified that someone's car must broadcast that information to us, we would know where they were, but we do not have to specify such a system. We could specify that the car must simply broadcast how much someone owes, how far they have travelled, what time of day they have travelled or the price of the road on which they have travelled. In those circumstances, it would not be necessary for the car automatically to broadcast information about its location. We can therefore deal with the privacy issues, and people should insist that we do so. However, they should not get hung up on the notion that such issues are a showstopper, because we can design a system that does not require that information.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/8">Several hon. Members have mentioned cost and social exclusion. On cost, we have made it clear that we do not intend the system to be revenue raising at this point. We are looking at shifting from the existing way in which motorists contribute to the Exchequer to new ways; we are not looking at the issue as a way of raising additional revenue.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/9">I take issue with what the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire said about the previous Government's 1996 White Paper, which did not deal with road pricing in quite the way that he suggested. In fact, it suggested looking into several possible ways of paying for roads and talked about the possibility of raising additional revenue, rather than the road pricing system that we are debating.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-24a.524.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" speakername="Stephen Ladyman" colnum="524"  time="16:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051124/halltext/51124h01.htm#51124h01_spnew64">
	<p pid="a.524.1/1">I certainly accept that we have to discuss such remissions. We must have an open mind. I would not rule them out at all. Let us not forget that, under the existing system, those essential car users already make a significant contribution through fuel duties, vehicle excise duty and the tax they paid when they purchased their car. How we deal with the shift in taxation from the existing system to the new system is not a matter for me. It will be a matter for the Chancellor. Other than my late mother, I do not think that anyone has ever suggested that I am in the running to be the Chancellor. These will be complex issues that have to be grappled with. Remission is certainly a problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.1/2">I recently had discussions with representatives of the disabled driving lobby. They told me that we would get no support from them unless we told them that they would not pay any road charges. My immediate response was that they were already paying road charges, so were they saying that they should pay less in road charges in future? Were they demanding complete exemption, or do we need to look for a system where they pay a standard road price rather than a variable road price?</p>
	<p pid="a.524.1/3">During that debate, the leading spokesman admitted that he makes a journey on a reasonably regular basis which takes him from just outside the congestion charging zone to another place just outside the congestion charging zone. If he went around the zone it would add only an extra three or four minutes to his journey, but because he has complete exemption from the congestion charge, he always goes straight through. He admitted that that was not an appropriate way to behave because he knew that the zone was there to eliminate congestion, which he was causing as much as anyone. He was prepared to engage with me and admitted that the issue is not as simple as complete remission of charges for everyone.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.1/4">Those are complexities that we must debate. I can give the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings and anyone in the essential car-user groups an absolute promise that we are completely prepared to engage with them and discuss how we would tackle the matter through the pilot schemes and any subsequent national scheme that we might ultimately introduce.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.1/5">Finally, I wish to comment on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the assertion of the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> that there were two questions to answer: one about the environment and pollution, and the other on congestion. I do not agree. The question that we must address is that of congestion. Environmental issues might be solvable by other means such as clean engines or incentives to use cleaner cars. We have just introduced the 5 per cent. renewable transport fuel obligation, which is one way we can begin to deal with greenhouse gas. It may be that once we have designed a perfect system that can deal with the complexities of congestion&mdash;we have identified how difficult that alone will be&mdash;there will be an obvious way to tweak it, so that it also brings environmental benefits. However, we must first concentrate on the big question of congestion, which is quite complicated enough. Let us not be tempted to get into a debate about a tax on gas guzzlers or other polluting vehicles. Let us deal with the difficult enough questions about how we resolve congestion.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.1/6">I shall finish where I started by repeating that the Government do not have a plan. We have set out our objectives and, shortly, we will outline how we intend to start groping towards a solution through pilot schemes. We are completely open-minded about technology and the other issues and problems that hon. Members have raised. We are very happy to engage with anyone and everyone including motorists' groups, people who represent transport interests and other political parties. We are happy to engage in that debate because we wish to reach consensus.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.1/7">No decisions have yet been made about how the matter will ultimately be resolved. We acknowledge the complexity of the issues, but we are starting to gain some clarity about the way forward. Shortly, I hope that we shall be announcing who will participate in the first wave of transport innovation projects, and we shall look for scope for further pilots. At this stage, everything is up for grabs. I and the Secretary of State honestly wish to solve the problem with help from across as wide a spectrum of opinion as possible.</p>
