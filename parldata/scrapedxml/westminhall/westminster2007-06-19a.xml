<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-19a.393.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1858" speakername="Michael Gove" colnum="393"  time="010:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070619/halltext/70619h0003.htm#07061940000430">
	<p pid="a.393.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Chope. First, I would like to join other hon. Members in paying tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> for securing the debate this morning. He laid out the challenges in front of us in an exemplary fashion with reference to two hard, complex cases. I appreciate the difficulty that the Minister will have in referring in detail to either of them, but the hon. Gentleman used them to illustrate broad, general principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/2">In particular, I appreciated the sensitive way in which the hon. Gentleman outlined the range of views on the vexed question of quarrying and quarrying development in his constituency. Undoubtedly his constituents suffer trivial disturbances and annoyances as a result of quarry working, but many of them will have been aware when they bought their houses and moved to the area that quarry work was going on there&mdash;he was quite right to acknowledge that. I would like to raise a broader point about the built environment, however, with which I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees. Many of us believe that housing development should be organic&mdash;in sympathy and in tune with the local neighbourhood&mdash;so local materials should be used. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" name="John Leech">The hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech)</phrase> made a very good point in a different context about the appropriateness of maintaining high aesthetic standards in development.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/3">The quality of limestone found in the constituency of the hon. Member for Northavon, and across the west country, is sufficient to allow sympathetic development elsewhere in the area. If we are to ensure that the necessary additional housing in the south-west is built in harmony with existing housing and in a way that wins the consent of local people, quarrying, such as that which takes place in his constituency, will have to continue. There is another layer of complexity, therefore, that means that the whole planning system has to take into account and balance a variety of conflicting or overlapping objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/4">This debate is taking place because the planning system is dysfunctional. Everyone who has spoken in our debate has addressed the way in which, not just planning enforcement, but the planning system overall, is not seen to serve the interests of our constituents, to underpin faith in local democracy, to reinforce faith in the rule of law or, indeed, to allow prompt and effective commercial development when it is in the interests of the community or the broader economy. The planning system has been tried and found wanting in almost every area.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/5">The hon. Gentleman mentioned an unauthorised development in the green belt in his constituency, which was consequent on the actions of a small group of Travellers. Once again, I congratulate him on the sensitive way in which he dealt with that issue. Everyone whom I know&mdash;certainly everyone in the Chamber&mdash;understands that the country has benefited from the rich diversity of traditions and cultures that make up the tapestry of British life. Some aspects of British life would have been impossible without Travellers and, as it is Ascot week, we should recognise that. Many of the events in the traditional British season, whether major racing events or local village f&ecirc;tes and fairs, would be impossible without the services provided by Travellers and showmen, so we should pay tribute to their contribution to British society.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/6">Once again, however, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, an appreciation of what Travellers and showmen have brought to our society is undermined by the actions of a small minority using the planning system in the way that he accurately described&mdash;they are playing fast and loose with the rules to push through unauthorised developments of a kind that make many local communities exceptionally irritated and lead them to believe that the law does not defend their interests. We heard, too, from the hon. Members for Stroud (Mr. Drew) for Manchester, Withington, and for St. Ives (Andrew George), as well as from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> about the way in which local people's faith in the planning system is tested when unscrupulous individuals or large developers think that it is more economical to ignore the law, take the hit, and profit elsewhere. That brings me back to something that we need to understand about the planning system. It is a legal framework. The rule of law matters in this country, and if people are to have faith in the system they need to see that laws are applied consistently and fairly.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/7">You will appreciate, Mr. Chope, having had the good fortune to serve alongside Nicholas Ridley&mdash;a genuinely enlightened figure in that role&mdash;in the Department of the Environment, that the planning system is about economics, too. If it is to work, it must work rationally and ensure that incentives for developers and others are aligned with good behaviour. At the moment, that is not the case. We heard interesting suggestions from the hon. Member for St. Ives and from my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point about how we might better align the planning system to ensure that penalties and incentives make developers behave appropriately. I would be very interested to hear the Minister's response to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" name="Daniel Rogerson">The hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson)</phrase> pointed out that one of many disappointments in the planning White Paper, which was a well-intended but disappointing document, was the lack of detail about how enforcement might be better secured. As he pointed out, there is a serious question about capacity in the planning system. Do we have enough sufficiently trained planning professionals to deliver enforcement? I would be very interested in the Minister's remarks on that, as well as his response to the initial questions posed by the hon. Member for Northavon about the way in which guidance has been framed to encourage and incentivise local authorities to be proactive. Of course, those two questions are interrelated. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, if a planning department is run off its feet dealing with a rash of new planning applications, sometimes enforcement takes second place to the processing of those applications. However, I am sure that anyone here with experience of local government, such as the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington, would say that guidance and resourcing go together. Adequate resourcing and clear, empowering guidance can provide local authorities with the means to do what I suspect every Member in this debate would like them to do&mdash;apply the law in such a way as to restore faith in the planning system.</p>
