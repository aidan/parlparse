<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-02a.245.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" speakername="Andrew Selous" colnum="245"  time="010:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080702/halltext/80702h0002.htm#08070259000470">
	<p pid="a.245.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Bercow. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1955" name="Frank Doran">the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Doran)</phrase> warmly on securing this important debate and on the tone and huge amount of knowledge and experience that he has brought to our proceedings. We are all extremely grateful. As the only English Member speaking in the debate, it is important that I put on record that this is a UK-wide issue. It is certainly not just a Scottish issue. The whole United Kingdom benefits from North sea oil, and every Member of the House should rightly and properly be concerned about the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/2">The hon. Member for Aberdeen, North was right when he said that the primary purpose of the debate should be to remember and pay tribute to those who lost their lives or suffered severe injuries&mdash;he mentioned burns and so on&mdash;in that terrible tragedy on <phrase class="date" code="1988-07-06">6 July 1988</phrase>. It must also involve more than that. We must ensure that we never become complacent about offshore safety, and we must do all that we can to prevent a similar tragedy occurring. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> reminded us, another major industry-related fire took place only seven months ago in Shetland, so ongoing vigilance is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/3">We have heard the accounts of what happened on that terrible night of <phrase class="date" code="1988-07-06">6 July 1988</phrase>. We know that 167 people lost their lives and 59 people were saved, many of whom had to jump into the North sea. It is a tremendously difficult time for the relatives of the dead as we approach the 20th anniversary. Children still mourn parents, wives and partners still mourn their loved ones, and people still bear the effects of terrible burns and injuries from that night 20 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/4">The Cullen report has been rightly and properly mentioned and praised by every Member who has spoken today. I am pleased that an official public inquiry was set up to establish the causes of the disaster and to recommend changes to the safety regime. It is important to recognise that all 106 of its recommendations were accepted by both the industry and the Government. Lord Cullen chaired the official public inquiry, which consisted of two parts. The first established the causes of the disaster, and the second made recommendations for changes to the safety regime. The final report was published in November 1990.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/5">The inquiry found a number of health and safety shortcomings. Workers on the platform were not adequately trained in emergency procedures and management were not trained to provide leadership during a crisis situation, as the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North mentioned. The approved maintenance paperwork system had been relaxed and there was a reliance on informal communication, which was not acceptable. Measures identified by previous risk assessment audits had not been implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/6">Lord Cullen's 106 recommendations were all accepted by the industry, many of them being a direct result of industry evidence. Responsibilities for implementing the recommendations were spread across the regulator and the industry. The Government accepted the recommendations in full and committed themselves to reforming offshore health and safety legislation. By 1993, all 48 recommendations for which industry operators were directly responsible had been acted upon and substantially implemented. The Health and Safety Executive had also developed and implemented Lord Cullen's key recommendation: the introduction of safety regulations requiring the operator or owner of every fixed and mobile installation in UK waters to submit a safety case to the HSE for acceptance.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/7">Parliament has not been idle since that terrible night. It has ensured that the appropriate primary and secondary legislation has been introduced to back up the recommendations of the Cullen report. The Offshore Installations (Safety Case) Regulations came into force in 1992. By November 1993, a safety case for every installation had been submitted to the HSE, and by November 1995 all safety cases had been accepted. The regulations require the operator or owner, known as the duty holder, of every fixed and mobile installation operating in UK waters to submit a safety case to the HSE. The safety case must give full details of the arrangements for managing health and safety and controlling major accident hazards on the installation. Parliament quite properly revised the regulations in 2005, in light of 13 years' experience. The objective of the revisions was to improve the effectiveness of the regulations while reducing the burden of three-yearly re-submissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/8">In addition to the application of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974, particular hazards in the offshore environment may need special consideration. Major sets of UK regulation therefore apply to the industry's operations. The Offshore Installations (Safety Case) Regulations 1992 are underpinned by more detailed regulations. The Offshore Installations and Pipeline Works (Management and Administration) Regulations 1995 set out requirements for the safe management of offshore installations, such as the appointment of offshore installation managers and the use of permit to work systems. The Offshore Installations (Prevention of Fire and Explosion, and Emergency Response) Regulations 1995 provide for the protection of offshore workers from fire and explosion and for securing effective emergency response. Lastly, the Offshore Installations and Wells (Design and Construction, etc.) Regulations 1996 are aimed at ensuring the integrity of installations, the safety of offshore and onshore wells, and the safety of the offshore workplace environment. That is what Parliament has done on the regulatory front since that terrible disaster.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/9">It is important to look at the safety record in the offshore industry since the Piper Alpha disaster. The latest officially sanctioned and agreed fatal and major injury figures for offshore workers are for the year 2006-07. There were two fatalities during that period, compared with two in 2005-06, none in 2004-05 and three in 2003-04. Sadly, it is still a dangerous industry that takes workers' lives, although, thankfully, in much smaller numbers than in 1988. Some 39 major injuries were reported during 2006-07, representing a fall of more than 20 per cent. from the 2005-06 figures. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1957" name="Robert Smith">The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith)</phrase> made the interesting point that the industry is not declining: in 2006-07, there were an estimated 28,100 offshore workers, which represents an increase of 22 per cent. on the 2005-06 estimate of 23,000. His point was very well made indeed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-02a.247.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" speakername="Andrew Selous" colnum="247"  time="010:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080702/halltext/80702h0003.htm#08070259000472">
	<p pid="a.247.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman is right to put on record that there is far more oil out there than we all thought 20 years or so ago. Furthermore, that oil is more difficult and technically challenging to bring to the surface than that extracted in earlier years.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/2">In 2006-07, the rate of fatal and major injuries among offshore workers was 145.5 per 100,000 workers, compared with 225 in 2005-06, so there has been an improvement. Let us consider briefly the major types of accident. Slips, trips and falls, being trapped or struck by or striking against equipment, and injuries associated with lifts, pulleys and swinging loads account for 83 per cent. of injuries. We have preliminary and strictly provisional figures for 2007-08, which will be subject to a full and detailed analysis, and possibly revision. Given the importance of the issues, however, as much up-to-date data should be put on record as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/3">According to those provisional figures, the HSE does not think that there has been a deterioration this year. There were no RIDDOR&mdash;Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995&mdash;reportable fatal injuries in 2007-08, for which we can all be extremely thankful, and the number of major injuries sustained was similar to that in 2006-07, 39, which was the lowest recorded figure since 1995-96. The combined fatal and major injury rate for 2007-08 is expected to be similar to that for 2006-07, which was 145.5 injuries per 100,000 workers. It is certainly pleasing that the overall figures for fatalities and major injuries in the offshore industry do not appear to be following a worrying trend, although there are no grounds for complacency, as all Members have said. Current statistics indicate a combined total of 74 significant hydrocarbon releases, although we await further details from a few duty holders.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/4">It is important, however, to look at the current state of the industry, and I have a number of questions, some of which have been posed already today, that I too would like to put to the Minister. I would be grateful for a general response, but if she cannot provide those answers, perhaps she could write to me and other Members present with the Department's view? That would be entirely acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/5">A few years ago, the general secretary of the Offshore Industry Liaison Committee&mdash;an independent union&mdash;said that</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/6" class="indent">&quot;all the elements that were there in 1986-87 and led up to Piper Alpha are there now&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/7">which is a worrying comment. However, we have heard from several Members this morning about the concerns that the pipelines and compressors are old and were perhaps intended to last for 20 or 25 years only. Is the Minister satisfied that the inspection regime, particularly for pipelines and compressors and other such vital infrastructure, is up to the job? What reassurances can she provide that she is confident in and satisfied with the inspection regime? Many of the pipelines and compressors were not expected to last for a further 10 or 15 years. We need reassurances on that very important point.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/8">The hon. Member for Aberdeen, North suggested that we introduce independent safety inspectors. The Minister will know as well as I do that there is a long tradition of workers within the coal mining industry appointing, perhaps through trade unions, their own safety representatives. I do not know the view of the then National Coal Board when that was introduced, but it has proved incredibly successful in the coal industry and has given real confidence to the work force, because they are working alongside, and have nominated, those supervising, or having a major input into, their safety. There might be valid practical reasons why that would not work, or be applicable, in the offshore oil industry, but if so, I would like to hear that from the Minister. I would also be interested to know whether she thinks that that could be explored to ensure that the safety statistics that I outlined continue to follow a downward trend.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/9">Finally, while researching this debate, I learned that the HSE had imposed a target to reduce by 2004 the number of offshore hydrocarbon releases to 50 per cent. of the 1999-2000 baseline figure, but I could not find out whether that target had been met. Perhaps the Minister, or one of her officials, has the answer, but if not, will she be kind enough to write to me?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-02a.248.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2013" speakername="Anne McGuire" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions"  colnum="248"  time="010:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080702/halltext/80702h0003.htm#08070259000473">
	<p pid="a.248.0/1">It is a pleasure to respond to this debate and to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Bercow&mdash;this is the first time that you and I have met in this arena.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1955" name="Frank Doran">the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Doran)</phrase> on his success in the ballot and on introducing this appropriate debate to mark the 20th anniversary of the Piper Alpha disaster. Those of us who sat through his speech will have found it a powerful and moving narrative of exactly what happened that day and in the aftermath. Certainly he brought back for me many of the images from that day, and many of us will have watched from the safety of our own homes and work places as those terrible events unfolded. Nowadays, we have 24-hour news coverage and direct access to information on all sorts of disasters, and we cannot overestimate how dreadful it was for the families not to know what was happening out on Piper Alpha. I also recognise his contribution to the promotion of health and safety standards in the North sea. He has campaigned inside and outside this House, and after listening to him this morning, we all appreciate why.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/3">It is important that we remember with sympathy those who lost their lives in that terrible disaster, 20 years ago, the families of those people, and those who were injured in the disaster. As colleagues have said, it has had a lasting effect, and there is a dark memory and image of it across many communities in Scotland and beyond. I think that it was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" name="Nigel Evans">the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans)</phrase> who highlighted, in an intervention, what my hon. Friend was saying: the focal point was undoubtedly Aberdeen and the north-east, but the disaster touched communities all over the country. In my town, three men lost their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/4">The message from this morning's debate is that we never want to see a repeat of that disaster. It was a wake-up call both for the offshore oil and gas industry and, as my hon. Friend pointed out, for the then Government. I know that he held many meetings with Ministers at that time. The cost of the disaster was very large in terms of the number of lives that were lost or shattered, and it cost &pound;2 billion in damage and lost production. It also emphasised, in the starkest possible way, the importance of the oil industry to this country and the importance of having a strong safety regime offshore for the viability of a key sector of the UK economy. The industry employs 30,000 people and supports hundreds of thousands more jobs onshore. There are billions of pounds' worth of offshore investment, and there is likely to be even more investment with the introduction of carbon capture and storage. All that is at risk if safety standards are not given the highest priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/5">Many hon. Members have mentioned the Cullen inquiry. We agree that one result of the disaster was one of the most radical reforms ever made to a regulatory regime. Lord Cullen's 1990 public inquiry report made 106 far-reaching recommendations, which have been mentioned, all of which have been implemented&mdash;some by the Government and some by the industry. There have been major achievements since then, such as the transfer of responsibility for regulating health and safety in the offshore oil and gas industry from the Department of Energy to the Health and Safety Executive in 1991&mdash;a move that was welcomed across the board. Another major achievement was the replacement of the earlier, prescriptive health and safety regime with a new goal-setting series of regulations that were made under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/6">The cornerstone of the new regime is the Offshore Installations (Safety Case) Regulations 1992. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> said, those regulations came into effect in 1993, and they have since been revised and modernised. They implemented Lord Cullen's key recommendation that offshore duty holders should systematically identify major offshore hazards, assess the risks, set out the necessary controls in a safety case and submit it to the HSE. No installation can operate in UK waters unless the HSE formally accepts a safety case for it. It is not just about regulation: the industry's whole approach to health and safety was galvanised after Cullen. The offshore industry spent more than &pound;2 billion on health and safety improvements between 1988 and 1998, and has spent much more since.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/7">Certainly, the aftermath of the Piper Alpha disaster saw a huge and necessary improvement in health and safety standards offshore. In the 20 years since then, there has been a significant reduction in health and safety risks and the industry has come a long way. I pay tribute to the work of the HSE in setting the regulatory framework and in leading the industry and other players towards having a better health and safety record offshore. However, as colleagues have pointed out, there are still issues affecting the industry's health and safety performance that need to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/8">The North sea and other offshore areas remain hazardous places to work. I do not know if you have ever been offshore, Mr. Bercow, but even on a short visit, one has to go through the safety procedures and must understand that it is not a jaunt in a helicopter and that one is going out to a hazardous work regime. Like many hon. Members, I have done that. If one did not appreciate before that it is a difficult area in which to work, one realises it afterwards. Even visitors need to be alert to the health and safety issues and to their responsibilities as individuals, and the industry has to ensure that they not only get out there safely, but get back safely too. There are hazards from the hostile environment and from the possibility of helicopter crashes, ship collisions, structural collapse, explosions, fires and well blowouts. The potential for a major accident remains, and control of that risk demands constant and close attention from duty holders and the HSE, as the industry's health and safety regulator.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/9">The industry is dynamic and constantly changing. It is highly innovative, and develops cutting-edge technology to solve both old and new problems. Innovation is potentially good for health and safety, as well as exploration and production, because it provides opportunities to design out risks. The HSE is responsive to changing circumstances and is very happy to work with the industry to develop solutions that improve efficiency and raise safety standards. Health and safety should not be costly afterthoughts; it should be an integral part of managing offshore operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/10">The risk of a major offshore incident is ever present. Even given the huge strides forward on health and safety over the years, it is essential that vigilance is maintained and that the lessons of Piper Alpha are not forgotten. The incident at BP's Texas City refinery is a recent example in the sector of the disastrous consequences that can occur when safety issues are not given the highest priority. We must all redouble our efforts to avoid a similar occurrence in UK waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/11">I should like to recognise the industry's efforts to improve health and safety through Oil and Gas UK, the Offshore Industry Advisory Committee and Step Change in Safety. In addition, the Government-led forum, PILOT, is concentrating on health and safety offshore, which I welcome. At last week's PILOT meeting, I called on the industry to raise its game on health and safety still further. I called in particular on people at the top of the industry to show greater leadership to raise those standards. I am doing that because of some of the worrying messages that flowed from the HSE's &quot;Offshore Asset Integrity and Inspection Report&quot;, which was published in November, on key programme 3. My hon. Friend touched on many of the issues that the report raised. As those elements are safety critical, any failure could result in a major incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/12">The results are worrying because even after 20 years of giving high attention to health and safety issues, the report drew attention to a number of weaknesses. The report reached several conclusions, such as that the offshore industry's poor performance and lack of progress in improving areas of asset integrity raises the concern that senior managers may not fully appreciate the implications that that could have on safety and business performance. It concluded that many senior managers do not make adequate use of integrity management data and do not give sufficient priority to ongoing maintenance. It said that the most senior management levels in companies need better key indicators of performance to inform decision making and to focus resources, and it found that many management monitoring systems tend to be overly biased towards occupational risk data at the expense of major hazard precursors.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/13">The report also concluded that a key element in balancing priorities is ensuring that the engineering function has sufficient authority to put forward the case for major hazard control and to act as a backstop against degraded safety-critical elements and safety-related equipment and structure. It concluded that the influence of the engineering function has declined in many companies, and that there is poor communication not only between companies&mdash;my hon. Friend mentioned that&mdash;but between installations within companies. The industry is not effectively sharing good and best practice. It also found that cross-organisational learning processes and mechanisms to secure corporate memory need to be improved. Although there has been progress, such matters show that we still need a renewed and continuing emphasis on sustained improvements, not least given the number of people who work offshore and the likelihood that that may be expanded in the future, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1993" name="Malcolm Bruce">the right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce)</phrase> and others have highlighted.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/14">As the offshore division of HSE conducts its regulatory oversight, it will use some key factors to hold the industry to account. Much of the offshore infrastructure is at, or has exceeded, its intended design life, which is an issue that has been identified this morning. Ageing offshore installations, changing ownership and management, worker inexperience, lack of corporate memory by managers, increased use of contractors and competition are among the growing challenges facing the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/15">Increased work force involvement in safety-critical issues is vital if the offshore industry is to improve its health and safety record. Incident statistics have plateaued over the past few years, and the UK is now reported to rank in the middle on an international basis, yet we have always aimed to be the best with regard to health and safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/16">Taking account of those and other factors, I am pleased to advise my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North and other hon. Members that the Secretary of State has commissioned the HSE to review the industry's progress on the issues identified by the KP3 programme. The issues include focusing on industry leadership to create a stronger safety culture in which the involvement of the work force, including the industry's trade unions, will be critical. We expect the review to be completed by April 2009, and the report to be published soon after. That report will be put into the public domain.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-02a.263.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1854" speakername="Richard Spring" colnum="263"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080702/halltext/80702h0005.htm#08070259000488">
	<p pid="a.263.2/1">It is a pleasure to see you chairing our proceedings this afternoon, Mr. Bercow&mdash;I am most grateful to you for enabling me to debate this important issue. I am also grateful to the Minister for being here to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/2">As hon. Members will be aware, NATS, which provides air traffic control services in the United Kingdom, has recently conducted a consultation on its proposed redesign of terminal control north airspace. The sheer demand for air travel has brought about the need for fresh consideration of flight path access to our airports and I therefore fully realise that there is a challenge that needs to be addressed. The consultation ended on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-19">19 June</phrase> and a feedback report will be published on NATS website towards the end of this month. The report will then be forwarded to the Civil Aviation Authority for approval by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/3">The proposed plans concern a large part of southern and eastern England, which incorporates my constituency. I would like to make it clear that I am fully aware of the benefits that air travel brings. There can be no denying that it is essential to the success of the UK economy and that it is an important part of modern life. Aviation provides some 200,000 direct jobs and a further 600,000 jobs are indirectly supported. The industry directly contributes more than &pound;11.4 billion to UK gross domestic product and visitors who arrive by air contribute a further &pound;12 billion a year to the UK tourism industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/4">In 1970, 32 million passengers passed through UK airports and last year the figure was 241 million, which is a 653 per cent. increase. A similar pattern emerges if we consider each individual London airport. In the past 10 years, the number of passengers who have passed through Heathrow has increased by 22 per cent.&mdash;from 56 million passengers in 1997 to 68 million in 2007. There has been a 31 per cent. increase in passengers at Gatwick&mdash;from 27 million in 2002 to 35 million in 2007. The number of passengers passing through Stansted airport has increased by 344 per cent.&mdash;up from 5.4 million in 1997 to 24 million in 2007&mdash;and Luton has also had a substantial increase in the number of passengers going through its terminals. In 1997, 3.2 million passengers passed through Luton compared with 10 million in 2007, which is a 212 per cent. increase. Finally, in the past five years, the number of passengers who have passed through London City airport has increased by 82 per cent.&mdash;from 1.6 million in 2002 to 3 million in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/5">According to the latest published forecast, the number of passengers passing through UK airports by 2030 will be between 450 million and 530 million, which is twice the number it is today. More than half of the total UK demand that is forecast for 2030 is for airports in the south-east of England. Stansted will have between 51 million to 60 million passengers passing through its terminals, which is a 150 per cent. increase. In the past 10 years, air transport movements have increased at London airports by 35 per cent.&mdash;from 739,000 movements in 1996 to 994,000 in 2006. At Stansted, there has been an increase of 153 per cent. in air transport movements in the past 10 years&mdash;from 75,000 in 1996 to 190,000 in 2006. BAA wants to increase flights on the existing runway to 260,000 and then open a second runway to accommodate 500,000 flights a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/6">Although it is important for London to continue to be a hub for air passengers, it is also important to ensure that a balance is achieved. The biggest change proposed for the Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and north-east Essex area is to increase the number of holds for Stansted and Luton arrivals from two to three. The two Stansted holds would be south of Newmarket between Hadleigh and Stowmarket. One of the main factors that NATS considered when designing the proposed changes was to try to avoid populated areas at lower heights. However, in doing that, the proposed changes would have an unfair and disproportionate impact on rural areas. The Campaign to Protect Rural England is concerned that the plans will mean that planes are rerouted over areas of natural beauty.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/7">Under the proposals, aircraft will descend in spirals to 7,000 ft before breaking out of the holding pattern to make their approach to Stansted. Areas to the south of Newmarket and Bury St. Edmunds, including some areas close to Newmarket that are presently not normally over-flown at all, would be over-flown by as little as 4,000 ft. That would lead to noise levels of between 58 to 73 decibels, which is against the Suffolk local transport plan objective to improve the ambient noise climate within the county.</p>

	<p pid="a.273.0/1">It is a pleasure to participate in this debate. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" name="David Gauke">the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke)</phrase>. He named a number of places that I know particularly well, as I was a borough councillor for Aldbury and Wigginton. I have probably met the very same people who have been lobbying him about the aircraft issues that he discussed. It shows that the issue is ongoing, and that a solution&mdash;although that is probably the wrong word to use&mdash;does not seem to be on the horizon. I hope that this debate will provide another opportunity for the Government to clarify where we are going.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1854" name="Richard Spring">the Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring)</phrase>, who brought an interesting angle to this discussion. As the shadow Minister for tourism and for gambling, I take a particular interest in our flight paths, not only because of who is inside them and how people can get from the plane through the airport to their destination efficiently, but because we have one of the best horse racing industries in the world. We can say proudly that we hold eight of the top 12 international races. As my hon. Friend mentioned, those will be threatened if we are not careful about protecting the industry. It is the sport of kings; I hope that it does not become a sport of the Government to ignore that important industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/3">The industry is important not just in the Newmarket area, but across the country, as my hon. Friend explained with some clarity. There are now some 60 horse racing tracks in the country. It is a thriving sport, but it is under threat. He mentioned football. From a betting perspective, racing is growing in popularity, as are international events abroad. If we do not harness, look after and nurture the racing industry, it will disappear. What has been identified today is Departments' lack of thinking about the knock-on consequences of avoiding considering the bigger picture.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/4">We have had issues with the Tote, the levy and on-course bookies. The Government could be accused of not taking horse racing particularly seriously. I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to rectify that, and say that he is interested in learning more about the impact on the racing industry of flights over the Newmarket area and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/5">I should put it on record that I am a pilot. I am not a commercial airline pilot&mdash;I would have to declare that in the Register of Members' Interests&mdash;but a private pilot. I am aware of the issues of stacking, the length of flight paths and how long it takes to go on to finals to land at a runway. Like many other pilots around the world, I am flabbergasted that the UK decided to base our main international airport downwind of our capital city. That is madness, because it means that almost every single flight must go across the capital, upsetting the city every time.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/6">The frequency with which flights now land at international airports, particularly Heathrow, has increased. Landings now take place every 60 seconds. We saw the chaos caused when a little fog crept into the UK only a year or so ago. There is no more capacity at Heathrow. Perhaps there is a bigger debate to be had about why we are investing so much money in particular airports and not looking at the bigger picture. The future is to spread out passenger and cargo airlift requirements more evenly around the country. It is not Conservative policy, but I would like to see an airport along the Thames estuary, where aircraft can land at will, upsetting no one but a few fish and birds. However, as I said, that might be for a different debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/7">My hon. Friend focused on the impact on horse racing and raised some important questions about the consultation. I reiterate: what other options were placed on the table? What other considerations were put forward? We might be able to say, &quot;Maybe Newmarket isn't the answer. Maybe we could consider something else as well.&quot; From my experience of the airlines, there is nothing wrong with having a stacking system over the sea. It could easily be done. Planes would simply have a long ride-in time on finals. It would not be a problem, but we do not even know whether that was considered, because the consultation does not allow it. I hope that the Minister will heed our requests to see the full set of evidence, so that we can make that judgment ourselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/8">The future was mentioned. If things are busy now, where will they be in five to 10 years' time? We must consider that in advance, not just for the sake of the horse industry but for Britain as a whole. I have huge concerns about the lack of long-term planning. The plans are based around airports, without any thought for what other advanced countries, such as the United States, have done in building new airports. JFK in New York, for example, is that city's main international airport, but additional airports have been built to take extra capacity, so that everything does not happen at one airport.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/9">That also has security implications. If something happens at Heathrow&mdash;whether it be natural, like the fog, or a security alert&mdash;London comes almost to a standstill, because there is no capacity to shift flights elsewhere. The matter is critical for our tourist industry. According to surveys of the business and international community, the biggest concern is what is now called the Heathrow experience. It is so frustrating to come through Heathrow that people deliberately avoid it to come through other airports.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/10">I plead with the Minister to consider what is happening, to be honest about aspects of the consultation and to be aware of the importance of the racing industry to the UK. In my intervention, I stressed that it is much easier to be aware of noise in the countryside than in urban areas. That factor must have been considered in the consultation, but as I said, we are not fully aware of what evidence was presented.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/11">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. I hope that things do not end here. I hope that the Government will begin to open their eyes to the bigger picture and take evidence from other parts of the industry, instead of simply arguing that tucking away stacking locations in rural rather than urban areas upsets fewer people.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-02a.283.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" colnum="283"  time="016:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080702/halltext/80702h0008.htm#08070259000507">
	<p pid="a.283.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I will continue with my responses to the points that have been raised. If I have time after that, I will be very happy to take interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/2">NATS is looking in detail at those and other concerns and investigating whether adjustments can be made to accommodate them. It might be helpful if I now explain the procedure for making changes to airspace in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/3">Airspace planning and regulation is the responsibility of the independent regulator, the CAA. The process for making changes to airspace is governed by the CAA's airspace change process. A change sponsor is responsible for developing and consulting on a proposal for an airspace change, ensuring that it satisfies and/or enhances safety standards, improves capacity and mitigates, as far as practicable, any environmental impacts in line with the Department's environmental guidance to the CAA, as mentioned by the hon. Member for West Suffolk.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/4">Informed by the consultation, the airspace change sponsor must then submit its proposal to the CAA. It is the CAA that then assesses the formal proposal against regulatory requirements, including environmental objectives, and either approves or rejects the proposal. If the CAA considers that a proposal could have a detrimental effect on the environment, it is required to advise the Secretary of State for Transport. It must refrain from making the airspace change without first securing her approval. Therefore, airspace changes are made only when it is clear, after consultation, that an overall environmental benefit will accrue or where the airspace management considerations and the overriding need for safety allow for no practical alternative.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/5">The hon. Gentleman raised the issues of aircraft noise, air quality and visual impact. Let me assure him that I recognise that, at a local level, those are issues of significant concern. That is why the CAA's guidance on the airspace change process includes substantive guidance on a range of environmental requirements, including noise, air quality, tranquillity and visual intrusion. However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members will appreciate that the development of UK airspace has to take place within a number of immobile constraints, such as the geographic location of airports.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/6">The hon. Gentleman is also rightly concerned about the impact of the proposal on the horse racing industry. Let me say that we fully recognise the importance of that industry and its value to the local and the UK economy. I know that representatives of the industry have submitted their concerns to NATS in response to their consultation, and that NATS will give them due consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/7">I come now to the hon. Gentleman's points regarding the height and location of the proposed new holds. As I have already said, I am unable to comment on the detail of the NATS proposal, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept that it is right that local residents were given the opportunity to raise those concerns in response to the consultation. NATS is now analysing all the responses received and considering whether any changes can be made to accommodate them.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/8">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> raised the question of the Heathrow consultation and alternation as well as mixed mode, the Cranford agreement and adding third runway capacity. The consultation on Heathrow already covers alternation and mixed mode. Obviously they will be examined in the consideration of the responses that have been received. As he knows, the responses are now subject to independent analysis. An airspace change consultation by NATS would have to follow any decision to produce with mixed mode or a third runway.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/9">My hon. Friend also asked about derogation of EU quality limits. I can tell him that the EU is likely to seek derogation. I will write to him with the exact details. However, that derogation is in line with derogations being sought by many other EU member states and it has nothing to do with the Heathrow added capacity situation and will be resolved by 2013-14, well in advance of any additional capacity that may arise out of the Heathrow consultation. As I say, I will write to him with the details.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" name="David Gauke">The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke)</phrase> raised a question about the lack of clarity in paragraphs 11.6 to 11.9. I can reassure him that the CAA will assess the NATS proposal, including the documentary evidence against regulatory requirements, and it is also for the CAA to consider the adequacy of the consultation material, as well as the issues that are submitted. He also expressed a hope that the Chiltern Countryside Group submission would be looked at closely by the CAA and I hope that I have reassured that that submission will certainly be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/11">The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East raised a number of points about Heathrow in expressing his views about our consultation, which concluded earlier this year. I certainly agree with him that issues about Heathrow are not for this debate, but it would obviously be foolish not to expect Heathrow to creep into any debate on aviation. However, if he looks at the material that we produced for the Heathrow consultation and the 2003 White Paper, he will certainly find the answers to a number of the questions that he put. The air transport White Paper committed us to making the best use of capacity at regional airports. A number of options were suggested by the industry prior to the White Paper; we agreed that there should be new runways in the south-east at Heathrow and Stansted, subject to meeting environmental conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/12">However, contrary to the allegations made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" name="John Leech">the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech)</phrase>&mdash;I think that he agreed with the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East and, forgive me for saying so, the hon. Member for Canterbury that this is some kind of &quot;predict and provide&quot; policy&mdash;there were bids for 15 runways, and the Government approved only four, only two of which were in the south-east. This policy is not about &quot;predict and provide&quot;, and certainly we are addressing the question of emissions. In fact, we are leading the world in respect of including aviation in the emissions trading scheme.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-02a.291.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" speakername="Meg Munn" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs"  colnum="291"  time="016:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080702/halltext/80702h0009.htm#08070259000514">
	<p pid="a.291.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1656" name="Emily Thornberry">the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry)</phrase> on securing this debate. The polar regions are incredibly important for us. This issue is rarely discussed in Parliament, so this is a useful, important debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/2">As my hon. Friend said, it is timely to focus on the polar regions now, in the middle of the international polar year, which has seen scientists from more than 60 countries mobilised in international collaborations to initiate a new era in polar science. The polar regions are of undoubted global significance: they have a profound effect on the world's climate and ocean systems and are a unique laboratory for the study of global processes, including, as she set out so well, climate changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/3">The United Kingdom has a long history with the polar regions. As my hon. Friend mentioned, this year is the centenary of the UK's claim to the British Antarctic Territory, which is by far the oldest claim to Antarctica, and it is almost 100 years since the heroic age, when Scott and Shackleton first set out on their Antarctic expeditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/4">Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the Antarctic treaty. The UK was the first state to ratify that treaty and, half a century on, the UK remains one of the leaders within the Antarctic treaty system because of the strength of our commitment and the size of our presence in Antarctica. The success of the Antarctic treaty in maintaining the continent for peace and science cannot be overstated. It is a valuable example of the international community's working together. We intend to mark the 50th anniversary by reaffirming the UK's commitment to the treaty and, in particular, the implementation of its protocol on environmental protection, which includes an indefinite prohibition on Antarctic minerals-related activities, except for scientific research.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/5">Both Antarctica and the Arctic face considerable challenges over the coming decades. My hon. Friend has set out a number of those, but I know, from my discussions with my officials in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, that there are far more than can be covered in today's short debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/6">The polar regions encompass some of the most rapidly warming regions on the planet. The resulting increase in melt has caused dramatic impacts on local environments and their ecology. It is predicted that the Arctic will become ice-free during the summer within a very short time span and boats may be able to sail around it, as my hon. Friend said. It is vital that we enhance our understanding of the consequences of that, both on the polar regions themselves and the rest of the globe. The work of British scientists is extremely important in this endeavour. The Natural Environment Research Council and particularly its British Antarctic Survey provide world-leading scientific understanding of the polar regions. We should surely aim to ensure that the UK continues to command such a position.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/7">Climatic changes in the polar regions are also causing shifting social and economic pressures on their management and governance. Turning to Antarctica&mdash;I am dealing with the regions the opposite way round to my hon. Friend&mdash;increasing summer temperatures and decreases in sea ice cover have facilitated greater access to the continent, notably by fishermen and tourists. The effective management of these activities, in line with the principles of the Antarctic treaty system, is one of the major challenges for the future preservation and conservation of Antarctica.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/8">My hon. Friend mentioned tourism. The number of tourists visiting Antarctica has more than trebled in the past decade. Those lucky enough to make the trip often return determined to play their part in the future protection of the continent and their more immediate environment. However, as she rightly said, with an increasing number of people keen to visit the continent, it is vital that the continuing growth in tourism activities is carefully planned and monitored. The UK is encouraging the Antarctic treaty parties to agree a future vision for the development of Antarctic tourism. As part of that, we aim to ensure that all tourism activities in Antarctica are conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/9">The sinking of the merchant ship Explorer last year was a salutary reminder that Antarctica remains a distant and inhospitable place. Although we cannot pre-empt the formal investigation, it is clear that the reasonable proximity of other tourist vessels played a large part in ensuring there was no loss of life during that incident. The UK already requires British cruise ships to demonstrate that they are not operating in isolation while in Antarctic waters and continues to encourage other Antarctic treaty parties to do likewise. We are also actively engaged in the work of the International Maritime Organisation to amend the existing guidelines for ships operating in Arctic ice-covered waters in order that they are equally relevant for both the Arctic and Antarctic.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/10">Accurate hydrographic charts are also vital to the mitigation of shipping incidents in Antarctica. More than 95 per cent. of Antarctic cruise vessels operate in the waters of the British Antarctic Territory. Yet less than 10 per cent. of these waters are charted to modern standards. HMS Endurance, the Royal Navy's ice patrol ship, plays a crucial role in gathering the relevant hydrographic data to support the production of charts by the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office. Back in January 2007, HMS Endurance was also involved in supporting the evacuation of passengers from another cruise ship that grounded in Antarctica. Having HMS Endurance working in Antarctica each summer not only reinforces the British presence in Antarctica, but also directly contributes to the safety of British nationals visiting the continent. We should be justly proud of this unique British ship and its crew.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/11">My hon. Friend rightly mentioned fisheries. Fisheries management in Antarctica is also covered by the Antarctic treaty system, specifically through the convention on the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources, which aims to provide comprehensive protection and conservation of the Antarctic marine environment, while allowing for sustainable harvesting of Southern ocean fish stocks. As an overseas territory of the United Kingdom, the South Georgia Government implements the convention requirements around South Georgia as a minimum, although there are also tougher restrictions in some aspects of the fishery. South Georgia's ensuring such a high standard of sustainable management has achieved Marine Stewardship Council accreditation for South Georgia toothfish.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/12">Climatic impacts on the Southern ocean are, however, likely to influence its fish stock levels. In addition, longer summer seasons are providing greater access to the fishing grounds. Illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing activities remain prevalent in the Southern ocean and present the greatest threat to sustainable management. We must be robust in ensuring that all our international partners continue to strive towards the greatest levels of sustainable ecosystem management in Antarctica. I give my hon. Friend the assurance that we will continue to keep this under close review.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/13">Turning to the Arctic, the environmental impacts from climatic changes there are even starker than in the Antarctic, as my hon. Friend said. Reduced sea ice is opening up vast areas of ocean for the first time. Increased hydrocarbon interest and shipping access has followed, all of which are having a profound effect on the Arctic environment and its peoples.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/14">The UK has major economic, political and social interests in the Arctic. However, unlike the Antarctic, there is no Arctic treaty. The issues of importance to the UK are largely covered by a raft of bilateral and multilateral agreements and a suite of international treaties. Most significantly, the United Nations convention on the law of the sea provides the framework for the management of the Arctic seabed. The UK also engages actively with the Arctic Council as a state observer. We regard that as an important forum for dialogue with the Arctic rim states on issues of mutual importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/15">The rapid changes in the Arctic also present a constant range of challenges. We are therefore conducting a further review of the UK's longer-term strategic interests in Arctic matters and how the UK should best engage with Arctic states on issues of mutual interest, through a joint FCO-Ministry of Defence project that will report later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/16">My hon. Friend delighted us with her stories and confirmed that many of the species that we hold dear are in danger&mdash;even if we do not know all the different types of penguins. My trip to the Falkland Islands helped me somewhat with identifying penguins. She is right to ask what will happen if we do not protect these beautiful, precious species. We have recognised that the polar bear is threatened in the wild and, although we have no remit to intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states, as I am sure my hon. Friend knows, we are committed to co-operating with the international community to address the threats to its conservation. One way we do that is through membership of agreements, such as the convention on biological diversity and the convention on international trade in endangered species. We will continue to work with all other states to try to ensure the preservation of these precious species.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/17">My hon. Friend talked at length about the narwhal, and we were all educated about its having been thought to be a unicorn. We share her concerns about the preservation of the species. I will investigate the level of assessed endangerment under international agreements, which will inform our action. I will come back to her about the matter, which was new to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/18">I would like to end by reaffirming the UK's continuing commitment to maintaining its leading role in the polar regions. I thank my hon. Friend for initiating this important debate, and I hope that the issues that she raised will be taken up more widely and by many more parliamentarians. It is something that we should be very concerned about.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-02a.295.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1960" speakername="Alan Reid" colnum="295"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080702/halltext/80702h0010.htm#08070259000515">
	<p pid="a.295.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Bercow. I do not know whether you recall the last time I served under your chairmanship in an Adjournment debate, but it was about VAT on the Isle of Mull. I am pleased to say that the then Paymaster General, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" name="Dawn Primarolo">the right hon. Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo)</phrase>, and Her Majesty's Customs and Revenue were very helpful after the debate, and the problem was solved. I hope that that is a good omen, and that under your chairmanship there will be a good result today.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/2">I applied for this debate after reading the HMRC consultation paper &quot;Review of Cluster and Individual Locations in Scotland&quot;. Of the 29 offices included in the review, the proposals recommend the closure of 19. My constituency suffers particularly badly from the review, with all three offices proposed for closure. They are in Dunoon, Rothesay and Oban.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/3">The proposals outlined in the consultation document are fundamentally flawed for many reasons, which I shall discuss in turn. The first is the loss of jobs in fragile communities. Secondly, I believe that the proposals will make HMRC less efficient, rather than more efficient. Thirdly, taxpayers will find it more difficult to get help with filling in their forms.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/4">I shall speak first about jobs. The proposals involve a reduction in the number of jobs in the offices outside urban centres in Scotland from 1,900 to 1,350&mdash;a loss of 550 jobs in small towns throughout Scotland. That is at a time when HMRC is not the only Department cutting back on jobs in small towns throughout the country. The Department for Work and Pensions is also transferring jobs from Jobcentres in small towns to large centralised offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/5">In my constituency, the three HMRC offices marked for closure employ 23 people, but that does not tell us the whole story because those offices have already seen significant job losses in recent years. The Rothesay office, which has seven staff, employed 16 just five years ago, and the Dunoon office, which employs 14 staff, has seen similar losses, so my constituency has already seen substantial job losses without consultation. The centralisation of those jobs reverses years of successive Government policy to disperse jobs from big cities to other parts of the country. Now, the policy seems to have gone into reverse, and jobs are being moved from small towns to giant offices in cities.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/6">Those job losses might not sound large if they were in a large town or city, but the communities that I am talking about are small with fragile economies, particularly Rothesay, which is on a small island. The jobs that are being lost are relatively well paid compared with most jobs in those small remote towns. People who are made redundant will struggle to find jobs locally that require the same skills set, and the job opportunities will be lost to the community for ever. As well as the direct loss of jobs, there will be a loss of purchasing power with a knock-on effect for other local businesses. It is important to remember that the work force are overwhelmingly female and are more likely than men to have caring responsibilities. They will therefore find it difficult to commute the long distance to the nearest remaining office in Glasgow or to relocate.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/7">The consultation paper considers the feasibility of staff commuting daily to the nearest remaining office, but it accepts that the nearest remaining office is too far away to be within reasonable travelling distance. Staff will have to choose between moving house or redundancy. It is important to stress that people who live in remote communities pay their taxes in the same way as people who live in cities. The local communities in these areas should be able to benefit just as much as those in cities from a share of public sector jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/8">I would like to draw attention to the Wick office, which is in the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1966" name="John Thurso">the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)</phrase>. He wanted to make an intervention today, but he is hoping to catch the Speaker's eye in the Chamber. He asked me to stress that the area around Wick is within the travel-to-work distance of Dounreay, where there will be substantial job losses during the coming years and that the loss of jobs in Wick is therefore very serious.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/9">The second matter that I want to mention relates to my doubts that the proposed changes will make HMRC any more efficient. The thrust of the proposals is that HMRC can do its job just as well with a lot fewer staff. I would like to draw hon. Members' attention to what the Treasury Committee found when it investigated HMRC as part of its 7th report of the current Session. Paragraph 119 of the report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/10" class="indent">&quot;We are concerned that the current VAT gap, the direct tax and National Insurance underpayments, and the deterioration in the Self-Assessment filing performance may be linked to the headcount reduction under the efficiency programme.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/11">The Committee went on to recommend that the Government should explain how they &quot;will ensure that any further efficiency savings are not made at the cost of further deterioration in HMRC's performance.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/12">In paragraph 128 the Committee states:</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/13" class="indent">&quot;There have been considerable problems with delays in VAT registration for small businesses. We have repeatedly been assured that the headcount reductions and efficiency programme as a whole would not cause a decline in the quality of HMRC's services. We ask the Government to explain why there has been a deterioration of service in relation to VAT registrations and what measures it will take to bring HMRC back on course.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/14">Will the Government explain why, despite all the problems identified by the Treasury Committee, they think the problems of underpayment of tax can be solved while shedding large numbers of staff?</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/15">Another saving that it is claimed HMRC can make is in relation to property costs. Why is HMRC proposing to get rid of property in small towns rather than in cities? It is obvious that property costs in small towns are significantly lower than in cities. I do not see how it is a saving to move people from a low-cost office in a small town to a high-cost office in a city.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/16">Computers and electronic communications mean that processing work can be done just as easily in a remote location as in a large city office. The ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne is a successful example of a company that has modernised its procedures while still keeping jobs in remote communities. Rather than centralising its booking system in one call centre, CalMac set up a dispersed call centre so that when a customer dials the number to make a booking their call is directed to one of many ports. The staff are therefore available to answer the phone in the same way as they would in a call centre, yet they are still located in various ports and can deal with local face-to-face inquiries, as well as with inquiries made over the phone. I ask HMRC to consider having a model such as that.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/17">Another type of job being moved is that of compliance officers. I find it difficult to understand how compliance will be improved by centralising compliance officers in big city offices. Moving compliance officers out of local communities will mean a loss of local knowledge and losing that valuable local knowledge will surely make the job more difficult. The Oban office consists of a detection officer and a local compliance officer. Will the Minister explain how those jobs will still be done effectively from Glasgow?</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/18">I understand that if someone's tax affairs are being investigated, they can insist on the interview being held near to where they live or work. That will mean increased travelling times for compliance officers and extra costs for HMRC as it will have to pay officers for driving their car or sitting on a train or a ferry, whereas at the moment the compliance office lives and works locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/19">I am also concerned about the job of dealing with local inquiries. HMRC still proposes to keep inquiry offices at Dunoon and Rothesay, but we have already seen cuts in the opening times of the Rothesay office. The opening times have just been reduced from 8.30 am until 5 pm to 10 am until 4 pm, which obviously makes it more difficult for people working during the day to visit the inquiry office.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/20">I have some questions about the how the new inquiry offices will operate. How many staff will be employed in each office? At the moment in the Rothesay office, one member of staff deals with nearly all the inquiries, but if they are off sick or on holiday, other staff are on hand to deal with inquiries. In addition, experienced back-office staff are on hand to assist the front-line officer with complicated inquiries. If only one member of staff is employed in the new inquiry office, what will happen when he or she is on holiday or off sick? If another officer has to travel from Glasgow to cover for holidays or sickness, surely that adds to costs, rather than making the system more efficient. Will there be health and safety implications if only one person is employed in an office? Will people still be able to turn up at any time during the working day or will they have to make an appointment? In addition, will a free-phone number be available for telephone inquiries or will the taxpayer be expected to pay the cost of the call to receive advice? At the moment, people can receive free advice by turning up in person.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/21">Until recently, the staff in Rothesay and Dunoon made regular visits to remote communities and held tax surgeries there. That was a valuable service. As the tax system&mdash;particularly in relation to tax credits&mdash;is becoming more complicated, HMRC should be re-instating such a valuable service, rather than moving staff yet further away.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/22">I have talked about costs, but what about carbon emissions? Has HMRC done an environmental impact assessment of the extra carbon emissions that will be created by staff commuting further to work in cities or by travelling from their city office to carry out compliance work elsewhere?</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/23">I have outlined where I think the HMRC proposals are wrong. Valuable jobs will be lost in fragile communities and a worse service will be provided to the public, yet I am not convinced the proposals will make HMRC any more efficient.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/24">This is the start of the consultation stage. I hope that the Government and HMRC will listen to the comments that I and other local people will be making and that they will reflect on the matter during the consultation period and withdraw the proposals to close these offices.</p>
