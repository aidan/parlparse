<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-04a.237.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" speakername="Jim Devine" colnum="237"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070704/halltext/70704h0001.htm#07070444000509">
	<p pid="a.237.2/1">Thank you for allowing us to have this debate, Mr. Conway. First, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on his new ministerial role and thank him for taking time out to come to the Chamber this morning. People might ask why we are having this debate, because bookies do not have a very good reputation with a lot of people. In fact, they are described as pickpockets who pay people the courtesy of allowing them to use their own hands. That is very unfair, because bookmakers bring a lot to racing, particularly through race track pitches. The last time I spoke in a debate like this, it was the week of Cheltenham and I gave out a tip for a horse, which came nowhere. What I did not realise was that half the staff who work in the Palace had bet on that horse, and some have not spoken to me since then.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.2/2">I want to draw the Minister's attention to a situation that is of grave concern to all bookmakers operating in the trackside betting industry. Under the Gambling Act 2005, hundreds of bookmakers throughout the United Kingdom stand to lose thousands of pounds in accrued business assets, because the Racecourse Association has decided that, as of 2012, it will no longer acknowledge a bookmaker's list position. A bookmaker's list position determines their choice of pitch, or pitches, on a race course. The higher up the list position a bookmaker is, the greater the choice of pitches on any given day. As one would imagine, the position of a pitch on the race course has a substantial effect on the revenue that a bookmaker can hope to make from the day's racing.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.2/3">Before 1998, such allocations were made on the system of inherited seniority, which enabled the priority of pitch allocations to remain within a given family of bookmakers. That outmoded practice was abolished in 1998, as it was rightly felt that it restricted access to new blood within the industry. Obviously, the concept of any system of inherited privilege should always be challenged in a just and fair society&mdash;I am sure that Members of the other place will wholeheartedly agree with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.2/4">From 1998, the rules were changed so that a bookmaker's list position, which at the beginning of that year was still based on the outmoded system of seniority, could be traded. Their greatest asset&mdash;the order in which they chose their trackside pitch position&mdash;could therefore be sold. That allowed bookmakers to realise the financial worth of years, and often generations, of hard work in the industry. To put that into a financial context, an official of the soon-to-be-defunct National Joint Pitch Council&mdash;the body that oversees the allocation of pitches&mdash; recently estimated the total value of bookmakers' positions to be in excess of &pound;100 million, a not inconsiderable sum of money.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.2/5">The change in the rules has allowed established bookmakers to expand their businesses and others to enter the industry. As was predicted in 1998, fresh blood is entering the system and it has worked effectively. The RCA is no doubt aware of the worth of the pitches. Although it is right to say that it owns the physical pitch, it has previously had no say in which bookmaker occupies which pitch. If the RCA were to control the allocation of pitches, the accrued worth of years' of hard work from bookmakers would transfer to it in the blink of an eye.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.2/6">Many bookmakers have invested thousands, and in some cases millions, of pounds in their list positions. I do not believe that, when the 2005 Act was first proposed, the Government intended to deprive so many individuals of their commercial equity. An article from <i>The Guardian, </i>published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-21">21 June</phrase>, mentioned a man named Barry Johnson who had spent &pound;1.25 million to buy 34 pitches in the south and midlands. If we continue to take the present position, that investment, made months ago, would disappear come 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.2/7">If the RCA proceeds as it intends, from 2012, all pitch positions will be rented out on any given day to the highest bidder. That will leave independent bookmakers, regardless of their previous list position, to compete with the larger corporate betting companies that will, no doubt, take advantage of the new system. In practice, we could face a monopoly whereby the big three or four bookmakers would determine the prices not only on the high street but on the track as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.2/8">Such a monopoly is not acceptable. To put it simply, many independent bookmakers will have no option but to leave the industry, as worsening pitch positions lead to a loss of revenue. Not only that, but their previous asset, their pitch position, will have zero value. That will render their investment, personal or financial, completely worthless. There is a great danger that our independent bookmakers will be priced out of the market by the larger, corporate betting companies, many of whom would, no doubt, pay whatever cost for the most prestigious positions on a race course. That would have a devastating effect on not only the independent bookmaking industry, but the image of horse racing in general.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.2/9">For those who purchased their list positions after 1998 from established bookmakers, the position is arguably even more unjust. They have purchased their list position at considerable expense and they are being told, despite assurances in good faith when the purchase took place that their list position was for life, that those assets will be rendered worthless as of 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.2/10">Modernisation should not result in the loss of millions of pounds worth of accrued assets for independent bookmakers. When a business has been established and built by a family, either to pass on from generation to generation or as an asset to sell at a later date, surely it is only fair that that family can trade that asset itself. The RCA has made no provision for, or even mentioned, any form of compensation for the bookmakers whose assets will be worthless.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.2/11">Horse racing remains one of the United Kingdom's best-loved sports and events, such as the grand national, are enjoyed the world over. Our independent bookmakers are an essential part of the industry. They bring a lot of fun and competition to the race track. We in both Houses should do everything in our power to ensure that they can continue in their chosen profession.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.2/12">I believe the RCA's decision to ignore long-established and regulated list positions from 2012 is not in the spirit of the 2005 Act as intended. When the Act was first proposed, much emphasis was placed on the regulation of casinos. Certain consequences for other sectors of the gambling industry, particularly trackside bookmakers, were perhaps not fully considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.2/13">I therefore urge my hon. Friend the Minister to revisit this important issue with the view to retaining the current system of list positions for trackside bookmakers. I fear we are in danger of doing a grave injustice to many individuals who have worked so hard in building up their livelihoods, and I encourage the Government&mdash;in particular, my hon. Friend&mdash;to address the issue with the utmost urgency.</p>

	<p pid="a.245.0/1">Thank you, Mr. Conway, for giving me the opportunity to participate in this important debate. Before I start my contribution, it would be remiss of me not to pass on my congratulations to the new Minister, who is a fellow Yorkshireman. His predecessor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" name="Richard Caborn">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn)</phrase>, who was the longest-serving Minister for Sport ever, is also a Yorkshireman. He has an advantage over the current Minister: he is from south Yorkshire, rather than west Yorkshire, and as we all know, south Yorkshire is the best part of Yorkshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/2">I will show that I agree with many of the comments made by hon. Members from all parties by quoting part of a letter from one of my constituents who is an on-course bookmaker. He is called Mr. Chris Johnson and he lives in Harlington, Doncaster, in my constituency. He has been an on-course bookmaker for considerable time. I will not read the whole letter, but those parts that I think are most relevant, as it encapsulates the problem of the current impasse that we face. I have, of course, recently sent the letter to the Minister's predecessor and have not yet received a response, although I only sent it around three or four weeks ago. The letter states:</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Dear Sir, I am a racecourse bookmaker whose livelihood will be confiscated on<i></i>1<i></i>September 2012 as a consequence of the Gambling Act, which comes into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-01">1 September 2007</phrase>.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/4">The letter then goes into the history of the establishment of the National Joint Pitch Council, and I will carry on from that point. He says that the establishment of the NJPC was</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/5" class="indent">&quot;heralded as an opportunity to introduce new blood into the ring and to give bookmakers the comfort of a stable career option at the end of which they would have a marketable asset with which to finance their retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/6">He continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/7" class="indent">&quot;As a consequence bookmakers have invested substantial sums in buying into the ring and to date it is estimated that the value of bookmakers' positions is in excess of &pound;100 million. Many bookmakers have invested heavily into the ring, often financing these purchases out of savings or loans raised on the value of their houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/8" class="indent">During the drafting of the Gambling Bill it was decided by the DCMS that the levy board was to be abolished and hence it's role in issuing 'certificates of approval', upon which bookmakers' pitch tenure depends, disappeared and was not replaced by another mechanism. The Act provides for a period of 5 years, during which racecourses are restricted in the pitch fees they may charge, as has been the case since outlined in successive Acts, the latest being the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1963.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/9" class="indent">However, as a consequence of the omission in the Gambling Act to replace the function of issuing 'certificates of approval', the RCA has interpreted this as allowing 'the confiscation of bookmakers' positions from <phrase class="date" code="2012-09-01">1 September 2012</phrase>'... I believe that it could not have been the intention of Parliament for bookmakers to have their assets confiscated in this way.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-04a.252.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" speakername="Don Foster" colnum="252"  time="010:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070704/halltext/70704h0003.htm#07070444000525">
	<p pid="a.252.1/1">I welcome the Minister to his new post and I am sure that we all look forward to his response. So far, the debate has been very one-sided, and I will stay on the same side as everyone else.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase> on introducing the debate. I also congratulate the hon. Members for Hove (Ms Barlow), for Reigate (Mr. Blunt), for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis), for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway), for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) and for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell), as well as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/3">The hon. Member for Livingston began by reminding us of what happened in 1998, when the list position arrangements were changed to allow trading in seniority positions. He welcomed that, although the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green has expressed serious concerns about it in earlier debates, including, most recently, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-14">14 March</phrase>. As to which of the two is right, all that I can say is that the various constituents who have come to see me rather favour the view taken by the right hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/4">However, we have moved on and we are now debating a separate issue, which has been well rehearsed in the debate. We are discussing the nature of the trading and whether people could reasonably believe that what was being traded was something that they held in perpetuity. The Minister rightly intervened on the hon. Member for Hove to ask whether people could reasonably have expected that to be the case&mdash;a point also raised by the hon. Member for Rhondda&mdash;and it is worth looking at that question. I will therefore concentrate largely on that issue in my brief contribution and I hope that that will help the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/5">As we know, the change in arrangements was introduced in December 1998. It is worth referring to clause 5 of the sales catalogue that was issued at that time, which says:</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/6" class="indent">&quot;The Buyer will be deemed to have knowledge of all matters which he could reasonably have been expected to find out given his knowledge as an Authorised Bookmaker and the exercise of due diligence.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/7">I would argue strongly to the Minister that responsible authorised bookmakers did do their due diligence test, but that they certainly could not have been expected to know what would happen following the introduction of the new legislation and its erroneous interpretation by the RCA.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/8">It is also important to note that the extensive conditions detailed in the catalogue consistently emphasise that the buyer is buying a title, which can be transferred only under the NJPC arrangements. Under company law, a title constitutes an asset given to the holder of that title. People therefore believed that they were buying a title, which is an asset, in perpetuity. They were further led to assume that that was the case because all the relevant documentation referred to an opportunity to buy into a prosperous new era. They therefore assumed that they had got something that would be of financial benefit to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/9">Underpinning every statement in the documentation was the idea of establishing a profession with stability and longevity. The issue of obtaining a title was made very clear by the NJPC, which set out four principles in its documentation. Those principles included the establishment of relativity, the affirmation of procedure, the determination of location and security of title. That is absolutely clear, but that security of title is now under threat, which is having a huge financial impact on on-course bookmakers and particularly, as the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough rightly said, on the colourful, smaller family-owned businesses, which are now in serious difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/10">Why has all this happened? Why are people under threat? I do not understand why they are under threat. I have not only read the Gambling Act 2005&mdash;I served on the Committee that considered it and I have looked back at the debates about it&mdash;but obtained the draft regulations relating to the relevant clauses&mdash;clauses 167, 168 and 355(1). The only relevant issue raised in the regulations relates to the five times rule, which paragraph 1(8) of part 2 makes clear will go after <phrase class="date" code="2012-08-31">31 August 2012</phrase>. I do not understand, however, why that gives the RCA the right to make all the other decisions that it has made.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/11">I therefore have a few quick questions for the Minister. First, is he aware that his Department has been informed of such concerns and worries over the past three years? Is he aware that a letter was sent to his Department as a recently as eight weeks ago, but that there has still been no reply?</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/12">Secondly, is what the RCA is doing in the spirit of the Act or does it run contrary to it? Is the Minister aware that the federation will have no choice but to go to the European Court of Human Rights, as the hon. Member for Reigate said? It will do that under the first protocol to the European convention on human rights, which relates to property rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/13">Thirdly, was the working group that was set up in the Minister's Department to ensure the smooth running of the Act given any remit to look at the issue before us? Although concerns were raised, I think that the Minister will discover that it was given no such remit. Perhaps he can explain why.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/14">Finally, if the Minister has the opportunity, will he address an issue that has not been touched on so far? Bookmakers from other European countries, and particularly from Ireland and Australia, are involved in the issues before us, which means that there could also be EU involvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/15">The hon. Member for Ryedale summed things up when he said that we need a fair solution. I served on the Committee that considered the legislation, and the present situation was not intended. We therefore look to the Minister not necessarily to find a compromise&mdash;indeed, we should not be talking about compromise because the proposal was not right in the first place&mdash;but at least to acknowledge that there is a significant issue of compensation to be addressed.</p>

	<p pid="a.256.0/1">Thank you, Mr. Conway; I welcome you to the proceedings this morning. I thank right hon. and hon. Members of all parties for their words of welcome to me in my new ministerial role, and I am delighted that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">the Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase> was able to secure the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/2">It would be foolish of me to underestimate or to fail to understand the high level of interest in on-course betting and the emotion that the issue generates, not least because of the passionate speeches made here today by hon. Members, but also because of the many letters that my Department has received. I have read through the previous debates, and I understand many of the issues that need to be considered. My predecessor, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" name="Richard Caborn">the Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn)</phrase>, wrote to hon. Members about some of the matters that were raised in the previous debate. This is my first opportunity to offer my thanks to my right hon. Friend for his work as Minister for Sport. He will be a hard act to follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston, like his predecessor in the constituency, the late Robin Cook, has a great love for and appreciation of British horse racing. I share his enthusiasm for that great sport and for the heritage, tradition and characters that go with it. I have shared racing day experiences with many hon. Members who are present today. I agree that a key part of the experience of live horse racing is to be able to place a bet with a bookmaker on the race course. It is exactly because we want to preserve that experience and encourage more people to enjoy live racing that we have maintained in the Gambling Act 2005 the right of bookmakers to be allowed into betting rings on race courses to take bets.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/4">Before I address my hon. Friend's specific points, it might be helpful if I set out some of the background to the issue. The Horserace Betting Levy Board is a non-departmental public body that operates in accordance with the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963, as amended. The board's main functions are to collect payments from bookmakers and use them for the three statutory purposes that relate to the improvement of horse racing set out in the 1963 Act. Since 1972, the board has also had the responsibility for issuing certificates of approval to race courses. Race courses can be issued with a certificate of approval only if they provide a place on-course for bookmakers to carry on their business.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/5">At the time in question, the National Association of Bookmakers had responsibility for the administration of betting rings, under agreement with the Racecourse Association. As has been mentioned, in 1997, after seven years of disputes, that agreement was terminated by the RCA. That is a fundamental point with respect to the relationships that have existed all the way through. To ensure that betting rings were properly administered after the termination of that agreement, the levy board instigated a review.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/6">Following an extensive consultation, the review recommended that a new administrative body should be established to be responsible for the administration and conduct of on-course betting rings. That new body was of course the National Joint Pitch Council. That brings me back to the point of my intervention on my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" name="Celia Barlow">the Member for Hove (Ms Barlow)</phrase>, which was to arrive at an understanding of what the NJPC's role had been. I am informed that it never gave anyone the lifelong entitlement to a pitch. There were always qualifications, particularly as the new legislation came in: people had to study the intention of the new legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/7">The NJPC is not a public body. It is a company limited by guarantee. The Department has no direct influence over its decisions. Its board includes a number of bookmaker representatives. Its functions are essentially administrative, relating to the conduct of bookmakers on race courses through the national pitch rules. Among other things, those rules cover the allocation of pitches to on-course bookmakers. It is a condition of the levy board's certificates of approval that race courses observe the national pitch rules that the board has endorsed.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/8">In late 1998, the NJPC also set up a system for the auctioning of pitch list positions. That was implemented at the request of the levy board to ensure greater freedom, transparency and accessibility in the on-course market. As we have heard, it replaced the old &quot;dead men's shoes&quot; system, whereby almost the only way to secure a pitch position was through inheritance. The auction system was a mechanism for one bookmaker to sell a pitch list position to another. Agreement was reached with the levy board and the NJPC on those auctions.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/9">My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston is right to say that under the Gambling Act 2005, the certificate of approval system will be replaced. From <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-01">1 September 2007</phrase>, the new premises licences will be issued by local licensing authorities, which will have a duty to take into account the three objectives of the Gambling Act: keeping gambling free of crime; keeping gambling fair and open; and protecting children and vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/10">The new system of licensing will be clearer, more transparent and more consistent than ever. It will focus on the regulation of premises, including race courses, rather than on their administration, and allow race courses and bookmakers to develop a mature, commercial relationship for the first time. That is entirely appropriate, because it is good for racing and for bookies, and it is in line with this Government's aim of minimising bureaucratic burdens and allowing successful industries to run themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/11">It is not right to suggest, as some have done, that the Gambling Act itself does away with pitch lists. Although the certificate of approval system provided a certain authority to support the pitch list system, the lists themselves have never been recognised in statute. They do not, and never have, confer ownership of land to any of the pitch-list place holders, and it remains open for race courses and bookmakers to retain the existing system, or similar arrangements, if they so wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/12">I freely recognise that the RCA's announcement that it will cease to recognise the lists from September 2012 has caused great consternation among bookmakers, as has been said today.</p>

	<p pid="a.261.2/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to have this debate on the future of the Yardley Green hospital site, and I am pleased to serve under your wise and experienced chairmanship, Mr. Conway. I welcome the late-arriving Minister and warmly congratulate her on her elevation to the position that she now holds.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/2">The Yardley Green hospital site has generated huge concern and anger in the local community. The site is in my constituency which, notwithstanding the success of the British economy over the past decade or so, is still one of the most deprived in the country. Some areas still have unemployment of more than 15 per cent. and there is massive pressure on all public services in the Bordesley Green area. The primary and secondary schools in the area are full and the more popular ones are massively oversubscribed. The pressure on social housing is enormous, and there is ever-growing need for health and recreational facilities. There is also a high birth rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/3">Against that background, the local population saw the closure of the Yardley Green hospital as an opportunity to address some of those issues. The hospital site is close to Heartlands hospital, which has expanded recently to take in Solihull hospital. There has also been expansion on the existing Heartlands hospital site. I had no issue with the health authority when it judged that, with the growth of Heartlands hospital, Yardley Green hospital was surplus to requirements, but there was a clear expectation in the community that the site would be used for much needed affordable housing, a desperately needed new secondary school, expanded general health facilities including&mdash;this is important&mdash;day care mental health facilities, and recreational facilities that could be used by local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/4">It therefore came as a total shock when the Heart of Birmingham primary care trust, in conjunction with the Birmingham and Solihull mental health trust, began a consultation with local residents on the possibility of the site being used solely for mental health facilities. Several meetings were held at which representatives from the mental health trust made presentations about the need for additional mental health facilities in the west midlands. Initially, it was pointed out that no decision had been taken and that the purpose of the consultation was to ascertain the views of local people. It was also pointed out that in addition to the Yardley Green hospital site, three or four other sites in and around Birmingham were being considered and that similar consultations were taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/5">At the meetings in Bordesley Green, there was overwhelming opposition from local residents to the suggestion that the site should be used solely for mental health facilities, because of the other pressing needs in the area. At those meetings, I made clear my opposition to the site being used solely for mental health facilities. I pointed out that I had had previous dealings with the mental health trust in respect of another site in my constituency and that, to put it frankly, I was not convinced that the mental health trust or the health authority were acting in totally good faith in giving the impression that they were conducting a consultative process.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/6">Based on my previous dealings with the mental health trust, I pointed out that I believed that it already had it clearly in mind to put solely mental health facilities on the Yardley Green hospital site because it owned the land, so that that presented the cheapest option compared with the other sites that it said it was considering. Furthermore, the trust had already embarked on a programme of closing mental health institutions in the countryside around Birmingham so that the land could be sold off, extremely profitably, for executive housing irrespective of whether the mental health patients living in those institutions wanted that to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/7">As the consultation moved on, more information about the plans emerged bit by bit, and it was eventually made known that the mental health trust had it in mind to build a medium secure unit on the site to accommodate 80 clients in a locked facility. It subsequently came to light that that facility would be bordered by a 5.8 m-high fence. When the full facts became known, there was even greater opposition to the proposal from within the area, but the trust finished its consultation process and then announced that, on reflection, it had decided that the most appropriate site for such a unit was the Yardley Green hospital site and&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;it also announced that the other areas in the west midlands that were being considered wholeheartedly supported the facility being put on the Yardley Green hospital site.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/8">Yesterday, I received a briefing&mdash;I suspect that it was intended not for me, but for the Minister&mdash;from Karen Helliwell, in which the mental health trust came up with a number of reasons why I should speak for the proposal today. The briefing is a collection of spin, half-truths, innuendo and downright slurs. I shall address one or two of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/9">The briefing points out that 114 responses were received to the public consultation, including 39 from local residents and two petitions signed by more than 1,300 members of the local Bordesley green community. It then said that the majority of the 114 responses to the consultation supported the proposals for a medium secure unit. Nevertheless, there was concern among the population. No reference was made to the 1,300 people who signed a petition, nor to the fact that the petition violently opposed putting a medium secure unit on that site. It also says that the facility is closest to the centre of Birmingham and Coventry. It is certainly closest to the centre of Birmingham, but Coventry happens to be rather a long way away, so again there is a massaging of the true facts.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/10">Finally, I take most offence at the fact that the briefing refers to the community liaison group, which was set up to conduct the consultation, and had been meeting since <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-06">6 June 2006</phrase>. It said that &quot;the Community Development Worker&quot;&mdash;to whom I shall refer in a moment&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/11" class="indent">&quot;is responsible for ensuring that all the community issues are acknowledged. The last meeting was held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-29">Tuesday, 29 May</phrase>. In fact, members of the public have been put off attending the CLG meetings as they have been intimidated by protestors outside the meetings.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/12">That is a direct slur and there is no justification for it. Indeed, Mr. Wilson, the project manager, wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-07">7 June</phrase> stating:</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/13" class="indent">&quot;Since January 2007, we have seen a decline in attendance at the CLG meetings. It has become apparent that while some people have found the CLG to be helpful, other people have not found it a useful forum. We have therefore taken the decision to postpone the meeting next Tuesday, pending a review of our communications strategy and how the community liaison group fits in with that. We know that many people are anxious about the development&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/14">There was nothing about the meetings being called off, or about people not attending because, allegedly, they have been threatened or intimidated. However, I regret to say that that is the way in which the mental health trust has approached the issue&mdash;with a catalogue of spin, half-truths and innuendo.</p>

	<p pid="a.263.3/1">Councillor Shah, the local councillor, is not a member of the planning committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.3/2">It is worth pointing out that the mental health trust had a paid community development worker who was involved in arranging the consultation process, and that surprise, surprise, he happened to be a Liberal Democrat councillor who represented in my constituency, the Springfield ward, where the previous controversy over the location of the mental health facility arose. The two Liberal Democrat councillors for the ward did not seek to challenge the decision of the planning committee at the full council meeting, and by not doing so, many people locally believed that they betrayed the interests of their constituents.</p>

	<p pid="a.263.5/1">Mr. Conway, forgive me, but I have given way twice already, and time is getting short.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.5/2">Bearing in mind the small majority that the Con-Lib alliance had on the council, I should be amazed if the two Liberal Democrat councillors for the ward had been prepared to stand out against the proposals. They would not have been able to persuade the Liberal Democrat group within the ruling alliance that the proposals should not go ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.5/3">The reason why I raise this debate today is because the people of Bordesley Green are extremely angry and frustrated that their clear opposition to the proposal has been ignored. They have been poorly served by their local Liberal Democrat councillors, who had it within their power to stop the proposals going ahead. The land is public land, and while the ultimate decision about what is built on it lies with the local planning authority, the residents are looking for help from the Department of Health to try to prevent the medium-secure unit being built.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.5/4">I end by reiterating what I said earlier. It really is hard to appreciate the anger and frustration in the area. The people of the area appreciate, as I do, that mental illness is increasing, and that one in four of the population will be touched by such illness at some time during their lives. They have no objection whatever to the provision of much needed general health facilities on the site, which would incorporate day-care provision and facilities for dealing with people who suffer from mild forms of mental illness, such as depression. However, to place an 80-bed, medium-secure locked unit surrounded by a 5.8 m fence in such an area, which is deficient in so many other needs, such as affordable housing, additional school places, general health facilities and community provision, is totally wrong. The site is the wrong site and I hope that the Minister will give some help and support to the local residents to stop that ill-conceived project going ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.268.2/1">May I welcome you to the Chair this afternoon, Mr. Conway? I also welcome the Minister to her new position.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/2">I am grateful to have secured this debate on an issue that is probably arousing more passion and concern in my constituency and throughout West Sussex than anything else. There are hon. Members here from East Sussex and West Sussex who are all affected by the proposed reconfiguration of hospitals. We are grateful for this opportunity to make the case on behalf of our constituents and for the fact that this debate has brought the Minister here to listen to those concerns, which I am sure she will do. I should like to focus on West Sussex, in which my constituency lies, but my hon. Friends and other hon. Members might refer to the situation in East Sussex. I shall also keep my remarks as brief as possible, to allow everyone here the opportunity to take part in this short debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/3">The situation in West Sussex is that the newly created primary care trust proposes to downgrade our three acute hospitals to one, so that there will be only one major general hospital for the whole county. That affects every hon. Member in West Sussex and some in East Sussex, and it affects me particularly, because my constituents use all three hospitals. I am therefore in a position to see how the proposals would affect the whole county.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/4">The first thing that I should like to say about our objections to how the primary care trust has handled the process is that the justification for the proposals has fundamentally changed. More than a year ago, we were eventually told&mdash;when the strategic health authority and then the primary care trust admitted it&mdash;that the overriding reason for downgrading our local hospitals was a financial deficit in the health care sector in West Sussex and that it would get worse. The principal justification for the measures that the PCT said were needed was that it would no longer be sustainable to retain three acute hospitals for a population the size of West Sussex.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/5">It is true that some clinical justifications for the change were set out at the time, but the overriding justification was clearly financial. Indeed, as a former chief executive of the primary care trust, Steve Phoenix, wrote to the <i>West Sussex Gazette </i>on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-30">30 August 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/6" class="indent">&quot;The financial issues for West Sussex are very serious. Although the NHS will get more money, we are already in debt and there are major challenges in the way we receive funding.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/7">He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/8" class="indent">&quot;if we do nothing, we will have a shortfall of &pound;94 million by 2008/09. This an impossible scenario. Our plans will involve significant changes to major hospital services. We must invest our funding in direct patient care rather than expensive hospital buildings.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/9">He could not have been more plain that the principal driver of the changes was the lack of funding available to the primary care trust that he perceived. That position was reinforced by the strategic health authority. As the chief executive of the strategic health authority wrote to me and other hon. Members on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-31">31 July 2006</phrase> on the issue of finance:</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/10" class="indent">&quot;It is much better, and more responsible, to plan for a clinically and financially sustainable healthcare system, as we are doing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/11">The new Secretary of State, whom I welcome to his position, too, said in the debate on access to NHS services yesterday:</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/12" class="indent">&quot;These reconfigurations are being driven by local decisions in local NHS trusts, and they are driven by clinical need, not by any financial constraints.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-07-03.853"><i>Official Report</i>, 3 July 2007; Vol. 462, c. 853</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/13">However, he cannot have been aware of the primary care trust's original justification for the changes that are taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/14">Nevertheless, it now seems that the financial arguments for downgrading our local hospitals have simply evaporated. The latest case scenarios that the primary care trust has published, along with the plan for reconfiguration of our hospitals, actually show that in five years' time, in 2012-13, the local health care economy&mdash;that is, the West Sussex and Brighton PCTs and the three acute trusts&mdash;will end up with an annual surplus of &pound;52 million. Let us deal with the argument once and for all: there is no financial case for downgrading our hospitals in West Sussex. The Secretary of State has now also said that there is no financial case for doing so. That crucial part of the argument for change and how the PCT has approached it for the past year has gone, yet the trust persists in the changes that it wants to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/15">Now the argument turns on whether there is a clinical case for downgrading our hospitals, but those arguments are strongly disputed. Locally, they are disputed by consultants, who disagree about whether there should be only one major general hospital in West Sussex&mdash;an issue to which I am sure my hon. Friends will turn their attention. Nationally, we are relying on the evidence of some of the royal colleges, on which the whole future of two major hospitals could turn, simply because it is argued that the most serious A and E cases ought to be treated in major centres. Given that there is no financial imperative for reorganising those major hospitals, it does not seem to make sense to put at risk major and much-prized local facilities simply to address that concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/16">The concern of my constituents and of the whole population of West Sussex is about accessibility. In my area of West Sussex, the question is not about the size of the population served by the three acute hospitals or about the catchment areas, in the narrow sense; it is about whether those hospitals are accessible to a community, many of whose members live in remote areas. From one village&mdash;it happens to be called Washington&mdash;right in the middle of my constituency, at the foot of the downs, the distance to Worthing general hospital, one of the three hospitals affected, is a very reasonable eight miles, with a travel time of 13 minutes. If Worthing general hospital is downgraded, which is one of the options that the primary care trust has set out, the travel time could increase by two and half or even up to five times if patients have to travel to Portsmouth, which is one of the potential effects of the changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/17">Indeed, in the document that the primary care trust published when the proposals were launched, it conceded that</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/18" class="indent">&quot;a minority of people may have to travel further&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/19">for what it called &quot;improved services.&quot; However, we are talking about a population that is relatively elderly. According to the 2001 census, just over one fifth of West Sussex's population were aged 65 years or over, which compares with an average of 16 per cent. in England and Wales. It is extremely difficult for elderly people to make regular visits to health care facilities that are further away. We are not just talking about travel times and safety for A and E services; we are talking about people who have to travel further for visits to facilities that are currently much closer.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/20">The other day I met an elderly constituent of mine who lives in Storrington, in the middle of constituency, who has to travel a number of times of week to Brighton for radiotherapy, making a round trip of 41 miles on each occasion, with a travel time of 76 minutes. There is a huge amount of fear locally that, far from there being a greater provision of local services, which we were promised as part of the reconfiguration, services will be taken further away from the local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/21">We have not seen the redeveloped local services that were promised as part of the reconfiguration, or any proposals for them. No assurance have been given in relation to one community hospital in Arundel, in my constituency. It simply does not make sense to say that acute hospitals might be downgraded and simultaneously to be unable to give assurances about the provision of community hospitals, on which people will presumably rely for more local services.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/22">The absence from the primary care trusts' proposals of an option for at least two major hospitals, which is what many clinicians and the public have asked for, is a significant omission. It makes the consultation paper a flawed one, and we asked the PCT board, unsuccessfully, to withdraw the paper until it could present an option that we felt should be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/23">I should like to convey to the Minister the strength of feeling in support of the three hospitals in West Sussex&mdash;the Princess Royal hospital in Haywards Heath, Worthing and Southlands hospitals and St. Richard's hospital in Chichester. Some 300,000 people in West Sussex have signed petitions against the closure of those hospitals, and 25,000 people have marched. The Prime Minister may stand on the steps of Downing street, as he did last week, and say that he will listen to people and make the NHS a priority, and the Government may espouse the notion of patient choice, but what can any of that mean if the Government and the PCTs are unwilling to listen to the almost unanimous view of local people?</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/24">There can be no better way to demonstrate how people feel about the potential downgrading of their hospitals than to consider the Princess Royal hospital in Haywards Heath, in the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1860" name="Nicholas Soames">the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames)</phrase>, who has fought tirelessly to retain those facilities. The Princess Royal will be the hospital most affected by the proposals. Under any of the scenarios proposed by the PCT, it will be downgraded. Yet a consultation document published only in 2004 promised that, in reshaping A and E services and moving trauma cases to Brighton,</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/25" class="indent">&quot;It is important to emphasise that the vast majority of local people will continue to receive A&amp;E services from their local hospital. So there is no threat to A&amp;E at the Princess Royal.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/26">That promise was made not only in the consultation document, but to my hon. Friend on the Floor of the House by one of the Minister's predecessors, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1387" name="John Hutton">the right hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton)</phrase>, now a Cabinet Minister. He told my hon. Friend on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-16">16 March 2005</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/27" class="indent">&quot;There is no question of A and E services being downgraded or becoming a minor injuries unit. That is not going to happen.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2005-03-16.383"><i>Official Report</i>, 16 March 2005; Vol. 432, c. 383</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/28">When the Prime Minister speaks, as he did yesterday, about rebuilding trust in politics and reconnecting people with the political process, what can those words mean if Ministers feel able to come to this place, give assurances to hon. Members about the future of A and E facilities&mdash;an issue that could hardly be of more concern to local people&mdash;and renege on those promises within two years? That produces a sense of anger in my constituency and throughout West Sussex about how local people are being treated. They have no voice and they are not being listened to, yet they are being told by the Government that they will be listened to and that the NHS is now the new concern. How can the Minister square that circle? I urge her to recognise local people's concerns about the issue and how the justification for the downgrading of our local hospitals has shifted and been undermined.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/29">I am grateful to the Minister for listening to my case. I hope that she will appreciate the strength of local feeling and that she or one of her colleagues will take the opportunity to come visit the hospitals. The previous Secretary of State visited the hospital at Brighton, but did not visit St. Richard's, Worthing and Southlands or the Princess Royal. If Ministers were to visit one of them, they would understand not only that clinical opinion is certainly divided about the merits of moving to one hospital in a county of that size but also that local feeling is strong. People have paid their taxes, and they feel that they are entitled to high-quality, local and accessible services. I think that they deserve no less.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-04a.271.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" speakername="Norman Baker" colnum="271"  time="014:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070704/halltext/70704h0006.htm#07070444000558">
	<p pid="a.271.2/1">There is very little difference between <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1377" name="Nick Herbert">the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase> and me on this issue. I congratulate him both on securing the debate and on how he put the case, and I welcome the Minister to her position.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/2">My constituency is in the grip of a pincer movement of threatened loss of services. At the eastern end, maternity services at Eastbourne are under threat. Most seriously, we face the potential or likely loss of accident and emergency services at Haywards Heath, a hospital that many of my constituents in the north-west look to. My constituents are angry and bewildered that at a time when more money than ever before is going to the NHS&mdash;I congratulate the former Chancellor on his record on that matter&mdash;cuts of a hitherto unseen extent are being proposed. It is difficult to square that circle.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/3">I must make it perfectly plain that not only has the case for removing A and E at the Princess Royal not been made, but it is exceedingly dangerous and will be counter-productive in its consequences for my constituents and those of other hon. Members present today. We are given three options in the consultation paper, all of which involve losing A and E services at the Princess Royal. The PCT is asking us whether we want to lose an arm, a leg or both. We are not given the option of losing none of the bits of our body.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/4">I feel strongly that that is not what was agreed. When I had a meeting with the strategic health authority last year, I was promised that the options in the paper would include a status quo option, even if the PCT did not feel capable of recommending it. The option would be included, if only to allow the other options to be measured against it in terms of the clinical changes required and the financial costs. That has not been done. Similarly, with maternity services in Eastbourne, we were promised at an early stage that a status quo option would be included. It is only thanks to the hard work of campaigners who look to the Eastbourne district general hospital for services that a so-called option 5 is now being developed there.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/5">The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs referred to the financial case. He is right that the sands have shifted and the goalposts have moved on that matter, but it is worse than that, because there is a chance that what is proposed will cost the NHS money, not save it. The Princess Royal hospital in Haywards Heath is quite modern; it is about 15 years old. The Brighton hospital, which will be expected to take up the slack, dates from 1828. It is pre-Nightingale in how it was built and what it offers. Its car parking is insufficient; it is pretty inaccessible by public and indeed private transport. It is on the coast, so half its catchment area is in the English channel. It is not where one would put a hospital if one started from scratch, yet the proposal is effectively to close the emergency department in a hospital that is well situated in mid-Sussex and serves a wide population 360&ordm; around it, and to relocate services to Brighton.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/6">That can be done only if money from the sale of land at the Princess Royal&mdash;it has been discussed&mdash;is used to provide new facilities at Brighton. But where is the sense in closing part of a recently constructed, 15-year-old facility and using it to bolster a hospital built almost two centuries ago with very little spare land, which it would cost a significant amount to develop? It makes no financial sense at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/7">If we are to have any changes to our acute services and move towards community services, which is the Government's intention&mdash;I accept that it is a sensible intention in so far as it can be delivered&mdash;that will cost money, too. We do not know how much that will cost. The hon. Gentleman is quite right that the community aspect has not been properly considered. I do not know what the proposals are for Lewes Victoria hospital&mdash;it is not clear what will be put there. If we are to have services taken away, we need to know before they are taken away and, as part of the consultation, what will be done to provide an alternative to the services that it is proposed will be removed from our acute hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/8">The issue of accessibility, which is key, was also raised. I represent a rural area, including villages such as Newick, Chailey and Wivelsfield. My constituents are already concerned about the journey times to Haywards Heath, without taking into account additional journey times to Brighton. I am sure that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" name="Charles Hendry">the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry)</phrase> will have a similar point to make about his patch. We talk about the golden hour in which to get people to hospitals. With the amount of traffic on the roads in east Sussex and the rural nature of many of the villages, I am not convinced that it could be guaranteed that people could get to Brighton within the hour. In clinical terms, it is simply not sensible to go down that route.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/9">Public transport is pretty sparse in the rural areas, and the bus services that the Government want do not exist. Many of my constituents, who can ill afford it, end up taking extremely expensive taxi rides to get to hospital already. If they are going to be asked to take taxi rides to Brighton&mdash;or even to Hastings for maternity services&mdash;that will be an expensive business. It is not right to ask people to do that. I do not know the Government's view on social exclusion, but they will make it worse through such proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/10">The pressure on the ambulance service has not been thought through, either. If we are to have people taken to hospitals that are much further away, by definition ambulances will be on the road far more, spending more time at each individual pick-up. Has the ambulance service been properly consulted? What will be the consequences for it? How many ambulances and ambulance drivers will we need? What is the cost of that? Has it been factored in? I do not think that it has.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/11">I am not convinced by the clinical argument that we need to have these single centres and that it is not safe to have different centres. My constituents certainly believe that the arrangements are perfectly safe and are happy with them. In fact, many of them would rather go to the Princess Royal hospital in Haywards Heath than to Brighton, given half a chance. There is no question but that people in my constituency believe that the present arrangements are safe. If they are not safe, what happens in the north of Scotland, Cornwall or other places that are more sparsely populated? They seem to manage all right&mdash;with fewer people going through them as well, I say to the consultant who claimed that a certain critical mass of individuals was needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/12">The matter crosses party lines. I am pleased to agree&mdash;I hope that I will&mdash;with the Conservative Members who will speak after me. It is good that we have seen a cross-party approach and I thank the hon. Members for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) and for Arundel and South Downs for the way in which they have approached the matter. In the north west of my constituency, that cross-party approach has worked quite well. We need to go forward on that basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/13">I note that although we have a vast turnout of Conservative MPs and 100 per cent. of Liberal Democrat MPs for Sussex in this debate, it is sad that none of the five Labour MPs who represent Sussex are here&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;One is.&quot;] I beg hon. Members' pardon; 20 per cent. of them are here. I hope that they will realise that it does not help Brighton and Hove if Haywards Heath is closed down and services are removed from there.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/14">I ask the Minister to listen to public opinion, which is strong in all our constituencies. If she does, she will come to the conclusion that the options that have been put forward, for the Princess Royal hospital in particular, simply do not wash.</p>

	<p pid="a.276.1/1">The debate is timely and I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1377" name="Nick Herbert">the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase> on securing it. In the long period during which I have been a Member of Parliament, I have never had so many complaints and concerns and so much anger expressed to me about the state of hospital services as in the past few years&mdash;that is as they are today in West Sussex, let alone how they would be after the Government's plans were put into action.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/2">My hon. Friends have described vividly our concerns about the proposed depletion of hospital services, particularly in West Sussex. I do not want to repeat them, but I add that the model being proposed for the southern end of West Sussex has already been put into effect in the north end. Over the past 10 years or so, Crawley hospital has effectively been downgraded from an acute to a community hospital. Way back in 1998, a joint health care NHS trust was formed between Crawley and the East Surrey hospital at Redhill, specifically to provide synergy and specialisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/3">We were assured that small amounts of care would be transferred from Crawley to Redhill and that that would be it&mdash;no more salami slicing. But then the salami slicer got to work again, and gradually more and more services have been taken away from Crawley. Now the only hospital that serves much of my constituency and the whole of Crawley is at Redhill.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/4">It is no criticism of the wonderful staff at Redhill to say that it is a hospital in crisis. I have a sheath of complaints, cases and concerns from relatives of patients who have died there in appalling circumstances. Its staff are utterly demoralised and it is in crisis. To meet the Government's top-down targets, ambulances have been queuing outside A and E, so as not to get patients into the A and E queues, to make the numbers look better. The situation is intolerable and should not be allowed to continue. The proposals would make it much worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/5">My hon. Friends the Members for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) and for Arundel and South Downs and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" name="Norman Baker">the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase> made a strong case for maintaining the Princess Royal as an acute hospital, and I totally support that. It serves some of the villages and communities at the eastern end of my constituency. Even as it is, it cannot serve constituents who live in the Horsham area, Crawley or villages as far away as Billingshurst, which are already uniquely inconvenienced in their lack of access to acute hospital care. Under any of the options proposed by the SHA and the PCT, that would get worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/6">I wish to make a quick point about accessibility. We always hear the same thing when such proposals are mooted&mdash;that what is crucial is not how far away the hospital is and how long it takes to get there, but how quickly paramedics can get reach people. That is true in some cases, such as cardiac cases, but it just is not true in others, such as strokes. A stroke is caused by either a clot or a bleed, and the treatments are diametrically opposed in the two cases. The critical thing in avoiding a person being permanently damaged is the speed with which they can be got to hospital and scanned. If a stroke is caused by a clot, as most are, and anti-clotting agents are introduced quickly, a stroke can be almost completely or, in many cases, completely reversed. Think of the savings in the cost to the NHS and society as well as the human cost of so many stroke patients not needing continuing care.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/7">Accessibility really matters. If my constituents become totally dependent on East Surrey hospital and, I suppose, the Royal Sussex at Brighton, they will find them both inaccessible. A constituent of mine in Billingshurst who sustained a serious injury had to wait 45 minutes before the ambulance got there, and it then took another hour and a half to get from Billingshurst to Redhill to the A and E. Time was not critical in that case, but there are plenty of cases in which it is. I am told that the air ambulance cannot even land in Brighton, so the difficulties are not overcome by air access. The matter is serious.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/8">My case is not only that we need to keep what exists but that we need more. We need to reverse the ill-judged changes that have seriously affected the Horsham and Crawley area. I would make the case for a new hospital to serve Horsham and Crawley. As the Government should know, much more housing is being imposed on the area. Indeed, the Prime Minister talks generally about imposing more houses, and none of us is against more housing development, but we do insist that there is a proper assessment of infrastructure needs, and hospital services are central to that. The case for not only keeping what we have, but reversing some of the changes that have been made is therefore increasingly powerful.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/9">I urge the Minister to take this issue seriously. Several hon. Members have said that we are taking a non-partisan approach, and that is absolutely right. Other parties&mdash;particularly local Liberal Democrats&mdash;have supported the campaign against hospital closures and the case for a new hospital to serve Horsham and Crawley. I do not wish to make a particularly partisan point, but the local Labour party in both Horsham and Crawley has been conspicuous by its absence and silence, and that causes concern. I therefore urge the Minister to listen. The new Prime Minister has made much of his willingness to listen, and the Minister has a good opportunity to get brownie points with him&mdash;if I can put it like that&mdash;by showing that she is willing to look again at the course to which the Government are apparently committed, but which will be very damaging for a large part of West Sussex.</p>

	<p pid="a.282.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1377" name="Nick Herbert">the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase> on securing this important debate, and I welcome the Minister to her new position, blinking in the sunlight after 10 arduous years in the dark corridors of the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/2">The more I learn about the NHS the more convinced I become that the principal problem facing the health service is the quality of its management. It is that poor-quality management that has led us, in the southern half of West Sussex, to the absurd position in which the West Sussex PCT proposes to decimate one of two leading major hospitals, either St. Richard's hospital in Chichester, or Worthing hospital. Both hospitals rank among some of the most efficient in the country, and both have strong reputations for clinical excellence.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/3">Nothing, however, demonstrates the poor management I have spoken of better than the financial arguments deployed by the West Sussex PCT and the strategic health authority. We were told in January 2006 on page 11 of the document &quot;Creating an NHS fit for the Future&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Healthcare in Surrey and Sussex is not financially sustainable&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/5">The document went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/6" class="indent">&quot;The NHS in Surrey and Sussex had an underlying deficit of about &pound;100 m in 2004/5&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/7">and the</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/8" class="indent">&quot;underlying position is likely to worsen after 2007/8.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/9">The graph showed a forecast deficit of something like &pound;250 million by 2009-10. The S4 review&mdash;it stands for sustainable services for Surrey and Sussex; the NHS never misses an opportunity to create a new piece of jargon&mdash;demonstrated that</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/10" class="indent">&quot;the financial situation will get worse over the next few years if it is not addressed as the demand for healthcare continues to increase&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/11">On that basis, the whole reconfiguration pre-consultation process was started. It was the argument put forward by every NHS spokesman at the plethora of public meetings that were held in West Sussex in the past year. We were told that we had to live within our means, that the financial position was unsustainable and that we could not afford two major general hospitals with a full A and E service. It is odd, then, that when the West Sussex PCT board papers were published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-25">Monday 25 June</phrase>, we could, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, find no reference to ongoing deficits or the unsustainable financial position. Indeed, in the key document, &quot;West Sussex Health Economy: Investment plan&quot;, the figures show a surplus of &pound;12 million for 2007-08 and a surplus of &pound;29 million in 2008-09, rising to &pound;52 million by 2012-13. Those are calculated on the assumption of the status quo, with no downgrading of either Worthing or St. Richard's. Of course, there have been efficiency savings at both hospitals in the past year, but such savings do not turn a growing and large deficit into a surplus of the order of &pound;52 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/12">The problem is compounded by the issue of Littlehampton community hospital. That well-loved and supported community hospital is now a pile of rubble surrounded by a tall blue security fence. It was knocked down to build a 40-bed state-of-the-art community hospital, after a long and protracted consultation process and a detailed business plan that made it clear that such a hospital was needed and was financially viable. As a result of the projected deficit, which we were told about in January 2006, the rebuilding plan was halted, and the future of Arun's community hospital was put in jeopardy and made dependent on the outcome of the West Sussex NHS reconfiguration. However, of course, there is no deficit. Yet there is no Arun community hospital in Littlehampton.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/13">I ask the Minister to look into the case of that community hospital. We are told that it is Government policy to move health care closer to people's homes. A huge amount of time and effort went into planning and designing the rebuild. The project is ready to go and it has just been put on hold because of the review, but it would be absurd if a review one of whose objectives is to move care closer to people's homes were to conclude that Littlehampton and Worthing should have one fewer community hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/14">To conclude, I urge the Minister not to allow any of the three options proposed by the PCT. St. Richard's and Worthing hospitals are excellent and efficient hospitals in an area with an increasing population and congested roads. They are loved by everyone who uses them or thinks that they might use them. People will not accept the downgrading of either hospital, and I urge the Government to overrule any such decision taken by the PCT in West Sussex.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-04a.286.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="286"  time="015:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070704/halltext/70704h0008.htm#07070444000572">
	<p pid="a.286.1/1">My hon. Friend is pointing out the weaknesses in the consultation process; often consultation is simply a preamble to do what people will do anyway.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/2">Trusts are, in a sense, a slight misnomer because, although they are staffed by perfectly decent and qualified people, they are rarely ever trusted. Trusts in Sussex seem to fit the bill in that respect, as they span more than one community, which is always a difficulty, and answer to different masters and pressures. As is evident from the contributions made, the trusts do not reflect the democratic will, and it seems as though the NHS is deemed too complex for democratic decision making.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1622" name="Michael Jabez Foster">The hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Michael Jabez Foster)</phrase>, who is not here, put these matters rather well in a quote that I read recently. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/4" class="indent">&quot;You can't close local hospitals. People would rather have slightly inferior services that are local&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/5">To some extent, he has hit a raw and pertinent nerve in that comment. I know about the statistics on neonatal death, the shortage of paediatricians, the working time directives and the various pressures linked to that, the sophistication of first responders, the reduction in bed requirements, the cost of high-tech medicine and the preferences of the royal colleges. All of those factors are part of the debate. However, we Members of Parliament also know that communities want an easily accessible accident and emergency department, maternity care within reach and access problems addressed. In other words, there is a balance of consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/6">We are not calling for decisions to be made according to untutored populism or simple nostalgia, but we want an informed public debate and a democratically accountable decision made. Democratically accountable decisions can be tough&mdash;I do not think that is an oxymoron&mdash;but people would prefer to make decisions, rather than to have decisions imposed on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/7">Essentially, we want decision making in which clinical outcomes are tested and scrutinised. We also want transport links and patient journeys to be reviewed, financial arrangements to be fairly and transparently laid out and patients' preferences to be clearly identified. Catastrophically for Sussex, there is no mechanism whereby that can be done and that is the essential point of this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/8">The Government are calling for a review by Dr. Darzi, as they think it will be a kind of solution, but it is not a sure solution. I have been involved in debates in this Chamber about recommendations made by Dr. Darzi for Teeside that led to internecine warfare between Labour Members. I believe that Conservatives are promoting that the ultimate decision-making body should be the NHS board supported by HealthWatch, making representations on behalf of patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/9">My personal view is that that is simply not good enough for the people of Brighton, Eastbourne, Worthing, Haywards Heath, Lewes or Bognor Regis. Those people have a right to a decisive voice in how their local services are configured, along with the responsibilities that that involves. I really believe that if people had a voice, this and so many issues that do not get much further than debate would not come to this Chamber, but would be resolved democratically at a local level, and we would not have to debate reconfiguration time after time, in relation to area after area. However, for the moment, we are doomed to go on doing so for quite some time.</p>

	<p pid="a.287.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1377" name="Nick Herbert">the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase> on initiating this important debate and welcome the Minister to her new position on the health team. This could be our first and last debate opposite each other.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/2">I think that it is unprecedented for every single Member of Parliament for West Sussex to be present and to have taken part in a debate on this issue, apart from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" name="Laura Moffatt">the hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt)</phrase> who is rather straitjacketed by her position and is unable to do so. This is undoubtedly the largest single issue affecting every MP and every constituent in the whole of Sussex. It is unfortunate that the three Members for the Brighton and Hove area who are not constrained by being on the Government payroll, but who are affected by these consultations have not come here to add their comments on behalf of their constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs made it absolutely clear that the whole consultation has been shambolic and is based on a shifting justification. There is now no serious financial basis for the consultation and it appears that the &pound;37 million projected surplus over the next few year for West Sussex primary care trust will not be spent on the health of patients in West Sussex. I strongly echo my hon. Friend's calls for the Secretary of State or some of his Ministers to visit our hospitals and see our patients who are under threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" name="Norman Baker">The hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase> reinforced the cross-party consensus of all the campaigns and, as he said, it is dangerous that these proposals are being put forward. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1945" name="Peter Bottomley">the Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley)</phrase> made it clear that the financial assumptions in the consultation are, in any case, seriously flawed. Every time we challenge the figures, we are not given a good response as to why such massive reorganisation is in the interests of our patients. Larger hospitals do not always make better hospitals, either from a clinical or financial point of view.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1860" name="Nicholas Soames">the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames)</phrase> described the proposals as genuinely absurd and pointed out the proximity of Gatwick and the other pressures that exist in the densely populated county that West Sussex has become. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1642" name="Francis Maude">the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude)</phrase> mentioned the downgrading of Crawley, in which the hon. Member for Crawley was herself complicit. When services were transferred to Redhill, the residents around Redhill may have cheered the extra capital investment. However, they are now finding that the extra pressures of numbers on that hospital means that they cannot get into their own hospital because it simply cannot cope. If West Sussex loses some of these services, I fear that the same thing will happen in Brighton. The infrastructure needs that we have in West Sussex are severe and we should ensure that the infrastructure is there before we commit to taking on extra house building and experience the population pressures that result from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/6">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" name="Charles Hendry">the Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry)</phrase> rightly pointed out the cynicism that accompanies these consultations and the fear that decisions have already been made. He certainly made a good point about travel times and the complications for problem pregnancies that could lead to very real dangers for the mothers involved. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1564" name="Nigel Waterson">the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson)</phrase> pointed out that it is ordinary people who have set up these campaigns of resistance. He mentioned the four options that people had in Eastbourne. We did not even have four options; we were restricted to three. There seems to be a commonality of missing options between the different consultations.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/7">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1429" name="Nick Gibb">the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb)</phrase> challenged the financial savings and the statement that the deficits will not exist in a few years' time. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" name="Andrew Tyrie">the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)</phrase>, who has led the campaign to save St. Richard's from the front with great skill and aplomb, asked who is taking these decisions? Is it just managers who are doing the Government's bidding and a case of the managers who wear the Government's clothes having no clothes&mdash;to use the analogy of the Emperor.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/8">The document that was produced last week and started the debate is flawed. It was nine months late and did not have a fourth option, which we were promised would consider the possibility of keeping two main hospitals in West Sussex with at least accident and emergency and maternity departments or the status quo. The representations made by Members of Parliament, councillors, patients and constituents to the PCT asked for that option, which was ignored with breathtaking arrogance by the PCT. We wrote a letter that was signed by every Conservative Member in West Sussex and by every leader, mayor and chairman of every council in West Sussex and most Opposition leaders. The letter pointed out that the consultation was flawed and asked for it to be suspended until the fourth option was restored. Arrogantly, the PCT completely and utterly disregarded the letter when, interestingly, most of the non-executive directors of the PCT sent their apologies when the vital decisions were being made.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/9">Henry Smith, the leader of West Sussex council, has made the county council's view absolutely clear. He says</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/10" class="indent">&quot;This is a bleak picture of the future for health services in West Sussex, and the County Council rejects it totally.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/11">It is no surprise that we have such strong campaigns to save St. Richard's, the Princess Royal in Haywards Heath and Worthing and Southlands hospitals. It is crazy that we are looking to downgrade hospitals in a county the size of West Sussex, which has 750,000 people and special needs for elderly people, in particular; some 4.6 per cent of the population of Worthing is over the age of 85&mdash;such people have additional needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/12">I believe that, last week, the Brighton hospital had been on divert for nine days running simply because it could not cope with the pressure of patients arriving in ambulances. Regularly, there are ambulance queues outside that hospital, and it is a nightmare travelling to it. Yet the Royal Sussex county hospital in Brighton will be the major beneficiary of the downgrading of West Sussex hospitals, particularly the Worthing and Princess Royal hospitals. Despite the excellent efforts and hard work of the Brighton hospital's managers and staff, it is struggling under the pressure of work. Can it make sense to apply further pressure?</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/13">Last year, some 63,000 people went to the accident and emergency department in Worthing, of which a large number were admitted to hospital. They did not need just a plaster; they needed serious attention. How can Brighton and Hove cope with those extra 63,000 people? It is also interesting that Worthing hospital will this year deliver some 3,000 births, and most of the increase is from mothers from Brighton and Hove having their babies delivered there.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/14">Worthing and Southlands hospital, the Princess Royal hospital and St. Richard's hospital, in Chichester, are good, cost-effective, and, as has been mentioned, well-liked hospitals. If it ain't bust, don't fix it, particularly given that we do not have a clue what will be put in its place. And neither do we know the displacement costs of the extra community activity that we have been promised. It is death by a thousands cuts! It is dishonest and unfair, particularly on the 3,200 staff at Worthing and Southlands hospital, and on those at other hospitals, over whose jobs there has been uncertainty in recent years. That is bad for local businesses, as the chairman of the South East England Development Agency said when he came to Worthing. Furthermore, it is bad for patients, staff and the NHS in Sussex. The &quot;fit for the future&quot; consultation document, which started all of this, is not fit for the future of our constituents. It is said that Sussex people won't be druv. Well, we will not be druv; we will fight for the future of our hospitals. I hope that the Minister listens.</p>

	<p pid="a.301.0/1">I once again congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> on securing the debate and on his contribution. I shall broaden some of his points and discuss fairness. I have no doubt that the taxes had nothing to do with the Treasury's wish to collect money; it was obvious that they were to do with climate change. However, the planes would fly whether the taxes existed or not and, in fact, with low-cost airlines, more and more flights take off from our shores daily.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.0/2">I shall discuss the aspirations of my constituents. I do not have one of the most affluent constituencies in the land; in fact, it contains a couple of the most deprived and poorest areas of the country. However, those people have aspirations, too&mdash;&mdash;aspirations to see the world and to sample the good things that other, much more affluent people, have the opportunity to sample. But suddenly, a family of four has to pay &pound;160 extra if they wish to fly from Glasgow to New York via London. Why would they want to fly via London? The fact is that there are very few flights from Glasgow direct to New York. They could take them, but they would still pay extra money. Almost all the cheap flights go through London, and in some cases, through other European cities, too. When we are discussing fairness, I sometimes wonder whether we have considered this country's hubs and the people who use them.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.0/3">British Airways has cut many of its flights. It is trying to put its finances in order, and some of us believe that it is not so much interested in Britain anymore, but looking more towards the international market. That may or may not be true, but plenty of airlines wish to secure slots abroad. In doing so, they want to fly from the hub where most people are situated, so they attract their planes to those hubs. By attracting their planes to them, they make money for the airport that they leave from, for the airport that they stop at while waiting for the other plane, and for the destination airport on the way back. I do not think that that is fair to the people who can least afford it. I want my constituents to be able to fly from Glasgow direct to New York, thus saving half the tax money.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.0/4">I also believe that the then Chancellor, now the Prime Minister, did not foresee the problem that such practice would cause outside London. The money that he receives affects the aspirations of my constituents. They want to go on holiday, and they want to take their family, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North mentioned, they may have to save up for years to get that holiday. The people who have been saving for three or four years now find that they have to save for perhaps another year. However, people who have the money can go whenever they please, because they can afford it.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.0/5">The aspirations of the poor are once again hit, but the aspirations of the rich are once again met, because they can afford to meet them. Our party is not in power to do that. We must consider the issue and we think about the aspirations of every person in this country. We want to broaden their horizons just as the horizons of people who can afford it do. My hon. Friend the Exchequer Secretary should reconsider the issue. I am not worried about the tax in general but people certainly should not have to pay twice, and if they travel from the isles or the far north, they certainly should not have to pay three times what somebody from London has to pay to take the same flight.</p>

	<p pid="a.302.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> on his success in securing this afternoon's debate, which is about an important topic. I also thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" name="John Robertson">the Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson)</phrase> for his contribution, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1977" name="Anne Moffat">the Member for East Lothian (Anne Moffat)</phrase> for her earlier intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/2">I shall do my best to soothe some of the worries, although I am not sure that I can produce the solution that my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North would wish for. He was right, however, to acknowledge that air passenger duty was introduced to address the environmental concerns about air travel, and I welcome the fact that all hon. Friends welcome the tax from that point of view. They have understandable issues, however, with the way in which it is being put into effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/3">To put it on record, air passenger duty is a way of pricing aviation's carbon emissions, and of helping to ensure that the industry pays the costs that it imposes on society at large with its pollution. The Government are committed to that principle, and I am glad that my hon. Friends agree with it. The air passenger duty will limit carbon emissions from aviation. They are a growing problem, and they are expected to grow in importance as more flights occur. The rate rise that was announced in the pre-Budget report will save the equivalent of 750,000 tonnes of carbon per year by 2010-11, which will be the equivalent of taking 400,000 cars off the road, so it will have a positive effect, for the purposes for which it was introduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/4">Air passenger duty is paid by aircraft operators on all passengers departing from UK airports, with higher charges for flights outside the European Union reflecting the fact that longer journeys are more polluting. There is an exemption for passengers who are in transit&mdash;the issue for debate today&mdash;and transfer through the UK. There is a concession for passengers with connected tickets for more than one flight, but the way in which the concession works is causing the problems. For those passengers, the APD that they pay will depend on their eventual destination, but it will be paid by the carrier that provides the first leg of the journey.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/5">I shall not explain the detail of that exemption, but if hon. Members are interested, it is set out in the Air Passenger Duty (Connected Flights) Order 1994. My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North correctly identified the way in which it works, and I do not intend to repeat it. However, it is important to emphasise that the concession is not restricted to passengers who book all their flights with one airline. Any airline can offer through-tickets, including for passengers who have connected flights with different airlines, if the airline collects enough information both to link the tickets and to account to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs for the connection between the tickets. Many airlines offer that service to their passengers, including a number flying from Scotland, such as BMI and British Airways, and if they do, the double payment, as my hon. Friend characterised it, does not occur.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/6">However, I accept that for their own commercial reasons, not all airlines wish to offer the service to their customers. In the case of the point-to-point airline, the concession does not apply. Since I realised that I would be having this debate with my hon. Friend, I have thought about the issue and the way in which the concession could apply. I must confess that I have not come up with an answer yet, but I am interested to hear whether he has one.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/7">Without the necessary information to link a passenger's first flight to their second, which is the information that exists in through-ticketing, it simply is not possible to treat the flights as one journey for APD purposes. Aircraft operators are required by the law to account for the correct amount of APD to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs&mdash;whether or not they pass the charge on to their passengers. Unless the airlines can identify for themselves and assure Revenue and Customs that the flights are genuinely connected, it is clear that the concession cannot be used.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/8">The existing framework allows the aviation industry to avoid what has been described today as double payments, and all airlines can use the concession if they are willing to collect the required information. Any airline or aircraft operator from any part of the UK can offer the concession to its passengers.</p>

	<p pid="a.303.0/1">My hon. Friend the Exchequer Secretary has been extremely positive up till now, but the problem seems to be that the airlines are of the view that if they try to operate through-tickets, they would have to pick up any administration costs. Their view is that the taxes are Government led, so the burden of administering them should not fall on the airlines. Therein lies the problem. I do not profess to be a professional in the travel industry, but if we can get the professionals together&mdash;that is, the Treasury team and the airlines&mdash;perhaps we can come to some sort of conclusion.</p>
