<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-24a.185.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="185"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070724/halltext/70724h0001.htm#07072481000485">
	<p pid="a.185.1/1">Indeed. I shall return to the NPT system in a few moments, but yes, that is an important point: we should abide by the NPT, if we expect others to do the same. The other point that the hon. Gentleman made concerning internal politics in Iran is an important one as well. We hear some incredibly simplistic reports of what goes on in Iran, and everything that the President says and the language that he uses is taken as the gospel according to the whole country. It simply is not like that. There are different power centres in Iran; the political President is one, but there are many others. We should try and understand a little bit more about the country. I commend to anyone interested in Iran Rageh Omaar's films on the BBC about life and attitudes in Iran. It is a huge, proud and important country resting on the Persian tradition, and the simplistic remarks about and attacks made on it do no good at all; in fact, they do a great deal of harm. We should have some respect for the history and position of that country.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/2">The purpose of this debate is to tease out the Government's position on the development of a peaceful nuclear process. The Government are quite keen, apparently, on developing nuclear power stations. I am not! But in a sense that is a separate debate from the one surrounding nuclear weapons. However, the assertion that we have an independent nuclear deterrent has been questioned by many of us for many years, both in this House and in the wider peace movement in this country. I do not believe that we have an independent nuclear deterrent, but that it relies entirely on technology and information from the United States to be fired or used. In reality, we are a subdivision of the US when it comes to nuclear weapons. However, that does not stop us spending vast amounts of money on our existing nuclear weapons, the development of the Aldermaston facilities and the putative replacement of the Trident system, which could cost as much as &pound;70 billion. That was one of the big issues&mdash;it was not the only one&mdash;in the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-14">14 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/3">I hope that the Government will recognise that if we are serious about our signing of the NPT all those years ago, committing us to long-term nuclear disarmament, as well as committing all those declared non-nuclear-weapon states to not developing such weapons, it is up to us to use this historic opportunity to say that we will go no further with the Trident project and that instead we will accept the terms of the NPT.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/4">I had the good fortune, because I am one of the national vice-chairs of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, to attend the NPT PrepCom&mdash;the preparatory committee meeting&mdash;in Vienna in April and early May this year, and I did so with great interest. I spoke at length with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1627" name="Jon Trickett">the Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett)</phrase> at a seminar that was conducted in parallel to the conference and I listened very carefully to the statements made by the Russian delegation, the United States delegation, many other delegations, the European Union and the British representative who spoke at the same session.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/5">Let me quote from the statement made by Ambassador John Duncan, the head of the UK delegation to the first preparatory committee. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Mr. Chairman, you will be aware that at the end of last year we published a White Paper explaining the reasoning behind the UK government's decision to maintain a nuclear deterrent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/7">He went on to explain that the UK Parliament voted to support that decision. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Firstly, I should make clear what we have decided. The UK has decided to begin the concept and design work required to make possible a replacement for our current ballistic missile submarine fleet; and to maintain the option of using the D5 missile beyond its current life expectancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/9" class="indent">This does not mean that we have taken an irreversible decision that commits us irrevocably to possessing nuclear weapons in 40 or 50 years' time. Indeed, our White Paper is clear that the UK remains committed to the goal of a world free from nuclear weapons.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/10">The next part was, to me, the most interesting. Ambassador Duncan said:</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/11" class="indent">&quot;Mr Chairman, some suggest that it is hypocritical for the UK to maintain its nuclear weapons while calling on others to desist from their development. Let me make clear that the UK does not belong to an opposite camp that insists on 'non-proliferation first.' The UK fully accepts the proposition that progress must be made on the disarmament and non-proliferation tracks in parallel. The UK White Paper on the nuclear deterrent makes clear our continuing commitment to meet our disarmament obligations under Article VI of the NPT.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/12">The interesting thing was that nobody, at that stage, had accused Britain or anybody else of being hypocritical; it was the ambassador who brought up the question of hypocrisy, which was somewhat surprising to us. He then fairly pointed out that Britain had reduced its number of nuclear warheads considerably.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/13">I was interested in Ambassador Duncan's statement and I was obviously pleased that he was at the committee and able to make the statement, but if he or, indeed, the delegation recognises that we are likely to be charged with hypocrisy, let us lance the boil and not go there. Let us say that we fully support all the principles of the NPT, which includes us not developing nuclear weapons or continuing with the replacement of Trident.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/14">As I understand it, the <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-14">14 March</phrase> vote was a vote in principle; it did not commit us to expenditure. I would be grateful if the Minister, when she replies to the debate, could explain exactly how much money has been spent on the development of a possible replacement for Trident and what is being invested now at Aldermaston in the development of further nuclear-bomb-making facilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.3/1">Not the script because there is no script&mdash;I cannot do scripts. I was indeed about to refer to the speech by the former Foreign Secretary, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1533" name="Margaret Beckett">the Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett)</phrase>, to the Carnegie international non-proliferation conference on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-25">25 June</phrase>. In my view, it is a very interesting, very seminal speech and extremely well put. I shall quote a couple of extracts from it, because I think it important that the House understands what she said.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.3/2">My right hon. Friend talked about the possibilities of long-term nuclear disarmament and quoted Kofi Annan. She went on to say that</p>
	<p pid="a.187.3/3" class="indent">&quot;there are some very specific triggers for action&mdash;key impending decisions&mdash;that we are fast approaching.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.187.3/4">She drew attention to the fact that START&mdash;the strategic arms reduction treaty&mdash;expires in 2009; there is not long to go. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.187.3/5" class="indent">&quot;We will need to start thinking about how we move from a bilateral disarmament framework built by the US and Russia to one more suited to our multi-polar world&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.3/6">That was an interesting use of language. She went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.187.3/7" class="indent">&quot;And then in 2010 we will have the NPT Review Conference. By the time that is held, we need the international community to be foursquare and united behind the global non-proliferation regime. We can't afford for that conference to be a fractured or fractious one: rather we must strengthen the NPT in all its aspects.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.187.3/8">Towards the end of the speech, my right hon. Friend said:</p>
	<p pid="a.187.3/9" class="indent">&quot;What we need is both vision&mdash;a scenario for a world free of nuclear weapons. And action&mdash;progressive steps to reduce warhead numbers and to limit the role of nuclear weapons in security policy. These two strands are separate but they are mutually reinforcing. Both are necessary, both at the moment too weak.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.187.3/10">In the historical context, my right hon. Friend drew a parallel with people who have stood against impossible odds and achieved something. She cited the example of those who campaigned for the end of the slave trade and quoted William Wilberforce. She cited those who sought the millennium development goals to make poverty history in our society and in our world. Her words at that conference were prescient and important.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.3/11">Nuclear weapons were used once in anger&mdash;in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. They were mere fireworks compared with the weapons that are now available in the world. Every year on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-06">6 August</phrase>, Hiroshima day, we have commemorations around the world&mdash;I always attend the one in Tavistock square in London&mdash;and every year we have aged Japanese guests who come along, who are dying of cancers, as others are dying of cancers, as a result of weapons used more than 60 years ago that are mere fireworks compared with what is now available. Those people are living the legacy of the only use of nuclear weapons. Hiroshima and Nagasaki have dedicated themselves as cities of peace. We should pay tribute to Mayor Ito of Nagasaki, who was tragically murdered earlier this year. He campaigned for peace on behalf of his city.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.3/12">We came very near to nuclear war in 1962 in the Cuban missile crisis. We came very near to nuclear war between India and Pakistan in 2002. Is it really conscionable that in the 21st century, with all the problems of poverty, hunger, malnutrition, the AIDS pandemic and the lack of sanitation around the world, we should be thinking of spending billions of pounds on developing weapons of mass destruction? Why do we not accept in its totality the NPT that came into force in 1970, the reasons that we signed it and what it commits us to? Why do we not say that our intention, our purpose, is to bring about long-term nuclear disarmament and start by setting an example by saying that this country will not proceed any further with the development of a new generation of nuclear weapons? We could use that to encourage others.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.3/13">The six-party talks have shown, in the case of North Korea, that it is possible to make progress. There are many people in this Room who would recognise that it is quite possible and, indeed, probable that progress will be made with Iran. If, however, we decide to go ahead with the new generation of nuclear weapons and the US, Russia, France and China do the same, who on earth are we to go to the NPT review conference in 2010 and proceed to lecture people in the rest of the world about why they should not develop nuclear weapons?</p>
	<p pid="a.187.3/14">This, essentially, is a moral quest with a moral purpose. Millions out there would like to see a better world, as do many in here, and we do not believe that nuclear weapons bring about peace, justice or security. Instead, they bring about danger, the possibility of proliferation and, by their very manufacture and existence, the danger of pollution. The NPT was a seminal treaty, which was promoted by countries that did not have nuclear weapons, did not want them and did not want anybody else to have them. Although the PrepCom meeting in Vienna eventually concluded with a degree of harmony and good purpose, there is no guarantee that the review conference in 2010 will achieve the same, unless the UK, as one of the five declared nuclear weapon states, does all that it can to develop the process of nuclear disarmament. That is why I called for this debate, and I look forward to the contributions of others and to the Minister's reply. This is an issue for our time; it is one that will allow us to make a real contribution and bring about a more peaceful world.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-24a.190.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2022" speakername="Dai Davies" colnum="190"  time="010:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070724/halltext/70724h0002.htm#07072481000491">
	<p pid="a.190.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> not only on his speech but on the campaign that he has supported for many years to keep Trident and nuclear weapons on the political agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/2">My constituency boasts Michael Foot and Llew Smith as my predecessors, and they were unilateralists, who campaigned for unilateral nuclear disarmament for many years. I was a multilateralist until relatively recently, but what changed my mind primarily&mdash;other than the campaigns by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament&mdash;was the reduction of nuclear weapons across the world, including in Britain, Russia and America, as well as the existence of parts of the world without nuclear weapons. Now seems to be the time to take the next step.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/3">The issue of a free vote has been mentioned. As an independent MP, I believe that the most important point is that all hon. Members must go out into their constituencies and listen to their constituents. Then, I would urge the Government to bring the issue back to Parliament and to give Parliament a free vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/4">Many things have been said about Trident, nuclear power and nuclear weapons in the past months, including during election campaigns for deputy party leaders. Many Ministers have indicated that there should perhaps be a rethink, and they should be listened to. The most important thing is that we lead as a country to show that there is another way. We must use the disarming of Trident as a negotiating point with countries such as Iran to persuade them that disarmament is the right thing to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/5">The Government held a debate that took a matter of hours, but this issue needs debating over a long time. CND has said that the move to renew does not have to be taken for six, seven, 10 and maybe 15 years, so let us have a debate. Let us not fail to talk about this issue for the sake of a matter of months.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/6">The safeguard that nuclear weapons give is a false one. I have written many questions to Ministers asking under what conditions this country would use nuclear weapons, and only two answers have come back. The first is, &quot;It is only a deterrent,&quot; but if that is the case, what is the point? The second is, &quot;We'd only use it as a retaliatory measure.&quot; I am sorry, but it gives my constituents no pleasure to think that if 300,000 people were killed by a nuclear strike in this country we would feel better if we killed another 300,000 in another country. That, to me, is no reason for using nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/7">A point has been made about cost. Estimates from &pound;20 billion to &pound;100 billion have been made&mdash;unimaginable, unreachable sums of money. We talk about postcode lotteries for health service care, including cancer treatments. At the moment flood defences, which are in the news at the moment, are among the things that the money could be much better spent on. I urge the Minister and the Government, and all hon. Members, to push for the Trident debate to come back to Parliament at the earliest opportunity, and to make sure that there is a free vote so that our consciences can lead the way.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> on securing the debate. He has long had an utterly consistent approach to these matters, and it will not surprise him that he and I disagree on one or two significant points. He has kept his CND badge polished and on public display even in recent years when it has become somewhat unfashionable among leading members of his party to advertise one's previous membership of that organisation. He is right out point to the importance of this topic.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/2">The non-proliferation treaty represented a bargain in which the non-nuclear states agreed not to acquire nuclear weapons, and to put their civil nuclear programmes under international safeguards. The nuclear states agreed to take action to prevent proliferation, to pursue disarmament negotiations, under article VI, and to allow the easy dissemination of civil nuclear technology. Any assessment of the NPT has to take all sides of that bargain into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/3">I do not agree with the hon. Member for Islington, North that the UK should give up its nuclear deterrent. Neither do I agree that there is a comfortable way out of taking the difficult decision whether to renew Trident by postponing it. The Minister will have chapter and verse, but my clear memory of our debate earlier this Session on the renewal of Trident is that all the expert advice from defence chiefs and others was that the lead-in time for the development of a renewed Trident system meant that the decision had to be taken this Parliament if we were to be in a position to renew the deterrent when the current Trident system is likely to become obsolete. For those reasons, I differ from both the Liberal Democrat spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1870" name="Richard Younger-Ross">the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross)</phrase>, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/4">It is a pity that earlier speakers did not mention that the UK has reduced its nuclear arsenal by 70 per cent. since the end of the cold war, or that we are the only one of the original five nuclear powers to have limited ourselves to a single delivery system.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-24a.196.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" speakername="Meg Munn" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs"  colnum="196"  time="010:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070724/halltext/70724h0003.htm#07072481000500">
	<p pid="a.196.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> on securing this debate. I thank him and other hon. Members for their kind words of welcome. Many thoughtful and considered contributions were made and we heard many sincerely held views. I shall do my best to respond to all of the many points that have been made. I ask hon. Members to bear with me and wait until I have got well into my speech before attempting to intervene if they fear that I am not going to respond to a particular point. I shall happily take interventions at that stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/2">From the Government's perspective the timing of the debate could not be better, because, as has been mentioned by several hon. Members, just a month ago the then Foreign Secretary spoke to the Carnegie international non-proliferation conference in Washington to call for a renewed commitment to a world free from nuclear weapons. She received a standing ovation for her speech&mdash;my aspirations this morning are somewhat lower, none the less I shall refer to the plan that she set out. The Carnegie speech set out how we as a Government want to reinvigorate the international approach to nuclear disarmament, with the explicit goal of reinforcing the NPT process in the run-up to the review conference in 2010, to which several hon. Members have referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/3">I believe that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> said that the UK has an exceptional record in meeting our NPT disarmament commitments, and we should be clear about that. What are those commitments? Article 6 imposes an obligation on all states to pursue in good faith negotiations on effective measures for cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date, on nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament. The NPT review conference in 2000 agreed by consensus 13 practical steps towards implementation of article 6. The UK remains committed to those steps and is making progress on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/4">We are disarming. The House heard in March of our decision to reduce the UK's stockpile of operationally available warheads by a further 20 per cent. to less than 160. Significant as that is, it is just the latest in a series of dramatic reductions in the UK's nuclear weapons. Since the end of the cold war, the explosive power of UK nuclear weapons will have been reduced by 75 per cent. UK nuclear weapons account for less than 1 per cent. of the global inventory.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/5">We have withdrawn and dismantled our tactical marine and airborne nuclear capabilities and, consequently, have reduced our reliance on nuclear weapons to one system: submarine-based Trident. As hon. Members have said, we are the only nuclear-weapons state to have done that. We have also reduced the readiness of the remaining nuclear force. We now have only one boat on patrol at any one time and it carries no more than 48 warheads. We have not conducted a nuclear test explosion since 1991, and we have signed and ratified the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. We have ceased production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. We have also increased transparency of our fissile material holdings, and we have produced historical records of our defence holdings of both plutonium and highly enriched uranium.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/6">Our decision to renew the Trident system did not reverse or undermine any of those positive disarmament steps. The UK is not upgrading the capabilities of the system, and there is no move to produce more useable weapons and no change in our nuclear posture or doctrine. The UK's nuclear weapons are not designed for military use during conflicts. They are a strategic deterrent that we would contemplate using only in extreme circumstances of self-defence. Over the past 50 years, the deterrent has been used only to deter acts of aggression against our vital interests, never to coerce others. I fundamentally disagree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase>, because we are not ramping up our weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/7">Hon. Members referred to timing and whether we needed to make a decision now. The issue was debated at length during the Trident debate, so I do not intend to go into it in great detail today. My right hon. Friend the Member for Derby, the then Foreign Secretary, said specifically that it would mean a decision to begin a process to design, build and commission submarines to replace the existing Vanguard class boats. That will take some 17 years, so the decision was necessary. It was discussed at great length, and it was appropriate to make it. I shall speak about the cost in a moment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-24a.198.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" speakername="Meg Munn" colnum="198"  time="010:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070724/halltext/70724h0003.htm#07072481000502">
	<p pid="a.198.1/1">Because we are maintaining the existing situation while reducing the number of warheads. Renewal is simply about maintaining the minimum nuclear capability necessary for our security, while we continue to pursue in good faith the conditions for a world free from nuclear weapons. The simple truth is that the UK is implementing its obligations under the NPT, while those states that are developing illicit nuclear weapons programmes are not.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/2">A number of hon. Members referred to cost. The average annual procurement cost represents less than 0.1 per cent. of gross domestic product, and we believe that that price is worth paying to maintain our capability. Since coming to power, the Government have increased investment in many of our public services and elsewhere, so this is not something that should be offset against this matter. Our annual expenditure on capital and running costs of the Trident nuclear deterrent, including the cost of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, from its entry into service in 1994-95 to 2004-05 is in the range of 3-4 per cent. of the defence budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/3">The UK is not the only nuclear weapons state to have been disarming. We have welcomed the series of bilateral agreements since the end of the cold war that have greatly reduced the major nuclear arsenals. By the end of this year, the US will have fewer than half the number of silo-based nuclear missiles that it had in 1990. By 2012, US operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads will be reduced to about one third of 2001 levels. Under the terms of the strategic offensive reductions treaty, Russia is making parallel cuts. The French have withdrawn four complete weapons systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/4">Last year, Kofi Annan said that the world risks becoming mired in a sterile stand-off between those who care most about disarmament, and those who care most about proliferation. He was right. The dangers of such mutually assured paralysis are dangers for us all. Any solution must be a dual one, with movement on both proliferation and disarmament&mdash;a revitalisation of the grand bargain that my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North set out so well at the beginning of his speech, and which was struck in 1968, when the non-proliferation treaty was established.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/5">Today the non-proliferation regime is under pressure, as a number of hon. Members said. We have seen the emergence of a mixture of further declared and undeclared nuclear powers, and two more countries&mdash;Iran and North Korea, which are both signatories to the NPT&mdash;present further challenges to the international community. Their actions have profound and direct implications for global security, and raise the serious prospect of proliferation across their region.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/6">The Government welcome Iran's discussions with the International Atomic Energy Association about resolving outstanding safeguarding issues, and we hope for rapid progress. Iran's suspension of all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities required by UN Security Council resolution remains crucial to restoring international confidence in Iran's nuclear intentions. It is not complying with that requirement and that is why we are discussing a possible sanctions resolution with our E3 plus three partners. As the UN Security Council has repeatedly made clear, if Iran meets the requirements for a suspension, that will open the way to negotiation with the E3 plus three about a mutually acceptable long-term arrangement. We are working hard to ensure that the matter is taken seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/7">We are not party to the six-party talks process, but we welcome the recent progress and sincerely hope that there will be further progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.1/1">As my hon. Friend is probably aware, the Government want universalisation of the NPT, and we want everyone to sign up to it. I shall refer to our general approach in trying to reinvigorate the process later in my speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.1/2">Our efforts on non-proliferation will be dangerously undermined if others believe, however unfairly, that the terms of the grand bargain have changed, so we must do more than just have an exemplary record on disarmament to date. As my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1533" name="Margaret Beckett">the Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett)</phrase>, the former Foreign Secretary, made clear in her speech in Washington, we need a renewed commitment to a world free from nuclear weapons, and a convincing plan. The point is not to convince the Iranians or the North Koreans and I do not believe for a second that further reductions in our nuclear weapons would have a material effect on their nuclear ambitions. The reason for doing more is that the moderate majority of states&mdash;our natural and vital allies on non-proliferation&mdash;want us to do more, and if we do not do so, we risk helping Iran and North Korea in their efforts to muddy the water and to turn the blame for their own nuclear intransigence back on us.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.1/3">I shall deal with the point that the hon. Member for Castle Point made about terrorism. International terrorism is a serious and sustained threat, and we must do everything we can to develop a comprehensive strategy to deal with it. However, it is not a matter of choice; we do not have to&mdash;nor should we&mdash;choose between addressing terrorist threats and nuclear threats, and we cannot choose between dealing either with those threats or with the challenges of climate change. We have to deal with all of them, and we will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.1/4">The Government are committed to an effective IAEA. We do not accept that it has insufficient resources to carry out its responsibility, and we will continue to make significant voluntary contributions to it to ensure that we provide it with appropriate support. This year's settlement provided a real increase to the budget of 1.4 per cent..</p>

	<p pid="a.200.1/1">We have set out our replacement for the Trident system and design. That is what we are discussing. Our position is that disarmament should be multilateral, and I shall come on both to address what we consider to be the important next steps and to respond to the hon. Gentleman's questions about our plans moving towards 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.1/2">Let me just outline the key components. First, we will continue to call for significant further reductions in the major Russian and US nuclear arsenals. We hope that the existing bilateral treaties will be succeeded by further clear commitments to significantly lower warhead numbers, including tactical as well as strategic nuclear weapons. We are clear that when it becomes useful to include in any negotiations the 1 per cent. of the world's nuclear weapons that belong to the UK, we will willingly do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.1/3">Secondly, we must press on with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with the fissile material cut-off treaty. Both treaties limit in real and practical ways the ability of states that are party to them to develop new weapons and expand their nuclear capabilities. The treaties play a very powerful symbolic role, too, signalling to the rest of the world that the race for more and bigger weapons is over, and that the direction from now on will be down not up. In other words, they are exactly the sort of</p>
	<p pid="a.200.1/4" class="indent">&quot;effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.200.1/5">that article 6 requires us to negotiate. That is why we are so keen for those countries that have not yet done so to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty, and why we continue to work hard for the start of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty in Geneva.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.1/6">Thirdly, we should begin now to build deeper relationships on disarmament between nuclear weapon states. For the UK's part, we have made it clear that we are ready and willing to engage with other members of the P5 on transparency and confidence-building measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.1/7">Finally, we have also announced a series of unilateral activities that the UK will undertake as a &quot;disarmament laboratory&quot;. We will participate in a new project by the International Institute for Strategic Studies on the practical steps required for the elimination of nuclear weapons, and we will undertake further detailed work at the UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment on the nuts and bolts of nuclear disarmament. That work will examine three discrete issues related to the verification of disarmament, the authentication of warheads, chain of custody problems in sensitive nuclear weapons facilities, and monitored storage of dismantled nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.1/8">I shall now deal with the other points that Members have raised. We are committed to all the NPT's three pillars: disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful use of nuclear power. The former Foreign Secretary set out that commitment very clearly in her speech in Washington, and if Members have not read it, I commend it to them. The UK is showing leadership. We are taking forward the practical work that I have just outlined, and we are working with EU partners on proposals to make withdrawal from the NPT more difficult. It is crucial for international security that states cannot just walk away and develop nuclear weapons. We are also working with Germany and the Netherlands on a uranium bond proposal that would offer countries wishing to develop their own civil nuclear industries guaranteed supplies of nuclear fuel in return for agreed safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.1/9">My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North raised the issue of Mordechai Vanunu. My hon. Friend will appreciate that we are talking about an Israeli citizen in Israel. However, I can assure my hon. Friend that during Mr. Vanunu's detention and subsequent to his release, we have raised the issue of the restrictions on him with the Israeli authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.1/10">In article six, there are two key words: &quot;good faith&quot;. The UK's record is one of good-faith disarmament. That is why we are recognised as the most forward-leaning nuclear weapons state. I have described today our determination to reinvigorate the global approach to nuclear disarmament, and the practical steps that we are taking to help achieve a world free from nuclear weapons. It should be clear that this Government are acting, and will continue to act, in the utmost good faith in fulfilling our disarmament obligations under the non-proliferation treaty.</p>

	<p pid="a.202.2/1">It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to debate Anglo-Saudi relations under your chairmanship, Miss Begg. Before I start, I should state that I am a member of the all-party group on Saudi Arabia. I am pleased to see that our chairman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">the hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase>, found the time to attend the debate, and I welcome him.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.2/2">There are 20,000 British citizens living and working in Saudi Arabia, which is by far our largest export market in the middle east. The Saudi royal family have close contact with our own. I am pleased that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office acknowledged the country's importance, and that quite a number of Ministers have visited Riyadh during the past few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.2/3">I have studied the middle east during the two years that I have been an MP, and I have been increasingly interested in Saudi Arabia's role in that part of the world. I thank Prince Sultan al-Saud, the head of the political desk at the Saudi embassy, and His Highness Prince Mohammed, the ambassador, whom I have met on a number of occasions. They are great representatives of their country and do a tremendous job here in London. I thank them for that and for the assistance that they have given me.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.2/4">Saudi Arabia is a key strategic ally, and one that is growing in influence. It has displaced the United States as well as the historical Arab diplomatic heavyweight, Egypt, as the regional power broker in the middle east. For example, at the 2002 Arab League summit in Beirut, the Saudis first proposed their peace plan for the Israel-Palestine conflict and managed to secure the support of the other Arab League members in that extremely important initiative. I shall discuss it later, but needless to say, it offers recognition and peace to Israel if it withdraws back to its pre-1967 borders.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.2/5">The Saudis have also been involved in trying to bring Hamas and Fatah together in Palestine, applying pressure to get those two increasingly conflicting and hostile groups to work with one another to ensure peace in the Gaza strip and throughout Palestine. Saudi Arabia has also tried to create peace between the Sunnis and Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.2/6">It is not well known that the Saudi king, Abdullah, has been instrumental in trying to convince the President of Sudan to accept a multinational force in Darfur. That is encouraging. As the Minister will know, in the '70s, '80s and even the early '90s, Saudi Arabia was not a big diplomatic player, tending to focus instead on domestic politics. Considering all the incredibly important initiatives that it is pursuing, not just near its borders but in other countries throughout the middle east, it is clear that it is playing an increasing role in negotiations and diplomacy. Saudi Arabia is a moderate, stable ally of the UK and a key strategic influence that we must cultivate.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.2/7">I thank the Foreign Office&mdash;I do not normally go out of my way to do so&mdash;for its initiative on one issue. The United Kingdom is the first Christian country to organise an official Hajj delegation to assist the 20,000 British Muslims who go to Mecca every year. FCO staff have met with members of the Muslim community at the Islamic centre in Regent's park.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.7/1">If he will allow me, I shall give way in a moment. The Foreign Office meets with the Muslim community at the Islamic centre in Regent's park, the Saudi ambassador attends and the FCO provides tremendous help in sorting out the logistics of ensuring that 20,000 British Muslims have a safe and secure trip to Mecca. I thank the Foreign Office for that work.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.7/2">To turn briefly to the defence industry, we owe a great debt of gratitude to the Saudis for entrusting us with their security. Over the years, they have spent a great deal of money purchasing British defence machinery. Tens of thousands of British jobs depend on those exports. We have secured exports worth billions of pounds to this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.7/3">Margaret Thatcher, the then Conservative Prime Minister&mdash;I have to put in a plug for her&mdash;did a tremendous job in the '80s on securing those contracts, as did her Ministers. I am pleased to see that the Labour Administration have continued such important negotiations in trying to secure further contracts. In June, I believe, the Secretary of State for Defence went to Saudi Arabia to discuss a contract for 72 Eurofighter Typhoon jets. I should be grateful if the Minister gave me an update on how those negotiations are going. The contract is worth billions of pounds; securing the sale of those 72 Typhoon jets would be a tremendous boost to our economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.7/4">I shall come to our other opportunities with Saudi Arabia, but I should first say that the Prime Minister should appoint a special trade envoy to the kingdom. He has appointed quite a few envoys recently; there is even an envoy for forests, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" name="Barry Gardiner">the hon. Member for Brent, North (Barry Gardiner)</phrase>, whom I saw speaking in this Chamber the other day.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.7/5">Why should the Prime Minister appoint an envoy to Saudi Arabia? Well, he has appointed an outsider, now Lord Jones of Birmingham, as global trade envoy. One can generally be pleased with that appointment, although I have some issues with the individual. The general concept of having somebody from outside in such a position is a good one. We need a special envoy to Saudi Arabia because of its huge size and the huge potential of our contracts with it. We need an outside expert who knows Saudi Arabia extremely well; who knows the culture and has a long-established network in the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend; I was about to say the same thing, before he mentioned it. On the issue of the wider Arab countries, does my hon. Friend agree that the stability of the region as a whole, including the Palestinian territory and Lebanon, would be better served and helped if those Arab countries financed the building of schools, hospitals and infrastructure rather than financing the army and equipping militia groups and terrorist organisations?</p>

	<p pid="a.207.0/1">I concur that it would be interesting to know&mdash;we should try to find out more about this&mdash;how much money the Arab League gives to educational projects in areas of conflict such as Palestine. We in the European Union, and particularly in Britain, play our part in financing Palestine and the Gaza strip and in giving development aid to that territory. We have to do everything possible to ensure that the Arab League and wealthy states, such as Saudi Arabia, play their part in financing vital educational and humanitarian projects in those areas of conflict. I agree totally with my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/2">I want to talk now about how Saudi Arabia is fighting the war on terror. In April 2007, Saudi Arabia announced the arrest of 172 suspected terrorists. The Interior Ministry said that detainees had reached</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/3" class="indent">&quot;an advance stage of readiness and what remained only was to set the zero hour for their attacks&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/4">In this country, we have recently had to make a number of arrests, regrettably, due to the increasing threat to our security. When people are arrested on suspicion of terrorism, it receives a great deal of media attention and coverage. It is difficult to imagine having to arrest 172 suspected terrorists. Many terrorists are infiltrating Saudi Arabia who have been trained in Afghanistan, Iraq and other parts of the world. Saudi Arabia is facing a hugely difficult situation in trying to cope and grapple with that. Ultimately, as we all know, it has been ramped up since May 2003 following our invasion of Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/5">According to official figures, about 144 foreigners and Saudis, including security personnel, and 120 militants have died in attacks and clashes with police since May 2003. Those are significant figures, as the Minister will acknowledge. In May 2003, al-Qaeda suicide bombers hit western housing compounds in Riyadh. In May 2004, 22 people, including an American, a Briton and an Italian, died in an attack on an oil company and housing compounds in al-Khobar. Days later, gunmen killed Simon Cumbers, an Irish cameraman working for the BBC, and seriously wounded his British colleague, Frank Gardner, as they filmed in Riyadh.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/6">I have it on good authority from my contacts in Saudi Arabia that over the past five years they have foiled 180 separate plots of insurgency within their country. No one can doubt the Saudi Arabians' effort in tackling international terrorism. The Minister knows, far better than I do, the help that our country gets from intelligence from Saudi Arabia. He knows, far better than me, a mere Back-Bencher, what happens in the communication between Saudi Arabia and our security forces. I would bet my bottom dollar that the help that we are getting from Saudi Arabia to deal with insurgency and terrorism internationally is phenomenal. I am convinced of that. We owe a debt of gratitude to our allies, who show so much confidence in us and are prepared to share so much with us to enable us to deal with the increasing threat of terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/7">I come now to the Gulf, which is a hugely important territory of water, and, in particular, to the strait of Hormuz. As the Minister knows, that strait is pivotal in securing oil supplies not only for us but for the entire world. Saudi Arabia's eastern fleet patrols that part of the world. Up until now, France and the United States have been leading the way in supplying Saudi Arabia with all the necessary vessels for its eastern fleet. We must do everything possible to provide Saudi Arabia with British ships for that fleet. We have the best naval vessels in the world, far superior to those of the French and the Americans, so we should be saying loudly to the Saudi Arabians, &quot;Buy British. Buy your vessels for your eastern fleet from the United Kingdom.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/8">In March 2007, <i>Jane's Defence Weekly</i> stated that the royal Saudi naval force had an interest in type 45 air defence destroyers. According to that journal, between two and four ships could be purchased. That would realise, for us, up to &pound;2.5 billion, providing a great many more jobs and more investment in our country. I would be grateful if the Minister could give me an update on that, and assure me that everything is being done to ensure that Saudi Arabia seriously considers British naval capabilities for modernising, upgrading and expanding her eastern fleet, which will inevitably do a great amount to help us safeguard the future and safety of the strait of Hormuz.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/9">The Minister will be pleased to hear that I am nearing the end of my speech, but I come briefly to the domestic front. Regrettably, I must say the most controversial thing that I shall say&mdash;even I have to be controversial at times. I am absolutely appalled by the honour of a knighthood to Salman Rushdie, and I believe that it should be rescinded. I should like to know who made the recommendation of a knighthood. In my estimation it was such crass management, such ineptitude, that it must have been either a deliberate provocation or incompetence of an unimaginable scale. Who suggested that our sovereign give such a huge honour to such a man? Not only is his writing appalling, but the fact that he has insulted Islam means that the honour is a deliberate provocation of Saudi Arabia and other moderate allies.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/10">The honour gives succour to the fanatics in Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries to fight the regimes in place, such as King Abdullah's and the Governments who want to align themselves and show solidarity with the west. Ultimately, they will say, &quot;There you are&mdash;you are negotiating and dealing with people who deliberately give honours to people who blaspheme against our religion.&quot; I am sorry to end on a relatively negative note, but we must be extremely careful not to upset our key moderate allies.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/11">I end by saying to the Minister that I shall continue, as long as I am a Member of Parliament, to promote Anglo-Saudi relations. Why? Because I genuinely believe that Saudi Arabia plays, and will continue to play, an increasingly important role in the stability of the middle east and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I hope that we will continue extensive ministerial visits to Riyadh and that we will invite senior members of the royal family to our country. I hope that the Minister can assure me that there will be a visit before too long. I would also be extremely grateful if he could assure me that everything possible is being done to ensure that our countries are brought ever closer together.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.2/1">I start by thanking the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham for securing the debate, especially in light of recent tensions between the two Governments; the debate is timely to say the least. He gave an eloquent although, I am bound to say, rather partial account of the current state of our relationship with the Saudi Arabian Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/2">Let me make it clear at the outset of my remarks that we should not underestimate the importance of Saudi Arabia. It has enormous influence in the region, as other hon. Members have said, and it has an invaluable relationship with the UK. It is our largest export market in the region&mdash;UK exports reached some &pound;1.4 billion in 2002. We also have a close relationship with the Saudis on security matters. Our co-operation on terrorism is well known and highly necessary, as is the Saudi influence in the middle east peace process, to which hon. Members have referred as well. A close relationship with Saudi Arabia is of course worth preserving, not least because the issues that divide us can be resolved only through persistent dialogue.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/3">That said, there is another side to the relationship from the side that we have heard much about in the debate. Before I reach the main part of my speech, let me say that I think that it would be wrong not to talk a little more about the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia and how that impacts on its relationship with the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/4">There is no doubt in the international community that there is still serious concern about the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia. The incidence of capital punishment in particular is clearly on the increase. This year there have already been 102 executions, compared with 38 in 2006. Discrimination against women has already been spoken of. It continues to be widespread and invidious, as do limitations on freedom of expression.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> on securing the debate. We look forward to the Minister's response, particularly in view of the reference on today's Order Paper to a written ministerial statement announcing a state visit by the King of Saudi Arabia to this country. I hope that the Minister will enlighten us about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/2">When introducing the debate, my hon. Friend was right to point to the breadth of interests that bring together the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia. We have a long-standing set of relationships with the various countries of the Arabian peninsula, and this debate gives us the opportunity to reassert the importance of those relationships, particularly the one that we have with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. At times, there has been a danger that we have neglected those historic ties and there is certainly evidence that our partners and competitors in France and Germany have mounted a vigorous programme of bilateral contacts with Riyadh and other capitals in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/3">I would like the Government to lead a long-term effort, with cross-party support, to elevate the United Kingdom's relations with all countries in the Gulf. As my hon. Friend pointed out, such an initiative would cover a wide range of political subjects, such as economic and commercial co-operation, security ties, links between the Parliaments and educational institutions in our various countries, cultural links, co-operation against terrorism and nuclear proliferation, and sporting ties, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">the hon.

	<p pid="a.220.1/1">I wonder whether that intervention was prepared when Miss Begg was overseeing our proceedings earlier. Thus far, she has been the only woman to participate in our debate, although I am, of course, delighted that my hon. Friends the Members for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) and for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark) are with us.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/2">If colleagues will allow me, I will make a couple of points about our bilateral trade relationship with Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia remains the UK's largest trade and investment partner in the middle east and accounts for 25 per cent. of the Arab world's GDP, which is more than the other five Gulf Co-operation Council countries and Egypt combined. On the point about an EU trade agreement, conversations continue, and further meetings are planned for October. We would hope to make quick progress on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/3">Today, the UK's trade and investment links with Saudi Arabia are stronger than ever and they are growing. Over the past few months, the importance of that relationship has been clearly demonstrated at Government level by a number of high- level visits. Those include visits by the Duke of York, in his role as special representative for trade and investment, and by UK Trade and Investment's chief executive, Andrew Cahn. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor also visited Saudi Arabia in May, in his role as the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/4">Let me respond now to the points raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" name="Mark Hunter">the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter)</phrase>. In the short time available, I do not intend to rehearse the debate that we had on the Floor of the House, and nor do I wish to add to the detailed responses that the Solicitor-General and the Minister for the Middle East offered on specific points. However, I do want to say on the record once again that the Serious Fraud Office's decision was taken by the director alone. The Government have given good reason to believe that there is a real danger to our co-operation with a country that is vital to us, and I do not use the word &quot;vital&quot; lightly in describing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's importance to us. It would have been wholly irresponsible of us to ignore that information and wholly wrong not to make the SFO aware of it. The SFO made a decision based on that evidence, and, on balance, we believe that it was the right decision. We are also confident that it is compatible with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/5">The hon. Gentleman reflected his constituency interest in an observation about BAE's good name, but let me gently tell him that the tone of some of his hon. Friends' comments in recent weeks&mdash;it was perhaps unintentional&mdash;does not do an awful lot to enhance the well-deserved good name of BAE in this country and internationally.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.1/1">Mr. Hood, it is always a delight to see you in the Chair and to have the opportunity to raise a subject of great importance. I stand here as a trade union MP, in the sense that I have the support of ASLEF, the train drivers' union. However, the matter that I want to raise today has enormous importance right across the field of representation.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/2">I and other Labour Members of Parliament are here today because of the existence of trade unions. It is not an accident that trade unions began in the United Kingdom. We have always had a commitment&mdash;I think that it exists in the Anglo-Saxon character&mdash;that makes us strongly resent anything that happens to the detriment of fair play, in industrial relations or with respect to any organisational change. I think, therefore, that it is important that this country should uphold, as it does, the labour laws that are part and parcel of our commitment to fairness, decency and proper standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/3">I want to talk today about a bus company. The way in which United Kingdom companies operate, in the UK and elsewhere, affects their efficiency and their ability to succeed. It is their particular responsibility to ensure that what they do is properly supported by the rules of law and, more than that, that it clearly shows a proper commitment to justice and the general principles on which the International Labour Organisation declarations are based. It is therefore important to raise the matter of First Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/4">First Group is a very successful transport company. It has expanded from a very small base into the railway and bus industries. Very many companies are involved with it. It has been extraordinarily successful and, in this country, very well run. It has conducted proper industrial relations. It has a strong and robust connection with the Transport and General Workers Union and it has made its commitment to proper trade relations clear. It is therefore worrying to see, as it begins to expand elsewhere, that that may not necessarily be a tradition that is fully carried out in other countries. We should perhaps today consider some of the things that are happening, which will rebound badly not just on First Group but on the reputation of United Kingdom companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/5">We might first refer to passages in the ILO conventions on trade union rights and civil liberties. Members of Parliament frequently mention their commitment to the ILO conventions; I wonder how many of them have read the conventions, including the provisions that state</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/6" class="indent">&quot;that a system of democracy is fundamental for the free exercise of trade union rights&quot;;</p>

	<p pid="a.223.1/8" class="indent">&quot;the contribution of trade unions and employers' organizations to be properly useful and credible, they must be able to carry out their activities in a climate of freedom and security&quot;;</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/9">and that a</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/10" class="indent">&quot;free trade union movement can develop only under a regime which guarantees fundamental rights, including the right of trade unionists to hold meetings in trade union premises, freedom of opinion expressed through speech and the press and the right of detained trade unionists to enjoy the guarantees of normal judicial procedure&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/11">Another paragraph states:</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/12" class="indent">&quot;The International Labour Conference has pointed out that the right of assembly, freedom of opinion and expression and, in particular, freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers constitute civil liberties which are essential&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/13">A commitment is also made:</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/14" class="indent">&quot;Although holders of trade union office do not, by virtue of their position, have the right to transgress legal provisions in force, these provisions should not infringe the basic guarantees of freedom of association, nor should they sanction activities which, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association, should be considered as legitimate&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/15">That is all very clear and good and is well supported in a Parliament that has grown up because of reaction to the imposition of unfair or unacceptable laws.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/16">Why, then, do I worry about what First Group is doing elsewhere? First Group is a company that because it is successful&mdash;I am happy to record that&mdash;is expanding. In the United States it is not just expanding into one company; it is expanding into a much larger company than was originally intended. Forty per cent. of the non-management staff of Laidlaw International Inc., which First Student appears to be about to take over, for $2.8 billion, are represented by trade unions. Why should that be a matter for concern? First Group is facing a serious risk to its reputation and it is best to speak plainly. It is because of its continuing aggressive interference in workers' organising rights, community consensus and the adequate funding of school transport services.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/17">I spoke to trade union representatives who came here from the United States of America, because I am very concerned about the reputation of transport companies, whether they operate in the UK or organise elsewhere. I knew very little of the situation and asked to be given a detailed brief. I was very surprised to see that, in spite of the fact that the company has pledged to support the principles of the ILO conventions on workers' freedom of association, three different reports produced for the Teamsters union by well respected members of universities&mdash;Lance Compa of Cornell, a professor specialising in labour and human rights law, John Logan, a scholar and professor at the school of management at the London School of Economics, and Fred Feinstein, who was on the US National Labour Relations Board, the Government agency that enforces federal labour law&mdash;make it clear that there has been a consistent, targeted and deliberate attempt to make it almost impossible for members of the First Student companies to organise, meet together and operate as a proper trade union. There is considerable detail in all the reports, which I will spare you, Mr. Hood, because I hope that we can accept that anyone who wants to know the details will read the &quot;Third Report on Freedom of Association and Workers' Rights Violations at First Student, Inc.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/18">Those matters were outlined to me by individual members of the Teamsters union. I was very taken by the representatives who came to the House of Commons. A lady who was a bus driver on a student bus was, apart from her accent, very much like the sort of person I would meet in my constituency. She was a lone mother, entirely on her own, who had found, in her job, a way to combine earning an income and running her family. She ran a bus journey for students, to and fro twice a day. She was not in any way an extreme or difficult person. She was the sort of person one would hope to see forming the cadre of trade union representatives. It is extraordinarily worrying that those workers were subjected to a targeted and consistent programme of something that I will not call persuasion, because it seems to me that persuasion, particularly on the part of management, must be couched in very controlled and considered terms; they were subjected to a very deliberate attempt to persuade them that joining the union or seeking together to create a union in their work place would lead to very direct consequences for them. One threat appears to have been, &quot;We'll deal with your depot in the way that we dealt with Baltimore,&quot; where, as far as one can see, because the staff voted for trade union representation, they were told that that depot would be shut down&mdash;and that is what happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/19">We should be quite clear about such matters in this country. If a similar situation arose with a bus company in the UK, I, personally, and, I am sure, many other trade union representatives in this House, as well as those who do not directly belong to trade unions but are concerned about labour relations because of their commitment to fairness would seek to raise the matter time and again. The UK Government have made it plain that even though they have no intention of interfering with and should not interfere with the commitment of UK companies abroad to the legal systems in which they cease to operate, they nevertheless require those companies to take account of and be responsible to the ILO convention. I have made it clear exactly what that implies. The House of Commons has a direct responsibility to tell such companies, &quot;You may operate in the way you think best in a capitalist system. That is, of course, your responsibility: you are responsible to your shareholders and you have a responsibility to ensure that your performance is acceptable to those who support you. However, because you are a British company, you may not ignore aspects of responsible behaviour that we in this country regard as a norm.&quot; Commitment to the ILO is absolutely essential.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/20">Today, I received from Moir Lockhead a letter that I found rather nowty, as we would say in my part of the country. Let us say that I did not turn up when he wished to talk to a representative of his and independent monitor who</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/21" class="indent">&quot;would welcome the chance...to discuss the implementation of FirstGroup's workplace human rights&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/22">He assures me that, within the UK, the company will comply with its commitments regarding trade union organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/23">The TGWU has made it clear that it finds it difficult to understand how a company that is so responsible in the UK and complies with its agreements with the trade unions could go so far to impede the creation of trade union rights within the United States. When we say that it is impossible to form a trade union within that company, we are talking not about the wilder shores of Saudi Arabia, the jungle regions of Colombia or some of the far-flung pits of Guatemala, but about the United States of America&mdash;a country that shares with us a common law system, approximately the same language and a financial system based on the capitalism that is now so fashionable. We have always regarded the United States as having direct roots in its relationship with the UK. I therefore feel more than justified in raising the issue of the anti-union behaviour there, which has been aggressive, deliberate, consistent and larded with the sort of threats that I would find wholly unacceptable if they were targeted at members of my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/24">I finish by making this point. I have in my time&mdash;I am only 21, but I have been around for a little while&mdash;met trade unionists and seen trade unions being run by people who were venal, inefficient, incompetent, arrogant and unacceptable. I have seen arguments put forward in the name of trade unionism that I found difficult to recognise, but I have also, over a lifetime of commitment to the labour movement, seen trade unions filled with people who were wholly committed to fairness, decency and the improvement of conditions for their fellow workers. I have seen people pay a high price for their trade unionism in this country, and I do not find that acceptable, but we now have a country that accepts the right of workers to organise. It is a very small thing to ask of a successful company in the transport industry that it should comply with the same standards and norms elsewhere, and I am astonished that it has not reached that conclusion of its own volition. The House of Commons would be unwise to ignore the behaviour of such a successful British company, lest it be thought that that is the way in which we operate as soon as we leave UK shores.</p>

	<p pid="a.230.1/1">I am grateful to you, Mr. Hood, and to Mr. Speaker for allowing me to raise the Child Support Agency's extreme shortcomings, and particularly two constituency cases that will more than amplify those. I am also grateful to the Minister for being here this morning. He has the unenviable task of trying to answer for an agency that I believe is completely out of control.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/2">Let me begin with the case of Ms Sonia Poulton, whose story is among the worst cases of officialdom working against the vulnerable and weak that I have witnessed during 15 years in this House. To date, I have written 23 letters and made 14 telephone calls about Ms Poulton and the maintenance of her daughter Shaye. Neither Ms Poulton nor I are satisfied with her treatment by the CSA, and I am staggered by the gross ineptitude that characterises the agency's dealings with her.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/3">Ms Poulton first approached me on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-27">27 January 2004</phrase>, three and a half years ago, as her payments from the CSA had ceased owing to a &quot;computer error&quot;. Even three years ago, Ms Poulton characterised her position as &quot;hellish&quot; and stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/4" class="indent">&quot;'despite repeated promises from them, the situation has seriously deteriorated&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/5">That turned out not to be an isolated occurrence. Throughout 2004, the CSA failed to collect payments because it was told that the father of Ms Poulton's daughter had left his employment with a London local authority. That turned out not to be the case. The local authority for which he worked had failed to fulfil the deduction of earnings order in his paperwork, and the CSA had not chased a response.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/6">Shortly afterwards Shaye's father did move job and in October 2004 a consolatory payment was promised when my office telephoned the MPs' hotline. However, Ms Poulton was informed directly by the CSA a little later that an assessment and a consolatory payment could not be made until a month later in November. The CSA informed us that &pound;110 was sent to Ms Poulton on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-27">27 October</phrase>, but that was never received. Meanwhile, Sonia Poulton and her daughter were plunged into even greater debt. In December 2004, we saw no ray of hope when the independent case examiner accepted Ms Poulton's case. That move, of course had no effect on the CSA making a payment of &pound;120 on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-20">20 December</phrase>. It was fitting, however, that Ms Poulton's first payment of 2004 should come in December.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/7">The case was investigated, and the CSA was found to be at fault. It was ordered to consider&mdash;only consider&mdash;a consolatory payment and compensation to Ms Poulton. Despite being brought before the independent case examiner, who identified its faults, the CSA compounded its error by writing to Ms Poulton in November 2005 announcing that her arrears amounted to &pound;1,335.86, despite earlier reports that they amounted to &pound;5,191.18. I wrote to the agency demanding to know why Ms Poulton's arrears had been reduced by a staggering &pound;3,855.32.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/8">Meanwhile, the independent case examiner recommended that the case should be investigated by the ombudsman, and told the CSA that the arrears occurred only as a result of its maladministration, and that the agency should make an advance payment. By December 2006, the CSA said that the arrears had increased to &pound;4,298.30, but in a characteristic sidestep stated that the advance payment was not ready. Ms Poulton was grossly misled by her CSA caseworker, Shaheen Khan, who was based in the Bolton office. Ms Khan claimed that she had spoken to Shaye's father on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-05">5 January 2007</phrase> and established a deduction from earnings order. She claimed that he had submitted the order to his current place of employment and that payments would be forthcoming. Ms Khan verified that both verbally and in writing. Mid February arrived, but maintenance did not. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-21">21 February</phrase>, a different CSA employee confirmed that no money had been received by the CSA, and that Shaye's father had in fact left his employment on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-03">3 October</phrase>, three months earlier, so it is beyond me how Ms Khan was able to speak to Shaye's father on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-05">5 January</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/9">On discovering privately that her former partner had left his place of employment, Sonia Poulton raised the issue, and Ms Khan behaved in a deeply inappropriate and impertinent way according to my constituent. The chief executive's office, no less, subsequently apologised for that behaviour and blamed it on the stress of working in the Bolton office. That particular member of staff's behaviour, which Ms Poulton reported in writing, is deplorable and worthy of disciplinary action, if it has not already been taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/10">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-21">21 February</phrase>, Ms Poulton wrote to me to say that she had not received payments since October 2006 because the CSA had told her that the maintenance schedule had expired, and no one had thought to put a new one in place. Although a new schedule was prepared from January 2007, no payments were received. In April this year, I chased the CSA and, believe it or not, it could find no record of those responsible for dealing with Ms Poulton's case because&mdash;you may have guessed, Mr. Hood&mdash;the files had gone missing and the computer system had failed.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/11">The CSA admitted that the Hastings office, where Ms Poulton's case was being handled, was unable to secure a response from the Bolton office, and that if I was unhappy about that, I should write to the independent case examiner. The examiner's reply in May said that the matter had been referred to the CSA chief executive. One could not have made up this story of incompetence.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/12">Finally, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-11">11 June</phrase>, my office was told that Shaye's father was receiving jobseeker's allowance, and that no arrears would be collected until his employment recommenced, when a new assessment would be made. Who knows what new and exciting challenges that reassessment will bring. Alison Cox, in the CEO's office, told us that the Bolton office refused to communicate with the rest of the agency. In fact, when Ms Poulton spoke to Ms Cox, she had more up-to-date information, garnered from her MP's office, than the CEO of the agency. That of course raises serious questions about the agency's ability to keep track of cases, and poses serious questions about its internal management.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/13">The CSA's staff agree that something should be done about the Bolton office. I was advised that staff turnover there is high. Information was excessively difficult to extract and the staff had no concept of the fact that they were dealing with people's lives. That is, I think, a conclusion that I would have reached independently, although I was grateful to have it confirmed by the impressions of the staff in the Hastings office&mdash;I mean that sincerely.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/14">Overall, Ms Poulton's case is a sorry tale of gross maladministration and lack of consistent information or interest from many of the officers and staff who were duty bound to look out for the interests of young Shaye and her mother. She is still owed thousands of pounds. Will the Minister today guarantee&mdash;I do not want mere platitudes&mdash;that the matter will be rapidly sorted out?</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/15">This case is especially vexing to me, because I have raised it before with the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1909" name="James Plaskitt">the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt)</phrase>, who said that the agency would</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/16" class="indent">&quot;be able to clarify all the outstanding points.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-02-06.580"><i>Official Report</i>, 6 February 2006; Vol. 442, c. 580</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/17">Let us hope that today the Minister, for whom I have high regard, can clarify some of the outstanding points.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/18">Let me now turn to my second constituency case. Mr. David Dalleywater first contacted me in February this year stating that the CSA had written to him claiming that he had not been paying the correct maintenance from 2000 to 2006. He was told that he owed arrears of &pound;8,113.51, despite regularly paying &pound;60 per week to the parent who had custody of his child. Later that month, he received a notice of liability order for the revised amount, which had fallen to &pound;5,413.51. It staggers me that the agency can come up with such differing sums so rapidly one after another. That order was based on a letter of 2004, which my constituent denies ever signing. Mr. Dalleywater made several telephone calls, and was told erroneously, but repeatedly in writing and on the telephone, that he could not have a copy of the letter that he had apparently signed.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/19">I wrote to the agency in February, requesting a copy of that letter. More than a month later on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-27">27 March</phrase>, I chased the agency, and in the meantime Mr. Dalleywater received a summons to appear in court on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-18">18 April</phrase>. Despite repeated requests, he had not received an account summary to show how his arrears had been calculated. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-17">17 April</phrase>, the CSA relented and let Mr. Dalleywater know that he could have a copy of his alleged letter, providing he wrote again to ask for it. We were told that the CSA was preparing an account summary, which of course prompts the question of how it intended to proceed with a court case without that vital piece of information.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/20">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-30">30 May</phrase>, I received a delightful letter from the CSA, featuring &quot;sorry&quot; five times. It apologised for the unhelpfulness shown to Mr. Dalleywater during the CSA's dealings with him. Although the sentiment is appreciated, it has not and does not clear up Mr. Dalleywater's case. It is heartening that the disputed letter, of which Mr. Dalleywater finally saw a copy, has been passed to the criminal investigation team; however, the accompanying account breakdown indicated that Mr. Dalleywater owed not &pound;5,413.51, but a staggering &pound;18,094.57. One could not make it up. The CSA was gracious enough to admit that there was a slight discrepancy&mdash;in that instance to the tune of a mere &pound;12,681.06. Court proceedings were therefore adjourned until the correct figures were ascertained. One can only imagine what the judge would have said if the agency had turned up with such unreliable figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/21">Finally, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-06">6 July</phrase>, we received a response stating that Mr. Dalleywater's total arrears were actually &pound;513.58. How the CSA was able to calculate such wildly different sums&mdash;with impunity and claim them all as gospel&mdash;is totally beyond me, and no doubt the rest of the House. The letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-06">6 July</phrase> explains the various and tortured routes that the Minister's staff in the CSA took to arrive at such staggeringly different amounts&mdash;in the process, wasting time and taxpayers' hard-earned money with their efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/22">I have written eight letters and made seven phone calls on behalf of Mr. Dalleywater, and although many CSA staff members have tried to be helpful, there are clearly deep and perhaps insurmountable problems in that faceless and creaking bureaucracy. The only part of the agency that seems to be able to function is the arm that takes people to court. David Dalleywater, like Sonia Poulton, feels that the CSA has treated his case appallingly. He was unable to obtain either direct answers to his questions from CSA staff, or indeed a copy of a letter that the CSA claimed he wrote in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/23">I am sure that the Minister will be well aware of the CSA's website statement that the agency can help to</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/24" class="indent">&quot;ensure parents who live apart from their children contribute financially to their upkeep...work out who should pay and how much...make sure more children receive the maintenance they are entitled to...take quick and firm action to make sure payments get made&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/25">It has failed to fulfil any of those tasks. The Home Office, on the admission of no less a celebrated and illustrious figure than the former Home Secretary, has been declared &quot;not fit for purpose&quot;. However, on the strength of those two cases, it seems that the Child Support Agency is not even fit to open an envelope.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/26">The then Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, now the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, declared a year ago that the CSA would be abolished. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/27" class="indent">&quot;These reforms will address the fundamental flaws in the current system.&quot; &mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-07-24.602"><i>Official Report</i>, 24 July 2006; Vol. 449, c. 602</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/28">Goodbye to that unhappy agency, to the &quot;troubled history&quot; of the CSA, flawed from day one.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/29">I ask the Minister sincerely not only to abolish the CSA, but to give me some firm pledges today that those two cases will be resolved rapidly, so that the children, particularly, and the parents who have custody of them, receive the money that they deserve.</p>

	<p pid="a.238.1/2">You, Mr. Hood, and I are proud of the Commonwealth, which has 53 sovereign, independent member states, only 16 of which have Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. I shall refer to that again, because it is important to place on the record that the overwhelming majority of Commonwealth members are republics.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/3">I am proud of the fact that the Commonwealth is an informal, mutually owned organisation that does an awful lot of good around the world&mdash;somewhat silently, but to the tremendous benefit of millions of people. Each Commonwealth country is responsible for its own policies, but they all work together in consultation and co-operation in the interests of their people. They try to reduce conflict and are involved in conflict prevention and bringing peace to the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/4">The Commonwealth's strength is in its diversity and geographical extent&mdash;rich and poor, developed and undeveloped, north and south. Commonwealth countries' common factors include a common language, in many cases, as well as history and democratic values. Such values are the cornerstone of the Commonwealth and are enshrined in the Singapore declaration of Commonwealth principles, made in 1971 and reiterated at Harare in 1991.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/5">The Commonwealth works closely with and in the spirit of the United Nations charter. Many organisations are related to Commonwealth agencies, including the Commonwealth Development Corporation and the scientific and education organisations. Many of us are proud of what is probably the second biggest single festival of sport&mdash;the Commonwealth games, which are very important to all the participants and countries involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/6">That is the background to the Commonwealth of which you and I are very proud, Mr. Hood. However, in my mind's eye, each time there is a Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, or CHOGM, there is an empty chair, in front of which is a notice bearing the words &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot;. Why do I use the empty-chair analogy? To me, an empty chair indicates the temporary absence of an occupant who will return, or that the attendance of the person for whom the chair is designated has been delayed.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/7">I use the analogy because historians, both in the Republic of Ireland and here, say&mdash;erroneously, in my view&mdash;that Ireland left the Commonwealth when Taoiseach John Costello decided in August 1948 to repeal the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936 and inaugurate the Republic of Ireland on Easter Monday 1949.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/8">However, I think that the historians are wrong: at that time, the Commonwealth, to the extent that it existed, was nothing like the Commonwealth of today. Its only sovereign, independent states in April 1949 were Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, apart from Ireland. The Commonwealth of the time bore no relationship to that of today. There is also the backdrop: at the time, all but Eire had been involved in what was then the recent second world war. Relations between not only Ireland and the United Kingdom, but those other states were still somewhat fraught&mdash;something epitomised by the exchanges of Winston Churchill and Eamon De Valera in their two great broadcasts of May 1945.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/9">However, things have moved on, and I raise this matter today in that spirit. It is also important to remember that, paradoxically, some of the great Irish statesmen have contributed to the modern Commonwealth. One is Eamon De Valera, who in 1921 came up with the concept of external association. At the time, the British Government could not get their heads around the idea that a state could be associated with those other states, with their historic ties and traditions, and yet be a republic. Valera's document No. 2 in the treaty negotiations of 1921 was spurned and rejected.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/10">However, it came alive again five days after the Republic of Ireland was inaugurated by Taoiseach Costello in April 1949, because on 22, 25 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-26">26 April</phrase> that year, the Prime Ministers of the remaining countries of what was then called the Commonwealth agreed that in 1950 Pandit Nehru could bring his newly independent India into the Commonwealth as its first republic.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/11">De Valera's concept of external association was adopted, but unfortunately those dealing with relations with Ireland could not get their heads around the idea that that formulation for India should have been triggered for Ireland in 1948-49. The rest is history; as I have said, the majority of Commonwealth countries take advantage of the concept and are republics within the Commonwealth.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/12">I have mentioned Eamon De Valera, but his adversaries in the Irish domestic situation also contributed greatly to the modern Commonwealth. I refer particularly to Desmond Fitzgerald&mdash;father of Garret Fitzgerald&mdash;Kevin O'Higgins and Patrick McGilligan. In the dominion conferences of the 20s and 30s&mdash;after the creation of the Irish Free State and with the support of W.T. Cosgrave, the Free State Premier&mdash;those men tried to stretch the envelope of their independence and enthusiastically interested the other countries in doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/13">The Anglo-Irish treaty of 1921 stated that the Irish Free State would have the same status as Canada's. That was seized by the plenipotentiaries who signed that treaty, but they went on to try to increase and build on it. They argued and persuaded Canada and Australia to seek greater independence; that was reflected in legislation such as the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927. However, the culmination was the Statute of Westminster 1931, which is still the cornerstone of the independence of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and many other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/14">When Eamon De Valera came into office in 1932, he was able to abolish the oath. On the occasion of the abdication, he was able to alter the Irish Free State's head of state position&mdash;he did away with the post of Governor-General, created the office of President, and moved things on a ratchet towards a republic, which he desired and for which he had a mandate. He also introduced the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936, which reduced the role of the monarch to a residual one, by which diplomatic representation was notionally done through the King and the signing of treaties. In every other respect, Ireland had moved to being a republic, although it was not declared as such.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/15">I have given that history because when we come to 1948-49 there was the apparent breach that I mentioned. As I said, the formula extended to Pandit Nehru was unfortunately not extended to, offered to or taken up by Ireland, although in retrospect it should have been. I do not think that it is too late for that to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/16">It is also interesting that Clement Attlee was somewhat exercised by the Taoiseach Costello declaration. However, he had the good counsel of the Canadian External Affairs Minister, the great Lester Pearson, and that of Prime Ministers Chifley of Australia and Fraser of New Zealand. My predecessor, the late, great Hugh Delargy, MP for Thurrock, helped persuade the British Government to pass the Ireland Act 1949, which decided not to treat Irish men and women as aliens, but to give them special status, which they enjoy today. I should say in parenthesis that as a consequence, many Members of this House of Commons hold Irish citizenship or are entitled to; some Ministers do, I think.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/17">A special relationship was created, anyway, but the terminology was not such that that Ireland was in the Commonwealth and, as I have said, that was followed by non-attendance at Commonwealth councils, at CHOGM and so on, which I regret. It should have been, as the spirit was that the franchise was as available to people of the Republic of Ireland as it was to citizens of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/18">By the mid-1950s, Ireland had joined the United Nations under External Affairs Minister Frank Aiken and since then it has not only been a great player in the United Nations but has been great friends of the Secretary-General, particularly using its small but highly skilled armed forces in the delicate matter of peace operations. It has contributed enormously to that, and I mention it because part of the role of the Commonwealth is peace, conflict prevention, keeping potential adversaries apart and trying to keep safety. Of course, Ireland has had a distinguished role in the European Union. It has held the presidency very successfully on a number of occasions. Ireland has a small population, but with great professionalism it punches above its weight in the United Nations, the European Union and many other councils. The missing element in my view, to our disadvantage, is its lack of membership of the Commonwealth.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/19">The Commonwealth is run by a small secretariat. It is not the British Commonwealth, but the Commonwealth&mdash;it has not been the British Commonwealth for decades. Its secretary-general has never been drawn from the United Kingdom: the present one is a former and distinguished Foreign Minister of New Zealand. I hope and think that one day the natural supply for the role of secretary-general would be professional diplomats from the Irish Republic or even a retired Taoiseach who has done so much to bring peace in our islands and throughout the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/20">What do I want from the debate? I trust that it will not be seen as presumptuous, but I hope that the United Kingdom branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association might reflect on what I have said and extend invitations to members of the Oireachtas to any of its future conferences. It might also raise the issue in the international conference of the CPA. I hope that both the secretary-general of the CPA and the secretary-general of the Commonwealth, Don McKinnon, will also take on board some of my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/21">I hope that the high commissioners in London of the Commonwealth countries, particularly those of Australia, Canada and New Zealand, because of their historic role and because so many of their fellow countrymen and women are part of the Irish diaspora&mdash;the Irish diaspora are in every corner of the Commonwealth, playing a full part in business commerce and public life&mdash;will reflect on what I have said. I hope that the Irish embassy in London will reflect on what I have said. I hope that it will not be too presumptuous to ask the Minister if, if I can persuade him that I have a case, to refer the matter to our Prime Minister. We are in a new era of relationships. I do not say that this should come about because of the Good Friday agreement and the success of <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-08">8 May</phrase> this year, with the new dispensation for north and south, Catholic and Protestant, republican and Unionist. The time is right for Ireland to take its place in the club in which it has not taken up its seat.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/22">This case needs to be remedied. I hope that those countries that are not independent sovereign states in the Commonwealth, such as our friends in the Isle of Man, might discuss the matter in their legislatures. At least they can use their good offices to invite, particularly the Isle of Man, which shares the Celtic, Viking heritage of the Republic of Ireland and whose language was rescued by Eamon De Valera in the early 1950s. I hope that everyone will reflect on the point.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/23">This is not the first time that I have raised this point. I raised it with a Minister a long time ago&mdash;not this Minister. That Minister was a mediocre one, who pompously said, &quot;It is a matter for the Irish Republic to apply.&quot; That made me very cross, and still does today. I know that we will get a different response, however. One of the things that all organisations do&mdash;it does not matter if they are the Boy Scouts, the Townswomen's Guilds, the Reform Club or a workingmen's club&mdash;is to extend invitations to people who they think can contribute and whose presence would be valuable. They do it as a way of extending to those people their respect for them. That is why I think that an invitation should be extended to the Irish Republic.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/24">There might be a residual one or two people who do not think that such an invitation ought not to come from the United Kingdom. So be it. Let this Minister say that he will work with Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the Caribbean countries and the countries around the world to see whether they should take the initiative of inviting the Irish Republic to take its natural place in the Commonwealth of nations.</p>

	<p pid="a.242.0/1">We spent many long evenings talking about many different issues. If only I had known about his interest in and passion for this subject, it would have saved us a huge number of other less riveting debates and conversations on which we were unable to find any great unanimity.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/2">My hon. Friend's comments encourage me finally to get round to reading a book that I bought some time ago, an Attlee book. I think its proper title is &quot;Empire into Commonwealth&quot;. My hon. Friend referred to Clem Attlee, and I shall undertake to read it over the summer recess. Whether it will make me less or more mediocre, I am uncertain, but I shall read that work of Attlee's.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/3">My hon. Friend was right to refer to the fact that many Members owe some affection to Ireland. I remember growing up and thinking about whether I would play international football for Scotland or Ireland; I then realised that it was not an issue of nationality but a rank failure of any ability that meant that I was incapable of playing for either of those two great nations.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/4">I should start by formally putting on the record Her Majesty's Government's welcome to the new ambassador to the United Kingdom from Ireland, Mr. David Cooney, who started work yesterday, I believe. I look forward to meeting him and discussing the many different issues that commonly concern us.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/5">I offer my next observation with a sense of great trepidation. My notes say that I should say, first of all, that it is of course for the Government of Ireland to decide whether or not they wish to join the Commonwealth. That was a prophetically drafted first sentence. However, perhaps I could add an additional comfort for my hon. Friend that although it is not for the UK to invite a new member to the Commonwealth, as he implicitly acknowledged when he said that at one time it was Britain's Commonwealth but that it is now a collection of states that share a common sense of values, the Prime Minister will discuss possible new membership criteria for the Commonwealth with his fellow heads of Government at the next CHOGM. That might offer some hope to my hon. Friend, although I understand that it does not capture the kind of thing that he is talking about. It is largely about whether there is consensus on the sort of membership criteria that allow countries without a constitutional link, such as Rwanda and others, to apply to join the Commonwealth.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/6">Let me set out some of the areas where we have close co-operation with Ireland while it remains outside the Commonwealth, and say a few more words about that. He is right that there was a degree of excitement and speculation about possible Irish membership of the Commonwealth after the recent visit by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association to the Northern Ireland Assembly. I do not know whether the Irish Government intend to join the Commonwealth, or even whether they are considering that step. Nothing that I have seen or read suggests that to be the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/7">As he said, Ireland left the Commonwealth in the 1940s because it wanted to make a decisive break with Britain's colonial past. India faced a similar choice but took an entirely different route. As a result, the modern Commonwealth was born. The UK understands the motivations of both countries in taking those decisions, but, now as then, they must themselves decide on their relationships with the Commonwealth. I hope today to show that, since that decision to leave in the 1940s, Ireland, the Commonwealth and the UK's relationship with both have evolved and improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/8">The Commonwealth would find the Ireland of today not just prosperous but booming, with an economy and a culture that is the envy of many. That is clear to any of us who visit Ireland on official visits, although I have not had the opportunity to do so recently, or who go to Donegal, as many of us do and as I do in my annual holiday. Over the years, the transformation of that part of Ireland has been remarkable and is emblematic of the transformation that continues across Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/9">Equally Ireland, in its assessment of the Commonwealth, would share my hon. Friend's perception that it has changed unrecognisably. It has come of age based on values, not on some historical relationship. Ireland would be unlikely to see any traces of colonialism and would instead see a modern, vibrant and international organisation, as he eloquently said.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/10">Many nations are keen to join the Commonwealth, because it brings together states because of who they are, not what they want. It spans divides of wealth and size, as he said, and its members share a cultural and emotional bond and strong people-to-people links. More than 80 Commonwealth organisations link groups of people such as nurses, young people, lawyers and many others. The Commonwealth gives all its members an equal voice and, as he alluded to, is a unique forum in which to be heard. It is a forum where Asia and Africa can meet and learn from each other, where small island states have as much influence as anyone else and where developed and developing countries and emerging powers such as India can find common ground. Its members span all five continents and are all committed to the democratic values set out in the Harare declaration. Tolerance, justice and democracy are the Commonwealth's guiding principles, and it keeps to them, suspending members who fail to respect Commonwealth values.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/11">We have a unique relationship with Ireland, based on our shared history. Were it to happen, Irish membership of the Commonwealth would provide a new context for that relationship.</p>

	<p pid="a.243.3/1">Of course that may be appropriate. My hon. Friend is not being a nuisance; having spent five years with him on that rooftop I can say that on some occasions he was a nuisance, but not today. But in trying to offer him hope on that specific point I say to him that, if Ireland were to make an application, we would of course enter into discussions and debate about specifics, timings and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.3/2">His introductory comments were fascinating. We have all listened to hundreds of speeches in the House, and I know that my hon. Friend does not welcome false praise, but his speech was one of the most interesting that I have had the opportunity to listen to in the past four or five years. I hope that he takes that in the spirit in which I offer it.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.3/3">On our close co-operation, there has been landmark progress in Northern Ireland, as we all know, which has led to the re-establishment of the devolved Executive there. I remember watching the rugby match at Croke Park between England and Ireland and cheering&mdash;I shall not say who for, but it was a good afternoon's rugby&mdash;and witnessing a Taoiseach address both Houses of Parliament for the first time ever earlier this year. I agree completely with the Taoiseach's words in that address that</p>
	<p pid="a.243.3/4" class="indent">&quot;the relationship between Britain and Ireland has changed fundamentally for the better&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.3/5">We now have an effective relationship with Ireland, both bilaterally through the institutions of the Belfast agreement, including the British-Irish Council, and internationally, notably through the EU and the UN, as my hon. Friend said.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.3/6">The UK and Ireland recognise that in an ever more connected world, being active internationally is the best option for shared prosperity and progress on the global stage. If Ireland decided to join the Commonwealth, it would find a forum to discuss and pursue issues of international development, trade and climate change without the traditional north-south fault lines that have characterised so many conversations in the past. Ireland would have an enormous amount to contribute to those conversations.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.3/7">As my hon. Friend mentioned, the Commonwealth is a modern organisation that provides the UK and all its members, on an equal basis, with the opportunity to find common solutions to common problems. Contrary to some assertions, it is far from seeing itself as a rival to the EU. That is an important point. In fact, both organisations are engaged in common work in Africa, for example, and hope to extend that joint work further. The UK, like Cyprus and Malta, finds membership of both organisations valuable.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.3/8">We welcome our international co-operation with Ireland and look forward to even greater engagement in the coming years on global issues of concern to all our peoples. While I cannot offer my hon. Friend the specific good news that he wishes for, everyone in the House knows how dogged and determined he can be. Ministers sometimes welcome it and occasionally they welcome it a little less, but dogged and determined he is, and often successful. The only suggestion that I make to him is that, having raised the issue here in the House, he raise it with the many good friends that he undoubtedly has in Ireland. It is in Ireland that any application to join the Commonwealth must originate.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.3/9" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.3/10" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at two minutes to Two o'clock.</p>
