<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.71.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="71"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0001.htm#10031063000471">
	<p pid="b.71.3/1">I am very pleased to secure this debate today on the British Indian Ocean Territory. It is timely and very important, and I look forward with great interest to hearing the Minister's reply, because therein hangs the possibility of bringing about some real justice for people who, in my view, have been denied justice for a very long time.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.3/2">The British Indian Ocean Territory consists of Diego Garcia and an archipelago of islands some distance away from Diego Garcia. The population of those islands have suffered a sorry tale of ill treatment, deception and injustice, caused by British and US policies and a high degree of secrecy and obfuscation by various Governments over a very long time. Everyone now recognises that the way that the islanders were treated was fundamentally wrong and many, many apologies have been offered to them. The islands were part of the British Indian ocean colonies throughout the 19th century. Essentially, they were places where copra was grown and some fishing was done. Their population had a virtually sustainable lifestyle.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.3/3">In the 1960s, the United States was casting around for a base in the Indian ocean, to have a site that its cargo planes, ships and submarines could use as a naval facility in the Indian ocean as part of its Vietnam war effort. The then US President, Lyndon Johnson, and the then British Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, came to an agreement that Diego Garcia could be used as a US base and a lease arrangement was agreed. That was done in a considerable degree of secrecy and additional requirements were made that the outer islands, as well as the island of Diego Garcia itself, should be depopulated.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.3/4">The population was systematically moved away and effectively dumped on the Seychelles and Mauritius. The islanders' case was taken up in the British Parliament by Robin Cook, who in 1970 was a newly elected Labour MP, and Tam Dalyell, who was also a Member of Parliament at that time and who only retired at the 2005 election. Both of them showed enormous support for the principle of justice for the islanders and for the suffering that they had been through.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.3/5">Many newspaper articles and some books have been written on the subject. I recommend a recent book by David Vine, &quot;Island of Shame&quot;. It is a very good read for anyone who wants to go through the history of what happened and the situation facing the islanders. A film by John Pilger, &quot;Stealing a Nation&quot;, was shown on television and it is continually shown at other places. It is an important film, because it describes the brutality of the removal of the islanders.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.3/6">The islanders were paid some compensation and I will come back to that issue in a moment. However, I do not believe that the compensation was anywhere near satisfactory. So we then have to look at the legal situation facing the islanders and their unquenchable desire for the right of return to their homelands, which is a right that is set out in international law and which is certainly a moral cause and a justification.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.3/7">The background is that when the new colony was formed in 1965, to make way for the US base, there was a separation of the administration from Mauritius and Mauritius became independent in 1968. The detachment of the islands from Mauritius was in breach of the UN General Assembly resolution 1514 of 1960. The compensation paid to the islanders was minimal and in any event much of it was taken away by dishonest land dealers and others from the population who continue to live in Mauritius and indeed in the Seychelles. I myself have been to Mauritius and I have met the islanders in their homes there. I must say that they live in considerable poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.3/8">One should pay tribute to the spirit of the islanders, both those who are living in Mauritius and in the Seychelles, and to the Chagos Refugee Association and its iconic leader, Olivier Bancoult. Indeed, one must also pay tribute to the members of the Chagos community who have more recently come to live in this country, predominantly in Crawley, which is represented by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" name="Laura Moffatt">the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt)</phrase>, who is present in Westminster Hall today for this debate. I understand that she wishes to contribute to the debate later on. Those Chagossians have also made their presence felt and raised a number of issues. However, as far as I am concerned, this is a debate about the legal process and the right of return.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.3/9">In 1999, Olivier Bancoult, on behalf of the Chagos Refugee Association, sought a judicial review of the April 1971 Immigration Ordinance, which meant that anyone visiting the British Indian Ocean Territory required a permit. The High Court judgment of November 2000 found that ordinance to be unlawful. The then Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, accepted that judgment and amended the British Indian Ocean Territory constitution to allow the Chagossians to visit BIOT, except Diego Garcia, and the Foreign Office said that it would press for resettlement feasibility studies.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.3/10">Rather strangely, just under four years later on election day 2004, the then Foreign Secretary, who is the current Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1423" name="Jack Straw">the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw)</phrase>, announced that the Queen had agreed on two Orders in Council, one on the constitution and the other on immigration, which effectively negated the High Court decision of 2000. The matter was never put before Parliament, because an Order in Council does not have to be put before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.3/11">Olivier Bancoult then applied for a judicial review in the summer of 2006. Lord Justice Hooper and Mr Justice Cresswell quashed the Orders in Council. Leave to appeal was granted to the then Foreign Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn. In May 2007, the Master of the Rolls and Lord Justices Waller and Sedley upheld the High Court judgment on the grounds that the Orders in Council were an abuse of power, repugnant, irrational and unlawful.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.3/12">Leave to appeal was refused, but the then Foreign Secretary petitioned the House of Lords and eventually the House of Lords agreed to hear an appeal. In October 2008, three of the five Law Lords held that the Orders were valid because the right of abode may lawfully be displaced for the time being in the interests of defence, but there was no reason why the ban should not be lifted if circumstances changed. In fact, there is no defence or security reason why Chagossians should not resettle on the outer islands, which are, after all, 130 miles away from Diego Garcia. That verdict was a majority verdict by the Law Lords.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.3/13">An application was lodged, which is now before the European Court of Human Rights, alleging breaches of articles 3, 6, 8, 13 and article 1 of protocol 1 of the European convention on human rights. That application was held pending and resumed in 2009. Last June, the Court suggested that an out-of-court settlement should be made, but that suggestion was rejected by the Foreign Office. The Foreign Office submitted its observations in July 2009, and subsequently in October 2009 and January 2010. The applicants submitted their observations on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-23">23 October 2009</phrase> and in February 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.3/14">If the Court decides that the case is admissible, it will hear the case probably in early summer. There is no impediment to the Foreign Office settling the case out of court. I hope that, when the Minister replies to the debate, he can explain to all of us-the public as well as the House-why we are spending millions of pounds of taxpayers' money on endless legal cases, challenging every application made by the islanders and now challenging the case in the European Court of Human Rights.</p>

	<p pid="b.73.0/1">I very much agree with what the hon. Gentleman has said in his doughty defence of these people. Does he agree with me that, in the context of, for example, the Constitutional Governance Bill, which says that it seeks to deal with questions of prerogative and treaties to ensure that Parliament has a much greater say in these matters, it is simply outrageous to have a situation in which the prerogative is used to achieve this tangle and undergrowth of injustice and in which, as the hon. Gentleman said, millions and millions of pounds are being spent for reasons that do not seem to be clear to anybody, except to make the position worse for the inhabitants of the countries concerned?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.73.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="73"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0001.htm#10031063000473">
	<p pid="b.73.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is correct that a full democracy-I look forward to this country's becoming one-would allow Parliament the right to challenge decisions made by Ministers. In this case, the Foreign Secretary asked the Queen to authorise the Orders in Council, bypassing Parliament. That cannot be right under any circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/2">Having sat through many of the High Court cases, I found it poignant to see the Foreign Secretary's barrister defending with great authority and gusto what I believe to be an unjustifiable, immoral position while a court full of Chagos islanders-now living in Mauritius or the Seychelles, or having made their homes in this country, mainly in Crawley-looked on as that expensive procedure went ahead. Why can we not recognise that a fundamentally immoral injustice has been done?</p>

	<p pid="b.74.0/1">I agree with every word that has been said. I put it to the hon. Gentleman that it is not only immoral; it is also impractical. It will not work in the end, so the sooner we find a resolution, the better. Have the Americans given any indication whether they still support our Government's resistance, or have the British Government decided by themselves to dig in their feet and not move?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.74.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="74"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0001.htm#10031063000475">
	<p pid="b.74.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention and his support for the all-party group on the Chagos islands, which I chair and of which he is an active member. It looks increasingly as though the British Government on their own are pursuing the rather bizarre line that it is impossible to resettle the archipelago-as I said, it is 130 miles away from Diego Garcia-due to security issues. The case is being taken up in the United States. Members of the Senate and House are being lobbied heavily on the subject, as is the Administration. I get the increasing impression that the British Government are on their own in the matter.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.74.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="74"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0001.htm#10031063000476">
	<p pid="b.74.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is making a strong case. He is arguing on moral grounds at the moment. From a British perspective, I think that we all believe that Britain should uphold the highest moral standards. Does he agree that although we are debating the rights of the Chagossians, the British Government are lowering our own moral standards by associating themselves with actions on Diego Garcia? It was eventually wrung out of the Americans that they had been using the island for the rendition of prisoners. Surely, if we in this country are to uphold the highest possible moral standards, we must above all protect and fight for the islanders' right to return as well as opposing the use of the islands in that manner.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.74.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1664" speakername="George Howarth" colnum="74"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0001.htm#10031063000477">
	<p pid="b.74.3/1">Order. I appeal to those who want to take part in this debate that, tempting though it is to make a short speech during an intervention, the convention is that interventions should be brief and to the point.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.74.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="74"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0001.htm#10031063000478">
	<p pid="b.74.4/1">Even if they are good short speeches, Mr. Howarth, I understand your point.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.4/2">The hon. Gentleman is also an extremely active member of the all-party group. I have two points to make in response to his intervention. The first involves the moral case and the damage that such activities do to this country's moral standing. I was at the United Nations Human Rights Council a few years ago when the Chagos islanders came in considerable numbers as a delegation of indigenous people denied the right to return to their homeland. I found it embarrassing to be there as a Member of the British Parliament while a delegation stated that they had been denied the right to live on their own islands by a series of decisions made in Britain as part of a colonial legacy or hangover. The Chagossians were there to petition the United Nations. Of course they had every right to petition the United Nations-I was there to support them-but I wondered what it was doing to this country's moral standing in the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.4/3">My second point concerns Diego Garcia. It is not part of the case that the islanders should be able to resettle in large numbers, or indeed any numbers, on Diego Garcia, because of the arrangements to lease most of the island for the US base. However, we should remember that Diego Garcia is at this moment, in law, a British Indian Ocean Territory. It is a British possession, if that is the right word. The Americans were eventually forced to admit that they had been using the island for extraordinary rendition flights. When that came out, the Foreign Secretary, who had clearly not been informed of it by the United States, was forced to apologise to the House. I would imagine that he was extremely embarrassed, and probably very angry, at having to do so, as he had been told constantly that the islands were not being used for extraordinary rendition. A degree of openness is necessary on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.4/4">Moving to the case at present, a legal debate is going on. I have argued that the legal case is strong for the islanders' right to return. I fervently hope that they win their case at the European Court of Human Rights. When the hearing takes place, some time this year, I intend to be there to support the islanders and watch the process in the Court. If the islanders win at the ECHR, as they probably will, the British Government-it will be after the election-will either have to accept that decision or introduce yet more legislation in the House to try to negate it. That can be avoided if the Foreign Office climbs down, accepts that there is an overwhelming case for the right of return and discusses with the islanders and the Chagossian community in the UK how it could be carried out, the cost, who would pay for it and the environmental impact on the islands.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.75.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1693" speakername="Gregory Campbell" colnum="75"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0001.htm#10031063000479">
	<p pid="b.75.0/1">I commend the hon. Gentleman on the timeliness of this debate and his long-running campaign on the issue. Does he think that the problem for this and any subsequent Government is that they have got themselves on the hook of not wanting to resolve the issue? The European Court of Human Rights might find that the Government must move. Does he agree that having been boxed into a corner, the Government appear reluctant to get themselves off the hook rather than implicate themselves even further as the years go on?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.75.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="75"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0001.htm#10031063000480">
	<p pid="b.75.1/1">The box is of the Government's own making from 2004 onwards. The previous Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, who had a good record on the issue, declined to appeal against the decision in 2000, so it stood. In 2004, the Orders in Council were introduced. It seems necessary for all of us to help the Foreign Office get out of the box in which it put itself in 2004. Going through endless appeals and incurring incredible legal costs is not the way to do so. The way is through discussion, conciliation and arrangements for a proper return to the islands.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/2">Proposals have been made, which I support, for the establishment of a marine protection zone around the Chagos islands. They are a unique and pristine environment. uninhabited except for itinerant yachtspeople who apparently call there from time to time. Some fishing also takes place, and an income is received from issuing fishing licences. The idea of a marine protection zone arises from the legislation passed by the House recently. In all other cases where marine protection zones are being established, they combine an absolute ban on the taking of organisms or fish and limited quotas and sustainable fishing arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/3">Consultations on marine protection zones around UK islands rightly have to involve the local communities and fishing communities. It is obvious that to achieve such a zone, there must be consultation. The proposals for the marine protection zone around the Chagos islands include that there be no take and that, apparently, no consultation with anybody other than a fraternity of biologists and scientists. I have great respect for biologists and scientists and for what they are trying to achieve, but experience shows that conserving natural resources and ecosystems is best done by involving the local population. The experience of nature reserves in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean islands is that if a Government ordain that a certain area is a total environmental protection zone, which no one may enter, poachers come in and illegal activities happen. That leads to an army or security force creating a war zone to protect the zone. Achieving the co-operation of local people works very well, as in Madagascar.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/4">I was happy to accept an invitation to Royal Holloway college in January to discuss these very matters.</p>

	<p pid="b.76.0/1">The approach my hon. Friend describes presumes that people want to destroy their own environment. They are fighting to get back so that they can protect their environment. Is this not colonialism gone mad?</p>

	<p pid="b.76.1/1">I suppose it could be called eco-colonialism. The best people in the world to protect the environment of the Chagos islands are the Chagos islanders; they are the people who love and understand the place, and the ones who would look after it.</p>

	<p pid="b.76.3/1">As my hon. Friend says, I am far too generous to impute such motives to others in these matters. I will leave hon. Members to form their views on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.3/2">I support the zone and, as far as I am aware, the islander communities in this country and in Mauritius support it, too. It is in nobody's interest to destroy the environment or ecosystem. There should be sustainable living by the islanders who wish to return. I do not know how many there will be, but the number will be much smaller than tens of thousands. It is the right of return that is so important and that, in particular, is what this debate is about.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.3/3">I hope that in his reply, the Minister will acknowledge the anger and outrage of islanders. The feasibility studies have been designed to create the aura that incredible expense and infrastructure would be required, in order to detract from the possibility of the islanders ever returning to the islands. I ask the Minister to look again at the issue, in particular at how the islanders have been treated and at the possibility of reaching a quick out-of-court settlement so that we can move on. We should have the marine protection zone, which would be a legacy of the British Government and Prime Minister, but that should be part of a wider settlement package that gives the islanders the right of return.</p>

	<p pid="b.77.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that the Foreign Office has identified the exiled Chagossian community as one of the stakeholders in the consultation for the proposed marine protection zone? Is it not odd that the Foreign Office recognises them as stakeholders in the environment, but will not let them go back to it?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.77.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="77"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0002.htm#10031063000486">
	<p pid="b.77.1/1">Absolutely. The islanders do not have the right of return, but they have recognition as stakeholders who will contribute to the consultation exercise. It is a non sequitur to say that we will consult them, but do not trust them to live there. In other words, we trust their opinions, but do not trust them to look after the place should they have the right of return.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.1/2">I mentioned that I attended a seminar at Royal Holloway college in January. There were 100 scientists and conservationists from around the world who had prepared various petitions and statements. Some supported the marine conservation zone and others supported it, but also wanted the rights of the islanders to be taken on board. There has been a marked reluctance by some who support the zone to acknowledge any human involvement or considerations in the matter, which I find extraordinary.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.1/3">The islanders have made their case. The legal position is that Britain separated the Chagos islands from Mauritius. As I said, I believe that that was contrary to the UN General Assembly resolution of the time. There is an issue about our relations with Mauritius to be resolved. I hope that the Minister will say something about the ongoing discussions with the Mauritius Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.1/4">The Foreign Secretary has an interest in considering this matter. I commend him for meeting the Chagossian community in this country and hope he will give the same service to the Chagossian community that lives in Mauritius on his next visit. The community in this country has lived in some poverty, as I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley will explain. They have been denied access to benefits because of the habitual residence test, which is bizarre considering that they are British citizens following an amendment that Tam Dalyell and I tabled at Committee stage of the British Overseas Territories Act 2002. I hope it will be recognised that, as British citizens and passport holders, they are entitled to the same rights as anybody else in our society.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.1/5">I have mentioned several people in this debate and will conclude by recognising two people who should be acknowledged and thanked. The first is Richard Gifford, a lawyer who has shown steadfast support for the islanders' right of return over decades. He has been to Mauritius and the Seychelles on many occasions. He has led the case through all the courts and all the chicanery. Such people, who go far beyond their professional demands, should be recognised, thanked and supported. The second person is David Snoxell, the former British high commissioner to Mauritius, who, in retirement, has given a lot of energy and support to the Chagossian community and to the case for their right of return.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.1/6">Finally, I mention again Olivier Bancoult, the chairman of the Chagos refugees group, whom I know well and have known for many years. It is remarkable that this small community, which was taken from its islands all those years ago and literally dumped in Mauritius and the Seychelles, did not spread asunder over the world, go to the four winds and disappear as an entity, but has stayed together and campaigned and petitioned together. There was a great sense that justice had been achieved in 2000, when the High Court in Britain gave the islanders the right of return. It is up to us to follow that through.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.1/7">Olivier sent me an e-mail that said:</p>
	<p pid="b.77.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Regarding the Marine Protected Area we will support it as long as it takes into consideration the fundamental right of the Chagossians. May I ask you to put a request to Foreign Secretary David Miliband who visited a Chagossian group in Crawley, that he considers meeting all the Chagossian groups as well?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.77.1/9">I know the Foreign Secretary met Allen Vincatassin, who is one of the prominent people in the Chagos community in Crawley, but he should also meet Olivier and his group when he next visits Mauritius. We have a chance to do something good: withdraw the case from the European Court of Human Rights, reach a settlement, allow the islanders to return, and protect the environment and the pristine marine life there by letting the islanders themselves look after it. We can right a wrong; we can correct an injustice. Apologies and catharsis are a good thing, but one has to go the whole way and finish the case by allowing the islanders to return. I hope the Minister can give us some good news when he replies to the debate.</p>

	<p pid="b.78.0/1">I am delighted to take part in the debate and I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> on securing it. This important subject requires proper consideration. In Parliament, when we talk about overseas issues that have a direct impact on our streets in the UK, this matter must be at the top of the agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.0/2">Most of us who have grown up understanding the injustice that has taken place and how islanders were treated like cattle and removed to Mauritius and the Seychelles have a great sense of the wrong that has been done. Those people were subsequently given access to a British passport and turned up in the centre of a town virtually destitute, with just a great sense of hope to see them through. The system let them down in many ways and they needed to be supported, helped and guided through very difficult early days, so it is inspirational to look at that community now.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.0/3">That sense of inspiration comes from watching a community establish itself in the UK and making sure that it is part of what we are-our fabric-through, for example, participation in the voluntary sector. It is very special to realise that the children of that community are doing extremely well at school and that its first students have gone to university. We need to congratulate that community on establishing itself in such a way. However, those people are not the only Chagos islanders whom we need to consider. Many others have, for whatever reason, not been able to make that move, and their views must be considered.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.0/4">This matter has given rise to hugely diverse views, which are deeply and passionately held. We sometimes become over-excited if we hear someone saying something that does not accord with our particular view, but it is right and proper that I should articulate the views of the islanders who have settled in Crawley. I have very close contact with those people, and I spend a great deal of time listening to the issues that have become a running sore for them. The work to secure visits to the island has been tremendous for the community-not only for the two groups of six that were able to visit the islands and come back with their reports of that pristine environment, which I understand everyone wants to protect, but for those who could not travel, as they attended presentations to see the beautiful pictures.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.0/5">That, however, is not good enough. No one can survive on a dream that existed decades ago. For the community, creating contact between the islands and those who have been removed-who may still be in Mauritius and the Seychelles or in the United Kingdom-is vital. I firmly believe that people must have a choice about the right of return. That is the cornerstone of all the work that has taken place, but it does not mean that everyone will wish to return, and we need to make that very clear.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.0/6">When the court cases were under way, many people who had settled from the islands came to see me to say, &quot;It doesn't mean that I'll have to go back, does it?&quot; They felt there was a sense of compulsion about the matter. It is important that the sense of the right of return remains, and that it is achieved. How that is managed is the big issue we are debating today, which can often become a little overheated.</p>

	<p pid="b.79.0/1">The hon. Lady introduced part of her speech by saying that there are diverse views. Does she not accept that, in fact, she is describing two views? One view is that those Chagossians who choose to do so should have the right of return and resettlement; another view is that they should be denied that right. There are just two views, not a diversity of views.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.79.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" speakername="Laura Moffatt" colnum="79"  time="010:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0002.htm#10031063000489">
	<p pid="b.79.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, but I absolutely disagree, mainly because I have heard many more than two views. It is impossible to state that the right of return is just a basic right of return. There are many permutations of the right of return and the way in which that is managed is crucial. Some people say that the right of return should be run through some sort of trust and that those who hail from particular islands should have complete control of that. The big issue-where there is great difficulty-is that some people do not believe that Mauritius should have sovereignty over the islands. If that is part of the package, it will never satisfy that group. That is why we need to have a debate between the communities as well.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.79.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="79"  time="010:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0002.htm#10031063000490">
	<p pid="b.79.2/1">I have two points to make. First, it was very traumatic to watch the film made by the 100 people who went on a visit to the islands. Secondly, does my hon. Friend acknowledge that it is possible to separate the issue of the future sovereignty of the islands from that of the right of return, which is what we are currently pursuing through the courts? It is important that we consider both matters in order, rather than necessarily as part of one package.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.80.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" speakername="Laura Moffatt" colnum="80"  time="010:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0002.htm#10031063000491">
	<p pid="b.80.0/1">I respect and understand my hon. Friend's view, but the trouble is that some of the issues are often linked to another given. For some of the islanders, the given seems to be that sovereignty will be transferred to Mauritius to allow the right of return, and that is where they have a huge difficulty. We need to try to separate out these matters. I utterly agree that if we start from the basic right of return and look at the overlying issues, many of those will relate to the differences between those who come from different islands. I am constantly amazed by the differing views, which depend on the island from which someone hails. The Diego Garcian community has a different view, for example, from islanders from Peros Banhos. I have no doubt that that will continue because it is human nature, but politicians need to be mindful lest they just bundle up the islanders and assume that they have a single opinion. It is untrue that there is one single viewpoint, and we need to take proper account of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/2">We are faced with a community that, after a sticky start, is doing extremely well in the United Kingdom. One of the sickest sights I have ever seen was that of honourable and decent people sitting outside the offices of social services because they were being denied basic benefits, and seeing other people, in effect, campaigning against British passport holders. That made me determined to support the Chagossian community in any way I could. I sincerely believed any investment made through social services in that community at that early stage would be repaid, and it is being repaid in spades.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/3">The islanders have become part of our cultural history and part of the community, participating in different events and sharing with us a rich culture of music and dance. It is a bright and intelligent community that has contributed to Crawley, so much so that it is easy to be sucked into the sense of optimism that grew out of a very difficult start. Indeed, Alex Morrison, one of the reporters from our local newspaper, the <i>Crawley News</i>, now volunteers with the group to help them publicise their events. Many people have taken the community into their hearts.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/4">A film crew is now producing a film about Crawley as a town of immigration, called &quot;The Road to Crawley&quot;, as it is a place where different groups of people have come to live over the years, since the 1960s, and we are now a diverse town. All those groups that have contributed to our town are being filmed, and the last group to be filmed is the most recent one to have entered Crawley in significant numbers, and is made up of people from the islands. They have become part of the fabric of the town, and we accept that there is a new group contributing to our lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/5">People in Crawley understand that that community is self-sufficient and ambitious, both for themselves and their children. They still encounter huge difficulties with language and with having to learn a completely new way of life, but they are determined to overcome them. In addition, they are still concerned about what will happen to their islands, which they care about, and the families who have been left in Mauritius.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/6">There is a big concern about visas, and I would be interested to hear the Minister comment on that. It is okay to grant someone from the islands a British passport, but if they have been living in Mauritius the likelihood that they will marry someone from Mauritius is high, and they would then have all the difficulties relating to access and the ability to live as a family. That issue is still causing concern and upset among those who have left the islands. I believe that that needs to be sorted out as a debt of honour-I know that that word has been used before in the debate, but I firmly believe that it is the right terminology for the response to that group of people.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/7">My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North is right that the Diego Garcian Society met the Foreign Secretary last week, but it was not the only group to meet him to discuss the matter. The Chagos islands groups also met him, which was important, because we need to widen participation and hear all the views. One would think that there were only two views if one listened to only two groups, but there is actually a multiplicity of responses to the cruel effect of removing people from their homeland and forcing them to create a new lifestyle for themselves, which the islanders have done first in Mauritius and now in the UK. I keep saying it because I mean it: that is a group of people I greatly admire for the way in which they have managed their lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/8">With regard to the marine protection zone, no one could argue that it does not stem from the highest ideal. I have seen photographs of those fantastic islands and their pristine beaches, although ground is being lost to the Indian ocean, so global warming has clearly had a huge effect on the islands. They have some fantastic and rare wildlife, such as tree frogs, which I had never seen before, and beautiful turtles in crystal-clear waters. Part of the reason for that is that no one is allowed to go there. One of the pictures shows a sign stating that absolutely no fishing and no trespassing on the beach are allowed. Those environments have been preserved as a result of removing a community.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/9">How then do we allow a degree of involvement by the community in the future of the islands without spoiling that? I can see that there is a purist view, which I think the Chagos Environment Network holds, and I understand completely where it is coming from. When I received a letter on the matter, I was concerned that there was not even one name on the list of those campaigning for the marine protection zone, and I wrote back to say so. I have been reassured that more consultations are under way with islanders, but I was disappointed that that did not involve those communities from the start. In a sense, the environment must be preserved in aspic, without anyone being able to take part in activities, such as fishing, that might benefit the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/10">Once again, we need to be clear about the community and who we are going to consult. It is like motherhood and apple pie to say that one must involve the local community, but who will those people be? Will it be the Government of Mauritius or just the islanders from the area where the marine park will be established, or will we have a wider consultation? That is why it was important that the Diego Garcian Society organised its own ballot so that it could contribute to the debate. I was delighted to be able to assist by getting a ballot box and ensuring that the ballot was conducted correctly so that people could have their say on the consultation in November.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/11">There are many unanswered questions, and not one of them can be settled in just one debate, although I believe that today we have a good opportunity to have a gentle look at the matter so as not to get to the point at which people are driven to take positions that might be difficult to get out of. I am a huge supporter of the Government, but at times I cringe and wonder why we are continuing to cause difficulties through the courts. Half of me understands that it is about trying to protect a position, but at times I believe that we need to look more creatively at how we establish the rights of those islanders, particularly before 2014, when we will have to give a definitive response before the Americans decide what they want to do with Diego Garcia in 2016. We have some time to have those negotiations with all those people, to respect the myriad views on the matter and to settle it once and for all.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/12">We must ensure that the British Government hold their head up, because I firmly believe that they have dealt with the matter decently and honestly. However, I think that the legal issue is really making mischief among those who are trying to find a solution. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has treated the community in Crawley with nothing but dignity and has offered help, advice and support. It would be difficult to argue anything else. Whenever we have requested meetings and visits, they have been granted. The time that those people arrived on the islands on a small fishing boat was a moment they will never forget, and I was pleased that women went along on the second visit, because the first one was an all-male event. Those visits have enlivened the interest of the community in Crawley and ensured that they have a sense of history and of where they come from.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/13">I can only speak for the community that I know and greatly appreciate in Crawley, so I will conclude my remarks by stating that it would wish those islands to remain under the protection of the United Kingdom. For that community, any other discussion is extremely difficult, so now we see just how difficult the subject is.</p>

	<p pid="b.82.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> on securing this debate. As other Members of the House know, he has been a passionate campaigner on this issue for many years, and today he set out the case using his great knowledge of the subject in a powerful speech. I struggled to find anything in it with which I disagreed.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/2">I reiterate my support and that of many in my party for the Chagos islanders' campaign to be allowed to return to the outer Chagos islands. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-23">23 April 2009</phrase>, we had a debate in this Chamber on the overseas territories, when I and other hon. Members noted that the Foreign Affairs Committee's seventh report of Session 2007-08 concluded that there is &quot;a strong moral case&quot; for allowing the Chagossians to return. I stand by my statement then that the Government have acted shamefully in preventing them from returning.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/3">I also had an opportunity to raise the issue last month in a European Committee debate that covered a wide range of issues, and at that time the Minister for Europe was firm in his disagreement. I am hopeful that we may get a slightly more positive response from this Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/4">In October 2008, the House of Lords ruled that the Government had acted legally when they issued two Orders in Council forbidding the Chagos islanders from returning to the outer Chagos islands. The ruling was based on a series of statutes in British law which state:</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/5" class="indent">&quot;In a conquered or ceded colony the Crown, by virtue of its prerogative, has full power...to act both executively and legislatively&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/6">regardless of whether its actions are</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/7" class="indent">&quot;for the benefit of the inhabitants of that colony.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/8">In the 21st century, arguing that the British Government can do whatever they like in their overseas territories without regard for the interests of the inhabitants is morally reprehensible, and the law should surely be changed. I deeply regret that the Government have not taken the advice of the European Court of Human Rights and sought a settlement out of court with the Chagos islanders that would allow them to return to the outer Chagos islands, which, as we have heard, are 130 miles away from the others. This legal battle has gone on far too long, and it is a stain on Britain's reputation.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/9">As has been mentioned, there is also a significant financial cost to the legal battle. In 2008, the Public Accounts Committee estimated that the Government had spent &#163;2.1 million on the court battle with the Chagos islanders. Since then, there have been appeals to the House of Lords and to the European Court of Human Rights, which must have brought the cost to the taxpayer much higher still. I urge the Minister to stop wasting money on this legal case, particularly in the current economic situation, and to settle out of court with the Chagos islanders.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/10">I am also greatly concerned that, at every stage of the legal battle, the Government have failed to consult Parliament on their decisions. In 2004, they used the Privy Council to issue two Orders in Council banning anyone from settling in the Chagos archipelago. The announcement was made on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-10">10 June 2004</phrase>, which was called &quot;Super Thursday&quot; with reference to the fact that it was the day of the European Union, local and mayoral elections, and therefore was ideally timed to escape the attention of politicians, the public and the press. Last May, the Justice Secretary admitted on BBC Radio 4 that he had &quot;exchanged speed for legitimacy&quot; when he chose to use Orders in Council, because that was &quot;simpler&quot; than putting the decision before Parliament. That is just not good enough. It may be simpler for the Government, but that does not mean that there should not be proper accountability in this place.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/11">After the European Court of Human Rights asked the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to reply by <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-17">17 July 2009</phrase> stating how it would respond to the Chagossians appeal, I was happy to sign early-day motion 1949, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Islington, North and signed by 51 other MPs. It called on the Government to consult Parliament before the FCO responded, but the FCO went ahead and responded without Parliament's being consulted. I hope that the Minister will explain why the Government do not see fit to give parliamentarians a say in such an important matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/12"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" name="Laura Moffatt">The hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt)</phrase> made an excellent contribution, in particular about her experiences with the Chagossian community in Crawley. She told the human story behind the issues of legality and principle that can so often be discussed in abstract terms. Of course this is not a simple issue-there are myriad different views within the Chagossian community, as within any community, as hon. Members know-but it is a real problem that the Government have failed to consult Chagossians themselves in the many instances when one would expect them to be among the first groups to be consulted.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/13">The Orders in Council that were used to ban Chagossians from their home in 2004 were based on a 2001 feasibility study for resettlement, yet the Chagossians were not consulted as part of that study. Nor did the Government consult the Chagossians when they came up with their document on a marine protection area that was published for consultation in November 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/14">Like other hon. Members, I very much support the creation of an MPA in the Chagos archipelago. However, I am concerned that the Government have sought to develop a plan for it before a ruling has been received from Strasbourg on resettlement. I recently signed the Marine Education Trust's petition calling for the Government's plans for an MPA in the Chagos archipelago to make provision for the future possible return of the Chagos islanders to their home. A number of Liberal Democrat MPs have signed the petition as well as early-day motion 960, which was tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" name="Diane Abbott">the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase>. It carries exactly the same message, and I encourage any Members who have not signed it to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/15">Fishing would be vital to the survival of the Chagossians if they resettled on the outer islands, and the proposal to make provision for it in the MPA has received support from many environmentalists who have signed the Marine Education Trust's petition. The case was put forcefully by the hon. Gentleman that, in conservation terms, it is best to involve local communities to ensure that there is a lasting settlement that will protect the environment, and that everyone has bought into it.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/16">Legal advice suggests that declaring an MPA without the support of the Chagos islanders and Mauritius would be illegal under the United Nations convention on the law of the sea. In a parliamentary answer to Lord Wallace of Saltaire, Baroness Kinnock wrote that the MPA must not</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/17" class="indent">&quot;impact on the operational capability of the base on Diego Garcia&quot;.-[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2010-02-22.234"><i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i>22 February 2010; Vol. 717, c. WA234</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/18">She went on to state that the island may therefore have to be excluded from the MPA. I would be keen to hear from the Minister how the Government will work with the United States Department of Defence to reduce the impact of the military base on the environment, if that is the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/19">I would like to turn to other impacts of the military base, particularly the troubling topic of rendition. I am sure that all hon. Members will agree that the use of Diego Garcia for extraordinary rendition of terror suspects is deeply disturbing, and that every effort must be made to prevent it from happening again. I understand that the US Government have not always been entirely honest with the UK about the use of Diego Garcia for that purpose, but surely we have a moral and legal responsibility to ensure that our territory is not used for such acts.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/20">To that end, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" name="Andrew Tyrie">the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)</phrase> has proposed legislation to tighten the criminal law on extraordinary rendition, and I understand that the proposals are being considered by the Ministry of Justice. The Justice Secretary has stated that</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/21" class="indent">&quot;The Government would not allow any rendition through UK territory that would put the UK in breach of its...human rights obligations&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/22">However, we know that past assurances given by the US Government on the matter have turned out to be false, so I would be keen to hear what the Government are doing to ensure that the US does not use Diego Garcia for that purpose.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/23">In conclusion, I make four points to the Minister. The Government should drop the legal case against the Chagos islanders at the European Court of Human Rights and settle out of court, as other hon. Members have suggested. The Government must consult Parliament on all major decisions concerning the islands, and consult the islanders themselves, the Mauritian Government and other stakeholders where it is clearly appropriate. They should make provision in any MPA for the Chagos islanders to fish in local waters should they resettle in the outer islands. Finally, they must take concrete measures to prevent the use of the British Indian Ocean Territory and, indeed, any others, for extraordinary rendition. I hope that the Minister will be able to respond positively to those points.</p>

	<p pid="b.85.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Howarth. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> on raising this issue. He has been tireless over many years in doing so, as have other colleagues. Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase>, I was also present when we touched on the Chagos islands in the debate on the Foreign Affairs Committee's report and also in the European Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/2">The hon. Gentleman said that this debate is about the Chagossians' legal right to return to the islands. He also said-I hope that I took this down correctly-that the British Government are, on their own, pursuing a case on a security issue all the way through the law courts. I shall return to that in a few minutes.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/3">It seems to me that there are several interlocking issues here, with justice for the Chagossians being at the centre of them. While listening to the debate, I heard the outrage of many hon. Members here, as well as during previous debates, about the way in which the Chagossians were removed from the islands and are unable to return, but their case is not unique. When I first went to Gibraltar-as a military historian, I am ashamed to say this-I did not realise that in the summer of 1940, around 90 per cent. of Gibraltarians were forcibly removed. Many went to the Azores, and some were brought to London because it was thought to be safe. There was a certain irony in that because they lived in tenement flats and hotels in Pimlico, and then had to endure the blitz. By 1945, they were allowed back, but tens of thousands of people were involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/4">In Norfolk-there are similar cases in Yorkshire and, of course, on Salisbury plain-at the beginning of the war, the army took over the Stamford battle area near Thetford. Many people in villages were forcibly removed and have never been allowed back. That is one of the little footnotes in history, and every 10 years or so a local television programme is made about it. I am not trying to compare or demean the Chagossian case, but there are other examples, although theirs is a specific one.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/5">In reply to an intervention, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" name="Laura Moffatt">the hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt)</phrase> made a good point in a fair speech. My experience when talking to many groups of Chagossians is that there is not one overriding view. There is a view about the right to return, but some Chagossian groups want to return, some want the right to return merely as visitors, some have business interests that they would like to develop-I have heard from some Chagossians that they would like to develop tourism, hotels and so on-and a substantial group wants the island to remain firmly a UK territory, and do not want it to be returned to Mauritius. The British Government have said that if the Americans decide to withdraw from Diego Garcia, responsibility for the island will return to Mauritius. I am making the point to show that, as the hon. Lady fairly said, and I am certain that the hon. Gentleman agrees, the issue is complex, not simple. Responsibility for resolving it must be with the British Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/6">The US-UK military presence is also an issue. The UK presence is tiny on Diego Garcia. The issue has been highlighted by accusations of extraordinary rendition, and I do not want to go into the details, but it has highlighted the fact that the overall relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States is not always open and honest in the exchange of policy and intelligence.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/7">The crucial point about the military presence on Diego Garcia, as the hon. Lady said, is that by 2014, we must consider proposals for any revisions of the agreement-2016 is the cut-off date-and that is only four years away. My best guess in 2010 is that it is highly unlikely that the United States will want to withdraw completely from Diego Garcia, because of the way in which the world has changed. I am not talking just about the conflict in Afghanistan. If one talks to people in the State Department and the Pentagon, they see Diego Garcia as being even more crucial both as a base for moving aircraft in and out-a supply base-and, as they see it, a strategic balance of power in the Indian ocean. My best guess is that in 2014 the United States will not want to withdraw. That will be a big attention-grabber for the British Government, the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence.</p>

	<p pid="b.86.0/1">Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that the archipelago is a long way from Diego Garcia-130 miles-and that it is bizarre to argue that there is a defence and security requirement on islands that are the equivalent of one third of the distance from here to Paris, for example?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.86.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" speakername="Keith Simpson" colnum="86"  time="010:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0003.htm#10031063000495">
	<p pid="b.86.1/1">Yes. The hon. Gentleman got in just ahead of me. The Chagossians have made that point, and there is a genuine question for the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence here, and the State Department and the Department of Defence in the United States to answer. Do they believe, objectively, that if the Chagossians returned and there were some form of economic development, there would be a threat to their security? What sort of threat do they believe there would be? It should be discussed to decide whether it is credible. The Department of Defence may well say that there is no such threat, and that if there were it could be monitored.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/2">We have reached the stage where the sort of secret agreements and discussions that we were able to have 40 years ago under consecutive Governments-this is not a party political issue; it was a Government to Government matter-cannot continue in quite the same way. There will be issues of confidentiality, but whoever are the Government after the general election will have to consider the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/3">The whole business of economic development of the area is crucial, and the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Lady made the point that some crucial issues will arise if some Chagossians want to return, particularly the development of the fishing industry. Mauritius also has an interest, and a matter in the documentation that worries me is the marine protection area. If the United Kingdom decided eventually to hand back the islands to Mauritius, I am not certain whether Mauritius would be legally liable to continue the MPA. That will be crucial from the point of view not only of the Chagossians, but of any investment that the United Kingdom and other partners have made in the development of the area.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/4">There is a series of connected issues, and I conclude by saying that we must put the interests of the Chagossians at the heart of them. I do not believe that the Foreign Office has entirely ignored them, but they have tended to be of second or third-level importance. That cannot continue. I am trying not to be too parti pris, but we know pretty well that there will be a general election on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-06">6 May</phrase>, given the announcement about the Budget, and if the consequence of that election is that my party finds itself in Government, I think we would want to revisit the whole issue with an open mind, because we cannot continue the present policy, given all the points that have been made by hon. Members today.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/5">Finally, one of the first things that the newly constituted Select Committee on Foreign Affairs should do in the new Parliament is to consider the whole issue of the Chagos islands and all the matters that we have discussed today. I again congratulate the hon. Gentleman on the way in which he raised this important issue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.87.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" speakername="Ivan Lewis" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office"  colnum="87"  time="010:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0003.htm#10031063000496">
	<p pid="b.87.0/1">It is a tremendous pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Howarth. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> for securing this debate, and for his passion and long-standing advocacy on an issue that disturbs any reasonable hon. Member, whatever their roles and responsibilities. This is not part of my ministerial portfolio, so I am new to the matter, but I considered some of the issues when preparing for this debate, and the historical treatment of Chagossians by the British Government at the time is a scar on our history. It was totally unacceptable, and we should be ashamed of what was done in the name of this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/2">I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" name="Laura Moffatt">the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt)</phrase> for a typically thoughtful and sensitive contribution to the debate, and more importantly, for the human and personal support that she has given to the Chagossian community in her constituency. I know that people in that community have great respect for the personal interest and commitment that she has demonstrated in ensuring that they are ultimately treated with dignity and respect. As my hon. Friend said, as a result of its efforts, the community is beginning to do well. A manifestation of that is the fact that some young Chagossians have the opportunity to go into higher education, perhaps for the first time. That is always a sign of a community that is progressing and moving forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/3">There can be no doubt about the responsibility and culpability of this country for the decisions that were made in the late '60s and early '70s. Because of that, we owe it to the Chagossian community to ensure that we behave appropriately and in a way that, while remaining consistent with our interests, is also sensitive to our responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/4">The key issue raised during the debate was the right of return, and in that context it is important to look at the different legal processes that have taken place and explain why the Government felt that they wished to pursue the case legally. The first example of that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North mentioned, was when the Foreign Secretary made the decision to appeal the case to the House of Lords following other court decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/5">The reasons for that decision were threefold. First, following an independent feasibility study, we were convinced that lasting resettlement would be precarious and, if sponsored by the Government, entail expensive underwriting by the British taxpayer over an open-ended, probably permanent period. Secondly, restoration of full immigration control over the entire territory was necessary to ensure the availability and full effectiveness of the territory for defence purposes, particularly in the light of a change in security circumstances since 2000 and our treaty obligations to the United States. Thirdly, the Court of Appeal's judgment raised issues of constitutional law that we believed to be of general public importance. For those reasons, the Foreign Secretary felt at the time that it was appropriate to appeal the case to the House of Lords.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/6">A lot of concern has been expressed today about the feasibility of resettlement and about defence, and during the debate, hon. Members have questioned the basis for our position on those issues. The independent study conducted in 2000 came down heavily against the feasibility of resettlement-I do not know whether hon. Members have had an opportunity to see that report. Although it concluded that short-term habitation for limited numbers on a subsistence basis would be possible, it emphasised that any long-term resettlement would, in reality, be precarious and costly. Hon. Members who are well informed will be aware that the outer islands-the largest of which is about the size of Hyde park-have been uninhabited for nearly 40 years and have no basic facilities or infrastructure. Therefore, in terms of objectivity, that feasibility study came out heavily against resettlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/7">On defence, the 1966 exchange of notes with the United States made the whole archipelago available for the defence purposes of both Governments as they may arise. The terms of that note remain in force, and the United States has confirmed that, from its point of view, that situation is still valid.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/8">It is also important to deal with compensation, and hon. Members have recognised that the Governments involved have made compensation available in the past. In the early 1970s, &#163;650,000 was paid to the Government of Mauritius for the benefit of the Chagossians, and, in addition, the Government of Mauritius made land available to the value of a further &#163;1 million. Further to that, under a 1982 agreement between Her Majesty's Government, the Government of Mauritius and representatives of the Chagossians, a further &#163;4 million was paid by Her Majesty's Government into a trust fund for the benefit of the registered Chagossians. In today's terms, total compensation paid by the Government would equate to over &#163;16 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/9">A High Court judgment made by Lord Justice Ouseley on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-09">9 October 2003</phrase>, and upheld by the Court of Appeal in 2004, looked thoroughly into the circumstances in which the 1982 settlement was reached. The judgment accepted that the payments were received as full and final settlement of all claims-that is important-and that the UK had no legal obligation, which I accept is different from a moral obligation, to pay any further compensation. Subsequent court cases have not changed that situation.</p>

	<p pid="b.89.0/1">I thank the Minister for the clarity of his response. Does he agree that there may be other ways to benefit the community and pay compensation, such as allowing limited activity on the island so that Chagos islanders can benefit as a whole, rather than providing money directly from the Government?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.89.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" speakername="Ivan Lewis" colnum="89"  time="010:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0003.htm#10031063000498">
	<p pid="b.89.1/1">That goes to the heart of the question about access to the islands. My hon. Friend referred to the two visits that were facilitated and funded by the Foreign Office. That was entirely appropriate and we should certainly consider doing more of that in the future. There are a variety of ways in which we can demonstrate sensitivity and respect for the islanders and their relationship with their homeland.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/2">Through financial compensation we have recognised our legal responsibilities, but of course there continues to be a moral responsibility, which is not as neat as a statutory or legal responsibility. How we deal with that moral responsibility needs to be an ongoing source of reflection for any responsible and reasonable British Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North asked about the European Court of Human Rights, and why the Government are using that to defend themselves. Let me explain why we are doing so. First, in the view of UK courts, the ECHR is not applicable in the British Indian Ocean Territory. Secondly, as I have said, the compensation that has been paid was in full and final settlement of all claims, and the UK has no legal obligation to pay any further compensation. Thirdly, the BIOT constitution is lawful, and hence there is no right of abode in BIOT. That is why we are defending ourselves through the European Court of Human Rights and have not felt able at this stage to settle out of court.</p>

	<p pid="b.89.2/1">On that point, if the European Court of Human Rights decides in favour of the islanders rather than the Government, is it correct that the only way that the Government could avoid having to carry out the Court's wishes is through primary legislation in the House?</p>

	<p pid="b.90.0/1">As far as I am aware, that is the case. Clearly, if I am told differently after the debate, I will write to my hon. Friend. However, that is my view, based on the information that I received in the run-up to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/2">Let me deal now with the marine protected area. When the Foreign Secretary launched the public consultation on it in November last year, he pointed to what he described as a</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/3" class="indent">&quot;remarkable opportunity for the UK to create one of the world's largest marine protected areas and double the global coverage of the world's oceans benefiting from full protection&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/4">Potentially, this is a very significant project, with wide ramifications.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/5">We extended the consultation period because, as hon. Members said, we needed to consult as widely as possible, and the consultation concluded only last Friday. The all-party group has formally responded, as has my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North. In addition to taking written contributions, we made sure that an independent facilitator was made specifically available to speak directly to Chagossians in Crawley and the Seychelles and by video teleconference to those in Mauritius.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/6">I am not being coy when I say that the consultation genuinely closed last Friday, and we are not in a position at this stage to announce its outcome or how we intend to proceed. However, I would like to place on record that is important that hon. Members are briefed-I suspect that this may be the responsibility of someone else, who will, I hope, come from the Labour party-when the Government decide what to do next about the marine protected area. I am cognisant of the fact that hon. Members feel that there was not sufficient consultation with parliamentarians on the Chagossians in the past before apparently unilateral decisions were made. I therefore put on record a commitment to make sure, wherever possible, that interested hon. Members are briefed before we make final decisions on the marine protected area.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/7">Let me turn briefly to the specific point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> made about extraordinary rendition. Other hon. Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase>, made the same point. We are all aware of what happened in 2008, but the key point is whether any assurances have been given that it will not happen again. It is important to put on record that in February 2008, when the issue came into the public domain and the Foreign Secretary made his statement to the House, the then US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, publicly underlined the firm US understanding that there will be no rendition through the UK, our overseas territories and Crown dependencies or our airspace without our express permission having first been received. Hon. Members may say that that was our understanding in the first place, but it is important that we have on record a reiteration of the fact that the US understands that these things were not acceptable and should never happen again. In terms of our special relationship with the United States, we are not happy with the way it has behaved historically on this issue, but we have to accept in good faith the assurance that the then Secretary of State gave.</p>

	<p pid="b.91.0/1">That was really my question. Is this just a matter of accepting the word of the US Secretary of State in good faith, or is there anything else that the Government can do so that they have confidence that these things are not currently happening? Do we just have to rely on what the US says?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.91.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" speakername="Ivan Lewis" colnum="91"  time="010:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0004.htm#10031063000502">
	<p pid="b.91.1/1">Of course, we have to take all possible steps to make sure that our laws and policies are respected, and that should be the case especially in the context of our special relationship. Historically, we were obviously given assurances that turned out not to be true, and that is totally unacceptable, whether it was the United States that did that or any other country with which we had any kind of diplomatic relations, let alone a special relationship. All that I would say to the hon. Lady is that we have now had an assurance, and we have to respect it. The United States was certainly left in no doubt, as has been said, about the fact that the Foreign Secretary was not only embarrassed, but angry that a country with which we pride ourselves on having a special relationship had, on this occasion, undoubtedly misled the British Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.1/2">To conclude, the difference between legal and moral responsibility is not a simple issue. As hon. Members have said, there is no doubt that we owe the Chagossians justice, fairness and respect for the fact that we treated the population badly all those years ago. Subsequently, we tried to offer redress through compensation and by resettling Chagossians in this country, and my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley has spoken of her experiences in her constituency. Equally, the Government are defending their position for good reason. In the context of our responsibility to do what we believe is in the national interest and our moral responsibility to the Chagossians, we must continually review whether we are getting the balance right. We have no choice at this stage but to defend our position in the courts, but we must remember that we are culpable for what happened historically. That moral responsibility will never go away, and we have to find ways, as my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North said, of constantly recognising that, accepting our responsibility and being held to account.</p>

	<p pid="b.92.3/2">In introducing the debate, I should say that Mr. Carlyle was an established customer of the bank and had enjoyed an excellent working relationship with it over the years. Development funding had been provided for projects that were successfully completed. In 2007, Mr. Carlyle had a solid track record, achieving an average profit margin of 30 per cent. on each project, and one project in East Kilbride was still progressing. That year, an opportunity arose to purchase and develop land in the grounds of the renowned Gleneagles hotel in Perthshire. As was his habit, Mr. Carlyle approached the bank with this new business venture, which would potentially realise substantial profit, benefiting the bank and himself.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.3/3">In March 2007 Mr. Carlyle met someone from the bank's commercial centre to negotiate funding for the project in two parts-the purchase of the land and the building development of a &#163;4 million house. It is pertinent to note that it was a condition of the sale of the land that the plots could not be resold, and were required to be developed by March 2011, failing which the land would return to the sellers. That is what they call a buy-back clause. Because of the buy-back clause Mr. Carlyle had impressed on the bank the fact that he could not accept funding for the purchase of the land if funding for the development would not also be made available.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.3/4">The bank was very enthusiastic about the project, and agreed. On the strength of his past dealings with RBS, and being confident of its support, Mr. Carlyle undertook the purchase of the land, although the funding from the bank for the purchase-&#163;845,000 and &#163;560,000-was not released until August 2007. Initial building works commenced, with continued assurances from the bank that it would support the Gleneagles development project. Mr. Carlyle had initially used some of his own funds to get the project started, and had paid off some debts, as a result of that, from the sale of another property, while also repaying some funds to the bank.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.3/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-12">12 August 2008</phrase>, Mr. Carlyle and his solicitors were abruptly advised that the bank would not provide the development funding, and that it demanded repayment of the &#163;1.45 million used to purchase the Gleneagles land by 10.30 the next day, or, it said, it would &quot;destroy&quot; Mr. Carlyle; and it advised him that he &quot;should be clear about the chaos that would ensue&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.93.3/1">Yes, I certainly will, as I develop my argument.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/2">The reason given for the action was that there had been no agreement to provide the development funding, and that all the funds from the property that Mr. Carlyle had sold should have gone straight back to the bank; the bank was not happy about that. It claimed to have an agreement that the total funds from the sale should have gone back to the bank, but since then it has been unable to produce such an agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/3">The bank's solicitors then embarked on a series of actions that is shocking. In a short space of time Mr. Carlyle's bank accounts were frozen, his company forced into administration, his assets seized, and action to repossess his family home commenced, with arrestment and inhibition orders from the Court of Session in Edinburgh. Not satisfied with that, the bank manipulated a personal account used for school fees so that it become overdrawn, resulting in payment of Mr. Carlyle's children's school fees not being honoured. Furthermore, to make things more difficult for him, the bank prevented solicitors from acting on his behalf, and it was only with the Bank's approval that his current solicitors in Edinburgh were able to be appointed.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/4">The project in East Kilbride was also the subject of seizure and was sold by the bank at a considerable loss, of almost half its value. The unjustified attack resulted in the chaos and destruction that the bank had intended, destroying the man's business and causing horrendous damage to his personal life and reputation. The bank pressed on against Mr. Carlyle through the action it had raised in the Court of Session. Mr. Carlyle counterclaimed, on the basis that the promise from the bank to provide development funding was a contractual one, and that the bank was in breach of that contract, known as collateral warranty.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/5">The Court of Session agreed with Mr. Carlyle. The judgment from Lord Glennie of <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-13">13 January 2010</phrase> found not only that the bank had failed to keep its contractual promise to provide the development funding, but that the conduct of the bank in the Court of Session fell far below the required standards. That is strong criticism from a judge. He also said that the Royal Bank of Scotland lacked &quot;candour&quot; in the proceedings, specifically in its deliberate failure to admit to key evidence in the Court of Session. If someone is described in a judge's language as lacking candour, that might mean to some of us in the House that they were lying through their back teeth.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/6">Since the beginning of August 2008 the bank has bullied and intimidated Mr. Carlyle's usual solicitors, threatening them with destruction of their business practice, which resulted in their withdrawing from acting for him in this matter. That is the thing that I really want to point out to the House, and to the Government. Here were lawyers-and it is the case today-having to approve the person who was representing the person opposing them. The firm of solicitors whose business was threatened with ruin was a small one, with little option but to tell my constituent, &quot;I'm sorry, I can't carry on representing you.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.94.2/2">Does the hon.

	<p pid="b.95.1/1">I thank you for your guidance, Mr. Howarth.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.1/2">One thing has really irked me. Another of Mr. Carlyle's solicitors threatened by the bank found out that a letter concerning an alleged attempt to obtain substantial funds from RBS had been &quot;concocted&quot; by RBS staff. The solicitor threatened to report the incident to the police and the fraud office. Only then was the matter dropped. Sinister stuff.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.1/3">The bank then pressed another large firm of solicitors to stop acting for Mr. Carlyle. I know which firm it was, but it would not be fair to name it at this stage; we may have to name it later, but we do not want to do so now. Mr. Carlyle was advised that no sizeable firm would act for him in a case against RBS. His current solicitors took the case only after saying to RBS, &quot;Is it okay if we take the case?&quot; They had to be approved by RBS before they could act. What sort of situation are we in?</p>
	<p pid="b.95.1/4">The Bank's specialised lending services and recoveries department in Edinburgh delivered a one-sided report to Mr. Dickenson, the chief executive, in order for him to respond to a letter from me. Again, it was lack of candour to brief the chief executive, but I leave that to him.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.1/5">In the spring of 2009, the bank falsely advised the Court of Session, the bank's chief executive and Mr. Carlyle's solicitors that the latter's key witness, an RBS manager at the time, had changed her statement made in support of Mr. Carlyle's claim, and that there was no point in going to court. That, too, was found to be completely false. Indeed, the woman in question-I have a copy of her statement with me-never made such a retraction. That was proved to be the case in evidence given to the Court of Session. That is what made Lord Glennie refer to a &quot;lack of candour&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.1/6">Following the proof being given to the Court of Session in October 2009, and while awaiting judgment, the bank apparently conspired to influence a third party and its representatives to have Mr. Carlyle sequestrated for the small sum of &#163;4,000, a sum unconnected with the bank. That was wrong and unfair; it was an attempt to destroy his ability to claim justice and reparation if he succeeded in his Court of Session counterclaim.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.1/7">Despite admitting in court that the promise was breached, RBS has apparently decided to bring in another highly paid legal team that includes-get ready for this-the Dean of Faculty to represent it at the taxpayers' expense, in order to examine Lord Glennie's judgment.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.1/8">The inexcusable and underhand tactics of bullying and intimidation by RBS personnel of individuals and organisations, no matter whether it is done in an uncontrolled manner or with the full knowledge and authority of the RBS directors, is wholly unacceptable. Once again, RBS personnel seem to believe that they are above the law and not accountable for their actions, and that the institution, with its bottomless pit of taxpayers' funds, will bail them out. They had the power to bully and destroy-and to hide when caught.</p>

	<p pid="b.96.0/1">The hon. Gentleman speaks of bullying smaller people and firms. May I tell the House about a firm in my constituency that had an order book of &#163;3 million? It was owed &#163;400,000, much of it by main contractors who were improperly withholding the money, and it owed others the lesser sum of &#163;300,000. The banks forced that company into administration, and refused to lend to it. The banks and the main contractors cleaned up big time, and the small man was trodden all over. It is about time that the Government took action to stop such improper practices.</p>

	<p pid="b.96.1/1">I am sure that the Minister is taking on board these interventions.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/2">As regards Mr. Carlyle, I would urge RBS-via Mr. Dickinson, its chief executive-to follow up its admission in the Court of Session that it breached its promise and honour it by providing the reparation due to Mr. Carlyle for its wrongful actions once his damages claim has been quantified. The taxpayer should not be funding personal vendettas by bank personnel; nor should RBS be allowed to wriggle out of honouring the clear promise made to Mr. Carlyle.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/3">On a wider note, I am sure that there are many without Mr. Carlyle's determination and strength of character who have been mistreated, bullied and intimidated by RBS. I urge them to lodge a detailed formal complaint to not only the Financial Ombudsman Service but their local MP.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/4">I received a letter from RBS yesterday. I understand that the Minister has a copy. It was one of those &quot;pp&quot; letters that we see far too often; although I know where it came from, I do not know who wrote it. It contains the same stuff-I was going to say &quot;garbage&quot; but I do not want to be too disrespectful-but it has the same garbage that the bank presented in its case at the Court of Session, which Lord Glennie said was &quot;less than candid&quot;. I shall disregard much of the letter's contents, as it contains information that we already know. However, it also includes an invite to a meeting at my constituency office to discuss this and other cases; I look forward to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/5">I ask the Minister to take all this information away. I do not say that he or the Government are responsible. When I came to this debate, I hoped that we were dealing with rogue managers and rogue directors at RBS, but from the interventions that I have taken-they were from Members from Northern Ireland and from many other parts of the country-I suspect that it is even more serious. It is not rogue people: it may be institutionalised. If so, it must be sorted; and we, as major shareholders in RBS, have a duty to sort it.</p>

	<p pid="b.97.1/1">I note what my hon. Friend says. He will be aware of the different routes through which he can progress these matters. He will appreciate that I cannot comment specifically on the particulars of the Carlyle case, because it is still subject to the court ruling. However, I hope to see a resolution of the matter-and, indeed, of other matters that have arisen.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/2">I would like to address some of the broader issues about bank lending in the UK economy, and say something specific about RBS in response to the concerns expressed by hon. Members. I shall not dwell too much on the context, given the short time for my response, but it can be traced back to the reckless lending in which some in the global financial sector indulged in the years preceding the crisis. We have seen the first global financial crisis of the modern era, largely as a result of the emergence of the sub-prime crisis in the United States following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Incredible action in the United Kingdom led to our substantial ownership of the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Lloyds Banking Group. We then took significant action to ensure continued lending, both to households and to businesses-the subject of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/3">The latest Bank of England &quot;Trends in Lending&quot; report shows that net lending declined by &#163;47 billion in 2009. That trend is not just relevant to the United Kingdom, but common to the United States, the eurozone and Japan. As the Bank's analysis has shown, during past recessions and financial crises, bank lending typically remained weak in the early stages of recovery. That may reflect a number of factors, including the reappraisal of risk by lenders, investors and borrowers; uncertainty about the prospects for the economy; people and businesses choosing to pay off debt and restructure their financial positions, rather than taking on more debt, which impacts on the demand for finance by households and businesses; and financial institutions restructuring to deliver higher capital levels and more conservative loan exposures. Having said that, it is absolutely important that creditworthy businesses should not suffer from constraints on the supply of lending, especially as demand recovers in the economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.97.2/1">Does the Minister accept that many banks throughout the United Kingdom are strangling small and medium-sized businesses? If they give a loan to such businesses, they impose such a premium that it is impossible for the businesses to get through this time of recession.</p>

	<p pid="b.98.2/1">I only have a limited amount of time, so let me make some progress with my speech. If I have time, I shall then give way.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.2/2">It is important that businesses have the necessary capital to invest in their factors of production, to invest in product development and to have the means to expand and grow, in particular as we-hopefully-secure the recovery. There should be opportunities for UK firms to compete successfully in the global marketplace, and barriers to finance should not prevent them from doing so.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.2/3">I am dismayed that I continue to hear stories from hon. Members about companies that are not able to access the sort of funding required to help their businesses for the future. There is evidence out there that more lending is beginning to flow to businesses, which is encouraging. Surveys, such as those from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Bank lending panel, all suggest that around three quarters of businesses get finance from the first source that they approach-it is important to put that on the record.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.2/4">Hon. Members will appreciate that nearly 6,000 small and medium-sized businesses have received more than &#163;605 million so far in loans from banks through the enterprise finance guarantee, which the Government introduced. RBS is committed to lending through that scheme, as well as through the European Investment Bank discounted loan scheme, which I would recommend as a funding option for growing businesses that are looking to make capital investment, although the scheme has not been promoted nearly enough by the banks. Indeed, we as a Government could do more to promote the availability of those funds.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.2/5">RBS data show that the bank is approving the vast majority of loan applications. RBS figures for 2009 show that the bank accepted 85 per cent. of all applications from SMEs. The increase in lending is of fundamental importance, but ensuring that customers are treated fairly is equally important. That issue has been raised by hon. Members, who should be aware that RBS has developed an SME customer charter. We worked alongside the bank to produce that charter, which set out the level of service that customers should expect to receive from their bank and includes features such as a 1.5 per cent. cap on overdraft and loan arrangement fees; ensuring that the price of loans or overdrafts reflects the cost of funding; a pledge to support business start-ups; and a programme of seminars to provide expert guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.2/6">We have taken actions, including on bank lending commitments. RBS has committed to lending &#163;16 billion during the year ending this month and we are discussing its future lending commitments. We expect banks to continue to offer competitively priced loans, to ensure that businesses get a fair deal, but decisions about pricing or terms and conditions of loans to specific businesses remain commercial decisions for banks and building societies. It would not be right for the Government to intervene in such decisions. Any dispute between a bank and a business should be resolved by the parties involved, initially by going through the bank's complaints procedure.</p>

	<p pid="b.99.0/1">Does the Minister understand that the issue does not affect new companies alone, but well-established companies with long-term relationships with the bank? There is something wrong with the bank-the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs drew the conclusion two weeks ago that the Royal Bank of Scotland has a structural problem in how it deals with such businesses. The bank is virtually blackmailing some of the businesses that it has been dealing with for years, and is foreclosing on others.</p>

	<p pid="b.99.1/1">I understand the ongoing concerns. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that there is an issue with existing businesses but, on RBS's figures, 85 per cent. of loan applications, which includes existing businesses, are accepted at the moment.</p>

	<p pid="b.99.3/1">I only have two or three minutes left, so let me respond with a few other things relevant to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.3/2">I referred to the bank's complaints procedure, but the Financial Ombudsman Service for small businesses is available, if people are not satisfied that they have received the right and appropriate treatment through the bank's complaints procedure. Hon. Members will be aware that RBS also operates a business hotline, which assists viable businesses in accessing loans. It is designed to be a second pair of eyes for businesses whose loans are turned down first-time. The hotline number is 0800 092 3087. I understand that only two Members of Parliament so far have made use of it, but some 4,400 calls have been received from businesses. We can use the hotline in our constituency roles, to take up the cases of RBS business customers who are not getting a fair crack of the whip.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.3/3">The hotline is clearly not applicable or appropriate in the circumstances to the case described by my hon. Friend the Member for Lanark and Hamilton, East, which went down the litigation route. He raised some serious allegations about the operation of the Royal Bank of Scotland. Undoubtedly, such matters will be determined by the courts. Certainly RBS is well aware of today's debate. My hon. Friend said that RBS is happy to meet him, which would be a good way for him to pursue the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.3/4">Overall, the Government's continuing actions are deliberately designed to address the flow of credit in the economy. We do not want to see credit constraints impeding recovery. We need to do all that we can to encourage lending. We have secured lending commitments from RBS and the Lloyds Banking Group, and we shall make further progress in that area.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.100.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" speakername="Roger Gale" colnum="100"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0005.htm#10031063000528">
	<p pid="b.100.2/1">I am grateful for this opportunity to place on the official record something that has been the subject of a huge amount of correspondence and a lot of comment in other debates in the House. Before I start, it is also worth placing on the record that I intend to quote from correspondence from other Members' constituencies because I have become the focus of attention for a lot of complaint, much of which has been sent to me by e-mail. I have notified, I hope, every Member whose constituents I shall quote from to enable them to be present and to comment if they so wish. Given that that is the case, I am more than willing-I know that it may take a little time-to give way to any hon. Member who wishes to intervene. I make that plain now, and I shall seek your indulgence, Mr. Benton, if that becomes necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/2">I have close to 1,500 reasons for raising the matter of the rail service-I use the word &quot;service&quot; loosely-between the towns of east Kent and central London via the Kent coast, or the north Kent line. The figure 1,500 represents the number of working men and women who pay very large sums of money to commute daily from Kent to central London to their places of employment. Those are people who have become so angered by the performance of Southeastern trains and by the failure of Ministers in the Department for Transport, including one Kent Member of Parliament, properly to understand and represent their interests that they found it necessary to send to the Prime Minister a petition calling for the restoration of a timetable that was in operation before December 2009 and the reappraisal of the vehicle that is less than appropriately named High Speed 1, the Javelin service.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/3">As long ago as March 2001, coincidentally in the run-up to that year's general election, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" name="Stephen Ladyman">the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)</phrase> was in the local press. The article stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/4" class="indent">&quot;A &#163;70 million rail link from Ramsgate to London was announced this week promising journey times of less than an hour. South Thanet MP Steve Ladyman said a new company, Netrail 2000, would operate the high-speed service, which would be running by May 2002. but the sub-hour journey might not be available until 2007.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/5">My description of this as a &quot;pre-election smokescreen&quot; was described as &quot;utterly contemptible&quot;. It was not long, though, before it became apparent that Netrail 2000 was of no substance and that the ghost trains &quot;to be built by Adtranz&quot; had not been ordered and did not exist. The sub-hour journey from a Thanet Parkway station to London has, however, been not only a dream but a potential reality for nearly 20 years and I have myself done the Victoria to Ramsgate trip, on an engineering train, in one hour flat.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/6">When the domestic high-speed service using the channel tunnel high-speed link was mooted, I campaigned, with others, for that high-speed service to be integrated with the domestic franchise in the fond belief that those travelling from east Kent to London would at last get the 21st century railway that they needed and deserved.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/7">Let me make it clear that I support the provision of a high-speed service from east Kent to London. Tomorrow, the Government will make a pre-election announcement about the proposed High Speed 2 service, but it would be good to think that before HS2 is commenced the Department will complete the half-finished High Speed 1 project, carry the upgraded line and service through to a Thanet Parkway station between Minster and Cliffsend and facilitate the development of Manston airport and a truly integrated rail, sea and air transport system. That really would be an achievement of some value to the economy of east Kent.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/8">At present, however, instead of the fast train to central London that commuters should be able to enjoy, we have been asked to applaud a train that runs fast-sometimes-from Ashford to St. Pancras at considerably increased cost, of little benefit to travellers using the Kent coastal services and at very severe detriment to the conventional routes to Victoria, Cannon Street and London Bridge that most commuters wish to use. Just as a parentheses, I heard this morning from Passenger Focus, which knows what it is talking about, that the take-up of the high-speed link to Ebbsfleet from passengers on the Kent coastline and from east Kent is just 15 per cent. I would not wish the Minister present to fall into the trap of believing that concern over the arrangements introduced in December were not anticipated. Notwithstanding the failure of consultation to take proper account of the views of the real fare-paying and travelling public, I myself raised the concerns in an Adjournment debate on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-20">20 January 2009</phrase>. I agreed that the high speed trains might reduce travelling times from parts of Kent to St. Pancras. However, I stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/9" class="indent">&quot;My constituents are going to be made to pay higher prices to travel to a station that they do not want to go to and then pay a tube fare to get back to the place where they actually want to be&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/10">With cuts to domestic services to clear paths for high speed trains, I predicted that</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/11" class="indent">&quot;my constituents are going to pay more for less.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-01-20.715"><i>Official Report</i>, 20 January 2009; Vol. 486, c. 715</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/12">That has been the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/13">Following that debate, the then Minister of State, now the Secretary of State, Lord Adonis, protested that there would be an increase in the services available to my constituents and that Southeastern fares would be capped at &quot;RPI plus 3 per cent&quot;-try telling that to my commuting constituents. He said that passengers from east Kent would experience benefits in savings and in journey times. He added:</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/14" class="indent">&quot;I do not believe that any passenger will be obliged to switch to a high-speed service in order to reach their preferred destination.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/15">Following my letter of <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-25">25 February 2009</phrase>, in which I challenged some of his more careless assertions, Lord Adonis replied on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-12">12 March 2009</phrase> and acknowledged that his assessment of the number of trains from Margate to Victoria during the morning peak was erroneous. He also said:</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/16" class="indent">&quot;It is true that your constituents who currently use the direct services to London Charing Cross in the peaks will no longer be able to do so after December. However, the journey may still be made by taking a service to London Bridge and changing there.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/17">He added that</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/18" class="indent">&quot;arrival at St. Pancras International would be more convenient for other passengers wishing to visit, for example, the British Museum, the British Library, London Zoo or Madam Tussauds.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/19">It may have escaped his Lordship's notice, but season-ticket holders commuting to work do not spend a great deal of time visiting caged wild animals or looking at stuffed dummies. I shall deal with the detrimental leisure aspects of this issue later.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/20">The immediate point that I wish to make to the Minister is that the problems that we are experiencing today were foreseen, forecast and ignored by both the train operating company, Govia, and the Secretary of State for Transport. In case we are in any doubt it is clearly with the Secretary of State for Transport that this buck must stop. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-16">16 February</phrase>, in a response to a complaint from Mr. Daniel Sargent, Southeastern trains customer services officer, David Eustace, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/21" class="indent">&quot;As far as the timetable is concerned, we realise that some people are disappointed with the changes that were made in December. Unfortunately, all timetables are a compromise between a service specification set by the Department for Transport (DfT) the infrastructure and rolling stock resources available&quot;.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.102.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1599" speakername="Adam Holloway" colnum="102"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0005.htm#10031063000529">
	<p pid="b.102.0/1">The high-speed train services have been amazing and transformative in my constituency, but, of course, the normal trains are slow, dirty and very often late. Would the hon. Gentleman agree that there is an urgent need for bi-directional signalling at the pinch point at Rochester bridge? In my own constituency the numbers of trains stopping at Sole Street station are being severely restricted.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.102.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" speakername="Roger Gale" colnum="102"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0005.htm#10031063000530">
	<p pid="b.102.1/1">My hon. Friend is leading me down a path that I was not going to go down, but he has given me the opportunity to comment on an issue that is not peripheral but separate. Five years ago, representatives of Network Rail came down to Margate and examined the potential for Margate station with me. We talked about signalling on the Kent coast line. I was assured that it would be in place by 2009. Modern signalling, which allows tricks that could not otherwise be played, would allow trains on the Kent coast line to overtake. Advanced signalling and crossover points-although this sounds hairy-allow trains to be run in both directions, overtaking each other, on the two tracks. One might think that that would mean that trains would meet head-on at some point, but I am assured that that is not the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/2">New signalling would also allow trains to travel much closer together, with much more signalling and therefore many more safety points on the line. The problem with the Kent coast line, as my hon. Friend and I know, is that it was built on the cheap 100 years ago. It has gradients instead of cuttings and only two passing points between Ramsgate and London. He is absolutely right to make that point. Sadly, the date has slipped. It will now be 2012 or 2014 before improvements are-literally-on track.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/3">David Eustace, Southeastern trains customer services officer, continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/4" class="indent">&quot;On taking over the franchise in 2006 we inherited as a contractual commitment the Integrated Kent Franchise service specification, which detailed the level of service the DfT had stipulated for the Southeastern network&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/5">so it is the Department for Transport's baby. He added:</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/6" class="indent">&quot;As it stands, there are unlikely to be any significant changes for when the summer timetable starts in May&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/7">That will bring joy to the hearts of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/8">Understanding that Govia's Keith Ludeman and Southeastern's Charles Horton were effectively pawns on the DFT chessboard, I wrote to the Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-06">6 January</phrase>, after a disastrous Christmas rail transport season in east Kent. In that letter, I said that I would be meeting Southeastern's Charles Horton to discuss the flow of complaint e-mails that I was receiving from dissatisfied customers, and I invited the Secretary of State to attend the meeting.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/9">Having met Mr. Horton, I wrote again to the Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-18">18 January</phrase>, saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/10" class="indent">&quot;With regards to the bigger picture, Mr. Horton places the responsibility on the terms of the franchise agreement laid down by your Department.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/11">Southeastern is in no doubt either about where the buck stops. I continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/12" class="indent">&quot;It is clear that now that the new timetable has been imposed it cannot be changed piecemeal and will require a thorough review. To establish how best the present unacceptable position may be rectified in the shortest possible time and in order that I may apprise you of the detail of the views of travellers, I am formally requesting a personal meeting with you&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/13">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-26">26 January</phrase>, the Minister responded to my first letter of <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-06">6 January</phrase> on behalf of the Secretary of State:</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/14" class="indent">&quot;Your constituents are well served by the December 2009 timetable&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/15">citing additional services to London Cannon Street, London Victoria and London Bridge stations, as well as the unloved St. Pancras service. We will hear the views of the travelling public in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/16">In a further and-forgive me-crass observation indicating his lamentable understanding of the geography of east Kent, the Minister then prayed in aid of his improvement claims services to Tunbridge Wells, Tonbridge, Sevenoaks, Bexleyheath, Greenwich and Grove Park, none of which are of interest to those using the Kent coastal services. He was, however, gracious enough to acknowledge that</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/17" class="indent">&quot;The Department has received some negative feedback&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/18">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-12">12 February</phrase>, the Minister wrote again on his Lordship's behalf, this time in response to my letter requesting a meeting with the Secretary of State:</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/19" class="indent">&quot;I am unable to attend such a meeting due to diary commitments&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/20">his diary having presumably been rearranged for the general election. He asserted in a further letter on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-22">22 February</phrase> that</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/21" class="indent">&quot;Southeastern is now the best connected London-serving Train Operating Company, serving seven London terminal stations&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/22">and told me and those whom I represent:</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/23" class="indent">&quot;forecast modelling tools used by the rail industry suggest that it will take up to three years for a new market to reach 100 per cent. of its potential. It is, therefore, too early to be seeking to reach a judgment on the recently introduced service to St. Pancras.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/24">My constituents are travelling now, not in three years' time. Their working lives are being disrupted now. They are paying vastly inflated fares-way above the Department's alleged increase of RPI plus 3 per cent.-now. They are travelling on dirty, overcrowded, unreliable trains, and arriving home late from work to cold dinners and children already in bed, now.</p>

	<p pid="b.103.0/1">I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way while making a powerful speech, and I congratulate him on fighting a remarkable campaign. May I add one more item to that extremely unappealing list? Those who commute across Kent rather than into London face a pathetic collapse in the timetable arrangements for transitions. Some transitions have dropped from 10 minutes to one minute, so people keep missing connections.</p>

	<p pid="b.104.0/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Some of the changes dramatically affect his constituents. If he can stay until later in my speech, he will hear me refer to one of them. If he cannot, I understand fully, as I know that he has other commitments in the House this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/2">I want the Minister-and the Secretary of State, who I trust will read this debate in the <i>O</i><i>fficial </i><i>R</i><i>eport</i>-to hear from the mouths of the travelling public precisely what they think of his Department, Southeastern trains and Govia. Michael Alderton, a gold card season ticket holder, says:</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/3" class="indent">&quot;The introduction of the High Speed (?) service to the timetable is a shambles and highlights the lack of consideration of SE Trains for commuters...I have had to start getting this earlier service because the later train (6.44) is regularly late and at work I do not have the luxury of being allowed a five-minute window&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/4">Five minutes, of course, is the amount by which trains are allowed to be late without being regarded as late.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/5">Working up the line from Margate-a two-hour journey on a good day-Vivien Viggers says:</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/6" class="indent">&quot;The introduction of this service and the downgrading of the original service to Cannon Street and Victoria has been of little use to me. Because there are no trains at Westgate in the morning at 6 am, I now have to walk to Margate. Whereas I could walk to my workplace from Cannon Street, I now have to take a tube...the journey is no quicker and I have been forced to pay the inflated fares for no improvement in service.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/7">One stop further on, in Westbrook, Paul Dexter writes that</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/8" class="indent">&quot;a new trend that is becoming more frequent is that when a train is running late on the return journey...Southeastern are not stopping at a number of stations between Faversham and Ramsgate to enable them to make up time (presumably so they can meet their targets)...customers for smaller stations between Faversham and Ramsgate have to terminate their journey at Faversham and suffer a further delay...whilst we wait for the next train to come through.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/9">Mr. Dexter, who pays &#163;3,780 a year out of taxed income for his season ticket, adds:</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/10" class="indent">&quot;It's all the more difficult to take increases to the price for this year on the basis of the vastly deteriorating service we have received since the new timetable came into place...The delays may not sound significant...but...the impact it has on the time I have to spend with a young family in the evenings is.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/11">Dawn Dale, who travels from Birchington-on-Sea, asks:</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/12" class="indent">&quot;Why are they running a 'high speed' service on a line that...cannot reach any high speeds until it leaves the commuter line at Ebbsfleet and the trains only get into London 10 minutes earlier than they would on the main line-time that you then have to spend getting back to where you need to be?...When are Southeastern going to admit that they have made a mistake on this line&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/13">I would add: when will the Minister?</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/14">The next stop is Herne Bay. Sharon Reeve pays &#163;4,150 out of a salary of &#163;26,000 to get to work. Because of the changes to the timetable she has to</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/15" class="indent">&quot;rise at 04:30 to catch a 05:35 train which will deliver me to London for 07:07-where upon I will have nearly ONE WHOLE HOUR before I need to start work.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/16">She goes on:</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/17" class="indent">&quot;If I lose my job through being late for work I will be another 'benefit' statistic, and if I have to take a local job, I will join the low paid, be unable to pay tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/18" class="indent">Why is the government not stepping in, to ensure that those of us willing to work, are able to get to work&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/19">Moving up the line to Teynham, Duncan Law used to catch the 5.27 to London Bridge and get to his Greenwich office by 7 am. Now</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/20" class="indent">&quot;the train doesn't stop at my Local Station, meaning I have to travel to Sittingbourne and pay &#163;4.50 per day just to park&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/21" class="indent">He goes on:</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/22" class="indent">&quot;The train from Sittingbourne is NOT direct to London Bridge or Cannon Street anymore, you have to change at Gillingham onto a local train to complete your journey.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/23">He concludes by saying that he is</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/24" class="indent">&quot;so angry and let down&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/25">by Southeastern.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/26">Antony Loveland from Faversham works in north-west London, an area that the Department says is favoured by the run-through to St. Pancras. He says that</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/27" class="indent">&quot;the St. Pancras terminal is of limited use to me. Furthermore, I would be required to find an extra &#163;1400-&#163;1500 for my annual season ticket if I were to use the 'high speed' service which only gains me 6 minutes each way. I find it difficult to see how Southeastern can deem this value for money.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/28">He concludes:</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/29" class="indent">&quot;Whilst I'm sure it had its drawbacks I would welcome a return of the old timetable&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/30">We now move towards the constituency represented by the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1594" name="Paul Clark">the hon. Member for Gillingham (Paul Clark)</phrase>, who presumably speaks occasionally to the Secretary of State. Dennis Hamer from Newington tells me that he faces</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/31" class="indent">&quot;a reduced number of trains in peak hours&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/32">and 50 per cent. fewer trains during off-peak hours. He adds:</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/33" class="indent">&quot;Needless to say these journeys take considerably longer than under the old timetable&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/34">Neil West, who lives on Sheppey and works in Fulham, says that</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/35" class="indent">&quot;the new timetable has increased my journey to work from 2 hrs to 2 hrs 20 minutes and the journey home from 2 hrs to 2 hrs 30 minutes on a normal day. I have lost almost an hour of my own free time each day.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/36">And so to Gillingham and Rainham, home of the Under-Secretary, who wrote on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-01">1 March</phrase> to his constituent, Jennifer Coles, saying that he had met with Southeastern's Charles Horton, who was</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/37" class="indent">&quot;very quick to acknowledge Southeastern's disappointment with regard to the general performance of the service.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/38">Mr. Horton had stressed that</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/39" class="indent">&quot;Southeastern's entire focus is currently being directed at driving up performance levels&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/40">Faced across the table by a Transport Minister defending a marginal seat and beset by angry commuters, he would say that. The Minister went on to sing from the Department song sheet:</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/41" class="indent">&quot;I do believe that the high-speed rail service is a great asset for the residents of Medway and that it will provide increased opportunity for the area. I hope that in time, and with the return to high performance levels of your standard commuting services, you will begin to think so too.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/42">It is debatable whether Amy Overy from Rainham, another constituent of the Under-Secretary, will be impressed by his observations. She said that</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/43" class="indent">&quot;the Medway Towns are worse off from the new HS1 service!&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/44">She went on:</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/45" class="indent">&quot;I do not want to hear that commuters are better off elsewhere in Kent, because I don't live elsewhere and I don't want to move either. I want a reliable service to and from London Victoria, in less than an hour, which is what I could expect before the timetable changes in December 2009.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/46">Interestingly, the Minister got the Department's franchise manager, John MacQuarrie, to reply to that comment. Mr. MacQuarrie said that</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/47" class="indent">&quot;the Department will review jointly with Southeastern how successful the implementation of December 2009 timetable has been.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/48">&quot;Successful&quot; is perhaps not the word I would have chosen.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/49">I appreciate that this debate is a lengthy journey. If the Minister is beginning to lose the will to live, perhaps he understands how Kent's travelling public feel on a daily basis. In case he is tempted to think that this problem affects just a few people on the line that is the subject of the debate, Daniel Sargent states:</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/50" class="indent">&quot;I commute to London Cannon Street everyday from Dover and my journey has been increased by 20 minutes in the evening, it now takes 2 hours in total.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.106.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1550" speakername="Gwyn Prosser" colnum="106"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0006.htm#10031063000533">
	<p pid="b.106.0/1">I have listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman's speech and to the complaints from many of his constituents and the constituents of other hon. Members. If I manage to catch your eye, Mr. Benton, I will give my view on the difficulties in Dover. However, I put it on the record that the volume of complaints in Dover about the impact of High Speed 1 on domestic services does not reflect the jaundiced and grim story we are hearing.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.106.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" speakername="Roger Gale" colnum="106"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0006.htm#10031063000534">
	<p pid="b.106.1/1">The hon. Gentleman will no doubt make his view known and I am sure that his constituents, such as Mr. Sargent, will pay attention.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/2">I am representing the daily experiences of real people who pay real money, after tax, to travel from homes along the Kent coast, through the Medway towns, and into London. Whether the hon. Gentleman likes it or not, the introduction of high-speed trains has had a dramatic effect on the performance of the standard service. Passengers are demonstrating with their feet that they do not want to go to St. Pancras. I have done that journey, as I am sure has he. After travelling to St. Pancras, it takes 25 minutes and costs &#163;2.50 to get back to Westminster. The same is true for Aldgate and other places, as I will show. That is not an improvement.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/3">Mr. Sargent goes on to make that very point:</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/4" class="indent">&quot;I cannot afford to use the High Speed trains and even if I could they do not take me to where I work. My office is a 10 minute walk from Cannon Street, so why would I want to get a train to St. Pancras and then have to pay for another season ticket to use London underground&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/5">It does not make any sense. No sane person would regard that as an improvement. No time is saved and money is wasted. By my miserable maths, people without season tickets have to pay an additional &#163;13.50 a day for a standard return fare to London to use the high-speed service-and that is before paying to park. That is a lot of money for a mediocre service. I will be interested to hear the hon. Gentleman justify it. Trevor Allison from Preston, near Canterbury, states:</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/6" class="indent">&quot;The introduction of the high speed service has resulted in an inferior service for passengers who travel to London from Kearsney, Shepherdswell, Aylesham, Adisham, Canterbury East and Selling.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/7">Even for people coming from Ashford-the raison d'&#234;tre of the high-speed link-all is not perfect. Julia Blackwell, a gold card, first-class traveller, reports that</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/8" class="indent">&quot;until the introduction of the revised timetable in December I was travelling to and from Cannon Street by semi-fast service. What SouthEastern fail to understand is that High Speed to the wrong destination is no gain at all for many people.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/9">Again, that is the point I have been making. She states:</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/10" class="indent">&quot;St Pancras is useless for the City...as it takes at least 20 to 25 minutes journey by tube back to Aldgate...thereby negating the benefits of a fast arrival at St Pancras.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/11">To add insult to injury, people who have to travel on the high-speed link, but do not pay the high-speed premium due to the failure of the train operator to provide adequate ticket purchase and upgrade facilities, such as Peter Jaquiss from Cliftonville and Sharon Gregory from Westgate, are faced with penalty fares on arrival at St. Pancras. Remember, this is progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/12">Even the local Kent services have not escaped the impact of this ill-conceived plan. Julie Gurr from Herne says:</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/13" class="indent">&quot;I travel from Sturry to Chartham, a journey of 11 minutes each way on the old timetable but...it now takes over 35 minutes each way!!&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/14">She continues:</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/15" class="indent">&quot;It has been a complete nightmare because if the train from Chartham is delayed or cancelled I can't get the connection at Canterbury. I thought the idea of public transport was to take cars off the road but with this new timetable I think that the opposite is going to happen.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/16">I think so too.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/17">I will bring this litany to a conclusion shortly, but I said that I would refer to the impact that this matter has had on leisure traffic. Terry Davidson from Folkestone tells me that</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/18" class="indent">&quot;we have lost the fast trains to Charing Cross twice an hour on Saturday...and one is forced to use the high speed line to have a sensible journey time.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/19" class="indent">The old Saturday service...was 1 hr 20 mins to London and to save just 20 mins it is nearly double the cost&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/20">Almost finally, there is Paul Twyman, who is a former under-secretary at the Department for Transport-I do not know whether he is known to the Minister-and a member of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport. He reminded me that journey times are now</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/21" class="indent">&quot;longer than in the age of steam&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/22">the trains in 1927 were faster than they are today. He asks:</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/23" class="indent">&quot;How can Thanet attract tourists if journeys can take up to 3 hours (my last journey at the weekend...was spent either waiting for a 'replacement bus' or journeying on it all round the highways and byways of East Kent; we nearly froze to death on Faversham Station).&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/24">He adds that high-speed trains</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/25" class="indent">&quot;are no good for me. I do not want to pay more to go to a place that I do not want to go to.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/26">A letter from another Southeastern customer relations officer, Dan Westlake, to Mr. Les Turner-this is brilliant-helpfully indicates:</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/27" class="indent">&quot;I should first of all explain that, when selling you a ticket, a railway company does not guarantee to carry you on any particular train (unless seat reservations apply) or that you will arrive at a particular time. The timetable is a guide to services that a train company intends to operate but it does not guarantee that trains will run in accordance with it&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/28">So now the cat is out of the bag.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/29">I am deeply indebted to Roy Coppins and John Nicholson of Herne Bay and to Bob Parsons, Terry Morland, Alastair Coles, John Cherry and many others for the painstakingly gathered information that they have provided me with. I am also grateful to Tunde Olatunji of Passenger Focus in the south-east for his staunch support and to the many hundreds of members of the travelling public who have signed John Nicholson's Downing street petition because they are, quite simply, at the end of their tether and their tolerance.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/30">In a recent <i>Kent Messenger </i>newspaper article, Lord Adonis, having taken a brief train journey with his junior Minister, the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for Gillingham, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/31" class="indent">&quot;The message I'm getting is that trains are working successfully, they are very reliable and they have slashed journey times, so they are proving increasingly popular with commuters&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/32">17 per cent. of them.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/33">He continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/34" class="indent">&quot;The trains were introduced at the same time as the severe weather when all trains were subject to delay and disruption, but since that weather ended, the high-speed service has been running extremely well.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/35">I do not know what planet the Secretary of State inhabits, but I do understand that the upper House is not yet elected, so he might pause to consider that a number of his parliamentary colleagues in the Commons currently occupy Labour marginal seats in the Medway towns, South Thanet and Dover. Their constituents and mine would like- not in three years, not in months, but immediately-to see a cut in fares to reflect the poor standard of service; a return to the sensible timetabling of trains to destinations that travellers actually wish to reach in central London; an end to short-form trains and the provision of adequate seating in clean units; an end to the practice of skipping stations between Faversham and east Kent; and, in response to John Nicholson's Downing street petition, an apology for the manner in which the Department for Transport and Southeastern trains have to date failed the high-fare-paying travelling public of east Kent.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.108.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1550" speakername="Gwyn Prosser" colnum="108"  time="015:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0007.htm#10031063000535">
	<p pid="b.108.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" name="Roger Gale">the hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale)</phrase>, who might be surprised to hear that I agree with some, but not all, of the points that he raised. I am not here to speak for other MPs' constituents, but I certainly want to speak up for my constituents in Dover.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/2">I have been using east Kent trains occasionally for 30 years since I first went down to Dover in 1979, although I have used them more frequently since I became the town's MP 13 years ago. No matter what the deficiencies and weaknesses of the current service and timetables, let us not forget that they do not compare at all with the experiences that we all suffered during those early years. Right up until the late '90s, we were travelling on the old slam-door trains, which really rattled and were dirty, insecure and unreliable. We have certainly come a long way since then.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/3">I have fond memories of turning up at Dover Priory station in 2001 to officially name the first of the class 375 services. Hon. Members will not be surprised to hear that it was named &quot;White Cliffs Country&quot; and not, I am afraid, &quot;Gwyn Prosser&quot;. However, those services really marked a turning point in investment in trains down to east Kent. The trains were brought in by Connex South Eastern, which was later to lose its franchise owing to poor performance-perhaps poor performance has something to do with geographical matters, rather than the train operator.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/4">The trains were subsequently renationalised for two and a half years-I would call them two and a half glorious years-and they ran under the name of South Eastern Trains. It is on the record that South Eastern's trains were more punctual and provided a better, more reliable service and that industrial relations were better than ever before. Along with my colleagues in the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, I campaigned hard, although unsuccessfully, to get Ministers to keep at least this rail operator in the public sector to provide a benchmark with which to compare private operators. We have seen some really dismal, sad stories from a lot of those private operators, large and small, over the years. As I said, it was well documented that the service improved under South Eastern, that punctuality got much better and that industrial relations were much better in that window of nationalisation. RMT and ASLEF fought hard to keep things that way, but it just was not to be.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/5">This afternoon, we are debating the timetables and the standard of service under the current operator, Southeastern trains. From a constituency point of view, I am pleased to put on record how delighted Dover is to be connected to the high-speed train service to London. That did not happen by accident, and it could easily not have happened at all. Some Members will remember the fight and the campaign that we undertook to ensure that the train came all the way down to Dover. The experts told us that there were safety issues at Shakespeare cliff and that there were technical matters and obstacles.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/6">For a long time, it looked as if the trains would terminate in Folkestone. I have nothing against Folkestone, and I should just mention that it is another east Kent constituency represented by a Welsh MP. However, one deficiency with the high-speed service is that the train stops twice in the little town of Folkestone, which has two stations less than a minute apart. If we took away one of those superfluous stops, we could easily cut the travel time from Dover to London to the magic one hour, rather than the present one hour and seven minutes; I just say that as an aside. Of course, if <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1587" name="Michael Howard">the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase> was here, I would see him outside afterwards. As I said, however, I have nothing at all against Folkestone.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/7">The campaign that we fought to get the trains into Dover has already had good results. Business people in the town say that even within weeks of the trains coming in, estate agents were reporting rising markets and more interest in commercial properties and general accommodation. We are therefore happy with the high-speed train as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough at present. That is why I have been pressing since the middle of last year for some high-speed trains to stop at Deal, which is an important part of my constituency. Its population is slightly bigger than Dover's, and there is huge potential for growth in the number of travellers from the town, so it deserves to have some of the high-speed trains stop at Deal station.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/8">The hon. Member for North Thanet made a number of complaints about the impact of High Speed 1 on domestic services. We have the high-speed train, but it impacts negatively on domestic services, and that is true at all our stations-I echo those complaints. It has a particularly bad impact on the town of Deal, where passengers have longer journey times and poor connections to Dover. Deal people, like quite a lot of others on that line, have none of the advantages of High Speed 1 and probably all or most of the disadvantages. However, I believe that that can be overcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/9">Last year, I started to talk to Southeastern, Network Rail and Ministers, to press the case for Deal. I met Charles Horton; we have all met him, and he is an amiable fellow. The chief executive of Southeastern acknowledged, I suppose, that there were some deficiencies, and promised a review, but wanted the present timetables and systems to settle down and wanted to get some service experience from them. However, I particularly pressed Deal's case. Since then I have discussed Deal with Lord Adonis.</p>

	<p pid="b.110.0/1">We are going to be told later, I suspect, that there will be a review and that things might get better at some time. The point is that we raised the issues a year ago and no one listened, so I wonder why the hon. Gentleman thinks they will listen now.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.110.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1550" speakername="Gwyn Prosser" colnum="110"  time="015:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0007.htm#10031063000537">
	<p pid="b.110.1/1">I have some sympathy with that remark. My experience of the Department for Transport is that it takes an awful lot of shouting, booing and pushing to make anything happen. It is the Department's inertia that may need to be addressed; I do not think that it is down to individuals.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/2">I raised the issue of Deal and the high-speed rail deficiency, as I called it at the time, with Lord Adonis, who came to Dover with two colleagues to celebrate the high-speed train. He got off at Dover Priory a month or so ago. He wanted to ram home the advantages of regeneration-the boost that high-speed trains give to regenerating places such as Dover. We have very ambitious regeneration plans on the table.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/3">I pay tribute to our local rail campaigning group, which is called Trains4Deal, and to the <i>East Kent Mercury</i>, for the work that they have done together to promote Deal's interests. Trains4Deal has produced a detailed document, which made a well-argued business case for including Deal on the high-speed network and improving connection times. I shall not burden the House by going through all those issues, except to say that on Monday, further to our discussions and meetings, I met the Minister, along with a member of Trains4Deal, and we discussed the paper in detail.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/4">It is right to complain when there are complaints to be made, and it is right to raise the question of the deficiencies of the service, but my group is more concerned with suggesting practical solutions that will give us the advantage of the high-speed trains without the present disadvantages for the domestic services. I am looking forward to the Minister's response to our detailed document, when he has had time to look at it, and perhaps to another meeting and finding some practical solutions to the situation in Dover and Deal. It would be tragic if the tenor of this debate gave the impression that High Speed 1 is a waste of time, that High Speed 1 has brought no advantages to Dover or other parts of east Kent, and that High Speed 1 is not recoverable and cannot be made into a first-class service without affecting our domestic lines.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.111.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" speakername="Hugh Robertson" colnum="111"  time="015:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0007.htm#10031063000538">
	<p pid="b.111.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" name="Roger Gale">the Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale)</phrase> on securing the debate. In our part of the world he is regarded with great affection and respect, and on the evidence of this afternoon's debate it is easy to see why.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/2">My constituency is in effect two smaller constituencies-the Faversham end and the mid-Kent end-and is bisected by three railway lines. In the south there is the Headcorn line, which has recently had a considerable increase in the number of complaints. I went to see the Minister about the Maidstone to Ashford line, with my right hon. Friends the Members for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley) and for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe). The issue in that case is the impact that the high-speed line has had on services. I have many constituents who live in Bearsted whose lives have been completely altered, to their detriment, as a result of losing services that got them home in time to pick up children from school, and the rest of it. In the north of the constituency is the north Kent line, which is the subject of this afternoon's debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/3">I should say at the outset that I am not one of those people who take a remorselessly negative view of rail services, and I always thought that it would take some time for the high-speed train line to settle down, when it arrived, and that we would need time to see the benefits or otherwise of the new service. However, just like my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet, I have been staggered by the number of complaints that I have received, relating to all three lines but most noticeably the north Kent one. In nearly a decade as a Member of Parliament I have never received as many complaints about the railways as I have in the past six months. Those complaints are not only in the letters that I have received, which I have passed on to Southeastern; also, everywhere I go, I get buttonholed by constituents who want to complain about what is happening. For example, last Friday night I was at a goodbye party for a local solicitor who was retiring after 30 years, and in that half hour I was buttonholed by two people. One of them said he had taken the train from St. Pancras back at rush hour the previous week, and had been the only person in his carriage. Then, lo and behold, across the room 10 minutes later I received exactly the same complaint. This is serious. It is not just a disruption caused by a new service.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/4">In essence there are three issues affecting the north Kent line, and they mirror many of those already raised by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1550" name="Gwyn Prosser">the Member for North Thanet and the hon. Member for Dover (Gwyn Prosser)</phrase>. The first and most important is the disruption that the new high-speed train has meant for what people in Faversham call the classic service-the existing service. The people concerned are those who moved to Faversham and bought houses, taking the decision to raise their family there, generally on the basis of the rail service. The lives of many of them have been completely disrupted by the arrival of the new services. They cannot get connections, they cannot get home in time, and there are not sufficient numbers of trains going to Victoria and Cannon Street now. For those people there has been an immediate impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/5">A second, associated issue affects that category of people, concerning a little station called Selling, which is on a line between Faversham and Canterbury. Because of the knock-on effect of incorporating the new service, a considerable number of services have been lost to the station of Selling, and that has completely disrupted people's lives there. Selling is the point to which people would come from many of the surrounding rural villages. Those people now drive to Faversham, clogging up the roads and causing extra congestion, and of course having to pay car parking fees. Selling, without doubt, is the place that has suffered most from the introduction of the new service.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/6">The second main batch of complaints is about a bit of a Faversham-specific issue-the parking and berthing of the high-speed trains overnight. They are berthed in the sidings at Faversham, which are right next to a new-build housing complex. Because the fans turn on and off in the early hours of the morning, people report regularly having a disrupted night's sleep. It was suggested over Christmas, when Swale borough council did some investigation, that the sort of noise disruption that people were suffering was considerably above the World Health Organisation recommended limit. I shall not take the Minister through the technicalities of that this afternoon, but it is apparent to me that it gives rise to a considerable issue. When the matter was first raised it was suggested that people who bought a house next to a railway line should expect a train to be parked on it overnight. There is an element of truth in that, unsympathetic though it is, but that should not be the expectation if the noise being generated is unreasonable. I am sure that everyone would agree on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/7">The third point, which echoes one that my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet made earlier, is about the fare structure of High Speed 1. I had not heard the Passenger Focus figure about the 15 per cent. take-up, but apocryphally I had heard a number of constituents complaining about it. The problem with High Speed 1, which is already well documented, is that it takes existing residents into what they see as the wrong part of London-St. Pancras-when archetypally they want to get to the west end or the City. To make use of the service they must pay a much higher fare and an underground fare to get back to where they wanted to go in the first place. The justification, clearly, was that the service would open up connections going north to people who lived in east Kent, but having looked at the issue for a few months I suspect that the number of people who are benefiting is relatively small and the number who are suffering disruption to their existing trip is pretty extraordinary.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/8">What do I want to be done about all of this? What do I want the Minister to say he will do? First, Southeastern has pointed out time and again-it is becoming a mantra-that the timetable is set by the Department. I ask the Minister if, indeed, he promises us a review this afternoon, to make sure that the timetable is rebalanced, so that it better reflects the demand of existing users.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/9">Secondly, on the Faversham-specific issue, I would like some reassurance that the overnight parking problem will be looked at seriously. It is simply not acceptable in this day and age for someone who buys a new-build house next to a railway line to have their night's sleep disrupted night after night, as two of the constituents who have written to me have claimed. They are nurses who work in the health service and have to go to work at the Kent and Canterbury hospital the next day, having had two or three hours' sleep. I would like some reassurance from the Minister either that properly sound-proofed sheds will be introduced or that the trains will be parked further away.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/10">In addition, for the good of the high-speed train service, I hope that the Minister will be able to promise us some sort of review of the fare structure. Clearly, the concept of pricing the high-speed service higher than the ordinary fare does not appear, on the evidence presented thus far, to be working.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/11">In conclusion, I would like once again to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet on initiating the debate. Above all, I do not want the Minister to think that this is some sort of pre-election heist on him or that the issue is being driven by press releases. There is very real problem here. I promise him that, in my nine years as a local MP, I have never come across such consistent anger over the rail services. I hope he will take the matter seriously and that he can promise us this afternoon that he will look into it.</p>

Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I shall start by giving a few more facts-we have heard lots of facts today-and picking up the subject of fares, which was where <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" name="Hugh Robertson">the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson)</phrase> finished. Fares are clearly very pertinent to the debate. We have heard what the additional cost of the fares on the high-speed line allegedly is-I heard the figure of &#163;13 mentioned, although my information suggests it is &#163;8 more.</p>

	<p pid="b.113.1/1">Just to set the record straight, the figure is &#163;13.50: about &#163;4.50 each way plus &#163;2.50 return on the tube. The fare is not just for the high-speed train.</p>

	<p pid="b.113.2/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that clarification. I think he just confirmed that the fare increase is very substantial-we are talking &#163;9 for the train alone.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/2">Hon. Members might be interested to know that someone can travel 391 miles for &#163;10 in Bulgaria. Indeed, I have-admittedly not recently-travelled on Bulgarian trains, and I can confirm that they do run and are spacious. For &#163;10, someone can travel 200 miles in Poland, 131 miles in the Czech Republic and 61 miles in France. We then get to the UK, where someone can travel 23.8 miles at that price. I suspect that for someone is travelling on a high-speed train, it is significantly less than 23.8 miles.</p>

	<p pid="b.113.3/1">I once travelled some hundreds of miles on a Polish train during a Select Committee visit, when an aeroplane failed to take off. If someone wants the experience of a 1950s British Rail reconstruction, they might enjoy a journey at such a price, but if they want a modern high-speed train, surely the hon. Gentleman would concede that they will pay a little more.</p>

	<p pid="b.113.4/1">I thank the Minister for his intervention, and I am happy to concede that. He has probably also travelled on trains in France, which are of a high standard. Yet someone can travel roughly three times the distance on French trains for the price we pay here for 23 miles. Let us not go to Poland; we simply need to look across the water and make some comparisons with the train services in France.</p>

	<p pid="b.114.0/1">Before the hon. Gentleman rushes into making European comparisons, he should know that one of the features of British train services is their frequency, which one does not necessarily get on the same basis between similarly distanced stations in France.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.114.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" speakername="Tom Brake" colnum="114"  time="015:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0008.htm#10031063000545">
	<p pid="b.114.1/1">We could probably trade statistics for the remainder of the time allotted today. However, I think that most people who have travelled on trains in France and in the UK would find that French trains compared favourably with those in the UK, whether UK trains are more frequent or not. The substantive issue, which, indeed, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" name="Norman Baker">the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase> sought to raise with the Prime Minister today, is that we have built a guaranteed fare increase year after year into the system through the retail prices index plus 1 per cent. arrangement. Since 1997, the cost of travelling by train has risen by 13 per cent. and the cost of travelling by car has fallen by roughly a similar amount. So, there has been a 13 per cent. increase in the cost of travelling by train and a 14 per cent. decrease in the cost of travelling by car.</p>

	<p pid="b.114.2/1">I am happy to continue to exchange statistics with the hon. Gentleman. For the same period, disposable incomes have increased by 25 per cent., so the real cost of rail travel has fallen.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.114.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" speakername="Tom Brake" colnum="114"  time="015:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0008.htm#10031063000547">
	<p pid="b.114.3/1">I hope that the Minister agrees-I believe that this was certainly a priority at some point for the then Deputy Prime Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1646" name="John Prescott">the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott)</phrase>-that we should encourage more people to use public transport. In fact, on a camping trip to Italy, I recall coming back from a day out to find that a fax had been slipped under the tent door asking me to comment on the fact that it was five years since the Deputy Prime Minister had pledged that, if more people were not travelling by public transport in five years' time, he should be called to account. I had been tracked down to that campsite in Italy to comment on the fact that the target had clearly not been achieved. Yes, it is true that people's incomes have increased, but it is also true that the price differential between trains and cars has grown significantly, which has put people off travelling by train.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.3/2">A final statistic I shall mention relates to overcrowding. The industry standard for PIXCs-passengers in excess of capacity-is currently set at 3 per cent. or an acceptable level. That is now being exceeded, which leads to substantial overcrowding on some of the train services that have been mentioned today. That is certainly the case on the train services I use as a commuter, and many commuters in the London suburbs have to deal with daily overcrowding.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.3/3">In the Prime Minister's response to my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes, he referred to an announcement to be made tomorrow, which we presume will be about high-speed train services. The experience of High Speed 1 has set an unfortunate precedent. As the hon. Member for North Thanet and other speakers have made clear, if a consequence of high-speed trains is that it costs people more to travel to a destination that they do not actually want to get to, and that is how people perceive the impact of new high-speed train services, the support in my party-and I am sure in other parties-for extending those services, particularly so that they can compete with short-haul flights, is likely to evaporate. The Minister will have to deal with that issue when he responds. Notwithstanding his interventions, there will be significant time at the end of the debate for him to set out how he will address these matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.3/4">As we know, the new timetable was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-13">13 December</phrase>. The promise then was that high speed would provide an extra 200 trains a day and that capacity would be boosted by 5 per cent. However, many commuters' experience appears to have been the opposite of that. There are fewer options, longer travel times, more overcrowded services and people have to pay a substantial premium if they want to travel on the high-speed link to a destination that, as other hon. Members have said, many people do not want to get to.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.3/5">Who is responsible for the issue? Other hon. Members have made it clear that, in the correspondence they have received, Southeastern does not accept responsibility for the new service and has clearly fingered the Government-the Department for Transport. If the Minister believes there was any flexibility for Southeastern to implement anything different from what it has been required to implement, I am sure he will make that clear when he responds. Forecasts were apparently carried out to determine which services could be reduced or cut entirely, so will the Minister tell us whether those forecasts were correct?</p>
	<p pid="b.114.3/6">The fundamental point about what has happened to the service, and about what risks happening to other high-speed services, is that there is a lack of vision and commitment from the Government on ensuring that high-speed train services are properly rolled out and implemented up and down the country. We need to hear from the Government precisely how they will fund an expansion of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.3/7">We believe that there is a case for setting up an infrastructure bank to raise funds for public transport schemes. We favour the idea of supporting local improvements, for which people often clamour, rather than the high-profile schemes. In a time of constrained budgets, we should look at the roads budget and take money from it to invest in small rail improvements, such as signalling changes at pinch points, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1599" name="Adam Holloway">the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Holloway)</phrase> mentioned. That can make a significant difference to local commuter services.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.3/8">We must hear something from the Minister on his vision of how to address the matter. It is clear from other Members' contributions that the concern is not a cheap trick being pushed a couple of weeks before the starting gun for the general election is fired. The matter has had a direct and significant impact on people, has worsened their quality of life and made their journey to and from work considerably more difficult. Therefore, we require a considered response from the Minister and clarity on how he will roll back some of the changes that have been made while maintaining the high-speed link, giving back to commuters the services they have lost after using them for many years, and ensuring that they have the required standard of service.</p>

	<p pid="b.115.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" name="Hugh Robertson">the Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson)</phrase> was surely right when he said that our hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" name="Roger Gale">the Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale)</phrase> is not only liked, but respected in his area. He put one of the most eloquent cases on behalf of constituents that I have had the pleasure to listen to in my short time as a Member. I, too, have been contacted about that issue by some of his constituents, as he will know, and by those of other Members in Kent served by that line, and about the concerns my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent raised about the other line.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.0/2">Having listened to the case put by my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet, I do not think that anyone could be anything other than utterly impressed by its strength. He started by saying that there were 1,500 reasons why the line needs improving and, with all due respect to him, at one point I thought that he was going to go through them all. His stop-by-stop tour of the misery line, including the stop in the constituency of the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1594" name="Paul Clark">the hon. Member for Gillingham (Paul Clark)</phrase>, was a powerful evocation of local people's concerns. One of the key roles of MPs, which we should never underestimate, is our ability to bring those concerns to the forefront in the House and in other places.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.0/3">My hon. Friend was also right to talk about what he considered to be the failures of consultation. In a letter he received on the consultation, the concerns of so many people about the introduction of the timetable were dismissed in a statement that simply acknowledged that some people would be disappointed. That might strike some as complacent, and others as extremely condescending. Indeed, it is a telling point that the managing director of Southeastern, Charles Horton, when my hon. Friend met him, was clear about where much of the blame was attached, and I want to address that point in a few moments. Clearly, Mr. Horton thought that the Minister's response that people were well served by the services in 2009 was not necessarily right and that, had he had the opportunity to do so, he would not necessarily have put that into his franchise. The failure of the specified franchises is at the heart of the matter we are debating today.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.0/4">My hon. Friend also quoted the Secretary of State, Lord Adonis, and was right that the message that the service is working successfully must cause a hollow laugh in his part of the country. Again, the operators are restricted from pursuing sensible timetabling and ending short trains. They must have the chance to look at exactly which stations might be better provided for at better times of the day. That is what needs to happen, rather than the huge over-specification of the timetable, which the Department for Transport has got itself into, as its franchising policy has failed and is failing. The move to longer franchises, which I recognise, will offer no reassurance unless it is accompanied by a move to less specified franchises.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.0/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent identified three concerns and also referred to the Adjournment debate, secured by our right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1877" name="John Stanley">the Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)</phrase>, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-06">6 January</phrase> on another train service in Kent. My hon. Friend was right to end his remarks by pointing out to the Minister that there is a genuine concern. It is not electioneering, but the genuine and honestly-felt concern of a huge number of people.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.0/6">Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1550" name="Gwyn Prosser">the hon. Member for Dover (Gwyn Prosser)</phrase>, I am in little doubt that the new high-speed trains that run on High Speed 1 represent a great leap forward for our railways. This country has waited a long time for high speed to come into operation, and it is clearly an achievement that it now is in operation. The UK has 68 miles of high-speed services, compared with 3,480 miles on the continent. The Minister knows that an incoming Conservative Government would address that, but we will also ensure that any development of the high-speed network is integrated with the classic network, that the cost of travel is affordable and that it is not just a premium network, and that it sustains economic growth. I suspect that several Members will be looking to the test tomorrow-maybe-when the Secretary of State might talk about high-speed rail and the development of the network in the country as the Government see it.</p>

	<p pid="b.117.0/1">The hon. Gentleman has just said that in the event of a Conservative Government he will ensure that high-speed rail is affordable. Would he explain to Members how he will do that?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.117.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1927" speakername="Stephen Hammond" colnum="117"  time="015:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0008.htm#10031063000550">
	<p pid="b.117.1/1">Absolutely. I would be delighted to explain that to the hon. Gentleman. The economics are simple. If one does the detailed financial modelling, as we have done, but as I understand his party has not done, one can take the average fare available and set it as the average fare available for high-speed rail and therefore say that that is the fare one would introduce. That is exactly what we have done in detailed financial modelling, which has enabled me to make that claim.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/2">The debate is not about the success or otherwise of high-speed rail, but about the failure of the Government's franchising policy. I cannot help but agree with my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet when he said that, while some of the people of Ashford and some parts of Kent might have gained as a result of the new services into St. Pancras, those in other parts are clearly losing out. The new timetable was drawn up to accommodate the high-speed services and has undoubtedly resulted in winners and losers. I am sure that the Minister will remember his comments in the Adjournment debate on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-06">6 January</phrase>, when he more or less dismissed the concerns of others. He stated that</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/3" class="indent">&quot;between 20 and 50 per cent. of the people...board and alight the trains at Ashford.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2010-01-06.79"><i>Official Report, </i>6 January 2010; Vol. 503, c. 79WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/4">He dismissed the concerns of the 50 to 80 per cent. of people who do not board or alight at Ashford.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/5">The winners and losers aspect was freely admitted to me by Southeastern, as it was to my hon. Friend. When the timetable was in draft form last summer, I wrote to the management of Southeastern and was told:</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/6" class="indent">&quot;I'm afraid that no timetable will please every passenger.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/7">That may be true, but to disadvantage so many passengers clearly cannot be right.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/8">It is clear that for those travelling to St. Pancras, the new high-speed services will greatly enhance the journey, but if one is accustomed to using the classic network, if one lives in other parts of Kent, or if one still needs to get to Cannon Street, Victoria or London Bridge, the new timetable, as my hon. Friends have pointed out so well, makes the commute worse. There are fewer trains on the classic lines in order to free up paths for the high-speed trains. What is more, fares across the whole network have risen to fund the cost of the high-speed link.</p>

	<p pid="b.118.2/1">I am trying to understand how the hon. Gentleman justifies the assertion that fares across Kent have risen in order to support the high-speed link.

	<p pid="b.118.3/1">The Minister says that it was generally accepted. Would he like to confirm that no part of the fare increase of RPI plus 3 went in any way to subsidise the cost of the new trains and the new high-speed link?</p>

	<p pid="b.118.4/1">We had better get this right for the record. It is not RPI plus 3 per cent. The Minister knows that and is being disingenuous. RPI plus 3 is an average for the whole of Kent. The increase on the Kent coast line has been way above RPI plus 3, as he knows.</p>

	<p pid="b.118.5/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that. I am sure that the Minister will want to deal with my question in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.5/2">The new timetable, which was designed to integrate the high-speed lines with the classic network, has clearly left several problems. We must not fall into the trap of assuming that nothing can be done, or that it is entirely Southeastern's fault. When I wrote to the company last summer, it replied that</p>
	<p pid="b.118.5/3" class="indent">&quot;the service pattern for the timetable was set by the Department for Transport.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.118.5/4">The main reason why Southeastern has been unable to respond to the needs of its customers is that its hands have been tied behind its back by the overly tight specifications of the franchise agreement, which was set out by the Department. I am delighted that the Government are accepting the need for longer franchises, but, as I said, longer franchises will not work unless they come with fewer specifications.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.5/5">That begs a question that the Minister may wish to come back to in his remarks: are officials in the Department still writing timetables? Conservatives want to see an end to the absurd practice of civil servants setting detailed timetables across the network. That cannot and should not be right.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.5/6">The Minister will remember that one of his many predecessors, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" name="Tom Harris">the hon. Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris)</phrase>, told this Chamber, and confirmed it in a written response, that there were 16 civil servants in the Department writing detailed timetables. The clear message from today's debate is that this is not a failure of high-speed rail but of the Government's franchising process. I certainly believe that the Department's role in franchising should be stripped back, and that the focus should be on overall policy decisions rather than what we see today, which is detailed intervention that so often leads to a diminution of the service for so many people.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.5/7">Today's debate presents us with a conundrum. We all want high-speed rail services, but we do not want them at the expense of classic services. The future success of the high-speed network in this country will depend on the ability to ensure that it does what it should do, which is to create extra capacity for many people.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.5/8">This debate also touches on rolling stock, which so often causes constraints in providing the service that so many people require. I would be delighted if the Minister would address the questions about rolling stock that I have asked him in two previous debates, which he will remember. Indeed, when does he expect a more detailed rolling stock plan to be produced?</p>
	<p pid="b.118.5/9">I look forward to the Minister's response, and to his saying that he accepts that this is a real and genuine issue, and that the concerns raised by my hon. Friends the Members for North Thanet and for Faversham and Mid-Kent are not a closed book. I hope that he will tell us that operators need to be given greater freedom to react to the demands of their customers. I am convinced that, if he is prepared to accept that, the problems that my hon. Friends have so eloquently set out this afternoon can be addressed.</p>

	<p pid="b.119.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon, Mr. Benton. It would be normal for me to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" name="Roger Gale">the hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale)</phrase> on securing this debate on rail services to and from the north Kent coast, and I recognise that his contribution was forceful. The contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" name="Hugh Robertson">the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson)</phrase> was thoughtful, that of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1550" name="Gwyn Prosser">the Member for Dover (Gwyn Prosser)</phrase> was well focused, that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" name="Tom Brake">the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase> was somewhat tangential, and that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1927" name="Stephen Hammond">the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond)</phrase> was, as usual, better informed than a contribution from the shadow Secretary of State for Transport would have been. If I am unable to deal with any of the issues that have been raised, I will ensure that I write to hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/2">I shall start by outlining some of the benefits that have been and will be derived from high-speed services in Kent. The introduction of such services has facilitated a number of journey time improvements across the network for existing users who wish to take advantage of them. In addition, high-speed services will create new markets for and in Kent, and will contribute to the regeneration of the area. That will be achieved, in part, by much greater connectivity between Kent and areas such as the docklands, the midlands and the north of England. The current timetable started on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-13">13 December 2009</phrase>. It represents the biggest change to train services in the area for more than 50 years. It offers integrated main line, metro and high-speed services across Kent, south-east London and East Sussex, and offers more choice to people who live or work in Kent or visit the area.</p>

	<p pid="b.119.1/1">I do not want to disrupt the Minister too much early on but, in a sense, he has put his finger on the problem. He just said that the great advantage is the connectivity that the service offers people who live in east Kent, in Faversham or in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet. If one thinks that through, the problem is that anyone who works in the west end or the City and decides to move out of London-they get to that stage in life and often end up in the areas that two of us represent-does not want connectivity to St. Pancras. Only a tiny proportion of rail traffic goes from Faversham or North Thanet up to St. Pancras, then uses the connections to the north. What such people want is a good service that takes them from their place of work, which is typically in the west end or the City, back home at night and up again the next morning. To predicate all of this on connectivity to the north of London is to grab the wrong issue.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.120.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1653" speakername="Chris Mole" colnum="120"  time="015:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0009.htm#10031063000559">
	<p pid="b.120.0/1">The hon. Gentleman has gone to the heart of the concern. Of course, if one focuses only on commuters, one will perhaps take only one set of solutions from the opportunities that arise from reviewing the timetable. I was a regular commuter from Northampton to Canterbury at one time, and my journey involved several train changes. People have described to me some of the journeys that they now make, and they take advantage of being able to change at St. Pancras. The point was made on a number of occasions about people transferring from St. Pancras to the City. That may not be the best journey choice for someone who has been travelling on the high-speed line; they have an opportunity to change at Stratford International, then take a seven-minute ride into the City, which may be a better choice.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.0/2">The timetable was developed following extensive research and feedback from stakeholders and the public over several years. I remind the hon. Member for Wimbledon that, despite his protestations, timetables are not written by the Department. Specifications cover the number of station stops, the frequency of trains and the times of the first and last services. May I point out to him the processes that the east coast main line services are undergoing? The Office of the Rail Regulator has developed the outline, and industry interests and the Department have engaged in an iterative process in defining the final timetable. Saying that the Department writes the timetable is not strictly correct.</p>

	<p pid="b.120.1/1">I am delighted to hear about the new iterative process. Is that a new process or was the Minister's predecessor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" name="Tom Harris">the hon. Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris)</phrase>, mistaken in his view that the Department wrote timetables?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.120.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1653" speakername="Chris Mole" colnum="120"  time="015:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0009.htm#10031063000561">
	<p pid="b.120.2/1">At the end of the day, when the Department lets a franchise, it lets a franchise associated with a timetable, so I suppose one could say that that gives it a certain degree of definition, but the process has always been as described. The hon. Gentleman made frequent reference to 16 people writing timetables. People may be engaged in writing timetables as part of their role, but to suggest that there are 16 people sitting around doing nothing but writing timetables is perhaps disingenuous.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.2/2">As I was saying, consultations took place as far back as 2003 and 2004 to determine the minimum service level required to meet current and future demand in the region. The Strategic Rail Authority published the findings from that consultation in January 2005 in the integrated Kent franchise stakeholder briefing document. The document's objectives require potential franchisees to develop and deliver a financially and operationally robust strategy; deliver a safe and reliable high-quality service for customers; deliver value-for-money services; support the development of the Government's communities plan in the south-east to meet the transport needs of defined areas and deliver accurate information on services and future demand to enable the development of the franchise during its term and for the next refranchising of the integrated Kent franchise.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.2/3">The franchise was awarded to Southeastern in 2006. Since then, Southeastern has undertaken further extensive consultation with local stakeholders as it has developed the detailed timetable required to meet the specification. Southeastern has also undertaken extensive market research on travel patterns and preferences across its network. That study looked at demand for services now and in the future. It is important to set out exactly what services are available for customers travelling along the Kent coast. The December 2009 timetable specifies services along the Kent coast to London Cannon Street, London Victoria, London Bridge and London St. Pancras stations, so services operate to four London terminal stations, whereas most other train operators serve only one or, if they are lucky, two London terminal stations.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.2/4">As a result of the new timetable, there are fewer services to London Bridge and Cannon Street in the early morning and late evening, and fewer services to London Victoria during peak times. However, with the introduction of high-speed services, the overall number of trains is broadly the same as it was before the new timetable was introduced. That means that Southeastern customers along the Kent coast now enjoy unparalleled access to and from London and have a fantastic number of journey options.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.2/5">The introduction of high-speed services has required a restructuring of the service patterns on the Southeastern network to account for introducing services to London St. Pancras. The changes are founded on the premise of developing a better timetable based on meeting customer demand and providing greater choice in stations served. For example, commuters can, if they wish, choose to travel to St. Pancras, which offers, as I suggested, excellent connections to many parts of London.</p>

	<p pid="b.121.0/1">The Minister reading a prepared script quickly will not make any difference to the people we have been talking about for the past hour. They do not want to go to St. Pancras. A journey is from the point at which someone leaves home to the point at which they arrive where they want to be, whether that is back home or their place of work. If he adds the time that it takes to get from St. Pancras to virtually anywhere that anybody wants to be, he will find that it is a longer journey at more expense. He cannot gainsay that. I have the details from the Department with me. It is not improved choice; it is nonsense.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-03-10b.121.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1653" speakername="Chris Mole" colnum="121"  time="015:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100310/halltext/100310h0009.htm#10031063000563">
	<p pid="b.121.1/1">The hon. Gentleman has his views-others beg to differ.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.1/2">It is important to recognise that introducing these services has significantly reduced journey times to several parts of Kent and, while the hon. Gentleman has made the argument that journey time-savings for his constituents are not significant, the Department feels that a typical high-speed journey time of 1 hour and 31 minutes from Margate to St. Pancras during the morning peak represents a significant time saving for travel to London. It represents an approximate time-saving of 15 to 25 minutes on main line services to London Cannon Street and London Victoria stations.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.1/3">It is recognised that journeys on main line services along the Kent coast generally take longer than they did before the introduction of the new timetable. That is because they call at more stations, and that is based on the desire to improve choice for customers. In addition to stops at those new stations, all destinations scheduled before December continue to be served.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.1/4">I heard the concerns of the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent about Selling, which I will certainly take on board and consider, as well as his concerns about the stabling of class 395 trains at Faversham. Although I am sure that he is engaging with his local authority over his concerns about noise, I will commit to talking to Southeastern because the concerns are obviously real and immediate for his constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.1/5">I am aware that there has been a performance problem on the Southeastern network since the end of December 2009. That has been caused principally by the adverse weather conditions and unreliable infrastructure. Having said that, on a number of days, over 93 per cent. of trains arrived on time. It is important to state that poor performance on the Southeastern network since the introduction of the December 2009 timetable is not a result of the introduction of the high-speed service.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.1/6">Since the introduction of the Southeastern franchise in April 2006, performance on the Southeastern network has improved markedly. At the end of rail industry period 9, from <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-15">15 November</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-12">12 December 2009</phrase>, Southeastern achieved a public performance measure moving annual average score of 91.1 per cent. That figure has dropped since the new timetable was introduced but, as has been mentioned, that is due to adverse weather conditions and infrastructure reliability problems. The level of investment that Southeastern has implemented since the commencement of its franchise in April 2006, with almost &#163;700 million invested in new rolling stock and infrastructural improvements, reflects the general improvement in performance on the Southeastern network.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.1/7">It has been suggested that there is little demand for high-speed services and the requirement to call at St. Pancras. It has also been claimed that the majority of people who use Kent coastal services wish to travel to London Cannon Street and London Victoria stations. Since the commencement of its franchise in April 2006, Southeastern has undertaken extensive market research into travel patterns and preferences across its network. That research indicated that St. Pancras was an attractive destination for people in Kent, and that the improved journey times resulting from the introduction of high-speed services across Kent would lead to a dramatically different demand for rail services in Kent. Southeastern's research confirmed that the specification for the franchise was correct and that a number off-peak leisure markets could be developed as a result of the introduction of the high-speed service.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.1/8">The standard forecast modelling tools used in the rail industry suggest that it generally takes some years for a new market to reach its full potential. The Department's view is that it is far too early to judge the merits of the recently introduced high-speed services to St. Pancras. That is not meant to imply that the service is not being monitored rigorously, but it does mean that snap judgements will not be made about the success of the new services.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.1/9">The argument has also been made that customers from the constituency of the hon. Member for North Thanet are not using the high-speed service. Information provided by Southeastern indicates that in the four-week period between <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-11">11 January 2010</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-06">6 February 2010</phrase>, one in three journeys from his constituency took place on high-speed services, which represents a good take-up rate during the short period for which the service has been operating. In conclusion, the Department, train operators and other stakeholders have worked hard to deliver high-speed trains to Kent successfully. Inevitably, there have been changes to the timetable affecting other services, but it is early days to judge the final pattern of usage and satisfaction in Kent.</p>

	<p pid="b.124.1/1">I am grateful to have secured this debate, Mr. Benton, and I am pleased to see the Minister in attendance. A few weeks ago, when travelling from my constituency to London, I noticed something interesting at Paddington tube station, and other tube stations after that. It was a picture of a Lewis chessman on a poster. It was a welcome sight, but the caption said, &quot;AD 1150-1200&quot; and &quot;Norway&quot;. I was stunned, because there was no mention of the Isle of Lewis. It was as if the connection with Lewis had been airbrushed from history.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.1/2">The chessmen are expertly crafted examples from the Viking civilisation in my constituency. We know two historical facts about them. They were made from walrus ivory, and they were found in Lewis in 1831. The director of the British Museum informed me that most scholars believe that the chessmen were crafted in Norway, because a piece of a queen that was found in Trondheim resembled the Lewis chessmen. That does not change the fact that they were found in, and are important to my constituency, and they could have been manufactured in Lewis, Ireland or elsewhere in the area of Viking civilisation and then traded. The only geographical location linked to the chess pieces is the Isle of Lewis, where they were buried for hundreds of years.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.1/3">I would love to know what incontrovertible evidence the British Museum has to assert in its poster campaign that Norway was the place of origin of the Lewis chess pieces. The museum's defence in <i>The Times</i><i></i>was that the Hebrides were then under the rule of a Norwegian king. However, when England was under French rule, it was not France. Is airbrushing the future of historical objects found in the United Kingdom and retained by the British Museum? There are other places where historical objects have been deleted from history. Is that what the people of the midlands should expect for its magnificent Staffordshire hoard? I certainly hope not.</p>

	<p pid="b.124.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. We talk about the Elgin marbles and so on, but an artefact from north Wales-a famous early Welsh gold cape-is in the British Museum and will not be released back to Wales. Such artefacts are part of our collective national memory. They are important, and should be returned.</p>

	<p pid="b.124.3/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. The matter affects not just the Outer Hebrides, Scotland or Wales, but England. Perhaps in time the museum will have a more enlightened understanding. Surely it is best if historical artefacts are retained in the area where they are found. Whether by Act of Parliament or an alteration in museum policy, something must change because what made sense in the 19th century may now be a dated approach. Why must everything be in London? It seems to be historical centralisation and imperialism.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/2">Since their sale to the British Museum in 1831 for &#163;30, the chessmen were lent to the islands in 1995, and are expected to return in 2011. When visitors arrive at Stornoway by ferry or plane, they are greeted at the airport and the ferry terminal by huge wooden figures modelled on the chessmen, such is our pride in them. Why the British Museum has a colonial attitude of keeping artefacts that belong to another place and another people is beyond me.</p>

	<p pid="b.125.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate. He referred to people arriving at the airport, and it strikes me that some of them will be tourists. Does he think the boost to tourism of having the Lewis chessmen in Lewis would be greater than the loss to tourism in London from not having them? The effect would be much greater in Lewis, and London could probably cope without devastation if it lost such a high-profile item.</p>

	<p pid="b.125.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point, and it is obvious that Lewis is bringing culture to London. London could live without the chessmen, but the effect on Lewis would be immeasurable. I am impressed that the Kelvingrove museum in Glasgow returned a ghost dance shirt belonging to the Oglala Sioux after their repeated attempts to have it repatriated.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.1/2">The British Museum holds 82 of the 93 chess pieces in London, leaving only 11 for Scotland and none for the Isle of Lewis. Such is the museum's perceived intransigence that we have none locally, a minimal number in our national capital, Edinburgh, and the majority in the state capital, London. In Lewis, they would be in their own cultural and historic setting. In Lewis, they would be a year-round tourist attraction to add to the splendid scenery of the Hebrides, which is arguably a more weather-dependent asset.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.1/3">The museum's high-handed attitude does not end with the chessmen. We have already heard about artefacts from Wales being held in London. The Fishpool hoard is not in Ravenshead; the 8,500 pieces of the Cuerdale hoard are not in Lancashire; and the Hoxne hoard is not in Suffolk. The arguments for the chessmen being held in Lewis have been stated time and again. Bonnie Greer, deputy chair of the board of trustees of the Museum said:</p>
	<p pid="b.125.1/4" class="indent">&quot;As far as I'm concerned on a personal level, they&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="b.125.1/5">the chessmen-</p>
	<p pid="b.125.1/6" class="indent">&quot;will always remain at the British Museum.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.125.1/7">As a Hebridean defending our indigenous rights, I did not expect the stiletto of Bonnie Greer to trample all over our hopes. I am sure that she did not want to seem like a queen from a position of power, disregarding pawns in a game of machismo.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.1/8">The Minister asserted in <i>The Scotsman</i> on the <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-30">30 January 2008</phrase> that the chessmen's home is in London &quot;Today and forever&quot;. That was a bold statement, and disappointing from a Labour Government-<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I hope that that telephone call is from the British Museum with news that it is listening to our debate, and that the chessmen will go to Lewis.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.1/9">Under section 5(1) of the British Museum Act 1963, which was made in this place, the British Museum may not sell items that are believed to have been crafted before 1850, but under section 4 of the same act it is allowed to lend pieces of the collection. Perhaps it could do so permanently if there is no change in the law. Had the hand of fate turned up those pieces to daylight in 1931 or 2001 rather than 1831, I do not believe that our cultural heritage would have been sold for &#163;30-a veritable 30 pieces of silver.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.1/10">Today, in more enlightened times, the museum has been offered a good deal by the local council, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar. Its chief executive, Malcolm Burr, said that the chessmen could be housed in the museum nan Eilean Siar, and that finance for their security would not be a problem. He also suggested that the British Museum could open up an extension to its main campus in London in the museum nan Eilean Siar itself. This is just one idea to bring at least some of the chessmen back to their home.</p>

	<p pid="b.126.0/1">The hon.

	<p pid="b.126.3/1">Ultimately, I am looking for any mechanism whatsoever to get the chess pieces back to Lewis. From correspondence that we have had, the chief executive of Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, the local council, seems confident that it could cope with that. We could call the exhibition the British Museum or any other name, just as long as we get the chess pieces back to their natural home. Ideally, we want all the pieces, but we are ready to compromise in the beginning. That is just one of many ideas, and as I have said, to start with we could have a third of the pieces in the Outer Hebrides, a third in Edinburgh and a third in London.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.3/2">Nearly 220,000 people visited my islands last year, and, with the introduction of the road equivalent tariff, it has never been easier to get to the Outer Hebrides. If you have any spare time this summer, Mr. Benton, I suggest that a visit to the Isle of Lewis might be well worth while. It could then be continued downwards through the Isle of Harris, North Uist, Benbecula, South Uist and Barra. Who knows, perhaps if you do that in a few years' time, you will be able to see the Lewis chessmen.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.3/3">The chessmen would be a great draw. Perhaps there are more historical artefacts to be found. Perhaps in future we might see grandmasters playing chess with the Lewis chess pieces in Stornoway, or certainly have them placed in the vicinity of such a match.</p>

	<p pid="b.127.0/1">As ever, my hon. Friend makes his case persuasively, which contrasts with the somewhat intransigent attitude hitherto of the British Museum. However, there is a general principle at stake, which is that artefacts that have a particular significance to a place, either culturally or historically, need to be returned to their place of origin. I cite the example of the so-called Lichfield gospels, which are currently in Lichfield cathedral. They are actually the Llandeilo gospels, which were produced in Wales in the eighth century and contain the earliest example of written Welsh. It is absolutely scandalous that the only gospels to have survived from Wales should be in an English cathedral. They should be taken home to my constituency.</p>

	<p pid="b.127.1/1">As I have learned after being in this House for five years, the word of Plaid Cymru can often be taken as gospel. This time, a case is being made for the gospel.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.1/2">My point is that we are willing to work hard to bring some, if not all, these historical artefacts back to their place of origin-the place where they were found. We are not an impediment to change. Perhaps in some ways we need a knight in shining ivory to help us, the underdogs, against the impediments of the British Museum.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.1/3">As I am sure the Minister knows, when the Staffordshire hoard was on display in Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent, over 80,000 people queued for upwards of three hours to view it in those two different places. Put simply, the economic boon that such historical objects could generate is vast. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1485" name="Adam Price">the Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price)</phrase> said, we are asking for the opportunity to allow people to experience the chessmen in the place that they came from.</p>

	<p pid="b.127.2/1">Hon. Members have mentioned the Staffordshire hoard and Lichfield cathedral, and both of those are close to my Staffordshire constituency. I have considerable sympathy with the idea that there should be some return, perhaps on the basis of a loan. In the enlightened view taken by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2004" name="Angus MacNeil">the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr. MacNeil)</phrase>, there could be a re-siting under the auspices of the British Museum itself. The situation seems extraordinary, and there should be some recognition and an opportunity for people who come from a specific area to have access to artefacts in the way that the hon. Gentleman describes. There are similar arguments across Europe. However, I am not quite sure how to get that into the framework of the British Museum Act 1963.</p>

As I said, we are asking for people to have the opportunity to experience the chessmen in the place where they came from. Therefore, I reiterate my request to move the chessmen permanently-under whatever label is chosen to describe that movement-back to the Outer Hebrides.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.3/2">Historical objects are not just pieces of art, gold or jewellery, but gateways to the past. Such gateways are accentuated by the landscape, scenery and the society that created them. Perhaps such a move will help people connect in a better way with the chessmen and the civilisation that produced them if they are viewed in Lewis, rather than in a glass case in the middle of London.</p>

Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr. MacNeil)</phrase> on securing this opportunity for us to debate the repatriation of historical objects yet again. He knows my views, because I have expressed them a number of times in the Scottish press.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.0/2">I will start by saying something about the objects in our museums, the importance of national collections, and the pleasure and knowledge that they bring to us all. Museums collect and display the greatest achievements of humankind. However, they are not just a visual record of our past. Modern museums are now worldwide centres of learning and interpretation, enabling us to make sense of what our ancestors experienced, challenging our perceptions and changing the way we look at the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.0/3">Our national museums are centres of excellence and scholarship and part of a wider international web of information sharing-a great collection in most of our great museums. It is not about promoting nationalism; the focus is on promoting an understanding of our shared past so that we can better deal with the present and tackle the problems of the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.0/4">As the hon. Gentleman knows, I profoundly disagree with the underlying premise of his argument that culture is to be enjoyed only by the nation most closely identified with it. Indeed, it is through understanding each other's cultures and sharing the fine artefacts, great literature and important works of art that are produced by individuals in countries across the world, that we start building a shared identity, tolerant understanding, and all those things that are so essential for peace and cohesion throughout the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.0/5">Furthermore, if beautiful artefacts are created, they should be enjoyed as widely as possible, not just in one nation. They do not enhance the lives of just one community, but of all of us in all our communities. The advent of digitisation enables us to share more widely the wonderful treasures that we are privileged to enjoy in our great national museums.</p>

	<p pid="b.128.1/1">I completely agree with the point of sharing culture widely and seeing artefacts and so on. However, does the Minister accept that historically, the sharing has not been very even? Perhaps those countries that used to have an empire, or were powerful for whatever reason, have tended to suck-in worldwide artefacts and such things. I accept that in Glasgow that was the case. We felt that the shirt that was mentioned earlier should go back to North America, as that is where it would be better placed, and I give respect to Glasgow city council for that.</p>

	<p pid="b.129.0/1">If the hon. Gentleman is arguing about how we came to have historical connections in one place, I have sympathy with his argument. However, things are where they are, and if we wish them to be shared, the British Museum has an excellent, first-class record in both collaboration and giving out loans. The British Museum is a worldwide brand in the way that it shows its artefacts online. There are ways of sharing that do not necessarily reside in ownership. I think that the British Museum excels in its record of trying to ensure that it shares its wonders with as wide an audience as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/2">The British Museum was one of the first institutions in this country to be named &quot;British&quot;, but its objective is to have collections representing the whole world under its roof, so as to enable everyone to enjoy its experiences which, of course, are free of charge. The museum is what so many people come to London to see. The First Emperor exhibition was the biggest exhibition mounted by the British Museum since that of Tutankhamun in 1972 and it enjoyed 850,000 visitors. The British Museum is now more popular than Blackpool pleasure beach in attracting people to come here. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Hon. Members may not think so, but Blackpool is still an iconic and important attraction. Despite the difficulties it faces, Blackpool is still one of the most popular tourist destinations. The resources put into Blackpool by the Government have helped to restore it to its previous great strength as a tourist destination.</p>

	<p pid="b.129.2/1">The British Museum has made just such loan arrangements with a number of Scottish museums and institutions-I want to come to that, so I had better move on-so that exhibits can form a coherent part of the story that the British Museum tells of the history of the world and yet be enjoyed by the residents of Scotland.

	<p pid="b.129.4/1">Although I respect the hon. Gentleman's views, he perhaps does not appreciate my argument, which is that a coherent story about the history of the world is being told within the British Museum.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.4/2">As the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar knows, a long-standing principle in the UK supported by successive Governments is that politicians do not interfere in the management of museum collections. I hope that all hon. Members participating in today's debate continue to support the arm's length principle, which means that museum trustees are responsible for managing the collections in their care. The Government have great faith in their ability. Changing that principle would be a dangerous and retrograde move, allowing cultural and artistic decisions to be determined by political views and prejudices.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.4/3">Museum trustees have a statutory duty to protect the nation's collections. Section 3 of the British Museum Act 1963 imposes a duty on the trustees of the British Museum:</p>
	<p pid="b.129.4/4" class="indent">&quot;to keep the objects comprised in the collections of the Museum within the authorised repositories of the Museum, except in so far as they may consider it expedient to remove them temporarily for any purpose connected with the administration of the Museum and the care of its collections.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.129.4/5">The trustees of our national collections are thus legally responsible for their collections. Leaving the question of whether an object should be de-accessioned to the trustees' discretion is consistent with those legal principles.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.4/6">A further issue is that the legal position on restitution is that the British Museum Act prevents the museum from removing objects from its collections. Other national museums have similar statutory restrictions. We have looked at whether it would be appropriate to lift those statutory restrictions and under what circumstances. As hon. Members probably know, we have done so in two instances: the law was changed in 2005 to allow nine named national museums to de-accession human remains if they considered it appropriate to do so; and we had the Holocaust (Return of Cultural Objects) Act 2009, which allows 17 national collections to return items lost or stolen during the Nazi era following a recommendation by the Spoliation Advisory Panel. The latter was a private Member's Bill, but the Government considered that allowing restitution to take place in those specific circumstances was supported by a strong moral case.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.4/7">I now want to deal with the particular issues raised by the Lewis chessmen. As the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar knows, my views are clear. However, as my officials always remind me, decisions relating to the Lewis chessmen and other objects in the collection of the British Museum are a matter for the British Museum trustees and not for me as a politician.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.4/8">I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider my next point. Nowadays, most scholars who have examined the chessmen generally agree that the most likely place of manufacture was Trondheim in Norway. The closest stylistic links for the decoration of the chessmen are to be found in the art and architecture of 12th century Trondheim and Scandinavia. In the 19th century, part of a queen, similar in style to the Lewis pieces, was discovered in Trondheim. Dr. David Caldwell, who is the keeper of Scotland and Europe at the National Museum of Scotland, visited Lewis recently with a team of researchers in preparation for the touring exhibition of the chessmen in 2011. He said publicly:</p>
	<p pid="b.129.4/9" class="indent">&quot;We certainly...believe the pieces are Scandinavian in origin, perhaps made in a workshop by several masters in a city like Trondheim.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.130.0/1">On that analogy, the Minister might be arguing that the Bayeux tapestry should be returned to the United Kingdom on the grounds that it was made by nuns in England-so we are told.

	<p pid="b.131.0/1">I do not agree at all, but I was dealing with a separate argument about a particular historical link based on where the Lewis chessmen were made. All I am saying is that most of those with a much greater knowledge than I have on the origins of the chessmen think that the pieces did not originate in Lewis but in Norway. I hold by my main argument that the British Museum contains, in its artefacts, the history of Britain and the world. As such, it is important that the whole collection should be held together and not pulled apart.</p>

	<p pid="b.131.3/1">Is such displacement of chessmen recognition, in many ways, of the decline of the economy of Trondheim in that part of the middle ages? After all, that part of Scotland has Scandinavian connections. Most importantly, would the Minister accept the rationality of arguing for the exceptional support for the local economy if people were travelling to see the chessmen? Leaving aside issues of origin and nationality, would that not be a strong argument for at least some of the pieces to be placed in Lewis?</p>

	<p pid="b.131.4/1">The chessmen legally came into the possession of the British Museum. That is an important point. They form a key part of the British Museum collection-hence they were used recently in the radio programme &quot;A History of the World in 100 Objects&quot;. The chessmen are important. Would they be a tourist attraction if relocated? Probably, yes, but that is dealt with sensitively by the British Museum through its loans policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.4/2">In the minute that I have left, I emphasise that the British Museum has close relations with National Museums Scotland and the National Galleries of Scotland, frequently lending material to Edinburgh. I am delighted that, in 2010 and 2011, the British Museum will be partnering National Museums Scotland in a Scotland-wide tour of the chessmen, supported by the Scottish Government. Twenty-four pieces from the British Museum will join six from the Edinburgh collections to be seen in four venues in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.4/3">I hope that the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar will continue to work with the British Museum in the interests of the people in his constituency, to ensure co-operation between the British Museum and museums in Scotland, so that the wonderful Lewis chessmen can be enjoyed by all.</p>

	<p pid="b.132.1/1">This debate is on a subject that most of us know as the Robin Hood tax, but as we have to use parliamentary language it has been called something else. I have some news hot off the press that even you, Mr. Benton, may not be aware of. Less than an hour ago, the European Parliament voted 536 to 80 in support of a Robin Hood tax-an international finance tax. I think that we would all welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.1/2">I am particularly pleased to open this debate because, being born and bred in Nottingham and being one of the city's representatives in Parliament, I have a particular connection to a Robin Hood tax. The consensus building for such a tax is so remarkable that it even has the active support of the sheriff of Nottingham. I hope that the Government will be a little more sympathetic today to everything to do with Robin Hood than was the case in the days of King John, but the omens are good. At last year's G20 summit in Pittsburgh, the Prime Minister called for serious consideration to be given to a financial transaction tax. Momentum is gathering around the world. From Europe to Japan, Finance Ministers from the world's leading economies have started to back such a tax.</p>

	<p pid="b.132.2/1">My hon. Friend said that there is consensus. I quickly checked the early-day motion in support of a Robin Hood tax before coming to the Chamber, and I noted that of the 97 signatories only two were Conservative Members. Does my hon. Friend agree that that may have something to do with the fact that the Electoral Commission's register of donations shows that so much comes from investment bankers and venture capitalists, including &#163;50,000 to my opponents. Who does he think Conservative candidates and MPs will represent-the people supporting the tax or those supporting the bankers?</p>

	<p pid="b.132.7/1">We do not want support for this tax to come and go. Something so significant has to be set up and needs to be kept in existence; it cannot be done in a few weeks or by one Government. I strongly hope that it will be the property not only of all parties but above all-this would be one of its strengths-the property of the public. If the money that we hope to raise is to be spent in the right way, it must have public ownership in the broadest sense, so that the public can hold the Government to account. We do not want to invent a new tax only for additionality to take away money that the Government would already have spent and use the Robin Hood tax to fill the gap.</p>

	<p pid="b.133.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on taking this campaign forward. On the question of how the money could be spent, earlier this afternoon, the Environmental Audit Committee raised the matter of the income from such a tax, saying that among other things, it could be used to help tackle deforestation as part of our efforts against climate change, or to help the economies of developing countries. Those would be two uses of the proceeds from such a tax.</p>

	<p pid="b.133.1/1">We do not want to spend the money before we have it. None the less, it is important to define some things relatively early. We are very much still at the beginning, but we need to settle soon those things that could command broad public support both globally-the sort of things mentioned by my hon. Friend-and internally, so that a number of key issues can be seen to develop.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.1/2">I am probably well known for talking about early intervention, and the need to help babies, children and young people to develop their social and emotional potential. That will take a generation to develop. If the money is tied to a long-term initiative such as an international financial transactions tax, over decades we will see the development of something positive. In the global sphere, deforestation would fall very much into that category.</p>

	<p pid="b.133.2/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend, my colleague from Robin Hood land, for giving way. Does he agree that it is essential that any such proposal should be adopted on a global basis, because the money would otherwise simply flee to those areas that do not provide it? I therefore welcome the fact that the Government, particularly the Prime Minister, have been taking it forward, and that there has been a measure of success in securing interest from the European Union and the United States in such an initiative.</p>

	<p pid="b.133.3/1">It is important that the objective of such a tax is international, as there is always the possibility that people could move money, or move the base where they make their transactions. However, we have to start somewhere. We cannot suddenly say that tomorrow it will be global. Someone has to make the move; someone has to show leadership.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.3/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1462" name="Nick Palmer">the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer)</phrase> was right about the Prime Minister raising this issue early at the Pittsburgh summit last year, and I hope that this Parliament, too, will exercise such leadership. If we do achieve a cross-party effort, I believe that many others will quickly follow. It is one of those things about which people will say, &quot;Why didn't we do this a long time ago?&quot; It will raise large amounts of money and it will cost a minuscule, virtually invisible, percentage of the take on transactions around the globe. One figure mentioned is 0.005 per cent-that is five thousandths of 1 per cent. Because the take is so small and the consequences so large, if we in this country can show leadership I have a feeling that it will quickly become international.</p>

	<p pid="b.134.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point, but at the beginning of this process, we should be full of excitement and optimism about what something like a Robin Hood tax, if we could make it work, could do and what it could generate and mean reputationally. If we consider the economic crisis over the past couple of years, we can see that politicians and bankers have probably not covered themselves in glory. It is incumbent on both classes of people to look more imaginatively at how we can raise money, not least for the causes that interest us both internationally and at home. Politicians should use their imagination and work with the bankers, who bear some responsibility for where our economy lies at the moment. By working on something that has such high-level impact and public support and small rates of requesting taxation levels-0.005 per cent. of 1 per cent.-we could, amazingly, go some way towards restoring our reputations.</p>

	<p pid="b.134.4/1">I do not want to cast aspersions on such a great idea, but is the hon. Gentleman aware that there is some doubt about Robin Hood's role as expressed in a recent historical survey? In fact, he was engaged in loaning money rather than taking it. Having said that, does the hon. Gentleman accept that there is a problem in taking money on a treaty footing, then not knowing who is responsible for the expenditure of that money and for the accountability that is necessary to ensure that it is spent properly?</p>

	<p pid="b.134.5/1">My hon. Friend-if I may call him that-raises several good points and one total lying falsehood. I have lots of other unparliamentary expressions about his account of Robin Hood. One thing that is not in dispute, however, is Nottingham castle, which still exists. There is also a sheriff of Nottingham and none but the most misguided could possibly doubt the fact that there lived in Sherwood forest someone who took from the rich and gave to the poor. The proposal before us is not so extreme. I am talking about assisting bankers to recover their reputation at a tiny, virtually imperceptible, level of taxation so that they can be seen to be not merely exploiting the financial system but putting in some social good, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.5/2">On the more serious point that has just been made, much work still needs to be done. We are at the beginning of a very long campaign, and I am sure that the issues raised need to be tackled and explained clearly. We are on the way to doing that. Given that the Prime Minister has strongly supported such a scheme, I want to ask my hon. Friend the Minister what work, research and analysis the Treasury is doing to assess whether a Robin Hood tax is workable? The Prime Minister does not throw out such phrases in front of the G20 willy-nilly. He clearly has a wish to see this proposal thought through very carefully, and I would like to know quite specifically from my hon. Friend what the Treasury is doing about it. He may not be able to answer this next question, but will we be in a position to float the idea at the Dispatch Box in the Budget, which I understand is about two weeks away? Can we at least say that the idea is being considered seriously, as we would expect of any announcement by the Prime Minister?</p>

He talked about politicians using their imagination, but is it not time for bankers to use theirs?

	<p pid="b.135.3/1">My hon. Friend pulled together the parliamentary aspect of the Robin Hood campaign. He more than anyone knows that this is a very broad coalition that includes not just the obvious figureheads from the world of entertainment, theatre and celebrity but hard-working third sector organisations such as Barnado's, Friends of the Earth, Oxfam and many, many others. On the point that he raises, there needs to be a new social contract between bankers, on the one hand, and the rest of society. We will need to have international flows of currency-they are absolutely enormous and dwarf the GDP of every country in the world-but some of that can be used for purposes that benefit the whole world and individual nations. Somehow it is incumbent on those in international finance and banking to say, &quot;We cannot go on as we were. We need to restore our reputation and we want to be part of the family.&quot; Perhaps this scheme is one way in which they, with all their financial expertise, can move things forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.3/2">I had a speech, but I have given way many times to demonstrate the support and the interest on the issue throughout the House. It is probably more important to demonstrate that than it is for me to put on record some of the key points of the campaign. Those points are available on the Robin Hood tax website, and I ask all those present who are missing out on my gems to access the website and see some of the basic planks of the campaign and the answers to many of those frequently asked questions.</p>

	<p pid="b.136.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for securing this debate. He has been as generous as he possibly can be to the banks and financial institutions. At the end of the day, it should be recognised that they bear responsibility for causing the recession, the economic effects of which are felt by constituencies such as his and mine. I refer here to all those who have lost their jobs and suffered greatly. It is clear that the financial institutions, which have an important role to play in the economy by providing lots of jobs, should make good what they have done wrong. However, why should we have to have a campaign to bring this to their attention? Should they not come to us and say, &quot;We agree that we should be doing this. It is the right, moral thing to do&quot;? Does my hon. Friend not agree that that is the case? They should come in themselves and talk about putting such a scheme in place .</p>

	<p pid="b.136.1/1">The campaign itself-I do not speak for the campaign-is a very broad coalition, and it would welcome with open arms the expertise of bankers and of people involved in international finance. It should invite them in to help find ways forward, to answer some of those technical questions and, as I mentioned earlier, to salvage some reputational status, which has been massively diminished over recent years.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.1/2">I must sit down and let the Minister respond and put the Government's view on record. I have just a couple more things to say. We are aware of the difficulty of starting off such a scheme and starting in one country, but it has to start somewhere and, therefore, perhaps we, with the leadership of our Prime Minister, can do that. Secondly, some people have raised moral reservations about making money from something that some may regard as not being of the highest international standard. If that were the case, we would never raise anything from tobacco or alcohol, and we should consider this as being in the same pot as those things. Financial institutions' trade across exchanges goes on, and we should be taking a tiny slice of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.1/3">I have a lot more to say, but it is probably fairer if I sit down. Many Members are here today, and many more could not come. There is great interest in the issue. The campaign proper is kicking off now with fascinating materials, including clips shown in cinemas and elsewhere. Celebrities have yet to enter the field to raise its profile, but I think that it will be a big issue, like Live Aid or Make Poverty History. All parties should get involved on a non-partisan basis to make it work globally and domestically. I hope that the Minister has listened to colleagues from all parties in this debate and will have news for us. Perhaps the issue will even find a place in the Budget.</p>

	<p pid="b.136.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> on securing this debate and remark, as he did, on the high level of interest and the large number of interventions, which reflect a great deal of public interest. I commend the Robin Hood tax campaign for drawing attention to an important current public debate, and all those involved for the energy, imagination and enthusiasm that they have invested in it. I accept my hon. Friend's point that nobody better could speak in the House for the Robin Hood tax campaign than a Member for Nottingham.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.2/2">As the world begins to emerge from the worst of the global financial crisis, people's minds are, rightly, turning from its immediate and urgent challenges to ways to prevent another, similar crisis in future, or at least mitigate the impacts of such a crisis. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1609" name="Derek Twigg">the Member for Halton (Derek Twigg)</phrase> pointed out, the impacts have been big and damaging for many people in the UK and around the world. People are asking what went wrong and how we can avoid making the same mistakes again.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.2/3">In doing so, people are looking for creative new ideas that can help the work being done internationally to reform the regulation of financial institutions. A lot of good work is being done, and there is a sense that we need to go further. That is the background to what the Prime Minister said last year in Pittsburgh, as my hon. Friend mentioned, and at the G20 Finance Ministers' meeting at St. Andrews in November, at which I was present. The Prime Minister set out the need for</p>
	<p pid="b.136.2/4" class="indent">&quot;a better economic and social contract between financial institutions and the public based on trust and a just distribution of risks and rewards&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.136.2/5">and suggested a number of options, including a global financial transactions tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.2/6">Since then, international debate about the idea has grown louder and wider. Various international bodies are considering the issues. The G20 has commissioned work from the International Monetary Fund, which is compiling what I think will be an important report, a preliminary version of which is expected at the G20 Finance Ministers' and central bank governors' meeting next month. That work aims to consider how the financial sector can contribute to the costs that it has imposed on taxpayers and national Exchequers as a result of Government bank bail-outs around the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.2/7">The report will need to cover a lot of territory. It will pick up on many current ideas such as systemic risk levies, resolution funds and bonus taxes, and I certainly expect it to cover financial transaction taxes as well. As with any idea for new taxation, it is important that we are clear about the detail, the upsides and the downsides in order to take a proper, considered view on whether it is worth introducing. A lot of serious consideration of the issues is needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.2/8">We would need to know, for example, the impact of such a tax on the transactions being taxed and what that would mean for the financial sector more widely and for growth in the economy. How would we ensure that financial transactions did not simply evolve into non-taxed forms, which would defeat the purpose of the tax in the first place? We see that in other contexts when taxes are introduced. One key principle set out by the Prime Minister in November involved economic distortion. If we go down the road of imposing such a tax, we must ensure that there are no unintended consequences that might lead to economic distortions with a damaging impact overall on the economy. We must ensure that in attempting to solve one problem, we do not create another somewhere else.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.2/9">Geographic coverage is also important, as my hon. Friend acknowledged. The Prime Minister made it clear in November, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1462" name="Nick Palmer">the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer)</phrase> mentioned in his intervention, that a transaction tax, like the other ideas being discussed, would need to be globally agreed and implemented in order to be effective. We live in an increasingly globalised world and use an increasingly globalised financial system. We in the G20 now have the ability to consider such matters on a worldwide basis, and the G20's work last year under the UK presidency was successful. We have a forum for considering such matters. There are many questions about implementation, collection and design. I hope that the IMF report next month will shine a light on some of those questions and inform the debate on transaction taxes and other ideas being discussed at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.2/10">As well as the IMF, we have supported the European Council in asking the European Commission to explore the issues. I understand that the debate in the European Parliament today, to which my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Nottingham, North referred, concerned calling on the European Commission to undertake analysis of financial transaction taxes. I took part in the launch of the French-led taskforce on international financial transactions for development in October, when I underlined its importance in considering the financial and economic implications of a new tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.2/11">With that in mind, I nominated Michael Izza, chief executive of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, to serve on the expert group commissioned by the taskforce to explore the feasibility of the tax. He has since been elected to chair the group, and he convened a meeting at the ICAEW's headquarters in the City a week or two ago. Work is under way, and the group should report on the feasibility of the proposed measures as a form of development financing in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.2/12">Another crucial question that we need to ask ourselves is what exactly the purpose of such a tax would be. We need to be clear that a number of different purposes are being discussed at the moment. Some people suggest that the tax could address a perceived failure in the financial market and act as grit in the machinery by creating a disincentive to speculative or socially useless trading. Evidence of such measures' efficacy for that purpose is unclear at the moment, but some well-informed people have certainly argued that the tax could help.</p>

	<p pid="b.138.1/1">At the Treasury, we are keeping a close eye on the debate, but we see it inherently and necessarily as an international initiative. That is why we believe that the IMF and the European Commission-particularly the IMF-have a crucial role in assessing the technical questions and advising Governments of the pros and cons of moving in that direction. Until we have that advice at a global level, we cannot do much at the national level. That is inherent in the nature of the measure.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/2">Apart from dealing with a market failure, the other key argument is that the tax would be a good revenue-raiser at a time of fiscal consolidation.</p>
