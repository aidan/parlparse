<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-11-03a.269.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40395" speakername="Annette Brooke" colnum="269"  time="010:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101103/halltext/101103h0001.htm#10110355000438">
	<p pid="a.269.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Streeter. I apologise that I will have to leave before the end of the debate; one of my constituents has organised a big rally in Old Palace yard for park home owners, and I should be standing alongside the banners that will, inevitably, be there.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/2">I officially start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40092" name="Paul Maynard">the hon. Member for Blackpool North and Cleveleys (Paul Maynard)</phrase>, who spoke elegantly and passionately. He brought the debate alive for us this morning. It is a timely debate because we are at a crossroads; we can look back over the excellent work that came out of the Bercow review, but we are at a point where we need to look forward, learn what we can from the past and take some steps forward. I appreciate the fact that the previous Government commissioned the Bercow report, committed resources-never enough, of course, but the resources were considerable-developed an action plan, appointed a communication champion and designated next year as the national year of speech, language and communication. Those were important steps forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/3">As the hon. Gentleman and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40451" name="Pat Glass">the hon. Member for North West Durham (Pat Glass)</phrase> pointed out, there is a spectrum of needs, which is why the matter is complex to debate. At one end, there is high need, low incidence, which needs highly specialised skills and technology, some of which comes in very expensive packages, but what an enormous difference it can make to the quality of life of the child and whole family. I want to touch on the whole family throughout the debate because it is important. At the other end of the spectrum, there are issues that we know can be addressed through simple interventions, which I shall touch on.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/4">It is highly significant that speech, language and communication needs feature in statements of special educational needs for 26.5% of mainstream educated children. How significant the problems are is absolutely staggering. Other Members have dwelt on the fact that if there is a communication problem, a behavioural problem often emerges. That is natural; for a three or four-year-old who cannot express themselves, with adults not responding in the way the child wishes, what else do they do? Inevitably, we will have behavioural problems; and that, of course, identifies the necessity for early intervention. Not intervening early means that problems escalate to widespread exclusions at secondary schools and the concerning percentage of young offenders who have speech and language difficulties. Obviously, we must emphasise that it is not a straight one to one causal relationship, but there is a significant link.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/5">I was interested in the comments by Jean Gross because we are concerned about people thinking, &quot;Oh, the child's just lazy. There are lots of very clever people who didn't start to speak until three or four. Do we need early intervention?&quot; I passionately believe that we do. A mother came to me with a boy of four. He could not speak and his behaviour was getting out of control. I suggested that the mother went to the GP to ask for a specialist referral, and the GP came back at me and said, &quot;How dare you tell me how to do my job?&quot; I was rather pleased that I stirred that up. When we talk about training the whole work force in these needs, we need to include health workers, health visitors and GPs, as well as those in education.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/6">I want to be brief, so I shall go over the key issues quickly. I recall that the Bercow report said that provision and joint working is patchy across the country. There were 16 pilots announced in 2009 to look at best practice in working together in health and education. I do not know if there has been a chance to evaluate them, but it is important to look at everything that has been initiated and evaluate it as soon as is timely. We have to learn from all of this, but it is difficult to come up with a national framework because the solutions have to be local.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/7">I am concerned about health provision. We have speech therapists and we have teachers trained by specialist speech therapists, which is good but it must not be a substitute-it is an add-on. Too many authorities are using it as a substitute, but it is not. We must have sufficient qualified speech therapists. I cannot get a grip on what the shortage is. As the Minister is aware, I am always asking parliamentary questions about numbers of specialist workers, but I cannot home in on what the shortage is, and we must have a grasp of what the needs are. I can think of fantastic situations in which specialists trained up pre-school workers, for example, in children's centres to work with children identified as having language delay. That is good for low-level speech and language problems, but we are not getting a grip on the exact size of the work force needed to address the issues, on how it is all pulled together and on where working together comes forth and provides an add-on. Simply saying, &quot;All we're doing is perfectly satisfactory&quot;, when it is a substitute, is not good enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/8">I emphasise the point the hon. Member for Blackpool North and Cleveleys made about the importance of an individual solution, particularly for a family. A mother who came to see me had six children including five-old-month twins, and one child in the middle had speech and language difficulties. A package was drawn up for her to give an amount of assistance a day. Of course involving parents and carers in the package is important, but, somewhere along the line, the family circumstances have to be taken onboard.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/9">Due to time, I shall end there. I endorse all the points made already, and I look to the Minister to focus on getting a grip on how all the services come together to give the best possible start to communication in a child's life.</p>

	<p pid="a.273.1/1">I join other hon. Members in congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40092" name="Paul Maynard">the hon. Member for Blackpool North and Cleveleys (Paul Maynard)</phrase> on securing this debate. Debates that take place in Westminster Hall are often significant. This is one such debate and it deserves a huge audience. It is not only in Parliament that we do not get to debate certain topics that, despite being mainstream, never capture the headlines they deserve.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/2">Sometimes, when we discuss policy, these sorts of issues do not have as high a profile as they should. We are talking about millions of children and adults who cannot communicate effectively. The service that we provide is often a Cinderella service in terms of the demand that it makes of the system, and the way in which the system responds with the money and resources that it receives. Whatever the size of the pot, and we may argue about that, the service does not get its fair share. That is because, for some reason or other, it does not make a loud enough noise, which is why the debate secured by the hon. Gentleman today is vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/3">I want to say a couple of things and to raise a particular case that demonstrates some of the problems we have. The project to encourage and help children with their communication, referred to by the hon. Gentleman, is especially important. One of our problems is that sometimes we say, &quot;We need to involve the family&quot;, and of course that is important, but in some of those families the parents cannot communicate particularly well. Their vocabulary is limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/4">I do not mean any disrespect to anyone and I am not decrying any particular families; I am making a statement of reality about our social situation. Many of us have experience of what we see in schools, and not just in schools: the limited amount of vocabulary that some children have at two, three, four or five, compared with others of the same age, is frankly astonishing. If we talk to some of the parents-do not get me wrong, they are loving parents, who care and so on-again, we find that the communication stimulus that many of us would recognise in our own homes is not there. Such things are important. I think one problem is the talk of involving the parents, which of course is crucial, when the parents have limited vocabulary to provide in support. We need to develop that.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/5">I do not want to make a political point. We know that we are in difficult times and that there are differences between the parties about spending and so on, but I want to raise a particular case in my constituency, that of Dylan Scothern.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/6">Dylan Scothern is six years old and he is autistic. He cannot communicate. The vocabulary he has now is thanks to the work of his loving parents. His mother, Rachel Scothern, has been at the forefront of the campaign about Dylan that I will come to in a moment. With the help of speech and language therapists, Dylan can communicate with about 20 words. Rachel has put something on Facebook in which they do &quot;The wheels on the truck&quot;-no, I mean, &quot;The wheels on the bus go round and round&quot;-he communicates with it better than I do. He has been brought to that point through the speech and language therapists.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/7">Nottingham Community Health NHS Trust says that its funding for Dylan's speech and language therapists will now stop because he has reached six years of age. The trust has changed its policy so that only children of five years and under will get speech and language therapy.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/8">As I said, I do not want to make the issue political. I do not care what the budget is for Nottingham Community Health, because I am going back to the point I made before: why is it that such services are always the first that people look to when making savings? That is the importance of the debate secured by the hon. Member for Blackpool North and Cleveleys. There are easy hits when it comes to cutting money-often it is youth services, rather than services for pensioners-and here we have an example in health. Again, that is an important point made by the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/9">The Minister, who I know will take the issue forward, needs to talk to her colleagues in the Department of Health, because there is a young child at a school-he is going to school-who is having his speech and language therapy taken away, not because of the actions of her Department but because of the actions of the Department of Health through Nottingham Community Health.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/10">The case simply has to be revisited, and I am using the debate to ask the Minister to do so. I know she will not know about the case-I do not expect her to know all the details, but I will write to her with them-but can she raise it with her Department of Health colleagues, Nottingham Community Health and others with responsibility? Can she say that in the debate all of us recognised the importance of speech and language therapy for some of the most difficult young people in terms of their learning challenges, and that it is simply not acceptable to cut speech and language therapy for an autistic child because he has reached the age of six? Frankly, that is not good enough. The policy needs to be changed and looked at again.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/11">With that, I shall finish, but going back to the point I made at the beginning. Let the debate be a clarion call not just for the case of Dylan and Rachel Scothern, a family who live in my constituency, but to all of those who provide such services, whether through health or education. We need to recognise their importance and understand that, simply because they are not necessarily front-page news all of the time, they are of fundamental and significant importance to countless families and young people up and down this country. If we mean to provide equal opportunities, we should ensure that those people receive those services, which should not be the first port of call for people with difficult budget decisions to make.</p>

	<p pid="a.275.1/1">I join other Members in warmly congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40092" name="Paul Maynard">the hon. Member for Blackpool North and Cleveleys (Paul Maynard)</phrase> on securing this important debate. He spoke passionately, clearly from unrivalled personal experience and knowledge, about this important area. I agree with the high-quality contributions we have heard from all parts of the Chamber and I hope that the debate sends a powerful message to the Government about the importance of services in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/2">I want to speak in particular about the special value of the ACE-aiding communication in education-centre to which the hon. Gentleman referred and which is based in my constituency, and of ACE North, which is based in Oldham. The centres provide a unique service for parents and professionals, with joint health and education-based approaches, combining whatever it takes to give children with severe communication difficulties access to communication, education and, thereby, independence.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/3">I have seen at first hand the remarkable-often moving-difference the centres make in children's lives. I took former Labour leader John Smith to the centre once and we were moved almost to tears watching a young girl learning to communicate using assistive technology, opening a world that would otherwise have been closed to her.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/4">The centres provide a level of clinical expertise far beyond what is provided by the statutory services for children with such complex disabilities. Their intervention not only changes lives but saves money in later life. They also save money by preventing cases from reaching tribunals, which may be one of the reasons why some local authorities ask them for assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/5">The centres have a huge loan library of specialist equipment that children and their parents can try before they buy. That saves authorities buying unsuitable, expensive communication devices, which can cost many thousands of pounds and which would, if inappropriately purchased, end up in the school cupboard. The centres also work with the IT sector in a rapidly changing area to develop more effective aids to communication. At the point of use, advice to parents is free and independent, which is a lifeline for families learning to live with and support a child with severe communication difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/6">The future of the centres and the services they provide is under pressure and under threat, and there are two main reasons for that. One is that the provision of direct funding, which central Government made available through grants and project support, is being shifted to local authorities. We should sound a note of caution to those who, under the mantra of localism, would shift all funding in the direction of local authorities, because highly specialist services can be marginalised and lose out in the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/7">The other problem is that although the centres charge local authorities to recoup operation costs, the money is not always forthcoming at the necessary level. Furthermore, charitable donations, which the centres also attract, have decreased considerably due to the tougher competition facing all areas of the third sector in this difficult financial climate.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/8">We therefore face a threat to a vital service. Were that service to go, we would lose something that, since 1984, has given thousands of severely disabled young people a voice and a chance in life. To run down these vital services in the national year of speech, language and communication would clearly be perverse and unacceptable.</p>

	<p pid="a.277.0/1">Yes, I certainly endorse that, although I was not making a party political point, because the shift towards the presumption of local authority funding clearly did not start with the current Administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/2">It would be disastrous and a tragedy if we removed the centres, losing their specialist experience and their huge loan library of communication equipment, in a climate where there is technology to help children, but the understanding, guidance and expertise to help them use it is often in desperately short supply. The same is true of the loss of specialist training for teachers and therapists in how to use the technology to support and motivate children in learning and moving towards independence.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/3">The centres therefore face a serious situation, and I ask the Minister for an assurance that central Government sustainability funding for the ACE centres will continue for the full three years, until April 2012. On the centres' service-level agreements with local authorities, what assurances can she give that councils will have, or will be guided to make available, the resources to ensure that the appropriate assessment and help is available in their area to children who need it? Will she look at providing immediate additional support from the sustainability services fund and the transition fund to ensure the future of the ACE centres? I should also be grateful if she could give an assurance that she will meet representatives of the centres to discuss the way forward so that we can save these valuable services.</p>

	<p pid="a.277.1/1">I am delighted to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Streeter, and to make my first contribution to a Westminster Hall debate as a shadow Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40092" name="Paul Maynard">the hon. Member for Blackpool North and Cleveleys (Paul Maynard)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I compliment him on his well-informed and impassioned speech. Mrs Williams, his speech therapist, taught him not to rush, but to slow down, and a lot of us-especially me-could benefit from following that advice when making our speeches, even given the time constraints. I am delighted that so many Members are in the Chamber to contribute to this important discussion. They have raised many questions, which I hope that the Minister will answer today.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/3">Many Members will know that I have a personal interest in this topic. I did not have speech therapy myself, but my son required it from the age of two and a half. I have put on record the problems we encountered when we moved around the country, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40269" name="Vernon Coaker">the Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker)</phrase> mentioned a lot of similar issues when he talked about the case of Dylan. My son's speech therapy stopped when he was seven, because we had moved from Gateshead to London, and we were told that speech therapy was not given to children over the age of five. Incidentally, when we moved back to Gateshead, local professionals said, &quot;We know he's 14, but he could really still benefit from speech therapy.&quot; Members can imagine how I reacted to that, when he had missed out on seven years of possible speech therapy because of where I lived.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/4">A lot of Members have spoken, and I want to give some quick tributes. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40451" name="Pat Glass">the Member for North West Durham (Pat Glass)</phrase> gave a very intelligent and thoughtful speech, showing her immense knowledge from a long and successful professional career in the education and SEN sector. She is a true asset to the House, especially on this issue, and the Minister would be wise to pay particular attention to her contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40395" name="Annette Brooke">The hon. Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> always speaks with good wisdom and great analysis on SEN matters, and that was evident once again today. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40179" name="Tom Clarke">the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr Clarke)</phrase> is a long-standing campaigner on this issue, and I wish that he could have spoken for longer. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40270" name="Rehman Chishti">The hon. Member for Gillingham and Rainham (Rehman Chishti)</phrase> gave a short, concise, but important contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Gedling gave a very knowledgeable speech, as we would expect, and raised the important case of Dylan in his constituency. I hope that the fact that he has done so will lead to a change in Dylan's situation. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40565" name="David Amess">The hon. Member for Southend West (Mr Amess)</phrase> and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40471" name="Andrew Smith">the Member for Oxford East (Mr Smith)</phrase> also made excellent contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/7">I regret that I was unable to attend the reception in the Commons a couple of weeks ago to mark the launch of &quot;Hello&quot;, the national year of speech, language and communication, which ties in with this debate, but I look forward to hearing what is planned for 2011. If the Minister can give an assurance that departmental funding for that important initiative will survive the cuts that the Chancellor chose to make, it will signify a commendable commitment to the campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/8">The national year is, of course, one of the 40 recommendations of the Bercow review, an excellent and thorough piece of work, which was welcomed by everyone on both sides of the House. No one was more receptive to those recommendations than the former Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40411" name="Edward Balls">the Member for Morley and Outwood (Ed Balls)</phrase>. Together with the Health Secretary at the time, he published an action plan and pledged &#163;12 million to ensure that all the Bercow recommendations were put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/9">It is important to pay tribute to that commitment, as well as to the work of Mr Speaker, who will be keeping a keen eye on the debate. I am sure that commitment is shared by the Minister, and the debate gives her a good opportunity to give us an update on what progress has been made since the election on carrying on the good work that has been done.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/10">The Government have, of course, recently consulted on an SEN and disability Green Paper, and I certainly look forward to reading the responses to it and scrutinising the conclusions that the Minister draws from them. One concern that has been raised with me is that work on the Green Paper is going on while the education and health systems are going through fundamental changes. I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm today that she meets Department of Health Ministers regularly to ensure that when children need support from NHS professionals, as is the case with the children we are discussing, the Government's reforms will not have a negative impact on the provision of such support.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/11">In that respect, my main concern is that the Green Paper should focus purely on improving services for young people with differing needs and not on reducing the money spent on such improvements. There is real concern in the sector that the results of the comprehensive spending review will force the Minister to do just that. If she could confirm that the funds for statemented children with speech, language and communication difficulties and other needs will be entirely on top of any pupil premium funding that they may attract I think a lot of people's fears will be put to rest.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/12">When we include in the equation significant cuts to local government budgets, and the wholesale restructuring of the NHS, which employs the vast majority of the professionals such as Mrs Williams who help children with communication difficulties, we are left with inevitable pressure on funding for supporting those children-unless the Minister can tell us otherwise this morning. I look forward to her speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/13">Concerns have also been raised, especially by the National Deaf Children's Society, that budget cuts to existing Building Schools for the Future projects will mean that new facilities do not meet the standards set for acoustics. I would welcome comments from the Minister on how those effects can be mitigated.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/14">The hon. Member for Blackpool North and Cleveleys described in his maiden speech how without speech therapy at an early age he might never have had the ability to be in the Chamber talking to us. He is a great example of early intervention reaping huge dividends. I am sure that if Mrs Williams is watching today she will be enormously proud of her work-and his.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/15">One of the better things to be announced in connection with the CSR was that the Government are to go ahead with Labour's plan of extending free nursery places to disadvantaged two-year-olds. Although I am slightly dubious about whether enough money has been committed to achieve that, I hope that doing so will present an opportunity for earlier identification of more children with speech, language and communication needs. Earlier intervention is important in tackling the problems that those difficulties can lead to later in the child's school career. In some deprived areas, as we have already heard, 50% of children begin school with language delay already obvious. As they get older about two thirds of them will have behavioural problems. Because they are often not recognised as having difficulties that may be causing their behaviour, it leads to exclusion and the problems that go with that. It is no surprise, then, that well over half-probably more like two thirds-of young offenders are said to have those difficulties. With early intervention, I am confident that those depressing figures could be reduced, and I shall welcome any measures set out in the Green Paper to that effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/16">I believe that the Government are committed to universal screening for two and five-year-olds, and I would be interested to hear from the Minister how that will be implemented. If we are to have early intervention, it will of course require funding for the extra cases that it brings to light. Training all teachers to spot risk factors at all stages of a child's school life will require yet more funding. Again, I am not sure where all that funding will come from, and I think that pretty much takes my remarks full circle.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/17">I think that hon. Members who have taken part in the debate are in unanimous agreement that action is needed to ensure that children get the right support. I am sure that the Minister shares that view. I realise that much of what constitutes future Government policy on speech and language therapy will rest on the outcome of the consultation for the Green Paper, so she may not be able to give too much away today; but I hope she can offer some reassurance to Members, as well as to the many parents, professionals and their advocates who will have a keen interest in this debate, that providing the best possible facilities and support for children and young people with speech, language and communication difficulties, as well as other special educational needs, will be a matter of principle and not of price.</p>

	<p pid="a.293.2/1">I am grateful for this opportunity to continue a hugely important debate. The decision taken by the Government today is of historic importance to this country, for two reasons. First, the decision to treble fees for this country's young people could have a huge impact on participation in higher education. Secondly-this has been covered less, but is as important-the decision to withdraw state funding from a large part of the curriculum, namely arts and humanities subjects such as geography, history and politics, has huge implications for our democracy. We are a liberal democracy committed to the liberal arts, and today's decision is to abandon that solely to private income. This is an important day, and I will be talking specifically about participation.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.2/2">I am pleased to see the Minister in his seat. We have had many years of debates on education matters in this House. I know that he is committed, from his perspective, to participation. We understand the subject, but we do not always agree on the means, and I suspect that we will disagree today. However, I remind him that in 2004, he described tuition fees as</p>
	<p pid="a.293.2/3" class="indent">&quot;flagrant, appalling and an abuse&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.2/4">That was his position as he voted against them. Can he really defend tripling fees to &#163;9,000? I am pleased that so many colleagues from across the House have joined me today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-11-03a.296.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40615" speakername="David Lammy" colnum="296"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101103/halltext/101103h0001.htm#10110355000483">
	<p pid="a.296.0/1">As I said, we were all concerned about the progress in relation to our most selective universities. That is why allowing our most selective universities to raise their fees to &#163;9,000 a year must be counter to the progress that I would hope the hon. Gentleman desires. The Sutton Trust estimates that there are 3,000 missing state school students from Britain's 12 most selective universities. A further statistic that comes to mind is that only one black Caribbean student was admitted to Oxford university in 2009-one student.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/2">The Government's claims are hugely important. They claim to be committed to higher education's role in social mobility. Indeed, we are told that access is hard-wired into the coalition agreement. However, despite that hard-wiring, the Secretary of State has apparently long questioned whether the 50% participation rate is sensible or affordable. It is important that the Minister says something about what he considers will happen to the participation rate. Does he believe that the Government can widen access with an increased tuition fee of &#163;9,000 a year? How will trebling fees encourage the sons and daughters of nurses and dinner ladies to achieve what their parents never had the prospect of doing? If we add to that figure the &#163;8,000 a year maintenance that a student needs to live on, the Government's plans mean that it will cost &#163;17,000 a year to study for a degree. Will that encourage a nurse on an average of &#163;23,000 a year to send her young son or daughter to university? With costs that are three quarters of their salary, will they not decide that university is what they always believed it to be: not for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/3">Does the Minister honestly believe that students from the poorest backgrounds will not be put off by these staggering sums of money? A Sutton Trust opinion poll shows that only 45% of 11 to 16-year-olds who are currently interested in progressing to higher education at current fee levels would be interested if the fees were increased to &#163;7,000. What does that then say about the current figure of &#163;9,000? With institutions now capable of charging variable fees of between &#163;6,000 and &#163;9,000, it is inevitable that some of the most capable students from the poorest families will make choices based on cost or on the perception of cost, rather than because of academic talent.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-11-03a.301.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40636" speakername="Sharon Hodgson" colnum="301"  time="015:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101103/halltext/101103h0001.htm#10110355000499">
	<p pid="a.301.4/1">I apologise, Mr Betts. The Deputy Prime Minister stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.301.4/2" class="indent">&quot;If fees rise to &#163;7,000 a year, as many rumours suggest they would, within five years some students will be leaving university up to &#163;44,000 in debt. That would be a disaster.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.301.4/3">I have to say this, Mr Betts: this is one of the few occasions on which I agree with Nick.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.4/4">Even if most universities charge the minimum of &#163;6,000, it will still be a disaster, and if most of the more prestigious ones charge &#163;9,000, it will be an even bigger disaster. If I were a 16 or 17-year-old working-class girl from Gateshead-not too much of a stretch of the imagination, as I once was-looking at my options for the future, a potential debt of &#163;44,000 would make me think seriously about whether I should go to university, especially if I were the first in my family to do so. It was not a journey that I was ever able to make personally because of cost constraints, and having to go out to work to help support my mam, who was on benefits, and two younger brothers.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.4/5">If I were desperate to go to university, I would probably have to go to one of my local universities to avoid the extra living expenses, rather than the best university that would accept me based on my ability and grades. That seems to be what the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills intends people from my constituency to do. I would also most likely have to take a significant amount of paid part-time work, reducing the amount of time that I could dedicate to my studies, and consequently my attainment.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.4/6">Even then, when I had struggled through three years and racked up a debt of &#163;15,000 to &#163;20,000 for the privilege-assuming that I had received some of the grants that the Minister of State outlined-my debt would continue to grow at a rate far above that at which my earnings would be likely to grow. An interest rate of 2.2% plus RPI, which would currently be 6.8%, does not compare favourably with a typical increase in median income of 3 to 4%. By that logic, somebody finishing university this year with &#163;20,000 of debt would see that debt grow by more than &#163;1,300 in a year and would need to find a job paying more than &#163;30,000 just to keep up with paying that off. Today, though, we have heard that someone earning &#163;30,000 could be liable to pay even more interest. That will mean millions of young people never paying off their loans and quite a number of those loans-not just the odd one-probably being written off after the end of the 30-year period. The thought of being 16 or 17 and realising that I would still be paying for my education in my 50s would definitely put me off higher education.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-11-03a.309.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40289" speakername="Diane Abbott" colnum="309"  time="015:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101103/halltext/101103h0002.htm#10110355000523">
	<p pid="a.309.1/1">I am afraid that I did not attract the Minister's attention. I have always been against tuition fees; I have marched through the Lobby against them. It gives me no pleasure to say that I knew it would end up like this, with Tory Ministers such as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40547" name="John Hayes">the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr Hayes)</phrase> ramping up fees-<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Members will see how I cast my vote in the coming debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/2">The point that I wanted to make is that in a world of markets-all of us here, even my good self, believe in markets nowadays-price is an indicator and, as I said earlier, if there is variable pricing, the indicator to students is that the higher-priced universities are not for the likes of them. Over the years, I have counselled many young people in my constituency, including ethnic minority young people, to try to encourage them to go on to higher education. They are held back not because they do not have the qualifications-their teachers bring them to me precisely because they think they are bright enough to benefit-but because their parents and they themselves are worried about leaving home, about the sorts of people that they will meet, and that the environment might be snobbish. And now that we see a gap of perhaps &#163;6,000 or &#163;7,000 between fees, what will those working-class students think?</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/3">I was the first in my generation of my family to go to university. I always remember my father, who was a committed and kindly parent, saying when I was in the sixth form, &quot;Girls of your age are out of school.&quot; He was not being cruel; all the black girls of my age that he knew were out of school. I voted against tuition fees in the first place because had someone told my father, who left school at 14 and worked all his life, that not only was I staying on into the sixth form, not only was I going on to university, but I was going to pile up upward of &#163;40,000 debt to go to my chosen university, he would have said, &quot;No. You leave school and you become a nurse like your mother,&quot; not because he was cruel, but because he was looking out for my future. For someone from his kind of background, that level of debt would be more than they would earn in a year, and more than my father in his day would have earned in several years, which would have been completely unthinkable.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/4">I agree with Government Members who said that the issues that face young people from communities such as mine when going forward into further education are not just about money. They are very complex issues, and that is why for many years I have run a programme that is designed to encourage black young children, specifically, in London to raise their achievements. We have conferences and seminars, and we give out awards. There are, of course, hundreds of ethnic minority young people doing very well in school, in spite of everything and, as I am sure my right hon. and hon. Friends will agree, this measure will hit not just people from communities such as mine, but middle England also. In some ways, the people who will be worst off are those who are just in the middle, who are not eligible for the help but cannot afford to contemplate their children going to forward to pile up &#163;40,000 of debt, not when they will have to think about their pension and their jobs, and interest rates on mortgages are rising. I believe that the introduction in this way of a crude market mechanism into higher education is wrong. I believe that it shows the reality of our invisible Lib Dem colleagues' commitment to equality and fairness. I look forward to hearing the Minister responding to my colleagues' points today, but I look forward even more to seeing what the electorate in Southwark, in Hornsey, and in Lib Dem constituencies up and down the country, will say in response to the way in which the Lib Dems have today walked away from signed commitments not to have higher tuition fees.</p>
