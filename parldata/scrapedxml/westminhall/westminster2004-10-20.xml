	<p pid=".243.3/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to debate the important subject of United Kingdom citizens who have been detained by the United States immigration service. I shall address some general points before moving on to a specific constituency case.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/2">At one level, foreign travel is relatively straightforward these days. Obtaining a UK passport is reasonably straightforward, and travelling for pleasure and business is common and often not too expensive. However, today's travellers must make certain that, before visiting a foreign country, they are aware of any visa requirements and any restrictions on articles and substances that they may want to take into that country. They should also familiarise themselves with its laws and customs and be aware that its legal and policing methods may not be the same as those in the UK. It would, in fact, be na-ve to assume that a country's laws and customs were necessarily the same as those in the UK, and people must be made aware of the fact that similarities in language, history, law, custom and perceptions of friendship may be no more than superficial.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/3">There are, for example, fundamental differences between the UK and the United States of America. Superficially, we have a lot in common: we have a common history and a common language; the US legal framework is very much based on that of the UK; and we have strong economic, political, military and friendship ties. However, the unwary traveller can get into serious trouble in the United States, either out of ignorance or because of the operating procedures used by the immigration service.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/4">In the case of the United States, we must be sensitive to the impact of 9/11 and of the international terrorist attacks that preceded it or which have taken place since. One can only imagine what would be the impact on our political system if an incident like 9/11 were to take place here. There would be an immediate desire for a massive strengthening of security, far beyond what we face now. There would also be a change in the balance between the emphasis on personal liberty and the rights of the individual and the belief that collective security was paramount.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/5">Following 9/11, as the Minister knows, the US Government established the Department of Homeland Security to co-ordinate 22 Cabinet-level agencies connected with that important subject. President Bush signed into law the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act 2001, or the USA PATRIOT ACT, to use the acronym. Obviously, some smart Alec spent a lot of time working out that acronym, and if we can find out who they are, one of our political parties might want to employ them before the general election.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/6">The Act contains numerous provisions that affect immigrants as much as terrorist suspects. They broaden the definitions of terrorism, terrorist activity and terrorist organisations for the purposes of deportability and inadmissibility, create additional mechanisms to enable the Attorney General to detain and deport a non-citizen as a terrorist, and establish a new ground of inadmissibility for the spouses and children of those inadmissible on terrorist grounds.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/7">Historically, the immigration and naturalisation service had responsibility for determining who could be admitted to the United States and for enforcing immigration laws. Following the reorganisation of <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-01">1 March 2003</phrase> under the Department of Homeland Security, however, two main bureaus were formed in the DHS to handle enforcement: the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/8">Apart from policing immigration and checking for the illegal entry of peoples and materials, the various agencies that make up the DHS have a primary duty to prevent terrorism. That task is truly considerable, both physically and psychologically, as the United States has to secure 8,000 miles of land and border entries as well as more than 300 designated ports of entry: a massive security problem.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/9">Since 9/11, the United States has tightened its border and immigration procedures, with the understandable built-in suspicion that terrorists may be trying to gain access to the USA under the cover of legitimate names, backgrounds and occupations. However, since the new procedures were put in place, given the understandable psychological atmosphere of fear and suspicion after 9/11, many innocent foreign citizens, including those of the UK, have received unnecessarily harsh, arbitrary and at times totally inappropriate treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/10">Furthermore, it is difficult for either such individuals or the Foreign Office to get information from the US authorities or, at times, to obtain either an apology or redress. There have been a number of incidents involving ordinary citizens, as well as one or two high-profile ones. Hon. Members may recall that the well-known British writer, Ian McEwan, attempted to enter the USA via Canada to give a lecture. He is a writer who is much admired by Cherie Blair, the wife of our Prime Minister, and also by Laura Bush, the wife of President Bush. He was stopped at passport control and, for a reason that we do not know, he was refused entry. His passport was then stamped to show that he had been refused entry to the United States.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/11">Following the natural furore over the incident, the United States Government investigated it and apologised to Mr. McEwan. They have now given him a letter to keep in his passport to say that a mistake was made. Once one's passport has a stamp, of course, it is there until the passport is replaced. That was a high-profile case, and I am perfectly prepared to accept that in any large organisation mistakes are made. However, mistakes have been made and incidents have occurred with people who do not have Mr. McEwan's high profile.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/12">I would also like to consider the fact that a number of individuals now appear on the Department of Homeland Security's preventive lists. The DHS obviously has a whole series of these lists, such as the no-fly list. They can be based on erroneous information. The individuals concerned, and others, can be detained or expelled for minor infringements, and they face the prospect that their passport will bear a stamp advising them that they have been refused entry to the USA or that their name will remain on some computer listing that can be activated by other countries. That is a serious point, which should worry all of us.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/13">There is an understandable desire to use information technology to prevent terrorism, to screen out suspects and to make reaction time very quick indeed. However, we all know only too well from our own experiences with computers, involving either our family interests or business, and from the Government's record on computers&mdash;I use the word &quot;Government&quot; to refer to a 20-year period&mdash;that a name can get on to a computer by mistake, by the use of the wrong surname, the wrong set of initials, the wrong address or just the wrong biog.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/14">Not only does that person face the prospect of being detained; the greater fear is that once the mistake has been recognised, their name might still appear not only on the main computer list but on those of allied countries. Once that has happened to an individual or their family, not only are they fearful of returning to the United States, but they fear that by travelling elsewhere in the world they could be picked up again&mdash;in Berlin, Johannesburg, Rome or wherever&mdash;because their name has triggered a whole series of reactions on other computers.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/15">Given 9/11 and the threat from terrorism, it may be that the US Government, their agencies and US public opinion are quite prepared to see individual foreigners discomfited, detained and expelled for the greater good of security. If one believes one is fighting a war, one at times will face those options and difficulties. It is not for me to moralise on that. In 1940 a British Government, largely under pressure from public opinion, rounded up tens of thousands of aliens in this country because they were of German or Italian background. The fact that many of them were Jewish or had fled from fascism was not considered a reason not to detain them. Indeed, in the USA, a similar thing happened after the attack on Pearl harbour, when the Japanese-American community was regarded as a threat.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/16">I accept that there is a balance to be struck, but such procedure is wrong in principle as well as in practice. The United States is likely to suffer further alienation from many of its natural friends unless it rectifies its procedures and the mental attitude that it has instilled in the people in the immigration service, who naturally assume that many foreigners are potential terrorists. I know from the experience of my own family and friends who have recently visited the USA that it is bad enough for those who look roughly like the average American, but the likelihood is that those who, in their deportment or dress, look as though they come from the middle east will psychologically already be regarded as a suspect.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/17">Since 9/11, foreigners have been denied entry to, or expelled from, US ports of entry for a variety of reasons, including on the suspicion of their being active in or supporting terrorist organisations or their political allies, on the suspicion of their being an illegal immigrant, for visa violations, for a failure to notify a previous criminal record and, at times, for just bad luck. Can the Minister give the Chamber any indication of how many UK citizens have been denied entry to the USA since 9/11? How many complaints has the Foreign Office received from UK citizens about unfair or erroneous denial? How many have complained that the treatment that they received ranged from verbal and physical abuse to being handcuffed and shackled at those ports of entry?</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/18">On the latter point, the US Government have recognised that there is a problem, not least in public relations, with the visit to London last month of Commissioner Robert Bonner of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection. He came to London effectively to say that he recognised that the bureau had received complaints from many travellers from the UK and found that</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/19" class="indent">&quot;there was unnecessary rudeness and hostility to people travelling into the US&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/20">He said that he had launched a &quot;professionalism initiative&quot; that incorporated a new code of conduct for staff which</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/21" class="indent">&quot;makes clear that rude or discourteous behaviour is not permitted and is subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/22">He also said that he realised that the treatment meted out to travellers who had committed</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/23" class="indent">&quot;minor technical violations, such as overstaying the time allowed under the visa waiver programme&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/24">had been</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/25" class="indent">&quot;grossly disproportionate&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/26">He concluded:</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/27" class="indent">&quot;We don't want to detain people who don't pose a risk. And in those cases where entry is denied, but the person poses no risk, there are procedures to deal with them that don't involve handcuffing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/28">To be fair, only a month ago the United States recognised that it has a problem that is serious enough for the man who effectively runs the immigration service to come here to London to issue a public apology. That is a good start. However, the problem is not so much Commissioner Bonner recognising that there is a problem, but how to train and advise the people doing the checks at points of entry to the US. If their approach is to view foreigners as potential terrorists, they will probably continue to take a fairly robust approach to any citizen who may mistakenly have done something that affects their entry. Certainly, the fact that such people are no longer to be shackled and handcuffed is an improvement.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/29">I shall now move from the general to the particular, and the case of two of my constituents, Mr. and Mrs. David Pattison of Beeston in Norfolk. Mr. and Mrs. Pattison flew to the United States on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-25">Sunday 25 April 2004</phrase>, arriving at JFK in New York at 4.50 pm, US time. They were planning to stay in New York for a few days before going to Dallas to stay with Mr. Pattison's former boss, a US citizen. At passport control, on presentation of their passports, they were led to an office after their passports had been swiped. Mr. Pattison was informed that he would be denied entry to the United States and deported because there was an Interpol notification on US records that he owed moneys to the state of Qatar, where he had worked as a finance officer. He denied the allegations but that made no difference. Since then, he has acquired written confirmation from Qatar that he was not wanted for any moneys owed and, some days later, the Qatar embassy in London said that it had no knowledge of any Interpol notification on him.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/30">At the time, Mr. Pattison exercised his right to call the British consulate in New York, but was told that it was unable to help him. Since then, the Foreign Office has said that that procedure was wrong, and it has apologised for what appeared to be a lack of help and sympathy at the time. Mr. Pattison was then informed that he would be taken to a detention centre, while his wife was told that she had to make her own arrangements. Eventually, she went to a hotel. She was, understandably, greatly disturbed, but that appeared to have no effect on the US authorities&mdash;simpatico they were not.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/31">After Mrs. Pattison had left, Mr. Pattison was taken to another room with seven other people already inside, where, in his own words:</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/32" class="indent">&quot;They placed ankle shackles on me, handcuffs, and a wooden thing like a cross was fitted across my chest, and they sat me with the others. We weren't allowed to speak, and we weren't given any food or water. We just sat on chairs with guards in the room.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/33">Eventually, Mr. and Mrs. Pattison were reunited and put on board a return flight to the UK at 6.50 pm on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-26">Monday 26 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/34">Since then, the commissioner has said that, in such cases, that procedure will no longer apply. I accept that in the USA, people who are regarded as criminals are often shackled and manacled; that takes place at the state level in certain cases. However, we would regard it as an overreaction to say the least. Generally, we do not do that to violent criminals unless they are continually trying to assault the police.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/35">Obviously, Mr. and Mrs. Pattison were shocked and traumatised by what they had endured, but they were also angry and frustrated. That anger and frustration is still with them six months later. On arriving home, Mr. Pattison contacted the Foreign Office seeking an explanation for what had happened. He said that he received little in the way of explanation at the time. Indeed, when Ian Clarke, the senior reporter for our local newspaper, the <i>Dereham and Fakenham Times</i>, contacted the Foreign Office at the beginning of May, he was told:</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/36" class="indent">&quot;In circumstances where the US immigration department is making a decision on whether or not they are going to let a person into the country, we can't intervene.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/37">Since then, Mr. Pattison and I, as his Member of Parliament, have attempted to gain both redress for what he and his wife endured and answers to questions. I have corresponded with Ministers and arranged a meeting with the Minister's colleague, Baroness Symons, so that she could hear directly from Mr. and Mrs. Pattison. That meeting took place in the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-15">15 June</phrase>, when Baroness Symons gave us about an hour of her time. She was sympathetic and agreed to follow up a number of points, in particular the alleged arrest warrant issued by Qatar through Interpol and the way in which Mr. and Mrs. Pattison were treated in New York, which she undertook to raise with the US embassy in London.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/38">Sadly, Mr. and Mrs. Pattison believe that now, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-20">20 October</phrase>, they are no nearer achieving their objective of obtaining an explanation and an apology from the US Government for their treatment, or an explanation from Interpol about the arrest warrant. In fact, it seems almost impossible for anybody to get an answer. Mr. and Mrs. Pattison cannot; I, as an ordinary Member of Parliament cannot; even the Foreign Office appears to be unable to get an answer from Interpol. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the Pattison case, it is incredibly frustrating that even a major British Government Department cannot get an answer out of Interpol, an organisation that acts as a clearing house through which member states can issue such warrants. That is a major problem.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/39">In reviewing the correspondence between the Foreign Office and Mr. Pattison and myself, I note that Baroness Symons genuinely believes that she and her officials are trying to get answers for Mr. Pattison. I think that they are. Unfortunately, as they make clear, the Foreign Office is in no position to force the US authorities to explain what happens to UK citizens or to apologise for it. Foreign Office officials and Ministers have had numerous meetings, both in London and in Washington, to attempt to persuade the United States that they might have the wrong procedures and that they treat UK citizens and others unfairly. It seems that they have had limited success to date. I am not blaming the Foreign Office; it is a problem for the United States.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/40">We are going through a period of considerable strain in British-American relations, mainly over the war with Iraq. There is a substantial amount of anti-President Bush feeling and, superficially at least, a lot of anti-American feeling. I regret that. I make these points as a convinced friend of the USA and the American people, and I speak more in sorrow than in anger. I hope that the US Government and the Department of Homeland Security will, at least, take note of the fact that British people, and a Member of Parliament such as myself, are feeling frustrated and angry. It will help to explain to them the alienation that they face from many others who will not even give them the benefit of the doubt.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/41">There is also the problem of getting an explanation from Interpol. It seems that the Foreign Office sees itself as no more than an interlocutor between Interpol and individual UK citizens who have fallen foul of an Interpol arrest warrant.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/42">Six months after the traumatic incident, my constituents still feel traumatised, frustrated and angry. They are not alone. Other British citizens have had similar experiences. Mr. Pattison still seeks an explanation and an apology from the US Government. I ask the Minister once again: is there any way in which the Foreign Office can facilitate that for Mr. and Mrs. Pattison? They still seek an explanation from Interpol, and indeed an answer to letters and phone calls. Is there any way in which either the Foreign Office or the Home Office can give Mr. and Mrs. Pattison practical help?</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/43">Finally, Mr. and Mrs. Pattison want closure on the experience. They feel very nervous indeed about foreign travel, certainly to the USA, which it is almost impossible for them to enter at the moment, but also elsewhere. Mr. Pattison feels that his passport has literally been marked. What guarantee has he that his name is not included on various suspect lists that are not only held by the United States, but copied out to friendly Governments? We know that that is the procedure.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/44">The citizen is at his most vulnerable. I remind the Chamber of what is printed on the front of all our passports:</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/45" class="indent">&quot;Her Britannic Majesty's Secretary of State Requests and requires in the Name of Her Majesty all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer to pass freely without let or hindrance, and to afford the bearer such assistance and protection as may be necessary.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/46">Obviously, that was written when few people had passports, but it puts an onus on a friendly allied nation to treat our citizens in a reasonably civilised way, at least, and to accept that it may genuinely make mistakes. Finally, the Foreign Office has a duty of care to its citizens because they are taxpayers, and because it is right.</p>

	<p pid=".249.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1227" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> on securing the debate and allowing us to discuss and deliberate on the plight of British citizens who have fallen foul of the American immigration authorities. I have listened carefully to the points raised by the hon. Gentleman, and to the circumstances he related as to how his constituents, Mr. and Mrs. Pattison, were treated and, to some extent, humiliated by the agency.</p>
	<p pid=".249.0/2">In support of the hon. Gentleman's case, I will highlight the experiences of my constituent, Mrs. Maureen Mordente, a 63-year-old grandmother from Dundee. She suffered at the hands of the American immigration agency when she attempted to enter the USA at Los Angeles airport on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-12">12 February 2003</phrase>. Mrs. Mordente, who is an extremely pleasant, caring and warm individual, had made a lengthy, long-awaited and eagerly anticipated trip of 11 and a half hours from London to visit her daughter, son-in-law and seven-year-old granddaughter, having not seen them since 2000. Her visit, however, was brutally cut short, as she made it no further into America than the immigration control desk and detention centre at LA airport.</p>
	<p pid=".249.0/3">Mrs. Mordente's excitement on arrival soon turned to anxiety when, after a long wait to have her passport and visa waiver form checked, the officials at the desk subjected her documents to lengthy scrutiny. After some sharp and tense discussion, she was asked to accompany immigration officials to a side room for a lengthy, tense and eventually tearful investigation. During that intimidating process, it became clear that on a visit to the United States over the festive season of 1997&ndash;98, Mrs. Mordente had inadvertently breached the conditions of her 90-day visa waiver by staying in the US for 103 days&mdash;13 days over the limit&mdash;primarily because of her daughter's illness. At that time, she was not aware of the breach of visa requirements, nor was it picked up or pointed out as she left the country in 1998, or when she re-entered and left in 2000 during a holiday with her daughter.</p>
	<p pid=".249.0/4">It is obvious that the visa infringement was logged due to the heightened attention to security after <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>&mdash;which I do not dispute is necessary&mdash; and that it caught up with Mrs. Mordente on that fateful trip, much to her cost and distress. Her treatment during the questioning, which went on for six consecutive hours, was brusque and intimidating. She knew that things were going wrong, but she believed that she would eventually be allowed to enter the United States and meet her family, who were still waiting on the other side of the immigration barriers, in the land of the free. She was allowed one telephone call, but her hopes were soon dashed as, after the questioning, she was rushed into another room, where she was fingerprinted and several photographs were taken, the last of which, it was explained, was a mugshot for her criminal record, which was to be retained in the United States. She was advised that she would be detained over night and deported back to the UK the very next day.</p>
	<p pid=".249.0/5">As hon. Members can imagine, the night that Mrs. Mordente passed in a cage in the LA airport detention centre was the most hellish experience that had ever been inflicted on her. That Dundee granny had lived a fairly quiet life but, after crying most of the night, she was deported straight back to London the next day, without her or her family having any chance to make a legal challenge to such an abrupt, arbitrary detention in and eviction from a country that prides itself on its legal system and which has a long, honoured history of seeking and promoting liberty. Nor, I believe, did the British consular service become involved in the sorry tale, despite the call that Mrs. Mordente's family made to the British consulate in Los Angeles.</p>
	<p pid=".249.0/6">The one glimmer of hope was that when Mrs. Mordente was taken from her cage to the departure lounge, after that shocking, searing sequence of events, the US immigration officer who escorted her left her with these parting words: &quot;You're not banned from the USA, Mrs. Mordente; all you have to do is get right on down to the American embassy when you get back to the UK and get your visa sorted out. You're always welcome here in the USA, Mrs. Mordente.&quot; It seems that customer care was evident in Los Angeles.</p>
	<p pid=".249.0/7">On returning to the UK, Mrs. Mordente apprised me of her troubles. However shocked and upset as she undoubtedly was, with those friendly parting words ringing in her ears, she contacted the American consular service and doggedly attempted to obtain a visa to allow her to return to the USA. She pointed out that her husband, who in 1997&ndash;98 had also infringed the 90-day limit in the visa waiver rules but did not accompany her on the fateful trip to Los Angeles in February 2003, also applied for a visa at the same time, now starkly aware of what awaited him if he attempted to enter the United States using a visa waiver form.</p>
	<p pid=".249.0/8">Just to ensure that things would be done properly, I wrote to the then American ambassador, Mr. William Farish, whom I had met at a lunch that he hosted for the all-party parliamentary British-American group, of which I was a member. Indeed, the previous year, in 2002, I had been a guest of the American State Department and was given a card asking the American people to help me, an honoured guest in the United States, in any activity or with any problems that I might have during my two-week stay as a member of a group visiting the United States. Mr. Farish's response, which was polite and civil, as was his manner at the dinner, voiced regret that Mrs. Mordente felt that she had been unfairly treated during her short stay in the USA and recommended that she apply for a visa.</p>
	<p pid=".249.0/9">The visa application progressed. Mrs. Mordente was interviewed on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-15">15 July 2003</phrase>, but was still awaiting news of whether she would be given a visa for entry to the United States again, hopefully to revisit her family there, in September that year. The disturbing thing was that her husband had already received the news that he would be given a 10-year visa, despite his breach of the waiver conditions in 1997&ndash;98. Not until November, following my further intervention, did she receive the long-awaited news. Unfortunately it was not good: as a result of her deportation, she was ineligible to enter the United States for 10 years.</p>
	<p pid=".249.0/10">Given the success of Mrs. Mordente's husband, she, her family and everyone involved, including me, was devastated at the news. For an overstay of 13 days, this quiet, peace-loving grandmother was given a sentence of 10 years without appeal. In a further letter from the United States embassy following my approach in December, it was also made clear to me that it was very unlikely that she would be allowed a further visa entry to the United States for a further 10 years. That is 10 years of exile from her daughter and granddaughter&mdash;her loved ones&mdash;who are now settled and applying for American citizenship on the other side of the world; her daughter is married to an American citizen.</p>
	<p pid=".249.0/11">As with the case mentioned by the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk, the local press had picked up the case and there was a story on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-23">23 December 2003</phrase> in the <i>Evening Telegraph&mdash;</i>called &quot;The Tele&quot; in Dundee&mdash;under the banner headline &quot;Banned in the USA&quot;, a parody of Bruce Springsteen's song &quot;Born in the USA&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".249.0/12">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-06">6 January</phrase> this year, at the end of my tether, I wrote as a constituency MP to the Foreign Secretary. Baroness Symons responded to my request for Government intervention on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-03">3 February</phrase>, in similar terms to the reply that the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk received:</p>
	<p pid=".249.0/13" class="indent">&quot;Please pass on my sympathies to Mrs. Mordente for what must be a frustrating situation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".249.0/14">To describe the situation as frustrating was an understatement; it was horrendous. She continued:</p>
	<p pid=".249.0/15" class="indent">&quot;However, the operation of the US Visa Waiver programme is solely at the direction of the US Government . . . Under international law we are unable to interfere in the immigration procedures of another country.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".249.0/16">It is disgrace that the USA, a country in which the constitution enshrines a Bill of Rights guaranteeing basic freedoms for its own citizens, can treat honest, ordinary, hard-working, decent British citizens in such a way. I am not advocating that America should lower its guard against terrorism; nor am I anti-American because, as is the case for many Scots, lots of my relatives emigrated to the United States and I still have close contacts there. My mother goes out every year to visit family and I am glad to say that she has never fallen foul of the immigration service. I studied American politics and history at university and I am a close observer of the political scene in the USA, but given the nature of American society and its creditable role in the world, I believe that with that power comes responsibilities. A country that is at the forefront in size, technology and industry should at least be able to devise a system that can check whether cases are genuine, perhaps in conjunction with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and British police. It should show a little sense and sensitivity.</p>
	<p pid=".249.0/17">I am also disappointed by the FCO response. First, there appeared to be no involvement by the British consular service in Los Angeles; secondly, it is apparent that nothing can be done through diplomatic channels to ensure that cases such as those that the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk and I have raised can be reviewed or go to appeal to secure some form of satisfactory conclusion.</p>
	<p pid=".249.0/18">It may be apt to point out that earlier this week in the matter of deploying the Black Watch, Dundee's local regiment, in support of America, the British Government are clearly all too happy to do everything they can to assist our oldest ally. It is a pity that that sentiment appears not to be reciprocated. When there are genuine cases of unfair treatment of British citizens, there seems to be no redress and no understanding between our two countries. I hope that the debate secured by the hon. Gentleman brings about a change in attitudes and that the FCO, even at this late stage, can do something. The hon. Gentleman, the Pattisons, Mrs. Mordente and I will be grateful if it can.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-20.252.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/785" speakername="Alistair Carmichael" colnum="252"  time="010:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/halltext/41020h01.htm#41020h01_spnew2">
	<p pid=".252.0/1">I add my congratulations to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1227" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase>, not only on securing the debate but on the exceptionally assiduous manner in which he has pursued his constituents' interests. I thank him for raising the matter in this House; it gives us an opportunity to examine the human cost of decisions that are taken&mdash;sometimes at a very senior level in the Government, as has clearly been the case in the United States&mdash;and the impact that they can have.</p>
	<p pid=".252.0/2">I also commend <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>. In preparation for this debate I have had cause to review some cuttings from that newspaper, and it seems to me that it has done a great deal to bring to light the problems experienced not only by Mr. Pattison but by other UK citizens in travelling to the United States.</p>
	<p pid=".252.0/3">I will listen with great interest to what the Minister has to say. Many of the legitimate concerns expressed by the hon. Members for Mid-Norfolk and for Dundee, East (Mr. Luke) are matters for the US Government; they are essentially internal matters. We can, of course, express our concerns and hope that that will have an influence but, beyond that, if our colleagues on the other side of the pond choose not to act on our expressions of concern, we as individuals must make our own decisions.</p>
	<p pid=".252.0/4">At the start of his speech, the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk appropriately reminded us of the importance of our relationship with the United States. As with all close friends, it is important that we should be seen as being not uncritical. It is therefore appropriate that we highlight the concerns of our constituents in this public way today. It is also to the hon. Gentleman's credit that he reminded us of our own wartime conduct in interning people whom we perceived at that time to be some sort of threat. We should remind ourselves that, in the past, we have not been immune to that sort of attitude.</p>
	<p pid=".252.0/5">On the wider front, the greatest value of today's debate will be in examining our own procedures and questioning whether some of the things that we are doing in response to 9/11 could threaten some of the freedoms that we seek to protect.</p>
	<p pid=".252.0/6">I have considered some of the most recent measures taken by the United States in the name of security, and I wonder how effective they will be. One can see the point of photographing and finger-scanning tourists who enter the country, but I question the effectiveness of the suggestion that every tourist should provide a complete record of their whereabouts in the United States before they can board the plane in the UK. For that to be effective, it would require a massive checking exercise, and it is difficult to imagine how the matter would be pursued if the person in question were to depart from the itinerary in any way. Perhaps it is not surprising that, since 9/11, there has been a 30 per cent. drop in the number of overseas tourists entering the United States. I hope that that may also serve as a salutary reminder to our Government about the possible impact of any unnecessarily draconian measures.</p>
	<p pid=".252.0/7">The hurt, anxiety and upset felt by Mr. Pattison is pretty clear. Indeed, the case was brought very graphically to the attention of the House today by the hon. Gentleman. It is difficult not to sympathise with someone in that situation. What concerned me most, however, was the withholding of information by Interpol which purported to relate to what was, in essence, a civil debt. I might have had some sympathy for Interpol if Mr. Pattison was alleged to have been involved in criminal activity in some way, but I must ask why on earth Interpol is holding information about people's civil debts. Surely all Members have experience of constituency cases in which people have fallen into dispute over the payment of a debt in the course of normal business activity. There can be any number of reasons why that could happen, but surely Interpol has better things to do with its time and resources than to hold and disseminate information of that sort.</p>
	<p pid=".252.0/8">I understand that the alleged debt, which, as the hon. Gentleman explained, was disputed and is now accepted to have neither truth nor substance, was about &pound;6,000, or $10,000. Why on earth does Interpol have to hold such information, and what possible interest can member states have in sharing it for the sake of security?</p>
	<p pid=".252.0/9"><i>The Daily Telegraph </i>also highlighted the case of Marie Casafina. I do not want to go into the details of her case, but what was significant was the comment made by Richard Morris of the consular directorate of the FCO and reported in that newspaper on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-22">22 May</phrase>. He said:</p>
	<p pid=".252.0/10" class="indent">&quot;The process of shackling and manacling by US immigration authorities prior to a person's deportation is, I am afraid, routine.</p>
	<p pid=".252.0/11" class="indent">We raise these cases at all levels with the Americans, asking that their immigration authorities adopt softer detention methods with British nationals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".252.0/12">The FCO should, quite properly, pursue this matter as vigorously as possible. Although my own experience of dealing with the criminal justice system in the United States is very small, it led me to realise that there is a culture there that accepts manacling and shackling in a way that I, as someone who made his living in the criminal justice system as a solicitor, find bemusing and barbaric. It is not for us to try to change the culture in America, but it is legitimate for us to ask that our citizens be treated with the concern and respect that they would be entitled to expect in this country.</p>
	<p pid=".252.0/13">The experiences that have been related to the Chamber today should give us a small amount of satisfaction that officers of our own immigration and nationality directorate, although certainly not blameless, have, in my experience as a constituency Member, shown flexibility and compassion. That experience may not have been shared by all, but their behaviour certainly compares very favourably with that of US immigration officials about which we have heard today.</p>
	<p pid=".252.0/14">Another concern relates to the holding of information by Governments, which is greater post-<phrase class="date" code="2004-09-11">11 September</phrase> that it has ever been. Information is not only held by Governments, but shared between them. The accountability of organisations such as Interpol must be given serious consideration. If Mr. Pattison's case highlights anything, it highlights for us all the fallibility of Governments in gathering, holding and sharing information.</p>
	<p pid=".252.0/15">That is one reason that my party and I believe that Government plans for the introduction of identity tags are dangerous in the extreme and should be approached with the greatest caution.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-20.254.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1259" speakername="Gary Streeter" colnum="254"  time="010:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/halltext/41020h01.htm#41020h01_spnew3">
	<p pid=".254.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1227" name="Keith Simpson">the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> on securing this important debate. He has a reputation in the House as a tireless worker on behalf of his constituents; we have seen more evidence of that today in the way that he has pursued the case and in his not being prepared to let it go. I also commend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1059" name="Iain Luke">the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Luke)</phrase> for raising another important case. I hope that we get some answers from the Minister on both cases&mdash;and some action.</p>
	<p pid=".254.0/2">I found the treatment of Mr. and Mrs. Pattison absolutely appalling and unacceptable. I feel for them, and I hope that today's debate shows them that we are on their side. What happened to them is unfair; it should not have happened and it must be put right. I am disappointed to learn about the wide use of shackles and manacles by US officials. I am also disappointed to learn about the role of the British consulate in America and its non-assistance in both cases. It has been suggested that that policy may now have changed. I hope that the Minister will have something to say about that. When British citizens travel abroad, they are entitled to expect more support from consular officials.</p>
	<p pid=".254.0/3">Although we have a close working relationship with the USA, I am concerned that representations from the Government do not seem to have achieved much in obtaining justice for those who have suffered. I commend my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk for fighting so hard on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Pattison. I hope that the Minister makes an appropriate response to the debate.</p>
	<p pid=".254.0/4">As my hon. Friend stated, it is important to put the Americans' reaction in context. We recognise and understand that 9/11 changed their world. It was the first time since Pearl harbour that the world's only superpower had experienced an attack on its mainland. It is no wonder that the country reacted in such a way and declared war on terror. If we are fully to understand world events, we must not underestimate the true impact of that frightful moment on the corporate psyche of the most powerful nation in the world.</p>
	<p pid=".254.0/5">When the twin towers came down, they brought with them an appalling loss of innocent life. It subsequently transpired that it was caused by hijackers, some of whom had entered the United States using various ports of entry. It is no wonder that the country has responded so vigorously by putting up defensive shields and trying to stop foreigners entering the country if it is suspected that they are entering America to commit terrorist acts. We understand America's new determination to secure the country; the American Government, like all Governments, have a primary duty to protect the country's citizens.</p>
	<p pid=".254.0/6">We understand also that America needed to fix shortcomings at some of its border controls. America, a country that the hon. Member for Dundee, East described as at the cutting edge of technology, has for a number of years used low-grade technology in some of its border control systems, which often used to cause mistakes. No wonder it is trying to correct that.</p>
	<p pid=".254.0/7">Although I understand those reasons, it is none the less perfectly legitimate for us to question some of the measures that have been taken, and to question whether the treatment suffered by innocent visitors to the United States is justified in every case. In a world of great mobility and liberal global markets, it is vital that every nation, especially one as powerful as the USA, strikes the right balance between robust security and allowing access to its markets for business people, tourists and legitimate visitors. The USA needs friends&mdash;in its own country and around the world&mdash;and the treatment of tourists in America has further alienated public opinion at a time when such alienation is not needed.</p>
	<p pid=".254.0/8">The relationship between Britain and the United States has rarely been closer. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk said, the Conservative party treasures the special relationship; I believe in it passionately. We are close allies, and we are co-operating in the struggle against terrorism. That is right and proper. The Home Office and the Department of Homeland Security share enormous quantities of information in their joint enterprise to detect terrorists and prevent them from launching attacks. We understand and support that.</p>
	<p pid=".254.0/9">However, although we have a special relationship, which we treasure, friendships and relationships work both ways. This must be a two-way street. If we are co-operating so closely with the United States, as we should be, we are entitled to expect a greater response from the Americans, particularly when cases are raised with them at a high level by Foreign Office Ministers. I should like to know why better channels of communication are not in place between the Foreign Office and its US counterparts and why there is not more of a two-way street in dealing with cases that are raised properly by Members of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".254.0/10">We remain concerned at the indiscriminate and bureaucratic way in which some rules of entry to the United States have been applied. My hon. Friend raised a case involving a constituent in which US immigration officials clearly overstepped the mark. The hon. Member for Dundee, East raised another case. Scanning some of the press cuttings about this situation in recent weeks and even in the last few days, one can see that there are many other cases.</p>
	<p pid=".254.0/11">Those travelling without a visa when an immigration officer deems that one is needed are at risk of being incarcerated and sent home on the first available flight. That is what happened to Mrs. Mordente and, as we have heard, when US officials incarcerate someone, they do not mess around. Some people have complained that they were shackled to the floor during questioning. Why is it necessary in this day and age to shackle or manacle people? Such action is completely disproportionate. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk said, Robert Bonner, the US Commissioner for Customs and Border Protection, has admitted that some treatment of British visitors has been &quot;grossly disproportionate&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".254.0/12">Last year, two Britons who were frequent travellers to the United States were detained for several hours in a detention room at Miami airport. They were questioned for several more hours about why they had visited America five times in a year. Others have had immigration officials delving into their credit card details and telephone numbers. Kevin McKay, a UK citizen, had to go through a six-week process before being allowed to fly to the United States in January 2004, because of speeding tickets that he accumulated in this country eight years ago. Such a response is disproportionate. In applying the anti-terrorism Act, under which travellers have to list any criminal offences that they have committed, US immigration officials have decided to include minor motoring offences. That might prevent me, with two speeding tickets in the last five years, from getting in&mdash;but at least I do not wear red socks. There must be a balance.</p>
	<p pid=".254.0/13">Under the normal rules, citizens of 27 countries, including the UK, are entitled to enter the United States for business or pleasure for up to 90 days without a visa. Sometimes, however, through no fault of their own&mdash;often because they have fallen ill&mdash;people are unable to leave within that time. Following 9/11 and until recently, if such people were caught while trying to leave the USA, they were arrested and detained for a number of hours, until they could be found a place on a flight home; generally, they would have missed the flight that they were trying to catch. Since August, the authorities have relaxed that policy. They no longer detain people but simply require them to apply for a visa for future travel to the USA. We welcome that change of policy towards travellers who, for entirely innocent reasons, may have overstayed their 90-day residence period in the United States.</p>
	<p pid=".254.0/14">I shall, however, raise one other specific concern. In 1952, at the height of the cold war, which my hon. Friend remembers well, the United States created a separate classification of visa, called type I, for journalists, who were no longer allowed to travel as normal business people. When the hysteria of the 1950s died down, the immigration authorities stopped applying that rule, and journalists&mdash;most of whom, I think, are normal people&mdash;travelled under the same conditions as other business travellers. They made the same use of visa waiver programmes as the rest of us.</p>
	<p pid=".254.0/15">Since 9/11, however, officials have reactivated the type I requirement, although they have not publicised the fact. Journalists now have to apply for a visa, and that process is no longer easy. They have to pay a fee of &pound;60, dial a premium-rate telephone number to arrange a compulsory interview and, if they are from Syria, Iran or North Korea, or if they are male and between 16 and 45, complete a supplementary form listing every country that they have visited in the last 10 years. They may have to wait weeks, if not months, for the application to be processed. As a result, journalists have been detained.</p>
	<p pid=".254.0/16">A well-known case involved Elena Lappin, a British citizen married to an American, who had previously entered the United States telling officials that she was visiting as a journalist without a visa. At Los Angeles airport last April&mdash;Los Angeles seems to come up from time to time in these discussions&mdash;she was arrested for not having a type I visa. She was interrogated for four hours, body searched, fingerprinted, photographed, handcuffed and forced to spend the night in a cell in a detention facility in central Los Angeles. We can see from television programmes that that is apparently not a pleasant experience. She spent another day as a detainee at the airport before flying back to London. We have already heard about Ian McEwan's experience of trying to enter the United States.</p>
	<p pid=".254.0/17">Is not it odd that a country whose Congress is constitutionally forbidden to abridge freedom of speech should so restrict travel by foreign journalists? A US Congresswoman, Zoe Lofgren, is currently sponsoring a Bill to reclassify journalists as ordinary business people, making them eligible for the visa waiver programme and putting an end to the current shambles. Perhaps the Minister is making representations about that; we should like to hear from him if so.</p>
	<p pid=".254.0/18">We are keen to hear from the Minister about all that he has been doing and will do, particularly about the two constituency cases in question. It is worth saying again that I recognise the difficulty of these matters. We must understand the shock caused by 9/11 and we recognise the duty of every nation to defend its borders and citizens, but we live in a globalizing world, and the free movement of people, goods and services plays an important part in the global economy. Although the issues are primarily a matter for the US Government, given the strength of our relationship with the USA and the impact of the policies on UK citizens, we are entitled to expect that our Government will be active and robust in dealing with these concerns.</p>
	<p pid=".254.0/19">It would be good to receive answers from the Minister to the questions that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk and the hon. Member for Dundee, East have put to him today. I hope that he will intervene more effectively in the case of Mr. and Mrs. Pattison. They are entitled to an explanation from the US Government and from Interpol. They are also entitled to an apology and to closure.</p>
	<p pid=".254.0/20">I hope that the Minister will also intervene more effectively in the case of Mrs. Mordente. It seems to me that she should be able to visit her grandchildren in the United States and obtain a visa from the US authorities. What will the Minister do to establish better channels of communication with his US counterparts? Will he make the most robust representations to help the US Government to get the balance right, to make more friends around the world and to treat UK citizens more fairly?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-20.258.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1083" speakername="Denis MacShane" speakeroffice="The Minister for Europe"  colnum="258"  time="010:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/halltext/41020h01.htm#41020h01_spmin0">
	<p pid=".258.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1227" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> on securing the debate, and on the measured way in which he and other hon. Members made their points.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/2">One reflection needs to be made before I go on with the main part of my speech: we all, as constituency MPs, deal with distressing cases of British citizens who find that they cannot secure easy entry into the UK for relatives&mdash;spouses, cousins, brothers, uncles and aunts&mdash;because of our fairly strict immigration controls. I expect that we might take it amiss if a foreign Government, through their Parliament or Ministers, criticised our immigration controls, the measures that we had decided were necessary to control people's means of entering this country.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/3">Many hon. Members have rightly praised our long-standing and close relationship with the United States, and I think that I am safe in saying that the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk is a staunch supporter of the transatlantic alliance. Hon. Members are right to raise individual constituency cases, but we should not let the debate become a generalised criticism of America, for we should not be comfortable if other countries criticised our mechanisms because their citizens were not given swift access to the UK or were turned back at points of entry.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/4">The individual cases raised are of deep concern to the Government. I would be happy if an American reporter were sitting in the Chamber, reporting the debate for <i>The New York Times </i>or the <i>Washington Post. </i>As a former president of the National Union of Journalists, I am delighted that an American Congresswoman is promoting a Bill declaring that journalists are human beings and should be allowed to travel freely.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/5">However, we must set these cases in the context of the great concern that the United States has felt since 9/11. It was not analogous to the attack on Pearl harbour: it was far worse in terms of loss of life, and the attack did not take place on an island possession thousands of miles from the American coastline but was at the heart of the United States. It was an act of aggression by what Joschka Fischer described yesterday, at a lecture that I heard him give at the London School of Economics, as those promoting the new totalitarianism of jihadi terrorism. We must have regard not only to the extraordinary new sensitivity in the United States after that single act of aggression perpetrated by people who were able to enter America because of lax immigration controls, but to the necessity of forging a permanent alliance along many fronts with the United States and the democracies of the world against what Joschka Fischer rightly calls new totalitarianism.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/6">In the case of Mr. Pattison, which I shall return to, there may have been a distinct and separate problem with Interpol. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/785" name="Alistair Carmichael">The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase> raised the question whether allegations involving a relatively small sum&mdash;it is good to hear a Scottish Member describe &pound;6,000 as a small sum&mdash;should feature permanently on Interpol computers. Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1259" name="Gary Streeter">the hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)</phrase>, I have three points on my driving licence for a speeding fine, and it is frightening to think that that could prevent me from travelling around the world.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/7">The United Kingdom enjoys a particularly close relationship with the United States. Bilateral relations are generally excellent and we are able to speak frankly to the US Administration whenever a problem such as that raised by the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk arises. He asked me how many complaints we have received from British nationals about problems entering the United States since 9/11, and the answer is that we have had 30 since June 2003. We have not received many complaints about physical and verbal abuse, but I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman a written reply to his question and place it in the Library of the House so that hon. Members are aware of it. Like other hon. Members, I congratulate those newspapers that have drawn attention to the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/8">I find the idea of manacling and shackling citizens of a country in alliance with the United States in Iraq and NATO wholly unacceptable. Were we to do that to any American citizen whom we decided to deport for whatever reason, there would be an absolute outcry. I hope that there would, because the idea of shackling and manacling anyone accused of anything but the most grievous or heinous crimes or acts of terrorism is wholly unacceptable, and I am happy to place that on the record on behalf of the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/9">The US Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration matters, has implemented tough, enhanced immigration policies. Those measures extend to all those who travel to the United States and affect all nationalities including British citizens. Immigration procedures are a matter for individual countries. We have no locus to intervene in the immigration affairs of other countries, just as I would not accept foreign interference in our immigration procedures. It is for the US authorities to decide whom they admit to their country. However, the Government have, of course, a duty to take an interest when cases of unacceptable treatment of our nationals by foreign immigration authorities are brought to our attention.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/10">Some 3.8 million British nationals visit the United States every year. Most of them travel on the US visa waiver programme, which allows nationals of certain countries to travel visa-free to the USA for private or business visits of 90 days or less. The vast majority pass through US immigration without trouble. However, over the past 18 months or so, we have received complaints from a small but significant number of British nationals&mdash;about 30 since June last year, as I said&mdash;who have been subjected to sometimes aggressive treatment, including manacling and shackling, by US immigration officials.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/11">Most complainants had committed relatively minor US visa infringements. The manner in which they had been treated seemed to bear little relation to the so-called errors that they had committed. We have raised individual complaints with the US authorities and encouraged complainants to write to the US embassy and the Department of Homeland Security. The US authorities have apologised for the handling of some cases, but not for their detention policy as a whole. That is why the Government decided that we should take direct action, at senior level, with the US authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/12">In early July, the Minister with responsibility for consular matters, my right hon. Friend Baroness Symons, summoned the charg&eacute; d'affaires at the US embassy to the Foreign Office to highlight our concerns about the treatment of our nationals at US ports of entry. Obliging a foreign ambassador or his representative to come to the Foreign Office is a serious statement under the normal terms of diplomatic protocol. I stress that to underline our concern about what is happening to UK nationals going to the United States.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/13">Baroness Symons spoke at length about the problem in general and about individual cases. She said that the matter was of great concern to the Government and asked that the United States take action to improve the manner in which our nationals were treated at US ports of entry when there was a question about their immigration status, and the conditions in which they were held in the event that they were detained. The charg&eacute; d'affaires undertook to convey our concerns to the relevant US authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/14">In late August, my right hon. Friend received a letter from the US embassy referring to the action that the US authorities had taken since her meeting with the charg&eacute; d'affaires. Our concerns had been investigated personally by Robert Bonner, the Commissioner for Customs and Border Protection, whose bureau has 35,000 employees and is part of the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS undertook to implement measures to improve conditions for what it called &quot;immigration violators&quot;, those who are guilty of minor US visa infractions.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/15">Those measures include the granting of greater discretion at ports of entry, to allow the admission of individuals who do not pose a terrorist or criminal threat to the United States. I only hope that a case such as that of Mrs. Mordente, which was raised by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1059" name="Iain Luke">the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Luke)</phrase>, could not happen again if sensible discretion were exercised by officials at ports of entry who were confronted with a granny who had stayed in the United States for 13 days longer than she should have done to be with her family.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/16">In addition, three things have been established. The first is a unit to evaluate decisions made by officials on the ground at ports of entry. People responsible for apparently inappropriate decisions or behaviour will be held accountable and required to justify their actions. The second is a working group to tackle issues of courtesy and to institute a training programme for all employees on maintaining professional and courteous standards while enforcing the law. The third is a system whereby each complaint will be tracked and reviewed at national level to ensure that appropriate action is taken.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/17">I hope that those changes will directly affect the vast majority of the British nationals who, on arrival at US ports and airports, are considered by the authorities to be immigration violators. However, it is not just British nationals who will benefit; the measures will apply to citizens of all nations who travel to the US under its visa waiver programme. The new US detention measures will not affect those who are detained for reasons such as terrorism, criminal activity or possible illegal immigration.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/18">During a visit to the UK in late September, Robert Bonner told journalists that his bureau had received complaints from all over the world about US immigration methods, but he was particularly struck by the number from the UK. He added that the reputation of the United States would be at stake if changes were not made to improve detention and deportation methods for visitors and to give his officers discretionary powers to allow entry to visitors who had committed only minor visa violations. I have sometimes described the United States as the world's greatest self-correcting democracy, and I hope that the points raised by hon. Members, which are being taken very seriously by Baroness Symons, have been put forcefully to the US authorities and will have some impact.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/19">I do want to go into great personal detail about the case of Mr. and Mrs. Pattison, which the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk raised. There is clearly a problem as regards Interpol and the Government of Qatar, and we have received no documentation of any sort from the authorities in Qatar to clarify their position on the matter. I shall ask officials to write to the Qatari embassy in this country for a clear and definitive statement of their position on Mr. Pattison and for clarification whether any documentation relating to his case has been sent to Interpol.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/20">Hon. Members must forgive me if I sound as though I am passing the ball to another Department, but, technically, relationships with Interpol fall under the aegis of the Home Office and, in particular, the National Criminal Intelligence Service. I assure the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk and the House that I shall write personally to Mr. David Lock, the chairman of NCIS and a former colleague of ours. I shall send him a copy of the <i>Hansard </i>report of this debate and ask him to communicate directly with Interpol so that we can find out what is going on. If it would be helpful, I shall also ask him to meet Mr. Pattison. Once we have all the documents and facts in front of us, we can then at least seek to clear up that part of the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/21">I hope that hon. Members accept that the Government have been active, and successfully so, in improving the detention conditions for British nationals who have travelled to the United States on the visa waiver programme. Indeed, in achieving better treatment for our own citizens and making the robust interventions that I have reported to hon. Members, we have succeeded in achieving the same for nationals of other countries.</p>
	<p pid=".258.0/22">I am also happy to write to the National Union of Journalists and the International Federation of Journalists to seek their views on the new I visa, which the hon. Member for South-West Devon raised on behalf of the Opposition. Our US colleagues have indicated that our efforts have brought about much-needed change in that regard. We are pleased about that, but we are not complacent. We shall carefully monitor the implementation of the new US measures, and we shall not hesitate to raise with the US Administration any problems that we observe or which are reported to us.</p>

	<p pid=".261.0/1">I welcome the Minister's broad comments and thank him for offering to use his good offices with Interpol. I seek his advice on the case of my constituent and that raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1059" name="Iain Luke">the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Luke)</phrase>. I accept that the Foreign Office can intervene and advise the American Government of its dissatisfaction, although it cannot tell them what to do, but how can I obtain from the American Government some recognition of the fact that my constituent was treated arbitrarily and unfairly, and some assurance that his name will not appear on the Department of Homeland Security computer, which would cause him problems if he ever wanted to return to America or, indeed, visit allied countries? Similarly, speaking on behalf of the hon. Gentleman, how can his constituent receive redress for what is effectively a 10-year bar?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-20.262.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1083" speakername="Denis MacShane" colnum="262"  time="010:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/halltext/41020h01.htm#41020h01_spnew5">
	<p pid=".262.0/1">I assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall ask officials to contact the American embassy over the case of Mrs. Mordente. A Dundee granny who loves America and wants to visit should not have to wait until 2012, and for another two or three American presidents to come to office&mdash;although I am sure that we will still have a Labour Government&mdash;to see her grandchildren again. However, I stress that the decision must be for the American authorities. On Mr. Pattison, Interpol has told my officials that the warrant is still active, so the problem has to be between Qatar, Mr. Pattison and Interpol. However, I assure the Chamber and the hon. Gentleman that we will do our best for Mr. Pattison.</p>
	<p pid=".262.0/2">I make two general points in closing. First, it would be helpful if the travel pages of our newspapers highlighted the necessity for all of us to look carefully at our visas and passports and at the new requirements, particularly for those travelling to the United States.</p>
	<p pid=".262.0/3">Throughout British history famous writers have been barred from entering America. For example, Graham Greene was stopped back in the 1950s at the height of the cold war because it was alleged that he had a loose connection with the Communist party. The case of Ian McEwan has been raised, and the case of the singer formerly known as Cat Stevens caused a great fuss here. The Foreign Secretary raised the issue directly with the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell. My message is that we shall vigorously take up all the questions and problems that have been raised. However, there is a duty on us all not only to criticise the United States, but to understand that new rules are in place and to ensure that we comply, just as we expect everyone coming to our country to comply with our rules.</p>
	<p pid=".262.0/4">My second point is that we now live in a globalised economy. British business men roam all over the world, rightly, working professionally and getting involved in investments and financial transactions. Sometimes allegations are made, however. I do not refer in any way to Mr. Pattison, but I know of cases involving allegations to do with financial transactions that one party or another does not consider appropriate. Governments can step in on behalf of their nationals and accuse British citizens of improper behaviour over what would be a civil matter rather than a criminal matter, to do with contractual obligations, payments honoured or otherwise, and so on.</p>
	<p pid=".262.0/5">Once people's names are on a computer somewhere, it is, I accept, difficult to have them removed. Both as a constituency MP and as a Foreign Office Minister, therefore, I advise people to be purer almost than Caesar's wife. People should be extraordinarily careful not to become involved in any business activity that would not be the norm in UK business, but which they might feel they could get away with because they were dealing with a far-away Government, well beyond the jurisdiction of British courts. I try to put the matter as delicately as possible and I in no way refer to the hon. Gentleman's constituent. However, as a Foreign Office Minister, I find that the issue is one of the most troublesome that I have to deal with.</p>
	<p pid=".262.0/6">My message to American journalists is please to report such cases on the front page, to show the concern of the House of Commons about manacling and shackling, and the treatment meted out to the Pattisons, Mrs. Mordente and other British nationals. My message to the editors of travel pages is please to highlight the fact that America is a wonderful place. I love taking my family there on holiday, but new rules are in place and we have to respect them.</p>
	<p pid=".262.0/7">My message to the editors of the business pages is to warn business men that a wrongly signed contract, a dishonoured cheque or an investment that is not made according to the rules and with complete transparency that could be defended in a British court, may mean that their names end up on lists that could cause them trouble. Until we have defeated what Joschka Fischer described as the new totalitarianism&mdash;the onslaught of organised jihadi terrorists against western values and all countries that are committed to democracy and the rule of law&mdash;these problems will continue to plague us. However, I assure the House that the FCO will defend British citizens and be robust with American and other authorities whom we think are not treating them properly. I hope that hon. Members accept that we have obtained some redress from the United States and new ways of operating. I am grateful to hon. Members who have spoken in this important debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-20.264.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1180" speakername="John Randall" colnum="264"  time="010:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/halltext/41020h02.htm#41020h02_spnew0">
	<p pid=".264.1/1">I am very grateful to have the opportunity to raise a matter of concern to a great many of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/2">The Ministry of Defence records office is based in the constituency of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> who is, in many respects, my hon. Friend. I hope, with your permission, Mr. O'Brien, and that of the Minister, he will be able to take part in the debate. The matter affects our constituents who have raised their concerns about what is going on in the records office. It was sold off to a private company, TNT, which is closing the site in Hayes and transferring all the files to another site in the midlands.</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/3">I shall not dwell on the rights and wrongs of privatisation; suffice it to say that saying either that all privatisation is wrong, or that all privatisation is right, is not the way forward. However, in certain areas, privatisation must be done with great care. That is not my point. The records office holds the personal and personnel files of every British sailor, soldier, airman and woman, some of which go back to the first world war, although some were lost in a bombing in 1940. It is not just a highly important historical archive; it is intensely personal for many families.</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/4">I have not visited the site myself, although my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington has done so. I have relied on evidence that has been brought to me, and what appears to be going on is nothing short of a national scandal. Hon. Members know from experience, especially in our constituency surgeries, that we sometimes have to take what is said with equanimity, if not a pinch of salt. However, although the people concerned might be said to have an axe to grind because they will eventually lose their jobs, I worked for some years in the private sector and dealt with many members of the public and staff, and I feel that I can detect when people's worries are genuine. That is why I wanted to raise the matter today. It needs to be brought into the open. I am sure that the Minister will try to answer my questions and if he, like me, is not entirely convinced that all is well, I hope that the matter will be looked into as a matter of urgency.</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/5">My constituents have come to me in almost the same distress as many people would experience in relation to personal family documents. They have a sense of ownership of the records that comes from working there for many years. It is rather like the sad state of affairs when someone dies and someone else comes in and years of a life are almost thrown away. I get the impression that that is how many of those people feel. One person who wrote to me said:</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/6" class="indent">&quot;It is horrendous. It has to be seen to be believed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/7">TNT, the company that took over, apparently stated at the beginning of its tenure that there was no problem with handling the archives&mdash;it was no different to handling tins of baked beans. I have spent a good part of my life in the retail sector, and I know that each item of goods has to be handled differently. I do not believe that handling valuable archives should be treated in the same way as a commodity such as baked beans.</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/8">It seems to me that the company has no experience of archiving or dealing with archives. It has more than 200 agency workers on the site. I have real concerns about the security clearance of some of those workers, and want to be assured that that issue is being handled properly. Some of the material held at the site is of a highly confidential nature and would be covered, if not by the Official Secrets Acts, certainly by the data protection legislation. I understand that the security clearance needed for that type of work would take a considerable amount of time to arrange&mdash;one has only to think of the detail required when our staff in the House apply for passes. I would also be interested to know what the charges for such security clearance would be. I get the distinct impression that, at best, some of those measures are not being fully implemented, and I have serious concerns about that.</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/9">I have heard that the behaviour of some of the agency staff leaves a lot to be desired. I have heard of towel holders being ripped off the wall in the gents' toilets, of the bin being used as a toilet, and of a roll of paper towels being put in a microwave, which was then switched on and left. Food and drink have been consumed near the files. There have been reports of people fighting, and even playing football within the archive. I know that such things would not have occurred with the quality of staff provided by the MOD.</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/10">It has also been reported that two cords on the fire doors have been cut&mdash;the doors that would be shut in case of fire. As one can imagine, a fire in an archive is probably the worst disaster that can happen. It is also reported that files are being packed into boxes with the bottoms falling out, and that files are being torn. The reviewers have complained that the files are torn when they receive them. Aircraft board of inquiry files have been separated from the main file, and there will be no chance of marrying them up to the main file once they have been relocated to people who have no experience in that area. In one instance of which I was told, a file relating to the Queen Mother was left lying on a shelf, because an agency worker did not know what to do with it. An ex-MOD worker had to search for hours to find that file, but was told by TNT that they had searched for too long and were being too conscientious.</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/11">Many files are kept in caged areas for obvious reasons, and many are for UK eyes only&mdash;I believe that that is the designation&mdash;but it seems to be quite acceptable for any agency staff to go into those caged areas to pack files for relocation as long as they are accompanied by a member of the TNT staff, who could not possibly keep an eye on the number of people in that area at a given time. Agency staff have been seen reading the files on several occasions.</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/12">If only a small number of those reports are true&mdash;and I believe that the issue involves more than that&mdash;the most distressing aspect is what is happening to individuals servicemen's documents: things are being separated in the move, and things that should be in files are disappearing. With the number of files that we are talking about, the chances of them being put back together in the appropriate files is remote.</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/13">As I said, agency staff have been seen reading personnel files. The vast majority of files relate to ordinary men and women of all ranks and they will be important to their families. However, among those files, are the files of people who became national figures. No doubt, some of their personal details would have financial value, and I am concerned that such files could fall into the wrong hands. There are obvious security questions about people who served in certain parts of the world.</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/14">Some of the records have to be transferred by someone personally, with a secret file. They have to go by aeroplane; someone told me that they were put on a 1 pm plane at Heathrow and were expected to be back by about 6 pm. The Ministry of Defence ruling would be that a file of such importance should be picked up by a branch that should have all the necessary paperwork from its office and a secure, locked case in which to carry the file. However, it seems that some of the rules are not being adhered to.</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/15">A problem for people who try to trace relatives' files is the increasing number of &quot;no traces&quot;&mdash;the self-evident expression meaning that the file cannot be found&mdash;that come up. That phenomenon may be extending to the Army Medals Office in Droitwich: there is some evidence that it also increasingly has &quot;no traces&quot; coming back. There is only a certain amount of time that can be allocated to tracing a file before a charge is introduced. The Minister will know much more about that this than I do, but the medals office is being relocated. I worry that once such work is in private hands and charging comes in, there will not be any incentive to get the work done quickly, and that some of the savings that the MOD has introduced to try to cut down expenditure might be wasted if it ends up having to pay a lot more to trace records.</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/16">I understand that there is a points system for breaches under the privatisation contract ruling so that the contractor could lose the contract if it loses enough points. Will the Minister tell us about that and whether all the breaches have been investigated?</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/17">We will soon be wearing our poppies for Remembrance day. At this moment, in various parts of the world, our servicemen and women are putting their lives on the line for this country. It is for them and in memory of those who served before&mdash;not only those who gave their lives, but those who carried on into civilian life with distinction&mdash;that we must show respect for this valuable and irreplaceable historic archive. I hope that now that this issue has been highlighted, the Minister will instigate an immediate independent investigation into what is really going on in the MOD records office.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-20.266.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" speakername="John McDonnell" colnum="266"  time="011:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/halltext/41020h02.htm#41020h02_spnew1">
	<p pid=".266.0/1">I return the compliment to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1180" name="John Randall">the. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)</phrase> by paying tribute to him for securing this debate, and for the support that he has given the staff at the Bourne avenue site, and my constituents.</p>
	<p pid=".266.0/2">This is not just a constituency matter, but one of national importance. I know that my right hon. Friend the Minister will understand its significance when I say that the records for the Bloody Sunday inquiry were secured at this site. The staff worked intensely hard to ensure that the inquiry received all the information that it required. It is significant not only as a historical archive, but for its relevance to today and today's service people.</p>
	<p pid=".266.0/3">I have been dealing with the issue since 2002, when privatisation was first mooted. The issues that we raised in the community and with Ministers concerned security of service, the records themselves, the staff and the future of the site. The tragedy is that I do not think that privatisation would have gone ahead today. Under the new Treasury rules, it would have been below the new &pound;20 million figure for which we would involve ourselves in such privatisations.</p>
	<p pid=".266.0/4">We were given assurances at the time of the privatisation proposal. The first was that the service would be maintained at a high quality. Secondly, we were assured that the records would be secure and, thirdly, that the staff would be cared for. We would, as employers, have a duty of care to ensure that they were redeployed and that they had a future that they could depend on.</p>
	<p pid=".266.0/5">Today, we have brought forward what can be described as anecdotal evidence of, at times, chaos on the Bourne avenue site&mdash;lost records, badly handled files, damaged files, failures of delivery of service and a failure to supervise staff that is putting the site at risk. There is a real risk to the long-term future of this valuable historical archive.</p>
	<p pid=".266.0/6">I have tabled parliamentary questions before asking about the number of complaints that have been received. Early this year, we were told that there had been 46 mostly minor complaints. My most recent question received the answer this week that there had been a number of complaints, but that they were only verbal and none had yet been put in writing. The staff should be listened to, because complaints are coming from within the site as well as from other departments.</p>
	<p pid=".266.0/7">We need to consider what procedures we need to allow people to come forward straightforwardly and with some protection to establish what is actually happening on the site and what breakdowns in service delivery are happening. I suggest that the Minister considers whether we can establish a whistleblowing procedure on the site and in those departments that are receiving the services of the Bourne avenue site, so that we can have a proper consultation about the reality of service delivery.</p>
	<p pid=".266.0/8">Staff working on the site have extreme concerns about the security of the documents. That is permeating into other departments. I tabled parliamentary questions about the issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge: that of security clearance for staff. We are told that roughly 180 staff have received security clearance, while another 80 to 100 have received basic clearance. Basic clearance, from my understanding of previous parliamentary questions, involves references being taken up with past employers and perhaps a criminal records check at best. The rules whereby those staff that are security cleared have to supervise basically cleared staff are not being adhered to. Basically cleared staff&mdash;they are largely agency staff&mdash;are not adequately supervised. In our view, that is putting the security of the site and of the records at risk.</p>
	<p pid=".266.0/9">On the site, we have a dedicated loyal staff who have served this country and the Government well. Some of them are with us today, as are their union representatives. They are professional staff, and they have been an excellent example of commitment and service. The promised redeployment to other MOD sites has not occurred. Redeployment to TNT facilities means that the jobs that they have been offered are not of a like kind, so many of them will now lose their employment.</p>
	<p pid=".266.0/10">I ask the Minister to meet me, my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge and the trade union representatives to discuss the matter. I also call for an independent investigation, and to allow whistleblowing exercises to take place on the site and within departments so that we can get to the truth of the matter and resolve the threat to that historic archive. Again, I remind the Minister of the significance of that archive to the future of our servicemen.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-20.268.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/990" speakername="Adam Ingram" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence"  colnum="268"  time="011:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/halltext/41020h02.htm#41020h02_spmin0">
	<p pid=".268.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1180" name="John Randall">the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)</phrase> on securing this debate, which is on an important topic, and I recognise the efforts of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" name="John McDonnell">the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase>. Both have monitored the situation closely. I fully recognise their reasons and the interests of their constituents.</p>
	<p pid=".268.0/2">My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, who has been dealing with the issue, asks me to apologise for his unavoidable absence. I shall deal with the matter on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid=".268.0/3">Like the hon. Member for Uxbridge, I have not visited the facility. However, I am told that it is worth a visit so that one can see the extent of the problems that it faces&mdash;not because of the staff issue but because of the inadequate nature of the infrastructure. I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has visited the site, but I recommend that he does so. If he undertakes such a visit, some of the other issues that have been mentioned may be raised then.</p>
	<p pid=".268.0/4">I emphasise the Government's commitment to modernising and improving public services. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman and my Friend would not disagree with that prerequisite. My Department, like others, seeks to deliver quality services efficiently and effectively. The records services provided at Hayes for a number of Government departments and agencies, and managed by the MOD, is no exception.</p>
	<p pid=".268.0/5">In 1997, a study recommended that alternative ways of providing that service should be explored. Again, I would expect the hon. Member for Uxbridge to recognise that one should always look for better ways of doing things. Significant investment would be required to provide a modern and effective archive service, and public and private sector solutions were both fully explored. That resulted in discussions with three consortiums, two of which submitted bids. Although the bids were similar, the TNT and ProLogis bid offered a better quality records service and a lower risk property solution.</p>
	<p pid=".268.0/6">The overall objective was to provide the required flexibility and give value for money for the customer departments. The contract therefore provided for the contractor to bear a significant risk, as well as to construct, commission and operate a new facility, to maintain and operate the Hayes archive for an interim period, and then to dispose of the Hayes site for redevelopment.</p>
	<p pid=".268.0/7">The service elements of the contract cover the depositing and storage of records, their retrieval and dispatch, and, when instructed by the department concerned, the destruction of records. A significant enhancement of the previous service is the requirement to produce an electronic index of the file holdings. Given his commercial background, I hope that the hon. Member for Uxbridge recognises the importance of such an approach.</p>
	<p pid=".268.0/8">The changes will enable the contractor to track and trace requests for files; it also supports departments when discharging their responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, which, as hon. Members will recall, comes fully into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January</phrase> next year.</p>
	<p pid=".268.0/9">The final negotiations were concluded in September 2003, and the Ministry of Defence awarded the contract to TNT (UK) Ltd., with ProLogis Ltd., on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-18">18 September 2003</phrase>. The contract provides for TNT (UK) Ltd to take over functions previously carried out by civil service staff at the archive.</p>
	<p pid=".268.0/10">I shall touch briefly on how we handled staff matters. The staff were given the option, under a preference exercise, either to transfer to the contractor under arrangements under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981, or to remain within Government employment.</p>
	<p pid=".268.0/11">When the contract was awarded, a three-month trade union consultation was conducted between TNT and the Public and Commercial Services Union, following a code of practice agreed between the Ministry of Defence, the trade unions and industry. The process was successfully concluded by vesting day, <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-18">18 December 2003</phrase>, when the contract commenced. Forty-seven staff transferred to the new company, and after the award of the contract TNT launched the construction of a new archive building in Swadlincote, south Derbyshire. The facility is far more modern and advanced in design, has better fire protection&mdash;the hon. Member for Uxbridge raised that point&mdash;is more energy efficient, and is generally far more suitable for its purpose, than the buildings at Hayes</p>
	<p pid=".268.0/12">The new building at Swadlincote meets all the requirements of the Cabinet Office manual of protective security, which is not true of the Hayes building. The facility was completed ahead of schedule, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-29">29 April 2004</phrase>, with final completion and handover, subject to the usual rectification of minor defects, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-06">6 October 2004</phrase>. The facility has a storage capability of 1 million archive boxes, with space for expansion if necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".268.0/13">When TNT took over operation of the Hayes site on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-18">18 December 2003</phrase>, it immediately began the indexing phase of the contract, to create a complete catalogue of the archive holdings. The concept&mdash;I hope that the hon. Member for Uxbridge will agree with the approach&mdash;is to capture essential information about each of the approximately 12 million items stored at the Hayes site to create an accurate and comprehensive database of the records held. The intention is to enable rapid and accurate location of files for immediate dispatch to the customer when required.</p>
	<p pid=".268.0/14">My hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington mentioned one of the big issues that required the accurate recall of, and access to, important files going back many years&mdash;the case he mentioned was a major inquiry, but it seems to me that the same should apply to an individual record. My hon. Friend, who has followed the Saville inquiry, will know how some information kept turning up. That was not because of inadequacies on the part of the staff, but because of a less than adequate filing system. That is why we had to try for a fundamental change in practice.</p>
	<p pid=".268.0/15">The contract with TNT applies fully the Government's strict and robust security standards, extending to the physical environment, delivery services, IT systems and personnel. The hon. Member for Uxbridge raised a concern about the security vetting of the agency staff at the facility.</p>

	<p pid=".270.1/1">I will give way if I have time towards the end; I should rather cover all the points that have been raised, if possible. There may be time for interventions.</p>
	<p pid=".270.1/2">As to security clearance, TNT personnel, all agency staff and permanent staff employed by TNT at Hayes and Swadlincote are subject to security checks and clearances in accordance with Government policy. Those security clearances are granted on the basis of the same criteria and standards that apply to civil servants employed on similar work.</p>
	<p pid=".270.1/3">The Defence Vetting Agency has made significant improvements over the past few years, and the clearances are being processed smoothly, but not, as has been suggested, on a preferential basis. Although the matter was not raised in the debate, I am aware of comments about the private company being given preference over civil servants who wanted clearance, but that was not the case. All staff are vetted to basic or security level.</p>
	<p pid=".270.1/4">The hon. Member for Uxbridge raised the matter of people going into secure areas. I hear what he says, but I am advised that TNT allows only appropriate staff to see UK-eyes-only files. He also raised the issue of the reading of files. It seems to me that, as an indexing process is being undertaken, it may be necessary to open a file to identify what is in it, and, we hope, establish a correlation between the index name and the file content. It would not surprise me that files had been read. However, I should hardly think that all the millions of files involved would have been read.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-20.270.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/990" speakername="Adam Ingram" colnum="270"  time="011:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/halltext/41020h02.htm#41020h02_spnew5">
	<p pid=".270.3/1">I am not going to get into a long debate on this, but I return to the Saville inquiry. People would have to read the contents of a document in detail to see whether it was relevant to that inquiry. It is not simply a question of looking at the heading. Sometimes the content beneath it might also give a trace elsewhere. The process is not as simple as the hon. Gentleman suggests. I ask him to reflect on that. If something is for indexing, it is better to give the best index. If it is for retrieval and examination, it should be done authoritatively and, I hope, exhaustively, depending on the nature of the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".270.3/2">All the Government records stored at the Hayes site have been retained either to meet a continuing business need or to discharge the obligations of departments under the Public Records Acts to preserve important documents. TNT is fully aware of the requirement properly to handle and protect all the Ministry of Defence material and other material now in its charge. To provide additional assurance that the contractual requirements are being met, the MOD has set up a contract management team to work alongside TNT to assist in the transition of activity to TNT and from Hayes to Swadlincote and to undertake audits and reviews. That might go some way towards addressing the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington. If he is demanding more, the matter might be worthy of examination by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, but that is the sort of audit and review mechanism that we have put in place.</p>
	<p pid=".270.3/3">The team remains based mainly at Hayes, but it has begun a relocation that will make it more convenient to oversee activity at Swadlincote.</p>
	<p pid=".270.3/4">Let me deal with TNT's performance in running the archive. The contract includes a comprehensive performance measurement specification, which specifies two time targets for each category of records retrieval. Most retrievals must meet the earlier target, and almost all the remainder must meet the longer one. The required level of achievement against the more challenging time target increases as the months elapse after vesting day, which reflects the expectation that TNT's performance should improve.</p>
	<p pid=".270.3/5">I am advised that TNT has to date consistently fulfilled those targets for records retrieval. It is, however, keen to exceed those requirements&mdash;again, because we all recognise the importance of these records&mdash;and it has been working with the contract management team to investigate areas where performance could be improved.</p>
	<p pid=".270.3/6">Unfortunately, teething problems are likely to arise in a contract of this size and complexity. As the hon. Member for Uxbridge will know from his commercial background, not everything goes swimmingly when one is moving from one large operation to another and transferring several lines on to a new computerised system, as in this case.</p>
	<p pid=".270.3/7">The contract management team is working with TNT to address these issues, which I am confident will be resolved because, again, we all recognise the important of these records. I agree that it would be worth comparing TNT's performance with the achievement before the contract was let. That would be a good thing to do, but it is simply not possible. The in-house team was not managed in the same, outcome-focused way, and it did not keep comparable performance statistics, so we had no baseline against which to assess it. That does not mean that we will not have new baselines for the new contract company.</p>
	<p pid=".270.3/8">Let me pay tribute to the dedication of the civil servants who operated the archive for many years in less than ideal conditions. That is why I suggest that a visit to the site might open eyes. In the past nine months, TNT has indexed more than 6 million records and has started to create the database to which I referred.</p>
	<p pid=".270.3/9">Before I make other points, I assure hon. Members that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will read what has been said in this debate. I shall speak to him, but the reform will be a matter for him. He views the process with the greatest seriousness, and we must ensure that what we are putting in place is as good as, or perhaps even better than, what went before.</p>

</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-20.273.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/836" speakername="Claire Curtis-Thomas" colnum="273"  time="014:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/halltext/41020h03.htm#41020h03_spnew0">
	<p pid=".273.1/1">I am delighted to stand here this afternoon, and I must declare an interest right away. This year, I have been immensely fortunate. I joined a scheme managed by the British Council in the UK to twin women Members of Parliament here with women MPs in parts of Africa, and I was fortunate enough to go to Zambia. First, a marvellous woman MP from Zambia, Mrs. Rosemary Chipambe, who represents the community of Nchelenge, spent a week with me, supported by the council, and then I went to see her.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/2">I am also delighted that the director general of the British Council in Zambia could be here today. That is an extraordinary coincidence. As hon. Members will know, applying for a debate in Westminster Hall does not necessarily mean that one will secure a debate here. I told the director general that I intended to apply for a debate when I got home, and I was immensely fortunate in being allocated one the following week. I doubt whether that has happened to many hon. Members, but it is a marvellous set of circumstances and coincidences. I apologise to all those who applied for debates and did not secure them, but at least we are here now to acknowledge the work that the British Council does in Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/3">It is unfortunate but true that most of us hear about Africa only when there is a problem. The difficulties faced by the continent are well known: poverty, lack of access to education and health facilities, HIV/AIDS, the thin skills base, difficulties with the democratic processes, which have not yet been embedded so as to provide equal opportunity and a guide against corruption, and poor leadership. However, that is not the whole story, and I shall use the debate to bring into focus a continent that all hon. Members need to understand better and engage with if we are to have a fair and prosperous world and communities that contribute rather than take from others.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/4">From what I have seen of Africa, I know that it is possible to make a positive difference there, but to do so we must change the nature of our engagement with the people of the continent. We must move from talking to listening and from showing to sharing. I certainly support such a move after my recent trip.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/5">The United Kingdom has had a long and multi-faceted relationship with Africa. It is complicated by a legacy of colonial resentment aggravated by present-day disputes over trade, for example, and the war on terror. It is important to understand that in both the UK and Africa, a generation has grown up that has no direct experience of colonialism, but whereas in this country colonialism is something in history books, many people in Africa, including many young people, still feel that they are living out its consequences.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/6">For almost 70 years, the British Council has been one of the UK's main channels for its engagement with Africa. The first group of student English teachers from west Africa came here to study under British Council auspices in 1936. In the same year, the council sent a British arts exhibition to Johannesburg. Its role in supporting the development of civil society, including those associated with the African National Congress, in the late 1980s and early 1990s&mdash;the dying years of apartheid in South Africa&mdash;helped to provide a strong base for high-level relations in today's era of majority rule. That was recognised by Kader Asmal, South Africa's Minister of Education, who said recently that the British Council continued to play a crucial role in South Africa in supporting its transformation agenda, particularly in the niche areas of education, the arts and culture.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/7">Over that time, the British Council has become a familiar presence on much of the African scene. Today, many Africans, from many different walks of life, have had experience of the UK through the council. One of them, Tejan Kabbah, who lived in the British Council's Hans Crescent hostel when he was a student in London, is now President of Sierra Leone. I met Tejan last year when I went to Sierra Leone. He had only glowing words of praise for the British Council. We have to be immensely proud of an organisation that, through its assistance and support, sees today one of its former luminaries, as it were, as President of Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/8">In Ghana, President Kufuor also speaks of his student days in the British Council library in Kumasi. Opening the council's new IT-based knowledge and learning centre in Accra earlier this year, he contrasted today's high-tech facilities and its pioneering access for Ghanaians with the World Bank's global distance learning network, saying,</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/9" class="indent">&quot;The services of the British Council provide a vital backdrop to strengthening the formal diplomatic and bilateral relations between our two countries&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/10">The experience of the British Council in Africa&mdash;it would be well for all of us to listen to what it has to say&mdash;is that given a mixed history of mixed access to opportunities, there is a suspicion of western motives across the continent. If we in this country want to engage with Africans we need to work with them in ways that they believe are of benefit to them, not just to us&mdash;practical help rather than patronage.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/11">From what I have seen of the British Council's work, that is what I believe we are doing. We are not patronising; we are desperately trying to help and engage communities about which we care and feel passionately. I welcome the active role that the British Council is playing to ensure that its approach is tailored to the principles of the NEPAD&mdash;New Partnership for Africa's Development&mdash;initiative, which seeks firmly to ensure that ownership lies with the Africans themselves. I was also pleased to see that the council is working with the Commission for Africa and has attached a senior member of staff to work inside the commission. That is a fantastic initiative from our Prime Minister that needs to be applauded.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/12">Today the British Council is represented in 19 countries across sub-Saharan Africa and manages a turnover of almost &pound;18 million. Given that the British Council programme reaches tens of thousands of Africans, that strikes me as good value for money. When we factor in the wider reach that the British Council is achieving through the cascading of its work through change agents, we see that it is clear that it is having a wider and deeper impact than the sums of money would suggest. Let us take, for example, the numbers reached through partnership of education reform or English language capacity building, which is a particular forte&mdash;a jewel in our crown&mdash;for the British Council in Zambia.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/13">It is clear that the prospects of many millions of people have been improved by the British Council's work. It is also having an impact through new and imaginative approaches. It has a syndicated music programme called &quot;Selector&quot;, broadcasting the best of contemporary British music to audiences of hundreds of thousands of Africans every week, making the return on the investment even greater.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/14">I wish to take a few moments to tell hon. Members an anecdote. I visited the community of Nchelenge, which has nothing: no water or electricity. It is a very poor community of 130,000 people in north-west Africa. There is a hospital of sorts run by a missionary of nuns. When they asked me for a meal I was delighted to go, because the accommodation in Nchelenge is challenging by our standards. I got used to the cockroaches; it was the rats that got to me. When the nuns offered me a nice meal in the missionary I took up their offer, only to arrive to find them watching BBC News 24 on their satellite television. They told me that it was the best programme that they watched, and that they did so everyday. At the time, the service was broadcasting the latest antics of Roy Keane, and they talked about him as if they knew him intimately and well. I was thunderstruck that 700 miles along the road from Lusaka, where there was no transport or anything else, the BBC was reaching out to a community of people in deepest Africa. They were thrilled with the presentation. The intimacy of BBC News 24 was brought to me on that occasion.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/15">As well as networking and bringing together people through the education programme, the British Council is also responsible for a programme that seeks not only to develop and bring on young leaders within their country, but to link them with their peers throughout Africa. The programme, which is called Interaction, also puts them in touch with people in this country, sometimes through face-to-face meetings, but its major feature is a cutting-edge website that allows them to stay in touch remotely&mdash;a facility that also gives them access to the knowledge stored in hundreds of specialist journals. The British Council uses Interaction to provide leadership training to 1,500 young African leaders, each of whom will be inspired to change the lives of thousands or perhaps millions of people. Let us hope that they do so.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/16">Hon. Members may be surprised to hear that web-based technologies are appropriate for Africa, but that is the new reality of the continent, and the British Council is increasing its investment in electronic services. That will extend the organisation's traditional role as the provider of information through libraries. In the near future, those services will be available not only through British Council offices in capital cities, but through a growing network of cyber caf&eacute;s in some of the remotest parts of Africa. Let us hope that a cyber caf&eacute; gets to that hospital in Nchelenge.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/17">I do not want to create the impression that it is all plain sailing. If there are to be improvements in political accountability, democratic participation and human rights, Africans and those working with them need to address some pervasive and highly sensitive issues. In Africa, there is a lot to be critical about, but sometimes tackling the issues head on only puts people's backs up, especially among those who are well aware of the shortcomings of the human rights record of European powers in Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/18">The British Council has found a creative solution to tackling the issue of holding the powerful to account through an exhibition of political graphics from the UK called &quot;Upfront and Personal&quot;, which toured southern Africa earlier this year. It was well received in South Africa, where there is a culture of brash, in-your-face political advocacy, but the situation in Botswana and Mozambique is very different. I understand that there was some nervousness about how such a forthright challenge to the establishment would be received.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/19">The exhibition worked in those countries because the establishment had to be challenged. It was a challenge to show how graphic illustrators, designers and cartoonists have attempted to keep the mighty on their toes in this country. We invited people in South Africa to think about how they handled freedom of expression in their own societies. At the opening of the exhibition in Gaborone, the Minister of Communications, Science and Technology asked whether Botswana was ready for such an exhibition. He was immediately answered his own question by saying, &quot;Hell, yes. Let's go for it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/20">The ways in which the British Council is working in partnership with Africa include &quot;Dreams and teams&quot;, an international programme aimed at developing young leaders through sport. It was launched in 2001 and now operates in 20 countries worldwide, including seven in Africa. Young people, teachers and youth leaders in the UK and Africa are trained to organise inclusive sports festivals and join a school link project. They learn by doing&mdash;in teamwork, communication and inclusion. The shared language of sport is an easy way into cultural exchange, enabling mutual learning between north and south.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/21">The British Council is developing sport as a tool for education in Africa, and it aims to pilot sports programmes in schools this year, with &quot;Dreams and teams&quot; forming a key component of the life-skills training syllabus. As to school links, the Department for International Development has a marvellous programme called the global schools partnership, a consortium initiative between Cambridge Education Foundation and Voluntary Service Overseas that promotes sustainable partnerships between Africa and UK schools; for example, a school in Malawi is partnered with a school in Norfolk. That link has facilitated reciprocal visits and joint curriculum work, but I know, especially through the churches in the UK and their work with the British Council, that there are huge numbers of informal linkages between schools in Britain and schools in Africa. They are immensely rewarding experiences for teachers and pupils here and in Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/22">I said that we needed to talk to Africans; when we do, they tell us that what they want are our voices. Rosemary Chipambe, my counterpart MP in Zambia said to me, &quot;We both have a voice and we can both utter the same words, Claire, but your words will be heard much louder than mine.&quot; We must try to reach a point in our global history when all people's voices carry equal weight and when all people are heard equally by those who influence their lives.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/23">My experience of the British Council in Zambia was extraordinarily good, and I would encourage any Member of Parliament who has not approached the British Council about undertaking an exchange visit to do so. Our representatives in such countries are outstanding. Last year, on a visit to Sierra Leone, I met the head of the British Council there. He had a most difficult job and was dealing with a very brutalised society. He did extraordinarily well and has broken down huge numbers of barriers between himself and the administrative authorities. The British Army is still there, doing a magnificent job. The head of the British Council was on a single secondment, so he had left his family behind in the UK&mdash;he was a man of remarkable dedication. Apart from doing all the things that I love, such as promoting science, engineering and education, he did a fantastic amount to help with the development of culture in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/24">When I went to Zambia a couple of weeks ago, I was met by John Mitchell, the director of the British Council there. He came to meet me personally and took me to his home; it was a wonderful welcome. The British Council is clearly well networked through John, who knows everyone and anyone, including members of the Government. There is a real emphasis on working together to enable the Africans to achieve not our objectives, but theirs. British resources are being put at the disposal of wonderful people who need them to achieve their potential.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/25">The British Council works not only with other bureaucratic administrations, but with the voluntary sector and non-governmental organisations, which are numerous throughout Africa. The task faced by British Council officers such as John Mitchell is to reach out to all those agencies to maximise the benefits that we deliver in such nations.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/26">John has to administer several grant programmes, including the Chevening awards. I told him that the funding for the awards had been reduced and that I was sorry about that because they produced fantastic returns. We get huge benefits for very little money, and I would ask colleagues in DFID and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to look again at the awards. They are made in a number of categories, but those chosen this year do not include engineering. As colleagues will know, I am a chartered engineer by profession, and I am desperately concerned about the absence of engineering as a discrete category. Africa can receive a huge amount of investment, and people want to invest and do well there, but unless there is an indigenous population of technicians and engineers, all the investment will be wasted. A huge $10 million water installation could be built in the Nchelenge community, for example, but the company that I spoke to said that it would not build the installation unless there was a community of Africans who could manage it. It is desperately important to increase the number of engineers in Africa, because engineers build the beautiful, clean and safe communities that people need.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/27">To conclude, the British Council's work in Africa is extraordinary, and I am grateful to have had the opportunity publicly to applaud it. I hope that the Government continue to support the British Council and people such as John Mitchell.</p>

	<p pid=".277.0/1">My hon. Friend has given an impressive catalogue of the British Council's activities. Does she agree that one of its great characteristics is that it is very well networked and therefore able to take on issues that can be difficult in some African states? I was recently lucky enough to go on an exchange visit of the kind that she has just been on and which triggered this debate. The British Council asked me to go to Ethiopia to teach the judiciary how to deal with domestic violence cases. That is a very difficult thing to do. For one thing, the British cannot go there and pretend for one minute to have all the answers. For another, one had to contend with a very old-fashioned attitude among the judiciary, which was buttressed by a pretty out-of-date constitution. The position has now changed, but the constitution originally gave a man the right to a defence if he struck his wife because she did not obey him. Persuading judges that they should look at the new constitution as it grew and that its equality clauses had to override that old law was a very diplomatic job, from which the British Council did not shrink&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".278.1/1">I fully understand the point that my hon. and learned Friend makes.</p>
	<p pid=".278.1/2">When I was in Sierra Leone, the British Army was there trying to bring order through training the army. The British Government involvement in the reconstruction of Sierra Leone also means that we are substantially supporting its law courts and law network, and the police service and the training of the police. Support for those institutions is essential in trying to ensure that a country is brought back to the point of having a judiciary that acts both in a way that is not corrupt and in the best interests of the people whom it serves. That is an immensely challenging task, as the problem is all over Africa.</p>

	<p pid=".278.4/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/836" name="Claire Curtis-Thomas">the Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas)</phrase> not only on securing the debate, which I think is the first on the subject in this Session, but on her enthusiasm for and dedication to the British Council. I also congratulate her on the way in which she has participated in the exchange with other women MPs, some of whom are present.</p>
	<p pid=".278.4/2">I congratulate David Green, the director general of the British Council, who was knighted in June this year. That was a wonderful thing&mdash;it was well deserved, because he is such a marvellous director general. Neil Kinnock will become chairman of the council in November, and that will complement David's role. There are exciting times ahead for the British Council.</p>
	<p pid=".278.4/3">I chair the all-party British Council group. We will soon be extending the way in which we work in the House by announcing an MPs' ambassador role for the British Council, so that particular MPs' interests, such as the women's movement or equality and justice, will be twinned with a country.</p>
	<p pid=".278.4/4">When we started the all-party group seven years ago, I said to David Green that the two things that he should concentrate on were IT for Africa and sport. I think that he thought that I was barking mad. If one travelled to British Council offices across Africa eight years ago, one saw that hardly anyone had computers and no one had servers in their offices. The wonderful thing is that now they have not just one computer but, sometimes, 60 or 120. Where they had one server, now they have two, three or four.</p>
	<p pid=".278.4/5">A remarkable change has happened to the British Council&mdash;a silent revolution. That means that thousands and thousands of local people in each of the countries in Africa can come to the British Council, can see a paper that has not been restricted by the local government, can catch up with world affairs and can have conversations that they cannot always have in their villages and towns. We need to do more on the IT area, and I shall say more about that later.</p>
	<p pid=".278.4/6">In the &quot;Dreams and teams&quot; programme, the soccer has been sensationally successful. We have learned from our experience that it is no good turning up with 25 Nike balls and 25 football shirts, because those will get sold on the black market the day that we leave. We have concentrated on finding local leaders who can run local soccer teams when we have left, and that has been terrifically successful.</p>
	<p pid=".278.4/7">The Government can be proud of their record with the British Council. We have had seven years of increases in funding. It is never easy for the British Council, because every time there is a change in the world, it is asked to do more. We asked it to look after all the &quot;stans&quot; in the former Soviet Union&mdash;to open more premises there. We have asked it to do more in the middle east, especially since 9/11. Its funds are finite, and it tries its best, but it always wants more. We should be as supportive as we can. If we were to ask it how it views the next seven or eight years, perhaps it would say that we need its presence not in western Europe, but in the middle east and Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".278.4/8">The British Council is one of the three great ambassadors for the country in Africa, the other two being the Open university and BBC World Service. People are always surprised when I mention the Open university. I mention it not just because I am a graduate of it, but because it has educated 5 million Africans and is the largest university in Africa. Ethiopia and Eritrea had a 20-year war of attrition, which did no one any good. When Ethiopia eventually took the democratic path, 23 of its 25 Cabinet Ministers took MBAs. The Prime Minister got the third highest MBA ever recorded at the Open university.</p>
	<p pid=".278.4/9">We have created things to be proud of&mdash;Jennie Lee and Harold Wilson should be smiling in their graves about the extent of the Open university. The BBC World Service keeps getting better. It is good that the British Council has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Open university and the BBC World Service.</p>
	<p pid=".278.4/10">This week in the House of Commons is a typical week for the British Council. On Monday, the all-party groups on Zimbabwe and on the British Council met. We heard from David Martin, the British Council's director of central Africa, on the problems of trying to handle Zimbabwe in its current phase. He gave a remarkably poignant and telling speech, and was not shy about taking hard questions from hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid=".278.4/11">Yesterday, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1009" name="Gerald Kaufman">the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase> hosted a lunch for African literature and what the British Council is doing with Margaret Meyer. This is a difficult time for African literature, and I ask the British Council to reconsider its role.</p>
	<p pid=".278.4/12">The two great British publishing houses, Macmillan and Heinemann, which have been consumed by other companies over the past 10 years, no longer publish African literature. The only way in which African literature could come to the notice of the rest of the world was through the two imprimaturs in those two big publishing companies, but that is no longer the case.</p>
	<p pid=".278.4/13">I wonder whether the British Council could find a way to create a small publishing house with the Department for International Development and with perhaps a private enterprise such as the Commonwealth Development Corporation, so that we could publish such novels and bring them to the attention of the rest of the world. It is a sad day when books are burned, as they were in Germany in the 1930s, and it is as sad a day when we can find no way to publish talented poets and writers in Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".278.4/14">I have been lucky enough to spend time with British Council officials in Egypt, Ethiopia, Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania, Mozambique, Namibia, Botswana, Kenya and Tunisia. Africa is in my skin: I was brought up in Nigeria and I simply cannot get away from it. Generally, the quality of people in our British Council offices is second to none, and they work fantastically well under trying conditions. I ask a small favour. After <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-16">16 November</phrase>, when we will be able formally to start highlighting our bid for the Olympics, we could provide every British Council officer with a tape of the London bid, so that they can act as apostles and fans to help us to win.</p>
	<p pid=".278.4/15">I will finish with these three thoughts. First, we could take the Open university idea wider with the Commission for Africa, on which the British Council has a seat. Mbeke's brother&mdash;I am trying to remember his Christian name&mdash;said in his report for the South African foreign policy think-tank that facilities and education for children in primary schools are now much worse than they were under Britain, France, Germany or Italy. We could have a big idea: Open university for schools. We could call it &quot;free school TV&quot; and put it up in English and 10 to 15 other languages simultaneously via broadband and satellite. We could use solar energy as the source, and use the cheap &pound;50 computer systems that are now available to carry out a primary school revolution for Africa. If there is one thing that the commission could do, it is that. I should welcome the Minister's thoughts on that.</p>
	<p pid=".278.4/16">Secondly, every year, 2 billion people try to learn English. It is a lot to ask of the British Council to take care of that, although it raises considerable funds, which it uses well. There is business to be had through BBC Worldwide, the Open university and the British Council in creating a teaching online service for English.</p>
	<p pid=".278.4/17">Lastly, a new movement is on its way from America, started by a professor called Lawrence Lessig, of Stanford university. It is called the creative commons. The idea is that, as one uses a small letter &quot;c&quot; for &quot;copyright&quot;, one would use two for &quot;creative commons&quot;. They would be used to allow copyright to lapse, or to be used. The website has been visited by 1.5 million people to release their copyright in music, art and books that they have written in the past 10 or 15 years, so that we can share.</p>
	<p pid=".278.4/18">For example, Gilberto Gil, a fantastic jazz musician in Brazil who is also the Arts Minister in the Brazilian Government, has persuaded the artistic and music community in Brazil to release all their art and music for free use outside Brazil, so that Brazilian music can come to the fore on the radio and online. How wonderful it would be if we could use the creative commons idea to free up copyright and to enable education to happen faster in Africa.</p>

	<p pid=".281.0/1">I am delighted to be able to take part in the debate, as I, too, have been a participant in a British Council exchange programme. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/836" name="Claire Curtis-Thomas">the Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas)</phrase> on obtaining this debate and so expertly setting out the picture of the British Council in Africa. I shall not repeat the points that she has covered, but will talk about what happened on my visit. I also congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1342" name="Derek Wyatt">the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Mr. Wyatt)</phrase>, because he has not only shown immense dedication, as a parliamentarian, to the British Council and everything that it stands for, but contributed innovative ideas and suggestions, which I hope may be taken forward.</p>
	<p pid=".281.0/2">I was part of the women's exchange that was just called &quot;Big cars and leaking roofs&quot;. The MPs have the big cars and the people have the leaking roofs. There is a perception in Africa that all MPs line their own pockets and do not care about their constituents. That was certainly not true of the twinned MP whom I met in Zambia and who visited my constituency, the hon. Rose Banda of Milanzi constituency in the eastern province of Zambia. Her dedication is as deep as that of any Member of this House, but the difficulties that she faces in carrying out her tasks are beyond the imagination of most of us.</p>
	<p pid=".281.0/3">I have had the good fortune to travel quite widely, but I had never been, until May 2003, to any of the poorest African countries. I thought that I had known all my life what it would be like in such a place, but, of course, the reality is much starker. The contrast between my constituency, which is one of the poorest in the UK, and Rose's constituency, one of the poorest in Africa, was extraordinary.</p>
	<p pid=".281.0/4">First, there are 60,000 registered voters in my constituency. Although, of course, I cannot visit them all, I can visit the whole constituency in a day. It is an inner-city constituency. Rose Banda has a mere 2,000 registered voters, but it takes two weeks to visit all the villages in her constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".281.0/5">We spent some of our time in a variety of meetings in Lusaka. One was with women MPs, the women's caucus of the Parliament. The minute we sat down&mdash;and I have to say that the meeting was extremely well organised and the majority of women MPs attended, even though the House was not sitting on that day&mdash;we found that our experiences as parliamentarians and as candidates were similar, as were our experiences of political parties.</p>
	<p pid=".281.0/6">We are the second-class gender in every Parliament and in every political party. There is no question about that. The women had faced the kinds of discriminations and difficulties with which we are all familiar in the west. We have had so much good fortune, and we have made such strides to equal gender representation, particularly in our party, that I was able to offer encouragement. I was able to talk from my experience and say that we might be in a much better position today, but that when I came into the House, there were just 37 women. We have made progress.</p>
	<p pid=".281.0/7">The women's caucus has no place to meet in that Parliament. Its members have no women's rooms; they have none of the facilities that we have gained for ourselves. However, we were able to talk about how they could move forward and not be totally discouraged. At that level, meeting with parliamentarians in the Parliament, I felt that I could make a contribution and thanked the British Council, because it had made me feel that I had been of some use there.</p>
	<p pid=".281.0/8">The highlight was the visit to the constituency. It takes seven hours to travel from the capital to the border of the constituency, and the border was vital to us, because there was a bed-and-breakfast establishment there. It was quite simple, but it had a hot water supply, a bath, hot food, electricity and mosquito nets over the beds. None of those, I was to find, were available in the constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".281.0/9">In that constituency, I saw for the first time people who would engage with me on every topic of conversation that was of interest&mdash;about the world, Africa, Zambia, and the UK&mdash;and we could have all those conversations, but they had absolutely none of the necessities that I found in the bed and breakfast to which we gratefully returned late each night. There is no electricity in the whole of the province, and no running water. There are none of the things that we now take for granted, particularly in education, such as access to computers or mobile phones.</p>
	<p pid=".281.0/10">Everything had to be made by the people themselves. Everything had to be traded or bought by people walking huge distances. It was most poignant to see all the huge plastic carrying cans&mdash;a western technology with which we are more than familiar. We have too much plastic; we have a problem disposing of it. There, each can is made to the greatest size possible, which even children have to carry when they are full of water&mdash;muddy, dangerous and diseased water from the river. Unless they carry that water daily, they have no means of washing or preparing food, and no water to drink.</p>
	<p pid=".281.0/11">Disease was clearly a major factor. One in five Zambians are, I think, infected with HIV/AIDS. In the whole time that I was there and travelling huge distances, we were able to find only one tiny clinic. Let us imagine a clinic that does not have a hot water system, and has no means of sterilisation. It was well stocked with drugs, because the world community, in various guises, was providing drugs. However, the most fundamental matters, such as sufficient room to examine people properly, were lacking&mdash;there was only one examination room. All the women who were giving birth needed to travel to that small clinic.</p>
	<p pid=".281.0/12">The basic nature of the facilities was so extreme that I could not but marvel at the way in which the people were entirely resilient and optimistic, struggling to achieve. I saw that in the schools, for example. People had gone to the muddy rivers, got the mud, carried it back&mdash;mud is jolly heavy&mdash;and made bricks. In one place, 1,000 bricks had been dried in the sun and were ready to use to make the walls of a school, or a schoolhouse for a teacher. However, there was no cement and, because of that, the 1,000 bricks would lie on the floor for a couple more years.</p>
	<p pid=".281.0/13">I went to schools that had no glass in the windows. Of course, that does not matter in the middle of a hot period. However, if it is teeming with rain or bitterly cold, it matters a great deal. Then, there were the leaky roofs. There were leaky roofs everywhere, and every village needed metal to seal the holes or to replace a roof that had blown off&mdash;a frequent occurrence, it seems. I went to a courthouse, a little wooden building with thatching, which had been almost eaten away by termites.</p>
	<p pid=".281.0/14">I had always known about people's daily struggle to live, but there is no substitute for seeing something with one's own eyes. I can tell the British Council that that is an incredibly important experience for western politicians to have. However, it is also vital that, having had the experience, we should understand what is needed and be in a position to try to meet those needs.</p>
	<p pid=".281.0/15">I went with Rose to visit the British high commissioner and to ask, &quot;Why is the UK not making any funds available to eastern province in Zambia?&quot; He explained quite reasonably that our Government were trying to help the Zambian Government to progress towards greater democracy, accountability and efficiency, province by province. I had to tell him that the need for help is there now. It costs so little&mdash;&pound;4&mdash;to get a mosquito net to save the lives of newborn babies. It costs very little to equip a simple clinic or to provide a sewing machine so that women can sew cloth and sell it at market. They are prepared to walk to make sales if they can, but they have to have the basic equipment. It costs little to provide hoes for basic agriculture.</p>
	<p pid=".281.0/16">I could see all the things that Rose and her people were telling me about. They said, &quot;Help us; we want to work, and we will do all that we can to help ourselves. We will construct our own schools,&quot;&mdash;they had already done so in many cases&mdash;&quot;We will dig our own latrines. We accept that we are living in a situation in which we will not get electricity or running water tomorrow.&quot; At that time, we were not able to help. However, now&mdash;I am sure that it has nothing to do with my visit&mdash;the UK Government are giving money to the eastern province and Rose's constituents have received promises of &pound;10,000 to assist the organisations that she has worked to set up in her community.</p>
	<p pid=".281.0/17">Let me talk about those organisations. They are primarily women's clubs. The women I saw were very organised. Wherever they could, on the tiniest sums of money, they produced the smallest amount of produce that could be sold. I saw them hoeing fields in which they had said that they would grow crops not just for their families but for the whole community, and would use them to obtain money to look after the orphans. Every village has a huge number of orphans because of HIV/AIDS, and the women organise themselves to look after those children, many of whom have no parents or grandparents. The poorest people there are looking after the most disadvantaged in the world.</p>
	<p pid=".281.0/18">I saw people not only doing physical things, such as trying to get money and using it for good causes, but engaging in self-education.</p>

	<p pid=".284.0/1">I was talking with some enthusiasm about how Zambian women are helping themselves and doing much for their communities.</p>
	<p pid=".284.0/2">I want to describe how those women are working in education. Some are teachers, but the women's clubs in the Milanzi constituency are primarily putting on theatre performances and educating whole villages about HIV/AIDS and the things that can happen to young women. I saw a most extraordinary performance, as good as anything that I could have seen in a fringe theatre in London. The message went across to children, young people and adults&mdash;both male and female. All sat and watched the performance by the women. It takes great courage, time and organisation to put on a theatre performance, and I remind hon. Members that those women were doing that without any of the props, opportunities or finance that any theatre group in Britain would expect.</p>
	<p pid=".284.0/3">Rose Banda has now organised those women's clubs into two overarching organisations: &quot;Shading the Shame&quot;, which is an HIV/AIDS project, and the Milanzi HIV/AIDS care and support foundation. It is her intention&mdash;I hope that we can help her&mdash;to ensure that NGO funding can be directed through those umbrella organisations at the clubs, which are self-helping, committed to the community and primarily run by women.</p>
	<p pid=".284.0/4">We need to work with MPs in other countries on the mechanisms for accessing aid, which has proved extremely difficult. Few NGOs operate in that part of Zambia, and I have not had much success in persuading more to get involved with the people of Milanzi. However, I will keep trying, and the result of the programme is that I now see myself, to a degree, as one of the champions for the people of Zambia. As I have mentioned, the high commission has already adopted projects through DFID in eastern province, but much more is needed. I shall keep pressing for more help to be given to Zambia.</p>
	<p pid=".284.0/5">I want to draw hon. Members' attention to the country's position with its debt payments. I hope that my hon. Friend who will reply to the debate may be able to pass this on to appropriate Ministers. I understand from a recently released report about education in Zambia that was co-authored by Oxfam and VSO that the Zambian Government will pay $377 million dollars in debt repayments compared with $221 million on education, and that there are between 8,000 and 9,000 unemployed teachers in that country. They are qualified teachers who are able to work but whom the Government are unable to pay&mdash;education is entirely a Government service&mdash;because of the limits that the International Monetary Fund has placed on Government expenditure. There is surely a need to separate the fundamental needs for basic education and basic health care from all the other aspects of governance and IMF funding. Zambia and many other African countries need that.</p>
	<p pid=".284.0/6">I am also working on a twinning arrangement for Kagora basic school. The people there asked me whether I could find a school in my constituency, and I am delighted to say that that has now happened; I hope that Haberdashers' Aske's will be involved in the twinning process. We can imagine how difficult that will be. The children in Zambia will not be able to communicate in the usual way. Somebody from the school will have to travel along those terrible roads and deal with all the other difficulties to get to the nearest place where they can pick up an e-mail or a letter. That will be difficult. It would be so much easier if they had their solar-powered computer and their satellite phone connection, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey proposed.</p>
	<p pid=".284.0/7">We must do such things. It will never be possible to deliver piped water and electricity to those tiny communities in the old-fashioned way. We need new ideas and new mechanisms. That is what we can contribute; we can share our knowledge and expertise with them. I would hate it if the people of Milanzi were forced to move lock, stock and barrel into the cities, where they would encounter a new and, in some senses, an even more difficult lifestyle and greater deprivation.</p>
	<p pid=".284.0/8">I pay tribute again to the British Council. I echo everything that previous speakers have said. I was recently in Russia, where I saw the magnificent work that it is doing there and its hugely imaginative programmes. I have no doubt that this twinning arrangement has been of great value. I hope that it will continue, and I am very grateful for having had the opportunity to participate in it.</p>

	<p pid=".285.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/836" name="Claire Curtis-Thomas">the Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas)</phrase> on securing this debate. Like her, I have shared in the twinning arrangement that the British Council in east Africa has so imaginatively developed. My twin, the hon. Ruth Msafiri, is a Tanzanian MP. She came here in November 2002, and I returned the visit in February the following year. I have had an opportunity to share that experience with Members. Therefore, while keeping much of that in mind and using it, I want to talk briefly about a return visit that I was able to make to Tanzania this year as a member of the Parliamentary Commonwealth Association. I met Ruth again and found out more about developments, particularly in education, which I want to share with hon. Members shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".285.0/2">First, however, I shall highlight the British Council's continuing work in Tanzania, and pay tribute to it. One of its key projects remains the politics of the future. That includes training for women MPs, but it goes much further. The politics of the future or POF programme includes computer training; training in key parliamentary procedures; planning and budgeting of central Government; understanding electoral law, which has changed recently in Tanzania; campaign management; fundraising; lobbying skills; and working with the media. That is the kind of background training that any current parliamentary candidate or new Member would value. However, as we can imagine, that is particularly the case in a situation where women especially are newly coming into office.</p>
	<p pid=".285.0/3">Work is also being done by the centre for international development at the state university of New York. We met Donna Bugby-Smith, who works out of the British Council office on a project to empower people and institutions to develop their own capabilities&mdash;a definition that I read out carefully, because it is important to stress the phrase &quot;their own capabilities&quot;. We are working not only with MPs, but with civil society&mdash;non-governmental organisations and those working for HIV/AIDS organisations and on local community development projects&mdash;and enabling them to understand their role in local, regional and national society and within the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".285.0/4">Our visit was very positive and very purposeful, yet more than 1,000 teachers a year are dying from HIV/AIDS in Tanzania. It is a struggle simply to maintain the existing number of teachers in that country, let alone to meet the need to develop education further, and especially primary education, in line with the millennium projects and the call of the Commission for Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".285.0/5">I return to my visit to a teacher training college, Katoke, in Ruth Msafiri's constituency of Muleba, North on the shores of Lake Victoria. The college has no computers, a library that has not been restocked since the 1970s and a crying need for solar computers. I heartily commend my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1342" name="Derek Wyatt">the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Mr. Wyatt)</phrase> on his vision of an open school. That is exactly what is needed. The idea of carting outdated textbooks to schools such as those in Ruth Msafiri's constituency should not be entertained any longer.</p>
	<p pid=".285.0/6">We must get solar computers into remote villages, but most of all we need to get help to the teacher's training college, which provides mainly textbook resource and training to 500 primary school teachers. Enriching the value of that training and education would have a huge impact on the whole of Ruth Msafiri's constituency. I have a large constituency of some 84,000 constituents. Ruth Msafiri has at least 100,000, but she does not really know how many there are. There are some 50 primary schools of varying quality in her area, but at the time of my visit there were only two secondary schools for the whole constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".285.0/7">There is an urgent need at higher education level to train sufficient numbers of people at a sufficient level to train the teachers. Fortuitously, Bristol university's education department is twinned with the education department at Dar es Salaam university, but it does not seem to be a long-term twinning with the underpinning of finance and support that is needed to develop the relationship throughout the country or to ensure that its impact is felt in Tanzania. Indeed, it is crucial to recognise how essential African students of all countries are to higher education internationally.</p>
	<p pid=".285.0/8">I particularly wanted to speak today about the British Council report, &quot;Vision 2020: Forecasting International Student Mobility&mdash;A UK Perspective&quot;, which was published this spring. It examines the need for this country to keep its share of the market in overseas students coming to this country or through e-learning in order that our higher education economy might be boosted.</p>
	<p pid=".285.0/9">The Prime Minister challenged the British Council to bring some 75,000 extra overseas students to this country, and it has delivered. The contribution from students from all over the world enriches our universities, and also sends students back all over the world with an understanding of Britain and an ability to share that experience in their own countries. Those students usually become friends of Britain for life.</p>
	<p pid=".285.0/10">The whole report emphasised the need for paying students, or students who can afford to pay. As a Government, we need to consider more carefully how we encourage students from Africa who are unable to pay the fees to come to this country. I looked at the work of the British Council in Tanzania in that respect; in 2003, the country had nine Chevening and Commonwealth scholars, and in 2004 it had 10, thanks to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. There is some higher education link work to the value of more than &pound;90,000, but it comes from the Department for International Development. It is not mainstream education funding in line with the Commission for Africa and the millennium goal for education. The Government received the British Council report very warmly, but I ask them to reconsider it in the context of how many students can come here from African countries to which they would take back their learning and experience. That would enhance the quality of education in many developing African countries, and that is my plea.</p>
	<p pid=".285.0/11">I shall end with an anecdote, to which I made a small contribution, and an important fact. This summer, I was introduced to the Prime Minister of Tanzania as Valerie Davey, and he said, &quot;Mrs. Davey?&quot; I said &quot;Yes&quot;, and he said, &quot;You taught me at Ilboru school.&quot; That was in the 1960s, I have to admit, but it was a stunning moment in my visit. We should remember that the former President of Tanzania, President Nyerere, a statesman of Africa and of the world, is a former student of Edinburgh university. Such links are extremely valuable and we should look again at the status of students from Africa who are unable to pay the fees.</p>

	<p pid=".287.0/1">I remind hon. Members who are winding up the debate that it has to conclude at 3.44 pm.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-20.288.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/750" speakername="Tom Brake" colnum="288"  time="015:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/halltext/41020h03.htm#41020h03_spnew11">
	<p pid=".288.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/836" name="Claire Curtis-Thomas">the hon. Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas)</phrase> on securing the debate. At the beginning of the debate, she was breathless; I was not sure whether she had run up the stairs to get here on time or whether she was breathless at the prospect of Neil Kinnock joining the British Council. However, she made it clear later that she was excited about her shadowing experience&mdash;a feeling that was echoed by other hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid=".288.0/2">I am happy to join other hon. Members in giving plaudits to the work of the British Council. It helpfully supplied statistics, which are outstanding: it works in 220 towns and cities in 110 countries&mdash;I suspect that few organisations can make a similar claim&mdash;teaching English to more than half a million people. It collaborates in almost 2,000 arts events globally and has an earning potential of almost &pound;200 million from clients and customers worldwide. Those are impressive statistics.</p>
	<p pid=".288.0/3">The British Council has been well established in a number of countries for a very long time. It has been in Botswana since 1972, in Cameroon since 1970, in Eritrea since 1971 and in Ethiopia since 1942, although it closed there in 1951 and reopened in 1960. Its long-term commitment to Africa is very welcome, and I am pleased that there has been a funding commitment from the Chancellor, who announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-12">12 July</phrase> that the budget would increase from &pound;173 million to &pound;197 million in 2007&ndash;08. The British Council receives a reasonable stream of contracts from DFID, among others.</p>
	<p pid=".288.0/4">One minor point to which I hope the hon. Gentleman will respond in winding up is that although the stream of contracts that the British Council receives is welcome, it fluctuates significantly from one year to the next. I received a parliamentary answer yesterday saying that the figure had gone from &pound;24 million in 1999&ndash;2000 to &pound;17 million in 2000&ndash;01, down further to &pound;10 million in 2001&ndash;02, back up to just less than &pound;20 million in 2002&ndash;03 and finally down to &pound;13 million in 2003&ndash;04. The British Council might find it hard to accommodate those fluctuations.</p>
	<p pid=".288.0/5">The focus that the British Council puts on to Africa is important and pertinent. In the long-term, given that DFID's budget has changed to support the poorest countries more, I wonder whether the British Council should, similarly, focus its efforts on the poorest countries. I was interested to hear the detail of the work shadowing experience of a number of Members, particularly the point about Members of Parliaments in certain African countries being expected to provide money to their constituents. I was fortunate enough to visit Ghana a month or so ago, on a trip sponsored by Oxfam.</p>
	<p pid=".288.0/6">I raised that point with a Ghanaian MP whom I happened to meet and he said, &quot;Oh yes, that is very true. In fact, I came home one day to find a constituent who had left a dead body on my doorstep and who said, 'Unless you give me some money to bury that dead body, I'm going to leave it on your doorstep.'&quot; Sure enough, that MP had to cough up. The prospect of having a dead body on one's doorstep would encourage anyone to provide the money. Expectations need to be managed, but I would not like this country to go down that route in terms of people's expectations of what we can deliver.</p>
	<p pid=".288.0/7">I was interested to see the seven participating countries in the shadowing scheme: Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. I shall return to Kenya's involvement shortly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-20.289.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/836" speakername="Claire Curtis-Thomas" colnum="289"  time="015:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/halltext/41020h03.htm#41020h03_spnew12">
	<p pid=".289.0/1">I am interested to hear the hon. Gentleman talk about the perceptions of Members of African Parliaments. They do things that we would not have to do. I learned that what sometimes appears to us as corruption is, for many Members of African Parliaments, being in a no-choice position. They are seen as a source of income in their communities, and they have far greater responsibilities for the support of families than we would ever have simply because there is no welfare, pension or care structure in place. Normally, a Member of an African Parliament is considered the person of last resort.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-20.289.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/750" speakername="Tom Brake" colnum="289"  time="015:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/halltext/41020h03.htm#41020h03_spnew13">
	<p pid=".289.1/1">I agree entirely with the hon. Lady. It is interesting that the work shadowing focused on improving the representation of women in Parliament, which I support. Unfortunately, the UK does worse in terms of representation&mdash;I must admit that my party does not help in this respect&mdash;than three of the countries that have signed up to millennium development goals, which require the countries concerned to improve their representation. We have something to respond to here as well.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-20.289.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/993" speakername="Helen Jackson" colnum="289"  time="015:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/halltext/41020h03.htm#41020h03_spnew14">
	<p pid=".289.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/836" name="Claire Curtis-Thomas">the Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas)</phrase> on securing this debate.</p>
	<p pid=".289.2/2">Malawi was my patch. Would the hon. Gentleman be interested in my main thought in following the work, which was that governance was the issue? Governance is so often mentioned as a key priority. Bringing women into public life not only in Parliament, but across the level is an aspect of governance and something on which the British Council has worked creatively in Malawi by bringing civil society, local people and Members of Parliament together to understand how, by working together, they could contribute to governance and a different, more democratic way of going about things.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-20.289.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/750" speakername="Tom Brake" colnum="289"  time="015:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/halltext/41020h03.htm#41020h03_spnew15">
	<p pid=".289.3/1">Again, I agree entirely. The involvement of women is clearly not only about representation at parliamentary level, but about involvement with non-governmental organisations, civil society and so on.</p>
	<p pid=".289.3/2">I am interested in the British Council's pan-African projects, and I support their aims. An organization that can act as an advocate on Britain's behalf is important. It has become harder for the UK to put across its point of view, because of what has happened in Iraq. The British Council should be able to respond to that challenge. The perception of the UK has changed; that is certainly the impression that I get from my contacts.</p>
	<p pid=".289.3/3">As to the leadership proposal, I should be interested to know how the 1,500 potential leaders will be identified and how they will be prevented from deriving personal benefit from taking part in the scheme, as set out in the documentation. To what extent can the British Council or others involved in the initiative ensure that, for instance, certain disadvantaged sectors of society, such as people who might be excluded on a caste basis, will be represented in the group of potential leaders?</p>
	<p pid=".289.3/4">I know that the hon. Gentleman wants a reasonable time in which to conclude the debate. I hope, however, that he will be able to set out the relationship between the British Council and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, particularly in relation to Kenya's involvement in the work shadowing. I understand also that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, with the global opportunities fund and a programme called &quot;Engaging with the Islamic world&quot; is also active in Kenya. I wonder how those two things interact, particularly as one of the main outcomes there is also expected to be an increase in the representation of women.</p>
	<p pid=".289.3/5">There are certain institutions, such as Radio 4 and the BBC World Service, that we are all very proud of. I think that the British Council falls into that category, and I am very supportive of its work.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-20.290.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1224" speakername="Mark Simmonds" colnum="290"  time="015:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/halltext/41020h03.htm#41020h03_spnew16">
	<p pid=".290.0/1">I add my congratulations to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/836" name="Claire Curtis-Thomas">the hon. Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas)</phrase> on securing this important debate following her interesting visit to Zambia with the British Council's women in politics and leadership project. The British Council is at the forefront of furthering cultural relations between Britain and the rest of the world, and the Conservative party is extremely supportive of its work. However, I am a little disappointed that the Foreign Office does not share our enthusiasm for the British Council&mdash;it has been unable to send at least one of its six Ministers. I mean no disrespect to the hon. Gentleman who will reply on behalf of the Government today, who I know will do so extremely ably and articulately.</p>
	<p pid=".290.0/2">The British Council's main raison d'&ecirc;tre is to gain recognition abroad for the UK's values, ideas and achievements, and to build lasting, mutually beneficial relationships between the United Kingdom and other countries. It is of key importance to British foreign policy. Specifically, the British Council's role in Africa is vital. I want to record our thanks to all of those who work for the British Council in Africa, who are doing excellent work.</p>
	<p pid=".290.0/3">We all know that Africa poses great challenges. It is the only continent that has regressed economically in the past 20 years. It is also a continent of vast wealth and opportunity. Because of its reputation of trust and integrity and the long-term programmes of assistance, the British Council is in an unparalleled position to help Africans to meet the challenges that they face.</p>
	<p pid=".290.0/4">Historically, one of the greatest problems with African Governments has been the lack of democratic accountability, and the lack of institutions to facilitate a pluralistic civil society. Sadly, that has led to chronic political instability in many African countries. Corrupt and inept leadership, combined with a history of human rights abuses, inter-ethnic rivalries and, more recently and very sadly, the explosion of HIV/AIDS, have left many parts of Africa lagging behind the rest of the world in building markets, trading and improving the macro and microeconomic well-being of its citizens. That can be seen in comparison to extraordinary economic growth in China and India, which is lifting millions of people out of poverty.</p>
	<p pid=".290.0/5">Sadly, Africa has generally stagnated. I shall give one example to illustrate that. Forty years ago, Nigeria was much wealthier than South Korea, with approximately the same population. Whereas Nigeria's oil wealth was squandered, South Korea invested in educating people and targeted key export industries in the west. It is now a leading export nation and has a per capita income 20 times higher than Nigeria. While both countries have found it difficult to make the transition to full democracy, South Korea did not suffer from the same corrupt military leadership, and lessons must be learned from that.</p>
	<p pid=".290.0/6">I shall not give a detailed analysis of the multi-faceted problems that exist across Africa, but the problems can be summarised into three key areas: the lack of political stability in Africa and subsequent conflicts; the poor education of citizens; and the lack of sustainable development. The British Council's work in facilitating democratic governance, fostering development and providing education addresses those areas. It is an excellent programme working in partnership with the African-led New Partnership for Africa's Development. I agree with the hon. Member for Crosby wholeheartedly that we should be listening and not lecturing, and the British Council scheme is a starting point for that. NEPAD also shows the real desire of Africans to work with other formal and voluntary international bodies and NGOs to move forward.</p>
	<p pid=".290.0/7">The British Council's work, together with its invaluable partnerships with the Commonwealth, the World Bank and countless other bodies, means that it is uniquely placed to build support for the reform needed to ensure that African countries and Governments become more accountable to their public. Without a strong and vibrant civil society, it is exceptionally difficult to hold a Government to account and to ensure that they act in the public interest rather than in the interests of the ruling ethnicity, clique or family. In contrast, a robust civil society can deliver honest and effective rule, which all African people deserve.</p>
	<p pid=".290.0/8">The British Council works on that directly and must be supported in its challenge. For example, it set up the leadership programme that we heard about earlier&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/750" name="Tom Brake">the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase> made some good points that I hope that the Minister's stand-in will answer in his summing-up. The council has given civil society leaders in Africa the chance to learn from accumulated experience in the UK, where civil society has grown over the centuries. It has also been instrumental in transferring working knowledge to African parliamentarians through the programmes that we heard about earlier.</p>
	<p pid=".290.0/9">That excellent initiative was supported by the Conservative party, particularly by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/914" name="Cheryl Gillan">the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)</phrase>. She took part in the programme and hosted a female Kenyan Member of Parliament who visited the UK. The differences between female British and female African MPs were highlighted by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1203" name="Joan Ruddock">the hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Joan Ruddock)</phrase>. Interestingly enough, however, my hon. Friend found that there were similarities between the problems facing female MPs: how to reach out to the electorate; how to balance family life with a demanding political career; and, slightly worryingly, how to deal with male colleagues.</p>
	<p pid=".290.0/10">The council has played a vital role in international development for 40 years and is currently working in 50 developing countries. We are pleased that this programme is part of a wider strategy to promote democratic government, education and trade. Sustainable development must ultimately be based on free market principles to ensure that the benefits of economic activity accrue to those who invest their time in enterprise and work, not to those who happen to be in power. People must have secure property rights but, without sustainable economic development, Africa's future will remain bleak. Countries should follow Botswana's example and attract foreign investment to grow their economies and to generate revenues to expand public services, as was rightly alluded to by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1342" name="Derek Wyatt">the hon. Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Mr. Wyatt)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".290.0/11">I agree with the British Council that business will invest only if there is a viable operating environment and the skills in the local market to operate those businesses. Paramount among those skills are communications skills. The teaching of English is key. English is now the language of international commerce and business, and the council is a world leader in teaching English. Excellent English not only helps Africans to communicate with foreign businesses but enables them to join the international community of fellow English speakers and to benefit from courses and degrees taught in English. I understand that last year the British Council delivered more than 1 million hours of teaching, and set and marked 1.15 million UK exams. We should all applaud that extraordinary achievement. The council has reached more than 10 million people through teaching centres, libraries and information services, to which other hon. Members have referred.</p>
	<p pid=".290.0/12">Before I finish, I shall ask a few specific questions that I would like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1130" name="Jim Murphy">the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Murphy)</phrase>, who will speak on behalf of the Government, to address, if he can, this afternoon. First, what assessment has been made of the value for money that the Government receive for the &pound;180 million grant in aid that the Foreign Office gives the British Council? How are the outputs measured? That point was raised by the council in the evidence that it gave to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs in detailing its &quot;Strategy 2010: Our Vision for the Future&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".290.0/13">Secondly, the council has expressed serious concerns that grant in aid of &pound;204 million for 2007&ndash;08 may have an adverse impact on its good work in Africa and throughout the world. What assurances can the Government provide that there will be no diminution in the service provided by the council?</p>
	<p pid=".290.0/14">Thirdly, the council operates out of 280 premises in 110 countries. The 2004 spending review stated that efficiency savings would be realised by</p>
	<p pid=".290.0/15" class="indent">&quot;reductions in the size of their overseas estates&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".290.0/16">I hope that we shall receive an assurance that such reductions will not lead to the sort of shambolic sell-off of good-quality property that the Foreign Office has instigated across the world and particularly in New York.</p>
	<p pid=".290.0/17">The fourth point was alluded to by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/841" name="Valerie Davey">the hon. Member for Bristol, West (Valerie Davey)</phrase>. What links does the British Council have with the further education sector in this country, and what are the Government doing to facilitate vocational learning and training throughout Africa? I am referring to Africans being educated in the UK and in their respective African countries.</p>
	<p pid=".290.0/18">Finally, is it right that the British Council operates in Zimbabwe, given the terrible abuses of both white and black people that are going on there? Do we not need to consider very carefully whether that sends the wrong signals to the currently appalling Mugabe regime?</p>
	<p pid=".290.0/19">In conclusion, the British Council is a unique institution because of its experience, reach, professionalism and integrity, but above all because it is practical.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-20.293.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1130" speakername="Jim Murphy" colnum="293"  time="015:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/halltext/41020h03.htm#41020h03_spnew17">
	<p pid=".293.0/1">I am delighted to have the opportunity to respond to the debate. First, I apologise on behalf of the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1127" name="Chris Mullin">the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin)</phrase>, who cannot be here today. It is fairly reasonable and understandable to offer hon. Members such an apology in this discussion of the British Council's work in Africa, because he is in Africa&mdash;in Kenya. I am delivering this response as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Whip. I am sure that my hon. Friend will respond to any questions that I cannot answer in the short time available.</p>
	<p pid=".293.0/2">As I said, I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the debate. It is not a regular occurrence for a Whip to be heard on any issue, but if there is one important issue that we should be heard on, it is the work of the British Council, its support of the Government's work in Africa and the Government's work to support the Commission for Africa. We are providing whatever moral and political support we can to NEPAD to help African leaders who are looking for African solutions to problems that are, unfortunately, far too common in Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".293.0/3">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/836" name="Claire Curtis-Thomas">the Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas)</phrase> not only on securing the debate but on its fortuitous timing, which she mentioned. She spoke with her usual passion and knowledge. Her anecdote about the BBC reminded me of the time when I travelled to the Negev desert with Bedouin tribesmen and we had&mdash;I am sure that they are not listening, so I can say this&mdash;a cup of what was possibly the worst coffee that I have ever tasted. I also received what was possibly the best hospitality that I have ever received, listening to the BBC World Service in the Negev desert.</p>
	<p pid=".293.0/4">My hon. Friend paid great compliments to the British Council on its work in Africa. I am pleased that she did so because she was correct. Not only is the British Council doing excellent work on that continent, but the British Government, as she said, have prioritised the issue of Africa for our presidency of both the G8 and the EU. The Government believe it to be crucial that the British Council fits within that work and that we work in a complementary manner to deliver the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's priorities, but that the British Council should have a degree of operational independence&mdash;something that is acknowledged to be essential throughout Parliament and across the parties.</p>
	<p pid=".293.0/5">We also had the good fortune to hear from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1342" name="Derek Wyatt">the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Mr. Wyatt)</phrase>, who is chairman of the all-party group on the British Council. He was to correct to identify the power of technology, which the British Council has identified as a key part of its 2005 strategy. He is probably the only hon. Member who has visited more countries in Africa than the Minister with responsibility for Africa; in that respect he is ahead of anyone else in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".293.0/6">We also heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/841" name="Valerie Davey">the Member for Bristol, West (Valerie Davey)</phrase> about her work in the women in politics programme in Tanzania, her teacher training in Kutoke and her experience of having met a former pupil. On arriving in Parliament, I had a similar experience with my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1069" name="John McFall">the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall)</phrase>, when I reminded him that he was my teacher in secondary school in Glasgow. He is still with us in the House. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, West will be aware that Tanzania is the greatest recipient of UK development assistance in Africa, and she also raised a number of other points that I will be happy to discuss with her. I am delighted that we also heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1203" name="Joan Ruddock">the Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Joan Ruddock)</phrase> about her work in the women in politics programme in Zambia.</p>
	<p pid=".293.0/7">We have spoken about the fascinating and important work that the British Council carries out in educating populations and individuals around the world, but it is clear from listening to hon. Members' impassioned speeches that it is also informing politicians and parliamentarians in this country in a way that perhaps was not initially envisaged. It is not only informing but influencing political values and philosophy on the Labour Benches, as well as on other Benches.</p>
	<p pid=".293.0/8">Hon. Members highlighted the issue of water, either for building bricks or for water-treatment plants. It is interesting to note that, on average, African women and girls spend three hours every day fetching and carrying water. That prevents a number of young girls from going to school, which is an additional problem.</p>

	<p pid=".294.0/1">I was about to compliment my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/993" name="Helen Jackson">the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Helen Jackson)</phrase> on her speech, but she has not yet returned to the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid=".294.0/2">A number of questions were asked about Zambia and the heavily indebted poor countries&mdash;HIPC conditions, and about achieving the completion point in HIPC. It is expected that Zambia will reach completion in early 2005. That will reduce the debt by two thirds, from $4 billion to $1.5 billion. Although that still leaves a large debt, it is a remarkable reduction.</p>
	<p pid=".294.0/3">The hon. Members for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) and for Boston and Skegness (Mr. Simmonds) asked a number of questions. I shall answer as many as time allows. They asked about fluctuation contracts, which are primarily a matter for the British Council; such contracts operate independently of Government, and there is no reason for increasing grant aid to cover them. In respect of the 1,500 scholarships, people from 19 countries will be selected in conjunction with their African partners to ensure a proper profile mix of age, gender and region.</p>
	<p pid=".294.0/4">I was asked about Kenya and about the Islamic world. We operate with the advice, support and expertise of the British Council to engage with the Islamic world programmes. We work with a joint public policy board in Kenya, and we try to co-operate with and complement the work of the British Council there.</p>
	<p pid=".294.0/5">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness was right to say that the British Council still operates in Zimbabwe. I do not suggest that he advocates that it should not do so, but for the purposes of consistency I should say that the British Council operated in South Africa during the horrible apartheid regime. The then Conservative Government supported the continuation of that work and the council's engagement with civil and civic society. The British Council was not contaminated with the ethos or the policies of the South African Government, and nor is it contaminated now by those of Zimbabwe.</p>

	<p pid=".295.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that it is a great tribute to the British Council that it should stay in countries with such huge problems, as many NGOs simply pull out? The indigenous populations feel abandoned. Is it not an exceptionally good thing that the British Council should stay in such countries?</p>

	<p pid=".295.1/1">Absolutely. I pay tribute to the many thousands of staff throughout the world who work for the British Council; some of them have been mentioned, but time does not allow us to hear of the work of them all. The courage of the British Council staff who carry out such work in Zimbabwe should be put on record.</p>
	<p pid=".295.1/2">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness asked about value for money. A Foreign Office questionnaire is sent to all FCO posts asking about the British Council's contribution to the FCO's objectives. I am delighted to say that about 90 per cent. of the responses compliment the British Council on its work and believe that it offers excellent value for money.</p>
	<p pid=".295.1/3">I am pleased to join my hon. Friend in paying tribute to the work of the British Council. It works with us in partnership to deliver a strong, democratic and prosperous Africa. We still have much to achieve in that respect, as we have heard eloquently pointed out today. The council recently launched its forward-looking &quot;Strategy 2010&quot;, which strives to reflect the UK's international priorities. We welcome the &quot;Strategy 2010&quot; programme. It will make the council more flexible and efficient and equip it to respond quickly to changing public diplomacy needs. A key feature of the restructuring is the development of regional groups, as successfully piloted in the southern Africa region.</p>
	<p pid=".295.1/4">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the British Council face similar issues with regard to security. Both were pleased that the requests for a full bid of &pound;4 million and a further &pound;6 million as part of the 2004 spending review were granted so that improvements could be undertaken to ensure heightened security.</p>
	<p pid=".295.1/5">There is not ample opportunity in this vote-interrupted debate to pay accurate or appropriate tribute to the work of the British Council. That lack of opportunity is also due to the number of hon. Members who chose to attend the debate and to pay their own tributes to its work. However, on behalf of the UK Government and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, I would like to put on record our thanks to the leadership of the British Council and our praise for the staff members who operate in countries throughout the world, particularly in Africa. They rightly raise the profile of the United Kingdom and challenge some of the perceptions about it, but more importantly, they provide skills, information, training and personal and character development for many individuals throughout the world. We have heard examples of that related to Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".295.1/6">In a time of heightened cynicism about politics and politicians, anyone listening to the passion with which hon. Members spoke today would know that politics can be a force for good. The British Council plays an important part in informing politicians to argue for change, as has happened today, and its work is a crucial part of the priorities of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. I thank the leadership and the staff for the sterling work that they do on our behalf.</p>

	Disability Living Allowance
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-20.297.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/788" speakername="Martin Caton" colnum="297"  time="016:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/halltext/41020h04.htm#41020h04_spnew0">
	<p pid=".297.1/1">I know that my hon. Friend the Minister is aware of the &quot;Mobilise&quot; campaign being run by Help the Aged and a coalition of more than 20 organisations that work in the fields of disability and ageing. The central objective of that campaign, which already has the support of 230 Members of the House, is to remove the upper age limit of 65 for claiming disability living allowance. At present, if someone becomes disabled after that age, they cannot get DLA. They can claim attendance allowance, but that benefit is much more limited. Attendance allowance has no mobility component, so there is no financial help with mobility costs, no access to the Motability scheme, no access to the specialised vehicle fund and no exemption from vehicle excise duty.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/2">I support the &quot;Mobilise&quot; campaign. I believe that the current rules discriminate against older people who become disabled after 65. The rules stand in the way of that group of people living as independent, healthy and active lives as they otherwise might. In the name of justice and equality, I hope that the Government will look again at the upper age limit for that benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/3">This afternoon, however, I want to focus on the other end of the spectrum&mdash;the lower age limit for eligibility for the mobility component of DLA, as it affects some severely disabled young children. Before I do so, however, I want to pay tribute to what the Government have already done to help disabled people to live fuller lives. For children, that includes things such as the increases in the disabled child premium, the introduction of the disabled income guarantee, and the disabled and enhanced disabled child element in the child tax credit. In April 2001, the Government also reduced the age of eligibility for the mobility component of the DLA from five years to three years. That decision&mdash;taken on medical grounds&mdash;was very welcome.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/4">Today, I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to go that bit further for some children under the age of three. To make my case, I want to tell her about the experience of a family in my constituency, Mr. and Mrs. Owen&mdash;Andrew and Alison&mdash;and their daughter, Seren. Seren was born on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-14">14 April 2002</phrase> by caesarean section in Singleton hospital, Swansea. She was in a very poor way, and Alison and Andrew were warned after 18 hours that she was likely to die. The only treatment that could save her was at Glenfield hospital in Leicester.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/5">A Sea King helicopter was sent to Leicester for necessary equipment and a nurse, and then to Swansea for Seren. They were told that they should name the child, in case she did not survive. As it was night when she was picked up and taken up into the sky, they called her Seren, which means star in the Welsh language. Seren was and is a fighter, and she lived, and returned to Swansea. When she was 12 days old, her parents were told that she had cerebral palsy. In fact, she has quadriplegic cerebral palsy with hypertonia in all four limbs and hypotonia in her torso. She has cerebral visual impairment and some sensory hearing impairment.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/6">Although in her short life so far Seren has received a lot of medical attention and hospital treatment, the good news is that comparatively recent developments in equipment for children with her sort of condition can mean that operations and other intrusive treatments that would otherwise have been necessary as she grew up can be avoided. Her parents, like all parents, want to give her the best, highest quality of life possible. They have got hold of a range of positioning and seating equipment designed to aid postural management. I have visited the Owen family in their home; I have seen that equipment and lifted, or tried to lift, some of it. It is extremely bulky and some is very heavy.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/7">I want to go through what the Owens need to take with them when they take Seren out for the day, or part of the day, and what they need if they want to take her away for a longer period of time&mdash;to visit her grandparents or go on holiday. For a day out in Andrew's Golf car, the first essential is the specialist car seat, which gives total posture support and keeps Seren's spine straight, hopefully helping to remove the need for operations to correct curvature at a later stage. It is extremely heavy; in the family, only Andrew can lift it, and even then it is not good for his health. Living and working arrangements mean that it has to be transferred between vehicles at times.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/8">They also need Seren's special wheelchair for when the family reach their destination. It has been issued by the artificial limb and appliance centre at Rookwood and involves a CAPS II seating system that fits within a Blade Plus wheelchair. That is what they call an aggressive form of seating and support and, as with the car seat, gives the postural management that she needs. It is a solid piece of equipment, which does not fold down like a normal pushchair or even some wheelchairs. In the Golf, it completely fills the boot.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/9">Add the tubes and feeding sets that Seren needs, as well as the normal baby stuff for a child of her age, and there is only room for mum, dad and Seren. If any members of the extended family, especially grandparents, want to accompany them, a second car has to be taken. I cannot help wondering what happens in a family with other, older children and a severely disabled child of less than three years. Are they denied the opportunity of going out as a family at all?</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/10">Apart from Alison and Andrew's determination that they should go out as a family and do the things that we all do as families, Seren needs to be transported to different places for her development: for physiotherapy and hydrotherapy, the NCH stepping stones project, occupational therapy, speech therapy and work with her vision impairment teacher.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/11">What happens if Alison and Andrew want to take Seren somewhere and stay overnight, or over several nights? What is needed then? They need all the things that I have mentioned for a day trip, of course, as well as Seren's Jenx standing frame. She needs that because, as she cannot walk or stand, the ball and socket joint in her hips will not develop normally. The standing frame helps compensate for that, again hopefully reducing the likelihood of the need for later, restorative surgery or other treatment. She will also need her R82 Panda hi/lo chair, which is her feeding and social interaction chair. It is a sort of waistcoat design that provides total support of the torso but frees the arms to reduce tension. That piece of equipment, on its own, also completely fills the boot of the Golf.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/12">Seren cannot yet take all her food by mouth. She receives food overnight through a pump feeding system that involves a stand and pump. That needs to be taken, as do the foods and medicines that she requires. On a longer stay away, Alison and Andrew would want to take the special toys that Seren has, which are designed to aid the development of children with severe learning difficulties. They would like to be able to take Seren's other, more comfortable tumble-form chair, which is made with foam sponge and in which she can spend up to half an hour without harm being done. They would want her &quot;Wedge and Drema&quot; sleep system that keeps her legs separated when she is sleeping, which is also important for her future development.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/13">It is impossible for the Owen family to travel in one car on a visit overnight or longer, at least without leaving beneficial pieces of equipment behind. Fortunately, Alison manages to run another small car, so although they cannot travel as a family, they have the means to get themselves and all of Seren's stuff from A to B. How do families manage when they do not have access to a second vehicle? I suspect that some are largely trapped in their homes.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/14">To add to the difficulties for Seren's family, she has just had Botox injections to loosen her hips. She is supposed to spend parts of her day in a plaster cast&mdash;her present cast is removable&mdash;but she is due for another series of jabs, after which she will be fitted with a full plaster cast that will not be taken off for some time. Transporting her in a normal family car will again be made more difficult.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/15">The Owens' dream, which they cannot get near to affording, is for a specially adapted, large people-mover vehicle, with any lip on the boot removed, a ramp or lift on the back so that Seren could be wheeled straight in, and room for the other equipment. If the mobility component of DLA, and therefore access to a Motability deal, were available to under-threes such as Seren, the Owen family could have had that since they had first needed it. Through a combination of determination, superb logistical planning and buckets full of love, Alison and Andrew have made sure that Seren has had everything that they could provide that could help her, including getting her out and about.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/16">As Seren will be three next April, the Owens realise that if even if the Government agreed to consider changing the rules now, they would be unlikely to benefit. However, they asked me to raise the issue in the hope that other families can benefit from the help that they did not receive in the first three years of Seren's life.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/17">I first met Seren and her mum towards the end of last year. I visited them during a street surgery that I had organised in their village and neighbouring areas. At that time, they were also being denied a blue badge by the local authority. We managed to get that sorted out, and I wrote to the Minister on the issue that I am raising now&mdash;the lower age limit for mobility. In honesty, though, I did not fully understand the extent of the problem, and consequently I did not make anything like as full a case as I should. I concentrated just on the wheelchair and posture-protecting seating issue, when I should also have brought attention to the other items of necessary equipment that I have mentioned this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/18">In the responses I received from the Government, the point was made very clearly and logically that entitlement to the mobility component of DLA is based on an</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/19" class="indent">&quot;inability or virtual inability to perform the physical act of walking&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/20">I appreciate that it follows that as children in their first years of life do not walk, or do not walk to get around independently, the benefit is not regarded as appropriate for them. Put simply, for most kids until they are three, they will mostly travel by pushchair. Most kids' pushchairs fold easily, and are light and compact. Most kids do not need standing frames, special chairs, feeding pumps and the other equipment that I have mentioned, when they travel. Seren and some other kids do.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/21">I am not calling for the three-year limit to be completely removed. For many children who are disabled, a normal pushchair or even small wheelchair will be their main means of movement, and they will not require much more equipment than an able-bodied child in their first three years. What I want is the introduction of some flexibility, so that the category of child who needs specialist equipment to travel with them can benefit from the mobility component of DLA. We are talking not about huge numbers or amounts of money from the national Exchequer, but about the possibility of making a huge difference to the lives of families such as Seren's.</p>

	<p pid=".300.0/1">I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/788" name="Martin Caton">the Member for Gower (Mr. Caton)</phrase> on raising such a tremendously important issue. He rather modestly said that he did not make as full a case as he should have when he originally wrote to me. Whatever he feels about his original letter, he has certainly made a full and proper case today.</p>
	<p pid=".300.0/2">I start by saying how much we can all appreciate the difficulties that Seren and her family have faced as a result of her disabilities. This debate gives me an opportunity to explain the basis of entitlement to the mobility component of disability living allowance. I understand my hon. Friend's points, and I thank him for the balanced way in which he set out his case and explained his understanding of the Government's position on the benefit as a whole.</p>
	<p pid=".300.0/3">The DLA provides a contribution towards disability-related extra costs for people who are severely disabled early or relatively early in life. That is the raison d'&ecirc;tre of the benefit, which focuses on severely disabled people because they have reduced opportunities to work, earn and save, as compared with people for whom the onset of disability comes later in life and, perhaps, with the increasing frailty of old age.</p>
	<p pid=".300.0/4">There is a care component and a mobility component to the DLA, as my hon. Friend explained. In broad terms, entitlement to the care component depends on the effect that physical and/or mental disability has on a person's need for personal care from someone else. Entitlement to the higher-rate mobility component depends on whether a person is so physically disabled that they are unable or virtually unable to walk. Entitlement to the lower-rate mobility component depends on whether a person needs supervision or guidance from someone else when walking out of doors on unfamiliar routes because of a physical and/or mental disability. Those are the entitlement conditions.</p>
	<p pid=".300.0/5">Entitlement is not, therefore, based on specific medical conditions or particular physical conditions. It is based on the effects that a disability has on the personal care needs of each individual who claims it and on their ability to walk. For the DLA care component in cases involving children younger than 16, the need for personal care must be substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. That is the law. We recognise that some very young disabled children need substantially more care than non-disabled children. That is why there is no age limit at all on entitlement to the care component. However, entitlement to the higher-rate mobility component depends primarily on whether a severely disabled person is unable to perform the physical act of walking.</p>
	<p pid=".300.0/6">Identifying the likelihood of walking difficulties arising at some point in the future is not enough for entitlement. Decision makers who make such decisions on behalf of the Secretary of State must consider the person's ability to walk out of doors at the time a claim is made. They cannot anticipate later problems, but must consider the entitlement conditions on the date that the claim is made. Decision makers must take account of the distance over which, speed at which and length of time or manner in which a physically disabled person can make progress on foot without severe discomfort. Although the vast majority of children will be able to walk by the age of three or even two and a half, many will be unable to walk significant distances until the age of four. I describe such matters not to sound callous, but simply to set out what the law says and to remind hon. Members that the law must be applied equally in every case.</p>
	<p pid=".300.0/7">In the instance that my hon. Friend raised, we can all see that Seren has had significant difficulties, and will continue to do so. Given that it is clear that she will not be able to walk when she turns three, it is perfectly understandable for my hon. Friend to ask whether it does not therefore also seem clear that she ought to have the help that the benefit is meant to convey as early as possible. We can all understand the logic of that argument.</p>
	<p pid=".300.0/8">We have, fairly recently, considered carefully at what age the mobility component of the DLA should become available. As a result of that, we extended the higher rate to severely disabled three and four-year olds who are virtually unable to walk, with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-09">9 April 2001</phrase>. The decision to lower the age from five to three was based on the views of the Government's medical advisers that three years is the earliest age at which it could be reasonably established that inability or virtual inability to walk is the result of physical disability rather than late, normal development.</p>
	<p pid=".300.0/9">I do not say on the basis of that that Seren might have late, normal development&mdash;that is clearly not the case. However, we must of course have rules that apply across the board, fairly and sensibly. At any one time, the change&mdash;reducing the age at which the DLA higher-rate mobility component and mobility components in general become payable&mdash;helps around 7,000 families with three or four-year-olds who either cannot walk because of their severe disability or have very limited walking ability.</p>
	<p pid=".300.0/10">I understand the issues that the Owen family face. I appreciate that they have problems transporting both their daughter and the necessary but bulky equipment that my hon. Friend described, including the heavy wheelchair. I am pleased that Seren gets the higher-rate care component of the DLA, which provides much-needed help to the family. However, I am powerless to intervene in individual awards&mdash;I know that my hon. Friend realises that but I want to make it clear. Awards can be made only if the entitlement conditions are met. I have no scope to waive those conditions and allow extra statutory payments or discretionary payments, however difficult the case may be.</p>
	<p pid=".300.0/11">Nevertheless, we recognise that the costs associated with disabled children can put extra pressure on families with low incomes. That is why we have introduced measures to improve financial support for families with disabled children. For example, we increased the additional elements for disabled children in the income-related benefits and tax credits since April 2001 by &pound;17.40 above the normal cost of living increases to the current rate of &pound;42.49 a week. We introduced the disability income guarantee in April 2001, through the enhanced disability premium. Families with severely disabled children benefit from an extra &pound;17.08 in addition to the disabled child element or premium for each disabled child in their child tax credit or income-related benefit assessment, so additional help is available.</p>
	<p pid=".300.0/12">There is also a range of measures to help the least well-off families with disabled children. For example, help is available from the national health service with fares to hospital, and from the local authority social services with transport. A fund called the family fund may offer an avenue of help for exceptional cases such as this one. It can help with transport costs and may be able to give a grant if a child needs help getting out and about but does not get the higher-rate mobility component of the DLA. It has no waiting list for assistance, but the normal time taken from the application for such a grant to payment being made is about three months. In cases of urgent need, it may be able to work more quickly&mdash;applications can be fast-tracked and processed quicker. It buys vehicles to transport young children, but decisions made about grants from the family fund are a matter for that organisation, and I cannot promise that an application would be successful.</p>
	<p pid=".300.0/13">My hon. Friend is aware, as we all are, that Seren will be eligible to claim the higher-rate mobility component from her third birthday on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-14">14 April 2005</phrase>. It is possible for her family to apply for that up to three months in advance of her birthday to try to ensure that the award and the additional help is available to the family as soon as possible. I do not make the decisions, but judging from what my hon. Friend has said, I would be surprised if Seren was not eligible.</p>
	<p pid=".300.0/14">The specialised vehicle fund, which Motability uses to provide adapted vehicles of the sort that my hon. Friend suggested was the Owen family's dream, does not have a waiting list for applications. I would have high hopes that if and when Seren receives her higher-rate mobility component award&mdash;I hope that the family will apply three months before her birthday&mdash;the additional help offered by that award, by Motability and by the specialised vehicle fund could be put in place as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".300.0/15">I also note that my hon. Friend referred to the &quot;Mobilise&quot; campaign and early-day motion 953. I have noticed that a significant number of hon. Members have taken a similar view to that expressed by my hon. Friend and have signed the early-day motion on the subject of people aged over-65 being denied access to the mobility components of the DLA in addition to the care components that they can get by applying for attendance allowance. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/732" name="Roger Berry">the Member for Kingswood (Mr. Berry)</phrase> tabled that early-day motion on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March</phrase> and I recognise the undoubted level of concern among hon. Members who have signed it.</p>
	<p pid=".300.0/16">The campaign was launched in April by Help the Aged with the support of a range of other charities and interested groups. Its aim was to extend the provisions that were introduced to help those severely disabled people who were disabled early in life and to extend the mobility components beyond age 65. The key message of the campaign is that the current benefit arrangements are unjust and that the upper limit of 65 for claiming disability living allowance is discriminatory.</p>
	<p pid=".300.0/17">While I recognise the genuine concerns expressed by hon. Members and supporters of the &quot;Mobilise&quot; campaign, I do not accept that interpretation of the provisions. It is normal and sensible for pensions and benefit schemes to contain different provisions for people at different stages of their lives. Child benefit is not paid to adults, and pensions are not paid to children. It is normal for social security schemes to contain age-related rules. Government resources are not infinite and it is essential for help to be focused where it is most needed and most effective, in ways that reflect varying priorities and circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".300.0/18">For example, we provide child benefit only for people with children, working tax credit for people of working age and state pensions to those over state retirement age. In many cases, people disabled after age 65 will have had fulfilling lives in work, with opportunities to earn and save, unlike those who have been disabled early in life. The aim of the benefit is to give additional help to those experiencing the onset of disability at an early stage. They have less chance to work and save, although we are making some inroads into that situation. For that reason, once awarded, disability living allowance can continue to be paid after age 65 if the conditions of entitlement continue to be met.</p>
	<p pid=".300.0/19">We believe that we are right to focus the most help on those disabled earlier in life, for the reasons that I have set out. Therefore, we currently have no proposals to change the rules. Of course, I understand the concerns that hon. Members have expressed. The mobility component of the DLA is part of the extra assistance that we focus on disabled people of working age, who face significantly more difficulties than those who have worked all their lives and develop mobility problems after the age of 65.</p>
	<p pid=".300.0/20">The DLA age 65 rule, if I can call it that, gives effect to that policy. It was originally set out in the legislation that established the benefits, and the preceding White Paper, and it has been endorsed by successive Governments. The purpose behind the benefits has not changed and the rules in respect of age have not changed. Nor, I am afraid to say to my hon. Friend, who raised the issue at the beginning of his speech, has the policy of the Government changed. I hope that, for the reasons I have outlined, my hon. Friend will understand the policy issue, even if he does not agree with it, and that the Owen family will apply as soon as possible&mdash;three months in advance of Seren's birthday&mdash;for the higher mobility component of the DLA. I am sure that they will do so, given the well-documented organisation that they are clearly capable of. I am assured that the specialised vehicle fund can be called into play very quickly thereafter. We all hope that Seren and her family will then have available a vehicle that will make their lives easier.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-10-20.305.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/976" speakername="George Howarth" colnum="305"  time="016:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041020/halltext/41020h05.htm#41020h05_spnew0">
	<p pid=".305.1/1">I would like to place on record my gratitude to my hon. Friend the Minister for the funding that has been made available to Knowsley council through the building schools for the future programme. I know that he is interested and involved in that work, together with the local education authority. It is very exciting and will lead to a major improvement in our secondary schools.</p>
	<p pid=".305.1/2">I would also say, in opening, that I am going to raise an issue that is of concern in one particular school in the Sefton part of my constituency. In doing so, I am not criticising the Government's policy towards voluntary aided schools. They, in common with all other schools, are receiving increased funding. Both the Roman Catholic archdiocese and the Church of England diocese are very grateful for that funding, as are all the governors, head teachers and parents of all those schools, who recognise that significant improvements have been made.</p>
	<p pid=".305.1/3">I first came against this problem in May this year when there was a fire in the school kitchens at the Holy Family school in my constituency. I should say a few introductory words about the school, with which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/729" name="Joe Benton">the Member for Bootle (Mr. Benton)</phrase> will concur. The school is excellent, despite the fact that the buildings in which the school operates leave much to be desired, and despite other difficulties that the school has had to overcome. My hon. Friend the Minister will no doubt be aware of the results that it achieves in public examinations, which are very good, but he might not be aware of the fact that the Prime Minister's wife visited the school a year or two ago and opened its sixth form centre, which is an excellent addition for which the Department for Education and Skills provided a major part of the funding. It has not all been doom and gloom, but much of the school is in a pretty bad condition.</p>
	<p pid=".305.1/4">After the fire this May, the governors, the local education authority and the Department set off on an odyssey to resolve the problem. The situation was resolved very recently, for which I am grateful. It means that although the kitchens and dining area are being rebuilt, the replacement of three temporary classrooms, which I visited recently and which, frankly, are awful, will be put off until the next financial year.</p>
	<p pid=".305.1/5">I say that the problem has been resolved, and all the ducks now seem to be lined up for the funding, but the chairman of the school's board of governors asked me to seek the Minister's assurance today that he is confident that not only will the school kitchens and dining area be rebuilt, but that the three temporary classrooms will be replaced with new buildings in the next financial year. As I said, I visited the buildings recently and found them to be generally appalling. Children are being taught very well, but in very shabby circumstances. The rooms are difficult to heat and are too hot when it is hot and too cold when is cold. The storage facilities are also inadequate. It really is high time that they were replaced.</p>
	<p pid=".305.1/6">The situation at Holy Family school led me to the general issue of how funding works for voluntarily aided schools. I am indebted to both the Catholic archdiocese and the Church of England diocese for the briefing that they gave me, but I in no way hold them responsible for any of my errors in relating the issues to the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid=".305.1/7">As my hon. Friend the Minister will know, the buildings in the voluntarily aided sector usually belong to the Church, and the governing body is required to contribute 10 per cent. towards capital building work costs. The remaining 90 per cent. is provided by the DFES. This raises a couple of issues, which I want to highlight. First, because of this arrangement, the governing bodies of Church schools, in agreement with the DFES, insure their property for only 10 per cent. of any damaged building that might need to be reinstated. The custom and practice at the DFES was that 90 per cent. of that funding came from what is known as emergency capital funding, which is what eventually happened at the Holy Family school.</p>
	<p pid=".305.1/8">Recently, the DFES has not provided the full 90 per cent. of the funding, but only a proportion thereof. The funding gap had to be met from the school's own development formula capital. The argument is that this puts Church schools at a disadvantage. It could be argued that schools should insure for more than 10 per cent of the cost of replacing those buildings, but that would have obvious implications for the size of the premium they would have to pay, which in turn would affect other budgets for the worse.</p>
	<p pid=".305.1/9">At a more general level, I am told that there has been a significant recent reduction in the available funding for Church schools. It gets rather complicated here but I am sure that my hon. Friend will follow me. There are three main sources of funding: targeted capital funding&mdash;TCF; local education authority co-ordinated voluntary aided programmes&mdash;LCVAP; and devolved formula capital. DFC is for smaller capital work jobs and equates to approximately &pound;28,000 per year for a one-form entry primary school and is scaled up for larger schools.</p>
	<p pid=".305.1/10">LCVAP is co-ordinated by the local education authority for voluntary aided schools and has been significantly reduced in the past year. It is used for larger-scale building work; say, of over &pound;50,000. The example I quoted earlier would clearly fall into that category. TCF is for major projects in excess of &pound;500,000. There are no new TCF bids this year and, as a consequence, any essential work has to be funded either from LCVAP or DFC pots. In many cases, the money is not there and in those cases where the money is there no other building work schemes that might involve repair and refurbishment work can go ahead. That was certainly part of the problem encountered at the Holy Family school.</p>
	<p pid=".305.1/11">The Catholic archdiocese has concluded that the TCF bids for 2004&ndash;05 resulted in only one successful voluntary aided bid in the north-west. I should say that the Liverpool archdiocese covers part of Lancashire: that is why I have referred to the north-west in the debate's title. The Liverpool archdiocese had a total of seven TCF bids in five of its constituent local education authorities. These schemes included a replacement school in Skelmersdale in Lancashire. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1158" name="Colin Pickthall">the Member for West Lancashire (Mr. Pickthall)</phrase> is aware of this debate&mdash;unfortunately, he is chairing a meeting elsewhere in the building&mdash;but he has been in correspondence with the Department and is concerned about the matter.</p>
	<p pid=".305.1/12">This followed the closure of three separate primary schools and the removal of a significant number of surplus places. It also involved the single siting of two schools in two local education authorities, Liverpool and Sefton, both of which have separate infants and junior departments at least half a mile apart. In addition, within the Knowsley area, two schools identified by the Knowsley commission report for rebuild were also turned down despite being submitted by the same LEA team that was successful with the building schools for the future bid, to which I referred earlier.</p>
	<p pid=".305.1/13">In each case, significant surplus places would have been removed. I hope that that gives my hon. Friend an inkling of the voluntary aided schools' concerns. I do not want to be overly critical because I know that the Department is doing a good job in my area, but it would be timely if he could agree at least to a review of the way that the schemes work in relation to voluntary aided schools. I am sure that a review would ease the minds of governors and head teachers and the archdiocese and the diocese.</p>

	<p pid=".307.0/1">It is nice to serve under your chairmanship again, Mr. O'Brien. I am happy to congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/976" name="George Howarth">the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth)</phrase> on securing the debate. I know that this is an issue about which he feels strongly. I had the privilege of visiting Knowsley on Thursday and of being able to talk to him and to some head teachers and LEA officials about the excellent work being carried out in some schools in the area. I also had the chance on Thursday to meet representatives of Catholic dioceses from all over the country, including Merseyside, and was able to discuss some of their perspectives on the issues that my hon. Friend has raised. I realise that a visit to Knowsley by a junior Minister from the Department for Education and Skills does not rival the occasion of a visit from the Prime Minister's wife, but I was happy with the reception that I received, muted and low-key though it was.</p>
	<p pid=".307.0/2">My hon. Friends the Members for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East and for Bootle (Mr. Benton) have been doughty and determined champions of their constituencies in general, and for education in them. I much appreciate their work to highlight the good practice in their schools.</p>
	<p pid=".307.0/3">Not all voluntary aided schools are faith schools. Equally, a lot of schools that are not voluntary aided but are classified, in the jargon, as having a religious character, fit under a foundation, community or voluntary controlled banner, but that is not what this debate is about. It is about how we can do our best to help all schools through capital spending.</p>
	<p pid=".307.0/4">There is agreement that the immediate problems with the restoration of Holy Family Catholic high school after the fire damage have been resolved reasonably expediently. Funding has been earmarked from our locally administered capital programme for voluntary aided schools to replace some temporary classrooms, but, in light of the unfortunate fire at the school, that money was temporarily redirected into helping with repairs. We also provided additional help by way of a significant emergency grant of almost &pound;130,000. The good news is that, through the partnership between the local education authority and the Catholic diocese, funds have already been earmarked from next year's local programme to solve the problem of the temporary classrooms. I appreciate that that resulted in some delay in the work, which is an unfortunate consequence of the fire, but we cannot do everything at once, despite the record levels of capital investment going into our schools&mdash;up to &pound;5 billion a year from 2005&ndash;06. Difficult choices have to be made.</p>
	<p pid=".307.0/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East legitimately raised the issue of the different labels under which capital is spent. I hope that I can explain it in a reasonably clear way&mdash;certainly one that is clearer than some of the acronyms that appear. Capital spending is distributed in three ways: for major city or town-wide capital refurbishment in the secondary sector, we have the building schools for the future programme, of which Knowsley is in the first wave; for smaller necessary projects, we have the targeted capital fund; and the third tranche of money is devolved to LEAs and schools through so-called devolved formula capital.</p>
	<p pid=".307.0/6">In Knowsley in 2005&ndash;06, the devolved formula capital was &pound;1.2 million, which is not an insignificant sum by any stretch of the imagination, especially when one compares it to 2000&ndash;01, when it was a mere &pound;261,000. I need hardly say that it was much lower in 1996&ndash;97. Those three types of capital spending are used to try to account for the different sort of spend that is necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".307.0/7">The voluntary aided sector is fully involved in the building schools for the future programme. Some 30 Catholic schools around the country are fully involved in the first wave of BSF, of which Knowsley is a part. The same goes for the targeted capital fund, as some of it is reserved for voluntary aided schools and for devolved formula capital, with which voluntary aided schools play their part.</p>
	<p pid=".307.0/8">The capital programme for all voluntary aided schools has increased fivefold in the past six years to more than half a billion pounds a year. That money is specifically dedicated to voluntary aided schools. Holy Family Catholic high school has received direct capital investment of more than &pound;2 million since 1996&ndash;97&mdash;due, in part, no doubt, to my hon. Friend's doughty lobbying. It will also benefit from the BSF programme, and it is due to be rebuilt. That level of capital funding has given huge help to the sector, but it is also important to point out that there are further developments for maintaining progress. Perhaps what I have to say will deal with the point that he raised. A working group has been set up to consider issues relating to capital funding for the VA sector in particular, recognising its place in the framework of local schooling. We have already shared with the group all the information about how capital is allocated, and demonstrated the continuing funding pressures.</p>
	<p pid=".307.0/9">The arrangements for helping VA schools in the event of a fire or other loss have been in place since we reformed the capital funding arrangements for VA schools more than two years ago. Those reforms were agreed by voluntary aided sector representatives, and approved by Parliament through the regulatory reform order of 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".307.0/10">Where there is loss or damage, whether by fire, flood or other eventuality or calamity, the arrangement is that capital grant will be available to meet 90 per cent. of the costs. The governing body must have insurance to meet the remaining 10 per cent.&mdash;the 10 per cent. relates to the percentage of the work that VA schools must contribute themselves. That is part of the bargain with the voluntary aided sector. Interestingly, at my meeting with the Catholic dioceses on Thursday, they were very committed to that 10 per cent. contribution. They see it as part of the partnership between the voluntary aid of the Church and the state in respect of capital spending.</p>
	<p pid=".307.0/11">My hon. Friend raised the issue of whether we should examine insurance arrangements. I am happy to say that we shall do so at the next available appropriate opportunity. We welcome advice on whether to hold back money for such emergencies, but, obviously, that has implications. The danger is that the money is not spent.</p>
	<p pid=".307.0/12">I am pleased with the way in which the working group has begun its work. It includes representatives from all the major stakeholders in the voluntary aided sector, including head teachers. Another benefit of the group is that it can advise us on the balance of the capital programme for VA schools. My instinct is to move towards as simple as possible a method of funding distribution, but we also know that local ownership of, and engagement, with the spend is critical.</p>
	<p pid=".307.0/13">We know, too, that there are significant pressures that can be tackled only by a more targeted approach. Next month, we shall announce another major round of capital allocations, to April 2008. I am sure that the working group will help to inform us with respect to that programme. The group will also be helping us to ensure that the interests of the VA sector are properly reflected in the building schools for the future programme. That includes the decision-making arrangements to take account of the ownership responsibilities of the trustees of VA schools.</p>
	<p pid=".307.0/14">In conclusion, I thank my hon. Friend for his appreciation of the Department's work and for giving me the chance to give an account of the strength of the partnership between the VA sector nationwide and in his constituency. I look forward to continued progress on that basis.</p>
	<p pid=".307.0/15" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid=".307.0/16" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at seven minutes to Five o'clock.</p>
