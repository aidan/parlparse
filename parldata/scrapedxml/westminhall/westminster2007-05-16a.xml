<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-16a.262.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1684" speakername="Harry Cohen" colnum="262"  time="010:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070516/halltext/70516h0002.htm#07051672000535">
	<p pid="a.262.0/1">First, I apologise to you, Dr. McCrea, and to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase>, who presented the debate, for missing the first 10 minutes. I was actually late due to train delays, and as frustrating as they are, it is better that the trains are driven safely than that we have an accident. The same should apply to all industries, including the construction industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate and on his excellent speech. It is an important subject, and the UCATT report that motivated the debate is splendid and informative. He drew attention to that fact, and he has an outstanding record on health and safety campaigning in Parliament. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1658" name="Stephen Hepburn">My hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Hepburn)</phrase> called him a giant, and I echo those words.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/3">I sit on the parliamentary panel of the building trade union, UCATT, but there is no personal financial gain in that situation, and my concern for better health and safety long predates my membership of the panel. A number of hon. Members have a common interest in those situations.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/4">The UCATT report, which has been referred to, considered:</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Levels of conviction and sentencing following prosecutions arising from deaths of workers and members of the public in the construction sector.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/6">The report, which was published last month, showed that from 1998 to 2004 there were 504 construction deaths, only 21 per cent. of which resulted in a conviction. In that six-year period, prosecutions by the Health and Safety Executive following construction deaths fell by 75 per cent. That is an appalling set of figures and an appalling trend. In 2006-07, construction deaths rose by 25 per cent. In the current year, which started in April, there have already been 11 deaths, one of which was the death of a 15-year-old child. We are only in May, and those are serious matters for concern, but the HSE is prepared to shed 300 inspection posts, which seems to run counter to the trend of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/7">The Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Bill, which I welcome and support, is before the House, and I hope that it will soon be an Act of Parliament. I sat on the scrutiny Committee, and I voted in favour of company directors being directly accountable for health and safety matters. However, it looks as though that provision will be squeezed out of the Bill, so the reliance will be back on fines. I shall address the level of fines in a moment, because the UCATT document mentions them and they are relevant.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/8">It is perverse that company directors can go to jail if they are found guilty of financial irregularities, but that if their direct actions or their neglect leads to the death of a worker, there cannot be a prosecution and they will not be sent to jail. It is wrong. I come from east London, and in my area one of the current stories is about a fine of &pound;5.5 million that has been imposed&mdash;admittedly by the Football Association&mdash;on West Ham football club for a couple of player transfers. The club has been fined &pound;5.5 million, when employers are invariably fined just a couple of hundred pounds for the death of a worker, which seems perverse.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/9">My hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone made the point that one of the reasons why deaths on construction sites are so high is our culture of subcontracting and self-employment, which he called bogus self-employment. Alan Ritchie, the general secretary of UCATT, gave a good explanation why that ricochets into deaths in <i>Tribune</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-27">27 April</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Despite the strong health and safety rules in place, the casualised nature of the British construction industry makes it an unnecessarily dangerous place in which to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/11" class="indent">If Britain's employment practices were in line with the rest of northern Europe, then only 5 to 10 per cent. of our construction workers would be self-employed. But in this country the figure is around 50 per cent. These are not people who have specialist skills, tools or equipment. The vast majority of self-employed construction workers work in much the same way as normal workers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/12">He said that such workers are indeed bogus, because they do jobs and take orders, and are not in any way specialist. He also said that</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/13" class="indent">&quot;sites relying on bogus self-employment are less safe and suffer a higher number of casualties than sites which have direct employment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/14">Part of the reason for that is that such workers have no representation for health and safety, but the trade union does a good job in demanding health and safety on site.</p>

	<p pid="a.268.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> and all the hon. Members who spoke in this important debate in order to press the Government on a serious issue, which is getting worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/2">In the six years to <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-21">21 March 2004</phrase>, 473 construction workers and 31 members of the public were killed, which means that 504 people in total died from construction accidents. The average figure for all fatal and major injuries between 2000 and 2003 was 111 per 100,000 employees. In 2003-04, that rose to 121 and in 2004-05 it was above 118. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-27">27 April</phrase>, the chief executive of the Health and Safety Executive, Mr. Geoffrey Podger, said that he expected a 20 to 25 per cent. increase in construction deaths in the year to <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>. The situation is regrettably getting worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/3">What is happening in the HSE while that is happening? It is reducing the number of inspections, and it is expected to cut some 280 jobs and &pound;8 million from its budget by March 2008. Some &pound;3 million will go from publicity spending, &pound;2.3 million from workplace budgets and a further 5 per cent. cut will be made to the budget between 2008 and 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/4">We know that field operations and inspections fell by 40 per cent. between 2001-02 and 2005-06. There were 55,195 inspections in 2004-05, the lowest on record at the time, and that figure fell again in 2005-06 to only 46,032. As I say, that was 40 per cent. less than the figure for 2001-02. The HSE chief executive's leaked memo to staff of <phrase class="date" code="">10 August</phrase> said that the cuts would lead to</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/5" class="indent">&quot;difficult decisions and unwelcome consequences&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/6">I have learned in an e-mail from an official in the HSE, received in February this year, that within the construction division there are plans to have only 171 inspectors, whereas there are 182 now&mdash;a reduction of 11. I know that final decisions were going to be made at the end of March on resource allocation. Will the Minister give us the exact figure for the construction division in 2007-08?</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/7">The reductions have taken place in the name of the Gershon review, which was announced in the 2003 Budget. The review was supposed to</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/8" class="indent">&quot;ensure that frontline staff get the resources they need to do their job even better, and that the bureaucracy that can get in their way is removed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/9">The story seems rather different when we see what is happening on the front line of the HSE.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/10">Of course, not only the HSE has a role in this. We have to consider the Crown Prosecution Service and the courts, too. The HSE is prosecuting less overall. In 2003-04, 963 prosecutions took place, but only 712 took place in 2004-05. We have heard from many hon. Members that in 1998 there was a 42 per cent. conviction rate for construction deaths, whereas in 2003-04 that fell to 11 per cent. We have heard that, according to the HSE, 70 per cent. of construction deaths involve management failure. The HSE internal audit said that there should be a 60 per cent. prosecution rate for construction deaths. Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" name="David Laws">the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase>, I hope that the report will be put in the public domain. It would be strange if it were not.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/11">I am wary of prosecuting according to a percentage target alone, but questions have to be asked when the HSE admits that it is prosecuting only about half of the number of construction deaths that it believes it should. We have heard of the regional variations too&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-16a.274.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" speakername="Keith Simpson" colnum="274"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070516/halltext/70516h0004.htm#07051672000545">
	<p pid="a.274.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your authority, Dr. McCrea, I believe for the first time. I initiated this short debate because under the Norfolk primary care trust consultation document&mdash;the consultation is taking place between <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-06">6 March</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">5 June 2007</phrase>&mdash;St. Michael's hospital, Aylsham, in my constituency could close, along with two other community hospitals in Norfolk. That has caused widespread anger and dismay in Aylsham and the surrounding area, and those feelings are replicated elsewhere in Norfolk, where there are threatened cuts. My primary concern today is the standard of health care available to my constituents. I am not convinced that the alternative proposal of home health care will replace or enhance the facilities that will be cut at St. Michael's hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/2">The Minister knows that there have been widespread demonstrations against proposed cuts in community hospitals not only in Norfolk but elsewhere in England. People rightly suspect that the cuts have more to do with overcoming PCT deficits than meeting new health care demands. He will be only too well aware that his ministerial colleagues the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, the Minister without Portfolio and the Under-Secretary of State for Health have publicly protested about proposed cuts in their constituencies. I do not think that that ever happened under previous Governments, and it stretches ministerial responsibility almost to breaking point.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/3">In Norfolk, there have been widespread protest meetings, petitions and demonstrations against the proposed cuts. That is not the consequence of some out-of-date sense of nostalgia. Local people, including health professionals, value their community hospitals and are unconvinced that alternative health care delivery is a substitute. I have received thousands of letters of protest and petitions, and I have spoken to both health professionals who work at St. Michael's hospital and local general practitioners, and all are united in that view. I have not received one letter, e-mail or verbal representation that favours the proposed cuts or supports the view that an alternative home health care system would be a good substitute.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/4">One of the problems is that people in Norfolk have very little confidence in the PCT. The Minister is probably aware that the current chairman of the PCT, Miss Sheila Childerhouse, was an independent councillor on Breckland district council. She lost her council seat to a candidate who supported the campaign to stop the hospital closure. That says something about local feeling.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/5">The Minister should also be aware that my constituents are pretty well convinced that the consultation exercise that is now being carried out is, in the words of one health professional, &quot;a sham&quot;, and that the decision to close St. Michael's has already been reached. In the consultation document, St. Michael's is flagged up as a hospital that may close&mdash;I believe that &quot;will close&quot; is the view of most of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/6">The idea of closing community hospitals flies in the face of what was said in a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-15">15 March</phrase> that I received from the Minister's departmental colleague, the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" name="Rosie Winterton">the right hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton)</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/7" class="indent">&quot;We are committed to empowering citizens to give them more confidence and more opportunities to influence public services in ways that are relevant and meaningful to them, and in ways that will make a real difference to services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/8">I am not convinced that closing community hospitals and trying to substitute home-based health care in their place is, in fact, in line with Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/9">As the Minister knows, many of the problems that we face in Norfolk are a direct consequence of the continual reorganisation of PCTs that has taken place over the past six years. Reorganisation has been incredibly costly, and it has undermined professional morale and public confidence. The Minister will be aware that Norfolk PCT has an annual budget of &pound;900 million but debts of &pound;47 million&mdash;it is one of the most indebted PCTs in the country. That is a direct consequence of poor financial management in the past, the impact of Government NHS reforms and, of course, historic debt. Removing the deficit is one of the drivers behind the PCT's proposals, and I accept the fact that it is not the only driver&mdash;there is, of course, a genuine desire to improve health care&mdash;but the consequence is the likely closure of St. Michael's hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/10">The strategic health authority set the PCT a target to cut the deficit of &pound;47 million by &pound;23 million by the end of March this year, and to clear all the debts by March 2008. I understand that at present the PCT has been able to cut only &pound;3 million. How does the Minister think that it can reduce the deficit? Even if the deficit is reduced, what guarantee is there that it will not be repeated, given the fact that only three years ago, under the previous PCT reorganisation, PCTs Norfolk-wide had debts of nearly &pound;30 million?</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/11">It is also relevant to bear it in mind that the Government are urging that alternative health care be provided in the community as a consequence of closing community hospitals. <i>The Times</i> stated yesterday:</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/12" class="indent">&quot;A key target in the Government's health reforms&mdash;to have thousands of community nurses treating the most seriously ill patients outside hospital&mdash;has been missed&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/13">and that less than 50 per cent. of the required number of nurses are in place. Can the Minister assure me that we will not have a further reorganisation of the PCTs in the lifetime of this Parliament?</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/14">My constituents and most Norfolk MPs, regardless of political party, are frustrated that responsibility and accountability for health care in Norfolk are passed around between the Department of Health, the strategic health authority and the PCT&mdash;it is like pass the parcel. It is incredibly difficult to get a grip on responsibility. Ministers say that they have devolved budgets and responsibility downwards, eventually to the PCT, yet it is obvious that PCTs are constrained and often lack the kind of professionalism that is required. The result is that my constituents suffer.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/15">So far, my constituents have not been impressed by the PCT's consultation process. At a public meeting held in Aylsham on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-23">23 April</phrase>, the chairman of the PCT and a senior official were unable to answer some obvious and straightforward questions concerning the future of the hospital, alternative health care provision, redundancies among staff and, given that the constituency is a rural one, the ensuing transport problems. In proposing the closure of St. Michael's and other hospitals in Norfolk, the PCT hopes to make financial savings, hopes to reduce redundant bed capacity, hopes to concentrate facilities and resources on fewer sites and hopes to meet the Government's policy of providing health care to people in their homes. I emphasise the word &quot;hopes&quot;, because so far I have seen little evidence that it will be able to achieve that. Perhaps the Minister will be able to convince me that it will.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/16">Let me remind the Minister of the important services that are currently being delivered at St. Michael's hospital. They include physiotherapy, incontinence clinic, occupational therapy, occupational health, chiropody, speech therapy, women's health, falls clinic, Parkinson's clinic, splint clinic, dietician, Dr. Woodhouse clinic&mdash;Dr. Woodhouse is a Norfolk and Norwich University hospital consultant for the elderly&mdash;and a district rehabilitation centre consisting of 24 operational bed spaces and six spare bed spaces for emergencies. I know from talking to local health professionals, particularly local GPs, that those services make up a critical mass that provides total health cover 24 hours a day, seven days a week, which, in their considered opinion, health care teams cannot and will not provide.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/17">Many of my constituents have given me examples where elderly relatives stayed at St. Michael's hospital for post-operative recovery. Under the PCT proposals, local doctors have told me that many of those patients would have to be taken directly home without a stay at St. Michael's. If they were to have a relapse, they would find themselves back at the Norfolk and Norwich University hospital, which already has considerable pressure on beds and facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/18">When and if St. Michael's closes, many of my constituents will have to travel to alternative health care centres at Dereham, Holt or Norwich. The Minister may not have travelled in Norfolk, but as I live eight miles west of Aylsham in the market town of Reepham, I can assure him that, to say the least, public transport is not good. The proposed changes to St. Michael's will create major transport problems, particularly for the elderly, and for the journey times of mobile health teams.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/19">The closure of St. Michael's hospital flies in the face of the Government's aim to enhance community health centres. Localism is an important matter for all political parties in relation to not only health care, but many other delivery systems that central Government were expected to provide in the past. None of the proposed changes takes into account the profile of Norfolk's population, let alone the projected population profile. Norfolk primary care trust provides services to a population of more than 700,000. It is an ageing population, and more than one fifth of people are over 65 years old, which is approximately 150,000 people. By 2020, the elderly population of the area will rise to 200,000, which is a quarter of Norfolk's population. Currently, 30.9 per cent. of Aylsham's population is already over 60 years old, which is above average for Norfolk.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/20">The elderly often require many kinds of intense health care, and if St. Michael's hospital, Aylsham and at least two other community hospitals are closed, I suspect that in five or 10 years' time, this Government or a future Government would want to provide the kind of community facilities that exist now in Aylsham. Such facilities would probably be brought back to Aylsham or near to Aylsham. The Government and the PCT have not taken the age profile of the area into account. Furthermore, within the next 10 years, under local government proposals, Norfolk is likely to have an extra 70,000 houses, which will mean a population increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/21">In conclusion, I will ask the Minister a number of questions&mdash;I contacted his office to inform him of the questions, because I knew that it would be helpful if he had them in advance. Local people are unconvinced that the proposed home care teams will provide a credible alternative to what St. Michael's currently offers. What is his Department's assessment of Norfolk PCT's proposed plan? When St. Michael's closes, how will the 24-hour services that are currently met, in large part, by the provision at St. Michael's be met by mobile health teams? If patients have to go for treatment in Dereham, Holt and Norwich, what transport facilities will be provided by the PCT or the strategic health authority in addition to those available to individual families, either by using public transport or their own cars? If St. Michael's closes, what are the estimated financial savings over five years?</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/22">Meeting health care needs is an expensive business. Governments must continually look at how health care is delivered, and rightly so. There are continuing changes in developments in medicine and in the kind of total package that can be delivered. There must be an assessment of how populations change in an area&mdash;some areas effectively lose population while others experience population growth. I accept all those factors, but in 10 years of being an MP I have never known so much deep anger and resentment about proposed closures not only in my constituency, but across Norfolk.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/23">This is not just a question of nostalgia, although that is important. The hospital has received much financial support from voluntary organisations in Aylsham. It was originally a workhouse and then became a war memorial hospital. There has been a lot of local investment in the hospital, but the bottom line is that any changes in health care must, as a minimum, provide the same level of health care as my constituents have now. Any changes should, of course, aim to provide much better health care, and my fear is that, as a consequence of Norfolk PCT's proposals, my constituents in the Aylsham area will receive a reduced level of health care. I hope that the Minister will answer some of my questions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-16a.279.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" speakername="Andy Burnham" colnum="279"  time="011:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070516/halltext/70516h0005.htm#07051672000548">
	<p pid="a.279.1/1">The PCT is agreeing a recovery plan with the strategic health authority so that it can get itself to a sustainable position. I am informed that by the end of the next financial year that recovery plan should have been implemented fully. No new national targets are being handed down through the system this financial year. Admittedly, there is the 18-week target and there are other challenging targets on MRSA, but over and above those we want people to use the money to respond to local priorities and needs. The hon. Gentleman's PCT is no different from any other; we want it to have that freedom.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/2">On a further point of context, hospital lengths of stay have fallen by 20 per cent. in the last few years, and 70 per cent. of surgery is now carried out on day cases, with no need to stay in overnight. More and more people do not have to go to hospital at all, and up to half of the 45 million out-patient appointments each year can be provided in the community, along with minor surgery. It is recognised that people greatly value their local community hospitals; I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. St. Michael's Hospital is no exception. However, the public are telling us also that they want more convenient and appropriate services available at times and in places more convenient to them. That was very much the conclusion of the Government's White Paper of the same title as the local consultation that his PCT is running. After extensive consultation with patients, that became the paper's main theme. It is not some policy diktat from Whitehall; it is the message that has come over repeatedly to the Department through public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/3">We want more services in the community and, where possible, in the home, but in that regard we do not compare well with other countries. For example, in Germany all out-patient appointments take place in the community, and that is true in other countries as well. Public consultation on the PCT's proposals began on<phrase class="date" code="2007-03-06">6 March</phrase> and will end on <phrase class="date" code="">5 June</phrase>. The PCT's aims in taking those proposals forward are to provide flexible, patient-centred care delivered at home, or as close to home as possible; to provide health care in the most suitable place, and not, for example, in a hospital just because it is the only option available; to achieve a balanced and consistent range of services across the whole PCT area; and to achieve better outcomes for patients, helping them to maintain an independent life for longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/4">I want to dwell on that point for a moment because, without commenting directly on the proposals and whether they are right or wrong from a departmental point of view, it is important to draw attention to the fact that the PCT is saying that it can provide care to 25 per cent. more patients than is currently the case. Although I understand the strength of local feeling, it is important that the message is heard that the proposals are about providing people with more convenient services. They will allow 700 people to be cared for in their homes, rather than in a hospital. I accept that we have some way to go before we can convince the public conclusively that that is better, but the more that patients experience those kinds of services, where proper support is provided in patients' homes, the more minds will be changed. Some of the proposals announced yesterday demonstrate that lots of PCTs are taking forward the idea of the &quot;virtual ward&quot; where intensive support is provided for more elderly patients, or those suffering from a long-term condition, with the specific aim of preventing unnecessary admissions to hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/5">In my view, that must be the aim of the health service. It should not just be about building big hospitals and filling them, but about keeping people out of hospital in the first place, which the health service has not always done particularly well. It is right to move money around the system with that aim in mind&mdash;that is human progress and health progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/6">I understand that the PCT has organised a series of public meetings throughout Norfolk to give people the opportunity to express their views on the proposals, and I have been informed that they have been well attended; clearly, people are engaging with the process. I believe that I have signed many letters to the hon. Gentleman responding to his constituents, and obviously we will continue to respond to concerns raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/7">I shall address some of the specific points that the hon. Gentleman raised. He asked whether the PCT will be further reorganised. I recognise that the more recent changes caused disappointment among some NHS staff. There were good reasons for those changes&mdash;for example, to make them more coterminous with local government services. That was a very important part of the rationale for those changes. At the moment, I cannot envisage any reason for further changes or reorganisation of the PCT. Indeed, I would not welcome that at all, as he would not. I cannot tie the hands of a successor Minister, but from my point of view, there will be no discussion of that, and nor should there be. We want the new PCTs to bed down and work closely with their local authorities in order to provide the kind of co-ordinated services that I am talking about.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/8">The hon. Gentleman asked how the deficit can be reduced. I hope that he will agree that we are working with the SHA, which believes that there is a way forward for the PCT to tackle its overspending, but at the same time improve services to patients. That might require some difficult decisions, but I believe that a good plan is being formulated to ensure that it happens. He asked also about population growth in his area. I can assure him that in the next round of PCT allocations, adjustments will be made and consideration given to areas experiencing population growth, or likely to. The formula can be adjusted to pick up those pressures.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/9">The hon. Gentleman talked about the difficulties of people travelling around the county. I understand that fully and know that many of the villages are some distance apart. It can be difficult to get older people to use public transport, but let us remember that, as I understand it, the proposal is to provide many more services in patients' homes and greater convenience, thereby avoiding the need for the individual to be in hospital and for their family to visit them. So there are potentially huge benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/10">I cannot say a great deal more because it is a live consultation. I know that the hon. Gentleman is representing his constituents' views clearly and directly in the consultation. I hope that he will allow it to run its course and then take the right decision in the best interests of his constituency.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.1/1">The case that my hon. Friend raises is, sadly, all too typical. Some people have not only spent the money; they may also have taken on hire purchase agreements, based on the estimated new income. They cannot live on the basic income, which is obviously low in order for them to qualify for tax credits. They have then spent that money and taken on further debts. They have the worst of both worlds. It is perfectly reasonable to accept, as is in the rules, that if hardship will be caused, in some cases these debts must be written off.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/2">Mrs. Karimi is an honest individual who is working hard to this day. She is repaying her debts by working every alternate weekend and she is currently paying off an outstanding council tax debt at &pound;50 a month. That is no mean feat on earnings of about &pound;11,000 a year, but as she has told me, &quot;You can't get blood out of a stone&quot; and the threat to take her to court for the money will result in legal fees for lawyers and nothing much else. If ever there was a case of a debt causing hardship and needing to be written off, that case and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">the case raised by my hon. Friend the Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> are two examples.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/3">Mrs. Karimi had gone to the tax credit office with the correct up-to-date information and was told that no, she needed to provide out-of-date information, which both she and the tax credit office knew would result in overpayments. Yet because that is the way in which the system operates, she is told that that is the way it has to be. It is surely a recipe for disaster.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/4">Just yesterday, I was contacted by Citizens Advice, which is increasingly concerned about the rising number of cases in which citizens advice bureaux are having to advise clients about overpayments when the clients have no idea why they have been overpaid and find it difficult to obtain explanations. In many cases, even the amount owed is unclear. At the same time, in the past few months the number of clients who have been threatened with legal action for recovery of overpayments, even in those circumstances, has increased.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/5">The Minister might be interested to know that Citizens Advice is conducting an online survey asking the public to report their experiences of the tax credit system. So far, 80 per cent. of respondents have reported being overpaid, most of whom did not find it easy to understand why.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.0/1">I am delighted to participate in the debate. This is about the fifth time that I have debated this issue this year, given my role on the Treasury Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/2">In 2002, the Chancellor said:</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Our new Tax Credits are both symbol and substance of this Government's ambition for Britain.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/4">If they are a symbol for anything these days, it is error, fraud and incompetence. The substance, as we have heard from the Public Accounts Committee, is the &pound;5.8 billion that was overpaid to claimants in the first three years of the current tax credits scheme; the &pound;1.9 billion of overpayments that have either been written off or are likely to be written off; and finally, the increase in the income disregard, which was intended to reduce complexity and errors, that is costing &pound;500 million a year. The Paymaster General must be sick and tired of coming before the House to explain the latest sorry tale on tax credits, and she must also be tired of being used as a human shield. I am sorry that she is unwell and is unable to be here, and I wish her a speedy recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/5">At the time of the Treasury Committee's Budget hearing, the Chancellor had not answered a direct oral question on tax credits for 1,050 days. Another 48 days later, he still is not prepared to accept that the buck stops with him. Perhaps, after 1,100 days of avoiding the issue, he will see fit to use his first 100 days in his new office to confront some of the issues that three separate Select Committees have raised with such monotonous repetition.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/6">On the theme of repetition, I have three points to make, and I look forward to hearing the Financial Secretary's response in the Paymaster General's absence. According to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs&mdash;the latest facts that I have go up until 2005&mdash;two fifths of the moneys paid out involve overpayments and one fifth of them involve underpayments. So, three fifths of the money that is paid out to claimants is paid wrongly. I shall go into that later, but given an uptake of only 25 per cent., only two fifths of 25 per cent. of the people who should be getting money are receiving the right sum. That is the tragedy.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/7">I should cite a comment made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1729" name="Jim Cousins">the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins)</phrase>, who serves on the Treasury Committee with me. He gave his verdict on that state of affairs during the Treasury Committee's follow-up session, and I shall repeat it for the record. He said that</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/8" class="indent">&quot;under or overpayments of tax credits&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/9">&mdash;I cannot use the emotion that he did&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/10" class="indent">&quot;is a shocking, devastating damage to the whole welfare reform policy...these administrative deficiencies have a major impact on the Government's welfare reform policies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/11">In that view, the hon. Gentleman joins other, equally distinguished colleagues on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1810" name="David Blunkett">the Labour Benches. The right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett)</phrase> has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The tax credit system is a shambles&mdash;such a shambles that I've had to help out one of my constituents financially, only the second time that I have ever done this, and the first was for a child. I don't know if I will ever get the money back, but what else can you do when the tax credit system is such a total mess?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/13">That tragedy, and the emotion shown by my colleagues on the Treasury Committee, is driven by the fact that the poorest members of society&mdash;some 97 per cent. of people who earn less than &pound;10,000&mdash;should be receiving the tax credits. They deserve them, and they should be receiving the right amount. As we heard so eloquently from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase>, this situation puts an enormous amount of stress on these families.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/14">I live in a fairly well-to-do constituency, but 25 per cent. of the people who come to my surgery do so because they have received the wrong amount. These people have received letters that come across, to them at least, as highly aggressive and put even more stress on them, because they are being asked to give back, in some cases, thousands of pounds, and they simply do not know what to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/15">The financial problem is compounded by the fact that an enormous amount of money has been written off. When we had our Treasury Committee hearing, the amount was &pound;400 million, but I believe that the Public Accounts Committee recently said that the amount to be written off was a whopping &pound;1.9 billion. Braintree has been waiting for a community hospital for a couple of years, and we have been told that it will cost about &pound;5 million&mdash;for the sum we are talking about, we could build 200 community hospitals in Braintree. I believe that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West used the word &quot;shambles&quot;, but that is an understatement of the gross financial mismanagement of tax credits.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/16">My second point concerns the enduring complexity of the system, which has shrugged off all previous attempts at simplification. As I have said, the tax credit system is relied upon by millions of the poorest people, which is why the failures in its administration are such a scandal. Large numbers of people are put off from applying for money to which they are entitled simply because of the complexity of the system. In the poorest communities, where people should be applying for tax credits, word gets around very quickly. The word on tax credits is that they are often more hassle than they are worth. If nothing else, that is a condemnation of a system that the Chancellor, with the best will in the world, wants people to take up.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/17">I have brought a copy of the forms with me, and they illustrate the problem. I know that this is not show and tell, but I do not know whether the Financial Secretary has even seen a copy&mdash;he probably does not use the system. I admit that these forms date from 2005, so it is, at least, conceivable, if not probable, that things have got a little better. For the benefit of the <i>Hansard</i> reporter, I should say that there is a 12-page main form, with four additional pages to use if, like me, someone has more than two children, and a whopping 56 pages of guidance notes. I have at least two degrees, one of which is a finance degree from Harvard business school, and I find it challenging enough to deal with the complexities of the forms. Of course, the most useful information to claimants does not even come from HMRC&mdash;it is the four-page advice guide from Citizens Advice on what to do in the event of an overpayment.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/18">I repeat that tax credits are intended for the poorest and most vulnerable members of our society, who often lack the time and education to deal with them. The sheer volume of criticism that the system has attracted does not seem to have dented the commitment of Ministers to carry on regardless. Even if HMRC can improve fraud and error rates from their current woeful levels, there is little evidence that anything is being done to confront the root cause of that fraud and error, which is the complexity. HMRC is sticking its fingers in the dam and, as the Public Accounts Committee report from last week has shown, it is running out of fingers.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/19">My final point also concerns uptake, but it relates to the more cynical side of uptake&mdash;the extent to which it is budgeted for. I tried to get answers straight from the horse's mouth when the Chancellor appeared before the Treasury Committee earlier this year but, to stretch the analogy, it was a bit like pulling teeth. HMRC's report on child tax credit and working tax credit take-up rates, published in March this year, forms the basis for budgeting uptake. For public expenditure purposes, the Treasury assumes that take-up will continue to be in line with current rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/20">This was an issue when the Treasury Committee examined the Budget, because we were worried that the Chancellor's abolition of the 10 per cent. starting rate of income tax would result in a leap in the take-up of working tax credit, which had not been budgeted for. The Treasury has in fact budgeted for an uptake of about 25 per cent. Should one create a system in which one assumes that only 25 per cent. of people will apply and take up the tax credits which are their due and which they richly deserve? The answer is no. If everyone who was entitled to working tax credits claimed them, I believe that there would be a hole of more than &pound;1 billion in the public accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/21">Again, I tried pushing the Chancellor on this issue. Those of us who come from a business background would do some sort of financial model&mdash;we would do a sensitivity analysis&mdash;and we would ask, &quot;What would happen if there were 50, 60 or 80 per cent. take-up?&quot; Those are the aspirations mentioned by the Chancellor. He wants more people to take these things up, but he could not answer my question. I suspect that he and his team had done no financial analysis on a much greater take-up of working tax credits.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/22">The Chancellor would not comment on any potential increase in take-up, because he thought that any figure I gave him above the level of his projection was hypothetical and, therefore&mdash;in a leap of logic&mdash;impossible. I was delighted when he admitted to a group of schoolchildren recently:</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/23" class="indent">&quot;I did maths at school and one year at university but I don't think I was...very good at it&mdash;and some people would say it shows.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/24">I guess that I am one of them. If there were less wastage, which HMRC now seems to accept as a fact of life, perhaps the system could afford to sustain an uptake of working tax credits of more than 25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/25">My final concern about the tax credit system is that after all the mistaken payments, the write-offs, the fraud and the wastage, the Chancellor is counting on people not to use it to capacity. It is tempting to think that the system has been designed to fail, but fail it has, and that is the Chancellor's legacy.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-16a.290.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" speakername="Danny Alexander" colnum="290"  time="015:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070516/halltext/70516h0006.htm#07051672000556">
	<p pid="a.290.1/1">I may as well resume from the very beginning. I was paying tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West for his assiduous campaigning over a number of years, which has gained him a strong reputation as someone who takes a close interest in this subject. He is one of a group of MPs from both sides of the House whose assiduous work has put a lot of pressure on the Government to make changes, and they have done so, although I shall argue that the changes need to go much further.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/2">Like both previous speakers, I extend my good wishes to the Paymaster General. I hope that she makes a speedy recovery and I am sure that that sentiment is shared on both sides of the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/3">The debate follows the very useful discussion that we had in this Chamber in March, in which many of those present were involved. That debate was in response to the Treasury Committee's recent report on tax credits, which made some pretty pungent criticisms. Indeed, we appear to get a report making strongly worded criticisms of tax credits every month or so, given that we have also had the 22nd report of the Public Accounts Committee since then. That report also makes significant criticisms and comments regarding the operation of the tax credit system, and I shall bring one or two of those to hon. Members' attention today.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/4">It is worth saying at the outset that Liberal Democrat Members see the idea of the tax credit system and of boosting the incomes of low-income families to make work worth while as a good one, and it is important to see the issue in that context. Sadly, that good idea has been badly let down by the implementation and the way in which the system is administered.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/5">As we know, not least from recent speeches by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Ministers, and perhaps Treasury Ministers in particular, seem to be in the mood to admit past mistakes. That is particularly true of the Chancellor, although he seems largely to be admitting mistakes on behalf of other Departments rather than his own. None the less, perhaps the Minister will have a chance today to admit to one or two mistakes in relation to the tax credit system.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/6">I wonder, however, whether we are being over-optimistic in expecting the Chancellor to take responsibility on this issue. I noted with interest a report in <i>The</i><i>Mail on Sunday</i> about a documentary that went out on Channel 4 on Monday or Tuesday of this week, although sadly I was unable to see it. The article quoted Sir Nicholas Montagu, the former head of the Inland Revenue, who told Channel 4 that the Chancellor had apparently disappeared during the tax credits controversy. Sir Nicholas continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/7" class="indent">&quot;What was disastrous and I don't mince that word was that the system was fundamentally flawed. I did not actually see the Chancellor during the worst of that period&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/8">In <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1443" name="Brooks Newmark">his own inimitable way, the hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark)</phrase> made the same point when he said that, until recently, the Chancellor had not answered oral questions on tax credits on the Floor of the House for more than 1,000 days.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-16a.291.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" speakername="Danny Alexander" colnum="291"  time="015:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070516/halltext/70516h0006.htm#07051672000560">
	<p pid="a.291.3/1">I certainly think that the points that the hon. Gentleman has made, to which the excellent report of the Public Accounts Committee drew attention&mdash;I congratulate him on his work in ferreting out the information&mdash;are important.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/2">The point about the flow of information on tax credits is one that I want to return to. The glacial pace at which information is forthcoming is one of the most frustrating aspects of the debate, for those of us who want to scrutinise the system and hold it to account in real time. Too often we appear to be debating on the basis of information about what the system was like two, three or four years ago, when we know from the experience of our constituents today that many of the same problems still exist. It is hard to get to the bottom of the issue and find out the extent of those problems, because the Department seems to be quite unwilling to bring forth even basic management information of the sort that, for example, the Department for Work and Pensions seems perfectly able to produce on benefit administration. The Treasury could learn a lot from that Department. It is not often that I say that anyone could learn a lot from the Department for Work and Pensions, but in this case, on information provision, certain lessons could be learned.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/3">Before the hon. Gentleman intervened I was dwelling on a point about responsibility. Sadly, it seems in the case of tax credits that while Ministers are not willing to take responsibility for their own mistakes the system requires claimants to take responsibility for the mistakes made by officials. That suggests a topsy-turvy world where responsibility is assigned completely wrongly. That point was initially made in the excellent report by the parliamentary ombudsman, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West referred in his speech. As far as we can ascertain&mdash;I have asked about this several times before, and perhaps the Minister will find a way to respond today&mdash;it seems that only four of the 12 recommendations that the ombudsman made in her report &quot;Tax credits: putting things right&quot; have been accepted and implemented. If the Minister could give a definitive answer about what has happened on the implementation of the other eight recommendations, that would be of great benefit to the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/4">The most important of the ombudsman's recommendations seem not to have been implemented. She recommended, for example, that when an overpayment is alleged, the claimant should be sent a letter, clearly stating how it occurred. The point was made earlier that not only should claimants be told that an overpayment has been made; they should be given details of the calculation that led to the overpayment. The system has serious shortcomings in that regard. The recommended approach would give time for a challenge to be made before recovery of the overpayment began. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West pointed out the need for a pause, and Citizens Advice and the Child Poverty Action Group have also argued for a pause before the reclaiming of overpayments. I understand that the Department has been looking into the matter, and I should be grateful for an update on progress, and on whether such a change will be implemented soon.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/5">The ombudsman also made the point that there should be a statutory test for the recovery of overpayments, consistent with the social security benefits test, and with a right of appeal to an independent tribunal. It is utterly unreasonable for Revenue and Customs to assume that claimants should take responsibility for identifying errors made by tax credit office officials. Yet that is the system at the moment. Hon. Members will often have encountered constituency cases, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West mentioned, in which constituents have continually updated the tax credit office on the changes in their circumstances. A constituent of mine, in a recent example, had kept the office up to date with changing circumstances at every stage, but, having failed to spot one error in a blizzard of 13 different award notices sent in a short period, was held responsible for the overpayment. The burden of responsibility and proof is the wrong way round. That was among the most important of the ombudsman's recommendations: that HMRC should reverse the burden of proof, where the error has been caused by HMRC itself. The assumption should be that an overpayment is not recoverable unless it is reasonable to think that the mistake would have been obvious and, clearly, if the mistake was obviously made by the claimant.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/6">The Public Accounts Committee report is the result of the fourth occasion on which the Committee has had to investigate the system. It concludes that the Treasury has still not developed adequate systems or an adequate response to the large-scale chaos that it has caused. That is in line with the impression of many Liberal Democrat Members, and the impression that hon. Members seemed to have formed in the Westminster Hall debate in March, that the Treasury continues to be in denial about the level of maladministration, passing it off as teething problems. More importantly, it is in denial about the impact that that has on the individuals who are directly affected. It is clear from both the Treasury Committee and the Public Accounts Committee reports, couched as they are in moderate parliamentary language, that members of those Committees share the anger and frustration about the system that many hon. Members feel on behalf of their constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/7">The Public Accounts Committee concluded:</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/8" class="indent">&quot;Tax credits suffer from the highest rates of error and fraud in central government, undermining HMRC's reputation for accuracy, fairness and proper handling of taxpayers' affairs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/9">That is a pretty damning indictment. The Treasury Committee report made it clear that progress on the problem had been inadequate in the past year, commenting that it was</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/10" class="indent">&quot;not convinced that the Paymaster General and the Department fully realise the extent to which HMRC needs to re-focus its administrative structures for tax credits around the needs of claimants.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/11">The needs of claimants are the real issue. That is what motivates so many Members of the House to become involved in the issue; because as well as causing losses to the Exchequer, overpayments cause real hardships to claimants. The Treasury Committee report highlighted the case research that showed that the incomes of low-income families are especially volatile. Tax credits&mdash;especially overpayments and the reclaiming of those&mdash;can make matters much worse, causing people to live on a financial rollercoaster.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/12">The reasons for overpayments are often unclear to the claimants, who are often held responsible not just for their own mistakes but for those of officials. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West referred to such instances. He also made the point that, sadly, such mistakes&mdash;and the last figures that are available, for 2004-05, show about 2 million families being affected by overpayments&mdash;undermine confidence in the whole system. His account of having to persuade people to reapply to enter the tax credit system, when they are reluctant owing to their own or their friends' experience, is borne out by the point made by the hon. Member for Braintree about take-up&mdash;of working tax credit in particular. That shows that the perfectly fair amount of negative publicity that the system has received, given the incompetent administration that has beset its early years, has affected claimants' attitudes and experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/13">Claimants who engage with the system have recently encountered other problems, including when they use the telephone helpline. That is not a criticism of the staff, who I know, through my dealings with the MP hotline, try to be helpful. A beneficial feature is that it is now possible to get hold of recordings of claimants' telephone conversations on the helpline, to try to understand the information that was provided. There are examples of claimants who felt that they were offered reassurances that an overpayment would not be recovered until the following year, and of claimants who were advised to appeal, only to be told much later that in such circumstances an appeal was not possible. Often, therefore, false expectations were raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/14">It is clear from listening to phone calls that despite the best efforts of the staff, some do not necessarily understand the operation of the whole system, perhaps because of the way in which they are separated into different management areas of the organisation. However, when making contact via the telephone helpline, the claimant fully expects to deal with someone who fully understands the operation of the whole system.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/15">I am concerned that staff reductions at HMRC will have an impact on the service that tax credit claimants receive. There is already a great deal of centralisation in call centres, but staff reduction in district offices such as the Inverness office will undoubtedly affect claimants' ability to obtain face-to-face service and assistance. Many claimants find it useful, because it is sometimes the only way in which they feel that they can get their point across, given the difficulties that they experience with the telephone helpline. I hope that the Financial Secretary will address that point in his response.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/16">It is also clear that the appeals process has been made increasingly tough. While millions of people still suffer overpayments, the number who have had their overpayments written off has substantially reduced, causing even greater hardship. In 2005, there were 351,000 disputed overpayments, of which 162,000 were written off. In 2006, there were 350,000 disputed overpayments, of which only 14,000 were written off. The rate of written-off overpayments has fallen from one in every two disputes to more like one in every 25, suggesting that the process by which disputed overpayments are assessed and decided on has become increasingly harsh. Taking up cases on behalf of constituents, Members from all parts of the House have experienced that situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/17">Recent parliamentary answers show that the number of cases in which the tax credit office and HMRC have taken legal proceedings to recover overpayments has increased dramatically in the past year. Again, I should be grateful for the Financial Secretary's comments on HMRC's increasing willingness to use legal proceedings to pursue families, who are still sometimes on very low incomes, through the courts for the money that they owe.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/18">The provision of information is important in understanding the system and in holding Ministers to account for its operation. In the next week or so, the latest tranche of information on tax credits will be published, probably for 2005-06&mdash;18 months to two years ago. The Paymaster General explained the reasons for that situation, but it highlights the difficulty in getting hold of up-to-date information from the Treasury compared, for example, with the Department for Work and Pensions. That point has been made in the recent reports to which I have referred, and the Public Accounts Committee was critical about the lack of up-to-date information on levels of fraud and error.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/19">There is a particular issue about the Social Security Advisory Committee. It has a statutory relationship with the DWP, but the committee does not have a statutory duty to be consulted by the Treasury on the benefits&mdash;tax credits and child benefit&mdash;that it administers. I should like that duty to be introduced, and particularly, the reports to be made public, so that people can understand the advice that that body of experts&mdash;the SSAC&mdash;offers.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/20">What needs to be done? The ombudsman's recommendations should be implemented in full; the pause has already been mentioned; there need to be greater appeal rights; and the forms must be clearer and simpler. Even after recent efforts, the award notices would still make the Scottish elections' ballot paper look simple. Given those problems, it is hardly surprising that many people find tax credit award notices hard to understand.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.3/21">In the long term, the Liberal Democrats would like much more stability in the system, and the reconsideration of fixed awards. That would strip away the instability&mdash;the financial rollercoaster&mdash;that causes hardship for so many hard-working low-income families whom the system was designed to benefit.</p>

	<p pid="a.295.1/1">I am mindful of your guidance, Dr. McCrea. My only challenge is that there has been an incredible amount of business in the tax credit system in the past week alone, so I do not want people to miss their opportunity to be represented.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> on securing this Adjournment debate and on introducing it so clearly. It is also a pleasure to be in the Chamber opposite the Financial Secretary this afternoon. I should normally debate the issue with the Paymaster General; indeed, I have done so in the Chamber several times. However, we are well aware why she cannot be here this afternoon, and I, like many other hon. Members, hope that she will continue to recover well. I ask the Financial Secretary whether he would be good enough to pass those sentiments on to her when they next speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-15">15 March</phrase>, we debated tax credits in the Chamber based on the sixth report of the Select Committee on the Treasury in the 2005-06 Session, entitled, &quot;The Administration of Tax Credits&quot;. That report was very critical of the operation of the tax credit system, which was designed specifically by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The report highlighted areas such as IT system error, the level of overpayments, the recovery of overpayments, fraud, error and organised crime, and even the availability of information about the tax credits regime as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/4">Tellingly, in terms of the extent of fraud and error within the system, the Treasury Committee concluded:</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/5" class="indent">&quot;We are concerned that it is now over two years since the end of the 2003-04 tax year, and yet HMRC is still to establish final levels of claimant error and fraud in the tax credits regime for that year.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/6">That point was well highlighted in the very good contribution from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1443" name="Brooks Newmark">my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/7">Moving forward to today, we can take as our text the more recent report by the Public Accounts Committee, entitled simply, &quot;Tax Credits&quot;, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May</phrase>, representing the fourth time that the PAC has investigated the new system of tax credits that the Chancellor introduced in 2003. The report was excoriating, pointing out among other things that almost &pound;6 billion has been overpaid to claimants since 2003; that</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/8" class="indent">&quot;tax credits suffer from the highest rates of error and fraud in Government&quot;;</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/9">and that the Treasury</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/10" class="indent">&quot;failed to design the tax credits scheme to give proper protection against error and fraud.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/11">The PAC's critical analysis provoked considerable comment in the media, including remarks on almost all national news bulletins, on national radio and in the press. Despite the best efforts on that day of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury to limit the damage, I have a sample of just a few comments that followed in the press.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/12">First, <i>The Daily Telegraph </i>summarised the situation:</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/13" class="indent">&quot;Gordon Brown's flagship tax credits system has handed out nearly &pound;6 billion of overpayments in the space of just three years, a damning report by MPs reveals today&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/14"><phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/15">It continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/16" class="indent">&quot;The scale of the problem is so large that officials have already been forced to write off more than &pound;500 million of overpayments and are 'unlikely' to recover a further &pound;1.4 billion, the report said. In a withering analysis the MPs stressed that a further &pound;1.28 billion of tax credits was lost in a single year as a result of 'unacceptable' fraud and error.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/17">The <i>Daily Mail</i>, in an article entitled &quot;&pound;2 Billion Lost to Fraud and Error in Tax Credits Fiasco&quot;, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/18" class="indent">&quot;MPs on the Public Accounts Committee blasted ministers for failing to tackle the 'unacceptable flood' of tax credits overpaid or lost through mistakes and fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/19" class="indent">The all-party committee found Chancellor Gordon Brown's flagship system was...in meltdown, despite repeated promises that it was being improved.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/20">In the interests of balance across the political spectrum, I can also tell the Chamber that the <i>Daily Mirror </i>concluded:</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/21" class="indent">&quot;The report slams Ministers and officials for failing to get a grip and Revenue and Customs for not stopping the 'flood of money wasted'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/22"><i>The Guardian</i>, in slightly more detail, put the matter like this:</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/23" class="indent">&quot;The Treasury is poised to write off &pound;2 billion&mdash;equivalent to 1p on income tax&mdash;as uncollectable from Gordon Brown's tax credit scheme, a report by MPs reveals today. The figure is almost four times higher than disclosed a year ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/24" class="indent">The complex scheme, which pays out money to the low paid, has been dogged by fraud and error since it was introduced in 2003. Ministers have already admitted that &pound;5.8 billion has been paid to people who should not have received the money.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/25" class="indent">In evidence to MPs which is published today, the Treasury admits &pound;1.9 billion cannot be recovered. The report details that money collected has often caused hardship to the low paid who were suddenly landed with big bills. The scheme was also vulnerable to fraud and error, and internet claims had to be abandoned in 2005 after 'sustained' attacks by criminals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/26">Scotland has very much been in the news recently and we would not want it to miss out, so for good measure, here is how <i>The Scotsman</i> put it:</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/27" class="indent">&quot;Billions of pounds are still routinely overpaid to tax credit claimants, years after errors in the system were pointed out to ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/28" class="indent">The government's response to the tax credits fiasco, which will cost taxpayers unforeseen amounts, is still inadequate&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/29">In case the Financial Secretary thinks that I have over-egged the pudding, I have left out quotations from the <i>Daily Express</i>, <i>The Independent </i>and <i>The Sun</i>.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-16a.297.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1772" speakername="Mark Francois" colnum="297"  time="015:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070516/halltext/70516h0007.htm#07051672000564">
	<p pid="a.297.1/1">I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention. As I am a great believer in the Union, I am relieved to hear that tax credits got the same panning in the north of Scotland as they did in much of the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/2">The fundamental problem with the new tax credits system, which the Chancellor has designed, is its inherent complexity, which makes it both difficult to understand by claimants and complex to administer by HMRC. My hon. Friend the Member for Braintree gave the good example of the complexity of the forms and the 56 pages or so of guidance notes, which are available to help claimants to try to fill them in. In short, the currently configured system is not user-friendly&mdash;in fact, quite the reverse. As a result, the levels of error are becoming staggering. Of some 5 million families who now claim tax credits, around 2 million are overpaid, while just under 1 million are underpaid. In other words, more than half of all the payments in the entire system are wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/3">Senior HMRC officials recently admitted to Parliament that many claimants do not understand the system because it is so complex. Sarah Walker, the director of credits and benefits at HMRC, said in evidence to the Treasury Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-14">Wednesday 14 March 2007</phrase>,</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/4" class="indent">&quot;we are making it clear to people what we expect them to check around their award and what we do not. We do not expect them to be able to understand the whole calculation because that can be quite difficult&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/5">The problem of immense complexity, to which even HMRC admits, was well summarised by the <i>Yorkshire Post</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May</phrase> in the following terms:</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Gordon Brown's masterful use of obfuscation and complexity has born much bitter fruit, and one of the nastiest is his tax credits system.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/7" class="indent">Since his introduction of the present system in 2003, taxpayers have seen nearly &pound;6 billion of the money they have paid to the Treasury incorrectly handed out.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/8" class="indent">That loss is galling, but perhaps the worst aspect of this fiasco has been the 'claw-back' which HM Revenue and Customs has engaged in when recovering money from families which had been paid too much. The Commons Public Accounts Committee says that collecting overpayments has caused hardship to many people...Mr Brown's brainchild is so shambolic that it continues to be riddled with problems. He has refused to answer Commons questions on these problems for many years. It is time that the Chancellor faced up to this shambles which is entirely of his own making.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/9">Quite.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/10">All hon. Members who have spoken have raised the problem of overpayments, which appears to be at the heart of the system's difficulties. The Public Accounts Committee pointed out that since 2003 almost &pound;6 billion had been overpaid, &pound;500 million of which had already been written off. In reality, many families had absolutely no idea that they had been overpaid until they suddenly received an official notice from HMRC stating that they had been, but often without telling them how that had been calculated and nevertheless demanding that they pay the money back.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/11">By definition, many of the families claiming tax credits have few if any savings. Overpayments therefore present them with a serious difficulty, not least because in most cases they honestly did not realise that they were in the wrong in the first place, because the system is so complex. We are now in a situation where HMRC officials admit to Parliament that many claimants do not understand the system because it is so complex, yet they are held responsible for not reporting to HMRC that they have been overpaid, by a system that it acknowledges they do not understand. When claimants appeal, they come up against code of practice 26, which says that they must not only prove that HMRC made an error, but pass a reasonableness test, to which I shall return.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/12">All those problems have been well highlighted by Citizens Advice, both locally, to many Members of Parliament, and nationally. John Wheatley, the social policy officer of Citizens Advice, said the following about the weaknesses in the system, in a press release of <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-11">11 April 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/13" class="indent">&quot;Some families have been left seriously out of pocket and confused because they are being asked to pay back tax credits, which they believed they were entitled to. Challenging the recovery of overpayments is not easy and currently thousands of families are being threatened with court action. People often say that they have received contradictory award notices, or been told that the money definitely is theirs; overpayments can even happen when no mistake has been made.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.303.4/1">Those figures are about the increase in the entitlement. The figures that were reported at the time and that I was talking about were the cost of the overall package of reforms. There is no inconsistency between the two figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.4/2">Finally, the amount by which payments can be reduced in order to recover an in-year overpayment has been restricted significantly for low-income customers. The hon. Member for Rayleigh mentioned the debate that he had on this subject with the Paymaster General after the Treasury Committee report was published. She announced that HMRC was about to start a pilot designed to help a group of claimants at one of the most difficult times of their lives, when relationships break down. It has conducted that pilot and is now carefully considering the results. I hope that we will be able to draw conclusions about a potential approach this summer.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-16a.304.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1918" speakername="John Healey" colnum="304"  time="015:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070516/halltext/70516h0009.htm#07051672000585">
	<p pid="a.304.1/1">In the Treasury and HMRC, we are keen to respond when we can to suggestions or requests for greater information about how the tax credit system is working. We shall certainly aim to do that, and the pilot is clearly of significance to not only HMRC and Treasury Ministers, but to a much wider audience.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.1/2">The hon. Member for Ludlow basically said that the tax credit system is complex. With the important aspect of flexibility in the system inevitably comes a degree of complexity, and in the end the judgment has to be whether the advantages of the flexible system outweigh the disadvantages and difficulties that can be caused by the system becoming more complex to understand. The flexible system of tax credits means that families can get extra support when their needs are greatest. That is particularly important in today's modern labour market, in which in any one year 3 million people change jobs and at least 200,000 men and women move into new, better jobs and see their family income rise by more than &pound;10,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.1/3">The only way to avoid end-of-year adjustments would be to have a system in which the payments were fixed and based on past information. In 2004-05, 700,000 families had a fall in their income but increased entitlement to tax credits. Under a fixed system they might have had to wait for up to two years before their income was reflected in their tax credit entitlement. If their income were to fall by &pound;5,000, that could mean that they would lose out on about &pound;2,000 of tax credits each year. Similarly, if someone receiving tax credits for a child had a second baby, they would have to wait until the end of the tax year to get any extra money. That would mean that they could lose out on nearly &pound;2,400.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.1/4">HMRC is keen to deliver better improvements to the system, and it has clarified the reasonable belief test that it uses to determine whether an overpayment is recoverable. The test is based on long-standing practice in the system and sets out that tax credit overpayments will be written off when there has been a mistake by HMRC and it was not reasonable for the claimant to have spotted the error. I wish to dwell on that for a moment, because a couple of hon. Members have asked me about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.1/5">Let me be clear: HMRC does not expect people to check whether their award has been calculated correctly. If the helpline wrongly tells a claimant that their award is correct, even though they have questioned it, HMRC will rightly accept that as passing the reasonable belief test. In short, it expects claimants to check the factual information on their award notices, such as how many children they have and what their income is. It also expects them to check whether the amount going into their bank accounts matches the amount in the award notice. Building on those improvements, a pilot will start in the next few months to provide an independent review of HMRC decisions on whether to recover an overpayment caused by official error. That will give claimants the option of having their cases reviewed by the adjudicator by a fast-track process.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.1/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> was concerned about hardship. The measures recently put in place to help that include reduced recovery rates for those on low incomes. For those who no longer receive an award, 12-month instalment plans are available with longer repayment periods where necessary. Where there are difficulties in the system, we are working hard to deal with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.1/7">In debates such as this and as Back Benchers in Committee, hon. Members play a useful part in ensuring that HMRC's attention is concentrated on the problems. However, tax credits have helped to increase the number of people in work, improved the incentives to work, reduced the tax burden for many families and helped to reduce child poverty dramatically in the past decade.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-16a.306.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" speakername="Philip Hollobone" colnum="306"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070516/halltext/70516h0009.htm#07051672000586">
	<p pid="a.306.1/1">I thank Mr. Speaker for granting permission for the debate to be held. I welcome the Minister and look forward to hearing his response in due course. I am pleased to welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase>, who, with your permission, Dr. McCrea, will also participate in the debate and concentrate on some aspects of the future funding of the hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/2">People in and around Kettering are extremely proud of our local hospital. It was founded in 1897, so this is its 110th year on the same site in Kettering. It would be remiss of me to proceed further without placing on the parliamentary record my thanks and those of all my constituents to the doctors, nurses and ancillary and administrative staff at Kettering general hospital for their wonderful work for local people, which is widely appreciated.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/3">Kettering general hospital does wonderful work, and a report by the Healthcare Commission, its latest in-patient survey, which was released today, shows that 95 per cent. of patients at the hospital have rated the overall care that they received as either excellent, very good or good. Only 4 per cent. rated it as fair, and only 1 per cent. as poor. That is a tremendous record. Having said that, it would be remiss of me not to say that there are people in serious circumstances who have been let down by the hospital. The situation of those patients&mdash;I am sure that you have such patients in your constituency, Dr. McCrea&mdash;is extremely serious, and it is our job as Members of Parliament to ensure that they get the appropriate redress.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/4">I wish to invite the Minister to visit Kettering general hospital. His colleague the Prime Minister visited in February 2005, but his visit was wholly inappropriate. He visited the hospital not as Prime Minister but as leader of the Labour party and held an election rally on the hospital premises. That was a black day for the hospital. I would welcome the Minister, in his capacity as Health Minister, visiting the hospital to see the wonderful work that goes on there and learn first-hand about the challenges that it faces in the years ahead. I hope that he will give that invitation, which I deliver on behalf of the Kettering General Hospital NHS Trust, full and proper consideration. He would get a warm welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/5">I applied for this debate because Kettering general hospital faces real challenges in the next 10 or 20 years, primarily because of the rapid growth that will take place in the local population up to 2031 as a result of the sustainable communities plan promoted by the Department for Communities and Local Government. In north Northamptonshire an extra 52,000 houses are to be built by 2021&mdash;in other words, over the next 14 years. The local population will increase by at least a third, and possibly more, which is one of the fastest rates of population growth anywhere in the country. One does not need to be a rocket scientist to work out that if the local population is to increase by at least a third, the medical needs of the population will also increase by at least at third. That, crudely, means that we will need one third more GPs and a one-third increase in hospital facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/6">Unfortunately, against the background of rapid and significant population growth there are significant capacity shortfalls at Kettering general hospital, and the staff are working flat out to meet the health needs of the local population, not least in the accident and emergency department. The situation has been made worse by the forced merger of the local primary care trusts by the Department of Health last year. That was bad news for Kettering general hospital because the now combined Northamptonshire PCT has a cumulative deficit of &pound;44 million, which is to be shared out across the whole of the county. The problem for Kettering general hospital is that it is an extremely efficient hospital, in the way that such things are measured, and the deficit of the Northamptonshire Heartlands PCT, which was responsible for the north of Northamptonshire, was not anything like the deficit of the Daventry and South Northamptonshire PCT.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/7">In other words, health services for constituents in Kettering, Wellingborough and Corby are being cut back because of financial overspends elsewhere in Northamptonshire, and the effect of that has been that Kettering general hospital has had to cut back on some of its procedures. It had to delay the opening of its wonderful new treatment centre in October last year until this April, wards have been closed, procedures have been cancelled and waits have been extended. All of that was the result of the Department's wrong decision to merge the PCTs in Northamptonshire, against the wishes of the county's Members of Parliament, including myself.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/8">The cuts have not helped the serious infection control situation at Kettering general hospital. Local people are rightly proud of the work that the hospital does, but it is sad indeed that in 2006 it had the worst record in the whole country for clostridium difficile infections. The figures are slightly distorted because the method for collecting them means that community-based infections are included with the hospital's infections. Nevertheless, there were 641 cases in 2006&mdash;the country's worst. That rather contrasts with the Prime Minister's remarks when he visited in February 2005. He said that Kettering was a world-class hospital, but since his visit we have seen not only ward closures, further underfunding, the country's worst record for hospital-acquired infections and some of the highest mortality rates in the country but also staffing levels driven to what one member of staff who I spoke to in preparation for this debate described as crisis levels. Those are the problems that the hospital has faced, and I commend all the staff for the way in which they have tried to address challenges that have been made worse by some of the decisions made in Whitehall.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/9">I have spoken with consultants at the hospital, and they are confident that measures are now in place to ensure that the hospital's record of hospital-acquired infections improves. The Department has granted a further &pound;300,000 to help in the fight against clostridium difficile infections. One medical ward is to be fully refurbished, a decontamination room for cleaning hospital equipment is to be set up, hand-washing facilities are to be upgraded and large, high-impact floor signs will be installed to remind all staff, patients and visitors of the need to wash their hands. I hope that the clostridium difficile infection rates at the hospital will improve as those measures work themselves through. Nevertheless, for every one of my constituents who goes into hospital to be treated, only to find themselves staying there longer because they have acquired an extra infection while in hospital, there is a tragic and unacceptable tale.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/10">In preparation for this debate, I was careful to engage with as many representatives of the local health service as I could. I spoke to senior managers at the trust, local GPs, members of the local patient and public involvement forum, consultants and staff. There is very much a shared sense of Kettering general hospital being a valued community facility in which everyone is doing their best against a difficult background. I know that the Health Minister must receive many representations from Members of Parliament across the country for extra resources for their hospital, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough will demonstrate in a moment, Kettering general hospital faces an almost unique background of consistent and persistent central Government underfunding going back some time. Although attempts have been made to address that, the cumulative underfunding over many years will not be caught up with overnight.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/11">The crisis is made worse by the increase in the local population, and I urge the Minister to ensure that the population statistics that his officials give him match the reality on the ground. If he were to accept the trust's invitation to come and see the hospital for himself, he would see the pressure that accident and emergency is under, especially at weekends, and the pressure that other wards are under as they do their best to treat local patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/12">I will give way now to my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough, but I would like to impress on the Minister the fact that local people are proud of Kettering general hospital. Everyone wants it to succeed. I hope that the Government recognise the challenges that it faces, and that the Department will do its best to ensure that whoever the Member for Kettering is in another 110 years' time, they will be able to look back at this debate and say, &quot;Yes, the Government understood the problems that local people faced in respect of their hospital and responded to the challenges.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-16a.312.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" speakername="Andy Burnham" colnum="312"  time="016:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070516/halltext/70516h0010.htm#07051672000592">
	<p pid="a.312.1/1">We will look at those issues during the next funding round. In particular, we will look at the pace of change policy in order to see how quickly we can move PCTs from below target to target funding. However, I suggest that the hon. Gentleman directs his questions to the shadow Health Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase>. Like mine, his PCT is under its target allocation and has benefited from the changes that the Government made in order better to pick out deprivation when health funding is being allocated. I ask the hon. Gentleman to direct his questions to his Front-Bench colleagues, because their proposals for changing the funding formula, as I understand them, would leave the constituencies of both Opposition Members present worse off. Perhaps they need to pursue that with their Front-Bench colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/2">On foundation trust status, I welcome the support indicated for the trust's bid. In my view, it is absolutely the right way for the trust to go in order to build on the sense of improvement that, it would seem from my discussions with the trust's management, has got going. I think that, elsewhere, foundation trust status has galvanised momentum and maintained local pride and focus. That is the right way forward, and I hope very much that the support of hon. Members today will be replicated throughout the community and that the trust can make that important step forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/3">The hon. Member for Kettering mentioned infection control. It is true that the trust has recognised that it has a particular problem with levels of clostridium difficile. In July last year, it recognised that action was needed to improve matters significantly, and action has been taken&mdash;in the first quarter of this year, a significant reduction was made in C. difficile rates compared with the first quarter of 2006. From memory&mdash;I do not have the figure to hand&mdash;that represents about a 36 per cent. decrease. However, he is right to say that there can be no complacency on that important issue. I was grateful that he acknowledged the money that has been made available by the Department to improve infection control&mdash;the &pound;300,000 to which he rightly referred. In my view, that will help the trust further to improve its infection control.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/4">In conclusion, I shall pick up a couple of further issues. The hon. Member for Kettering made a general point about the need for health services in the Northamptonshire area to keep pace with anticipated population growth. I think that both Opposition Members present made that point, and it was a point very well made. The hon. Member for Kettering will know that in the last PCT allocation round an adjustment was made to the funding formula to recognise the latest figures on projected population growth, and I assure both hon. Members that the same thing will happen this time. There is no debate about it: a significant increase in population is expected in their area, and it is vitally important that the health service keeps track of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/5">I would like to point out to the hon. Member for Wellingborough that there were some 528 beds in his trust in 2003-04 and that today the number is 598. So there is evidence that the capacity of the service is increasing, and I believe that the trust is looking at increasing further the level of services provided in the surrounding towns. I hope that that is of some comfort to him.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/6">The hon. Member for Kettering said that everyone is doing their best against a difficult background, but I do not accept that. I think that the background is positive. A lot of investment has gone into the trust, which is responding well and improving services, as patients are telling us. However, we are not complacent. I shall work with him to improve matters further and accept his kind invitation to visit the trust and see the improvements for myself.</p>

	<p pid="a.318.2/1">I repeat that I stand corrected on the precise figures, and I am sure that the Minister is going to address the point that I made in my intervention on my hon. Friend. It is not scaremongering to suggest that the time frame in which people can take advantage of the scheme is too short, and that there are serious concerns about the training of professionals to deliver the scheme that the Government have put in place. Those are legitimate concerns to raise, and they have been expressed by many people in Wales, Scotland and elsewhere.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-16a.321.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1800" speakername="Shaun Woodward" colnum="321"  time="017:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070516/halltext/70516h0011.htm#07051672000605">
	<p pid="a.321.3/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point about lessons to be learned. I congratulate Digital UK on its work in his constituency. That work would not have been done without the partnerships that we envisaged would have to take place, not only in his constituency, which is leading with switchover, but in all constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.3/2">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend whose role in bringing together the voluntary sector, particularly that of Age Concern, has been exemplary for all of us. He has worked extremely hard with the local authority and with local charities, but particularly Age Concern because it represents and has knowledge of a particular sector that will be affected. If hon. Members work with their local organisations, such as Age Concern, they can have a huge impact on ensuring that the switchover happens smoothly and effectively. The lesson that we shall draw, particularly from Whitehaven, is to look at the way in which my hon. Friend has worked there to lead his constituents and ensure that they will all benefit from being the first to roll out switchover later his year.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.3/3">The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland asked about the assistance that will be made available to those who must purchase Freesat to receive digital. The help scheme will provide vulnerable households that qualify and are outside the DTT coverage area with the option of satellite at no additional charge. He asked whether I could guarantee that those households relying on satellite will receive the same level of service as other households. Digital UK will ensure that all households can enjoy the same level of service.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.3/4">The hon. Gentleman asked a specific question about relays carrying fewer channels than the main transmitters. The short answer is no. Switchover will bring around 18 channels, including Channel 5, to those areas that have only four analogue services at present, so they will not carry fewer channels than the main transmitters.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.3/5">When switchover takes place in Orkney and Shetland in the first half of 2010, the power of the digital terrestrial signals will be significantly increased, and all the relays will broadcast digital signals so that all households that can receive analogue at present should receive reliable digital terrestrial reception.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.3/6">The final issue that the hon. Gentleman raised was about extending digital radio to Orkney and Shetland. That is a matter for the BBC, but I understand his point in a personal capacity, and I am sure that eventually we will, as it says on the Mars bar, be able to entirely satisfy him.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.3/7">I hope that I have dealt with the issues that the hon. Gentleman raised, but if other hon. Members have issues to raise, I shall be more than happy to correspond with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.3/8" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.3/9" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at twenty-three minutes to Six o'clock.</p>
