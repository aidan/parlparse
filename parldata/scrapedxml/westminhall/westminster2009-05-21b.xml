<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-21b.479.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1993" speakername="Malcolm Bruce" colnum="479"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090521/halltext/90521h0001.htm#09052150000164">
	<p pid="b.479.1/1">I can honestly say that there was no spite, because I had a private conversation with Josette Sheeran afterwards. She would want me to make it clear that she had a good personal relationship with the Secretary of State and that there was no quarrel. The money that she was getting was fine and delivered its intended purposes. There was no complaint about the relationship, but she felt that our Government was resisting its development. She would like to tease out the Secretary of State's position, and I am sympathetic to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.479.1/2">Rather than being in any way challenging and critical&mdash;I do not want to be&mdash;I am saying that I completely understand the Government's position and why they are taking it. Perhaps until last year I would have said, &quot;That's it. The Government simply say, 'We view the WFP as the lead humanitarian food relief agency. It is excellent. Whenever that is needed we will fund it generously.'&quot; Neither I nor the WFP quarrel with that. However, if we are looking at whether we want to prevent famine&mdash;and we do&mdash; the Committee is suggesting that the WFP should have the capacity to make a contribution to that. We should at least reassess whether that would be a legitimate vehicle for British funding&mdash;that is all I am asking the Government to reconsider.</p>
	<p pid="b.479.1/3">I do not want there to be any suggestion of spite, conflict or difference of opinion. My impression is that there is high regard for the British Government in the WFP, and vice versa. In respect of the development of the relationship, there is not tension but simply difference. Other countries are responding in ways that the WFP finds helpful. Personally, and from the Committee's point of view, it would be good if the British Government considered that view.</p>
	<p pid="b.479.1/4">I do not want to detain hon. Members unduly. I hope that I have given some of the flavour of the report, the context in which we produced it and the changing circumstances over the last 12 months. We must not allow food security to lose its high priority on the agenda, and I shall refer to some points that have been made recently.</p>
	<p pid="b.479.1/5">An article in the <i>Financial Times</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-07">7 April 2009</phrase> reported that 1 billion people were chronically hungry and referred to the increased requirement of $6 billion instead of $5 billion. Peter Brabeck, chairman of Nestl&eacute;, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.479.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Don't forget that the food prices are today about 60 per cent. higher than they were only 18 months ago. And this means that those people who spend 60, 70 per cent. of their disposable income on food have been hurt very, very strongly&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.479.1/7">Josette Sheeran has said that the food crisis is not over. The WFP worries that because we do no have food riots and there is no focus on high spikes, attention may be moving away.</p>
	<p pid="b.479.1/8">I commend the Department for International Development for not chasing headlines or fashion. It tries genuinely to provide one of the most important and sustained mechanisms for delivering poverty reduction. I respect the ministerial response that the Government were not ready to change policy because they believed that they had got it right. I am asking them only to think about this, which is reasonable.</p>
	<p pid="b.479.1/9">The Committee takes the view that the WFP is one of the best UN organisations. It operates in extraordinarily difficult conditions and does a fantastic job, bearing in mind that delivering food is not just about getting it there. The WFP must often build roads and secure access in dangerous places, and must do so often under fire with resulting casualties. That has positive consequences. Roads were opened up in southern Sudan for the delivery of food, and they became trading links and networks for economic development that was unrelated to the WFP, but facilitated only because the WFP built the road.</p>
	<p pid="b.479.1/10">The WFP is one of the best organisations, but our conclusion is that it has the capacity to do a lot more to prevent famine. National and international communities must give serious thought not just to how we respond to emergencies&mdash;the Government do so admirably&mdash;but to how we can prevent those emergencies, and the role that the WFP could take in that. That is the key issue on which the Committee would like the Government to focus.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-21b.482.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" speakername="John Barrett" colnum="482"  time="014:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090521/halltext/90521h0002.htm#09052150000167">
	<p pid="b.482.1/1">When my right hon. Friend was making his opening speech, I was scoring out paragraphs in mine because he was pre-empting them, and he has just done that again, but I will read it anyway.</p>
	<p pid="b.482.1/2">Many of the poorest people in the world are no longer reliant on good or bad crop yields, but they are now dependent on the market to access food. If someone in this country does not have access to food, we do not give them food aid, or seeds and tools to plant food. They receive money under the benefits system, so that they can go out and buy food. I am sure that there would be riots in the street if we were to suggest handing out food parcels rather than benefits. If that is not right here, surely there are plenty of other countries where we should consider alternatives. I shall return to the system of vouchers and cash.</p>
	<p pid="b.482.1/3">I would be grateful to hear whether any consideration was given during the last round of the Doha talks to nutrition and the ability of countries to feed their citizens. Nutrition was mentioned in the opening speech today, and it is a key aspect of the issue. It is about not just the quantity of food available, but the quality. As we have heard, food insecurity is particularly hard to tackle in a complex, ongoing crisis and in the fragile transition to stability. During a crisis, fragile states may lack the capacity or institutional frameworks to implement long-term food insecurity solutions. That situation is made more serious by poor governance, conflicts, man-made disasters and HIV/AIDS and other diseases.</p>
	<p pid="b.482.1/4">Against that backdrop, it is right that the focus is shifting towards cash, rather than the giving of in-kind food donations. I am pleased to see the increased emphasis given to social transfer schemes of cash or vouchers, which my right hon. Friend has mentioned, through the World Food Programme, and the Select Committee was right to highlight their importance. I strongly support the recommendation that the USA should immediately review its practice of giving the vast majority of its support in the form of in-kind donations of US surpluses, shipped by US companies. I remember many years ago visiting the United States Agency for International Development headquarters, where I saw a sign stating that more than 50 per cent. of aid given by USAID was spent on American companies. It boosted the American economy, rather than helping the individuals and countries that one would have thought it was going to.</p>
	<p pid="b.482.1/5">I want to take a few minutes not only to consider what we can do to help to solve the problem, but to raise a few questions with the Minister about what we are doing to make it worse. Many developed countries naturally support their own farming industries and interests, but too often that is at the expense of others. Dumping surpluses or subsidising products can undermine local production in developing countries and their markets, and those markets will need to develop and thrive if developing countries are ever to inch away from their current level of food insecurity. What can the Minister say about the overdue reform of the common agricultural policy&mdash;I believe that that is central&mdash;and other negotiations that would allow a level playing field for more people and give them the ability to reap the reward of growing their own food, rather than receiving alternative cash products?</p>
	<p pid="b.482.1/6">Aid should not be determined by any factors other than need and effectiveness. It is one of the best legacies of the current Government that the International Development Act 2002 explicitly states the principle that the giving of aid must be guided by humanitarian principles and not take into account the interests of the UK overseas. I am interested to hear whether the Minister has had any discussions with his counterpart in the new Obama Administration regarding any shift in US policy. I welcomed the recent commitment to a $60 million pilot project for local purchase of food. It would be good to think that that is part of a genuine reappraisal of the approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.482.1/7">As I have said, DFID has done much good work and is respected in many parts of the world. I am happy to place my views in that regard on the record. I welcome the &pound;400 million support package for agricultural research, and I am interested in any progress report that the Minister can give on where that money is being spent and the impact that it is having. However, food security is clearly about more than supporting agriculture and matching supply with demand. It must be about building countries' and communities' resilience to the shocks that are increasingly restricting access to food for millions of people.</p>
	<p pid="b.482.1/8">Growing water scarcity, triggered partly by climate change, is also severely affecting countries' ability to irrigate crops. Global demand for water has tripled in the past 50 years. We cannot consider food supply and security in any region without examining the broader effects of global warming. I would be interested to hear what DFID is doing to ensure that there is joined-up thinking between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence and DFID to ensure that food security is not just considered as a development issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.482.1/9">Save the Children, in its evidence for the original report, rightly cited</p>
	<p pid="b.482.1/10" class="indent">&quot;a myriad of international actors with overlapping remits but none with the key purpose of ensuring the efficacy of international donors, development organisations and governments in reducing malnutrition.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.482.1/11">I share those concerns, particularly given that there still appears to be a lack of a specific nutrition policy or genuine measurable targets for assessing progress in reducing malnutrition. I understand that there is now a nutrition policy team in DFID, and I would appreciate any update from the Minister on the work that it is undertaking.</p>
	<p pid="b.482.1/12">A few years ago, I survived for a week on a Red Cross food parcel; it was just after Christmas and into the new year period. The food kept body and soul together, but there was no nutrition there, and that was for only a week. I would not wish the experience of trying to survive on it for more than a week on anyone else. Unfortunately, however, as we have heard, 1 billion people in the world have to survive on similar rations or less. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say, because the current Government have done and are doing good work, but we can always press for more.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-21b.484.0" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-21c.484.0" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-21b.484.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" colnum="484"  time="015:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090521/halltext/90521h0002.htm#09052150000168">
	<p pid="b.484.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Key. I congratulate the Chairman of the Select Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1993" name="Malcolm Bruce">the right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce)</phrase>, not only on his speech and assessment of the current situation, but on this very comprehensive report. His Committee was very prescient in taking up the issue before the crisis erupted last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/2">Perhaps the best way of opening my speech is to read out in full paragraph 7 of the report, which summarises what was happening in the world last year:</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/3" class="indent">&quot;It is in developing countries that people's lives are being endangered by the crisis. A 'perfect storm' of factors has conspired to send wheat prices spiralling by 122 per cent. and rice by 250 per cent. since 2000. The crisis has contributed to the threat of famine in countries such as Ethiopia, where the increasing cost of food imports has combined with drought, crop failure and conflict to double the number of people needing emergency assistance to 4.6 million. Four African countries&mdash;Lesotho, Somalia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe&mdash;are classified by the FAO&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/4">the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/5" class="indent">&quot;as having 'exceptional shortfalls' in food production and supplies. There have been food riots in countries as diverse as Egypt, Malaysia and Yemen. In Haiti, where up to 75 per cent. of food is imported, riots during April 2008 forced the resignation of the Prime Minister.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/6">Sadly, that was the context that followed the Select Committee's initial inquiry into this matter, but it is not an entirely new problem. I had a leading Indian human rights lawyer in my office this week, who gave me the shocking statistic that 300 million people in India eat 100 kg less a year now than they did at the time of independence in 1947. The problem has been becoming steadily worse, and DFID needs to be addressing it.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/7">A fortnight ago, we were debating millennium development goal 6, relating to HIV/AIDS, and today we are debating MDG 1, which is probably the most important of all the MDGs, because if people do not have adequate food and water, they become, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> has made clear, vulnerable to every other disease and pressure on their lives. I need hardly remind hon. Members participating in the debate about MDG 1, but to put my speech in context, I shall put the details of it on the record. The goal is to halve between 1990 and 2015 the proportion of people whose income is less than $1 a day; to achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all, including women and young people; and to halve between 1990 and 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/8">As both previous speakers have said, it was commonly assumed that 850 million people were living in hunger; it is now assumed that the figure is more than 1 billion&mdash;one sixth of the world's population. That is a very serious statistic. A child dies from malnutrition every five seconds, and 30 per cent. of all children who die, die from malnutrition-related problems. Those are shocking statistics. We all have tremendous sympathy for people in these situations and want to see what we can do about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/9">Much has been said about the WFP today. I did not wish, in my intervention on the Chairman of the Select Committee, to cast any aspersions on the WFP. I just want to understand why the director of the WFP did not praise Britain in relation to contributions to the WFP, because it seems to me from everything that I have read that we generously support the WFP. Indeed, the agency is held in the highest regard worldwide and its staff deserve due credit for the vital work that they perform. The fact that eradicating hunger features as the first MDG should focus everyone's mind on how serious the matter is.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/10">As I have stated, we discussed HIV/AIDS in this Chamber two weeks ago. Although it is right that that and the issue before us are debated separately, we must remember that the challenges that we face are not distinct, but interlinked and part of the web of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/11">The Committee's report noted that 850 million people regularly do not eat enough food&mdash;a point graphically made by the Liberal spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase>. The hon. Gentleman quoted Robert Zoellick, who said that MDG 1 is the forgotten MDG. As the Committee reported, Robert Zoellick went on to say that the world food crisis&mdash;this is perhaps the most shocking thing in the entire report&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/12" class="indent">&quot;could push 100 million people into poverty, reversing the gains made in poverty reduction over the last seven years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/13">In other words, a lot of what the international community has achieved will be reversed. That is why we need the Minister to address the problem seriously.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/14">If current trends continue, we will miss the target of halving the proportion of underweight children by 30 million children, and that will be largely because of the slow progress in southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. As I have said, a child dies from hunger-related causes every five seconds. When the Minister sums up, I hope that he will tell us how the work of the WFP and DFID in tackling hunger and malnutrition ties into the picture of underdevelopment as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/15">As the Chairman has said, unpredictable and volatile world food prices were exacerbated by fluctuations in the oil markets, by increased weather hazards and by an overall growth in demand. Backed by the global recession, that created a perfect storm, as the Committee has said, and incomes fell. All those factors came together to make the situation worse. As I said in the debate on HIV/AIDS, the adverse exchange rate also reduced British aid. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West quoted the chairman of Nestl&eacute;, who said that food prices rose by 60 per cent. last year. Again, that exacerbated the problem. Prices might have dropped back a bit this year, but they are still above trend.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/16">The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, no less, highlighted the simple consequences of such events to the Committee:</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/17" class="indent">&quot;When people are that poor and inflation erodes their meagre earnings, they generally do one of two things: they buy less food, or they buy cheaper, less nutritious food. The result is the same&mdash;more hunger and less chance of a healthy future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/18">In response to such concerns, the Committee made the following recommendation:</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/19" class="indent">&quot;the safest plan of action is to prepare for relatively higher prices over the next decade, and we encourage the WFP and DFID to make the necessary adjustments to their policies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/20">When the Minister sums up, I would be interested to hear the Department's view of what the trends in food prices and availability are likely to be over the next few years and what plans it has to adjust budgets, if it feels that we are likely to remain above trend.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/21">The WFP has responded to the increased challenges of global hunger by broadening its activities, moving away from simply providing food aid, which Save the Children has described as a blunt instrument, towards providing food assistance through cash and food transfer systems. As a farmer&mdash;I have declared that in the Register of Members' Interests&mdash;I think that the best long-term solution is to provide development assistance to encourage more farmers in individual countries to grow more of their own food, and DFID needs to pay close attention to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/22">As has been said, we must recognise the USA as an important partner in tackling these problems. As the Chairman has said, however, the fact that the USA, which is the largest donor to the WFP, gives nearly all its donations in kind&mdash;as food&mdash;is of concern. It is far better from every point of view&mdash;whether we want to increase local capacity, get farmers to produce food themselves or deal with the environmental effects of CO2 emissions&mdash;that we do not transport vast quantities of food around the world any more than necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/23">At just the time when assistance is needed most, it is of great concern that the USA, as one of the key global players, has adopted such a policy. The Minister will no doubt recognise the concerns that that has raised, and I hope that he will enlighten us as to the dialogue that he has had with his counterparts in the USA about whether assistance should be provided in cash or in kind. I hope that he will tell us what more can be done through the WFP and direct donations by USAID and DFID to shift the emphasis on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/24">I turn now to the work of the WFP. I share the Committee's surprise that</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/25" class="indent">&quot;DFID was not more supportive of the wider development activities undertaken by the WFP&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/26">Those comments go in a similar direction to those made by the WFP's chairman, when she explained why she had not praised Britain more. There is something of an underlying agenda here, and it would be helpful if the Minister were to give us a clue as to what this is all about.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/27">Clearly, the decisions taken by DFID have not been arbitrary, because the Department has stated that it has concerns over the appropriateness and effectiveness of WFP interventions. I hope that the Minister will be able to enlighten us. I will not criticise the Department's decisions in that respect, because I want the Minister to explain in more detail exactly what DFID's concerns are and what comparative advantage DFID has over the WFP in delivering health and education packages.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/28">I now turn to two of the key issues that could feature in more long-term development&mdash;nutrition and agriculture. The report notes that donors have ignored nutrition for too long, adding that</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/29" class="indent">&quot;Only $250 million is spent on nutrition aid globally, compared with the $3 billion spent on HIV/AIDS&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/30">in fact, it is more than $3 billion, because DFID spends &pound;1 billion as part of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/31">The report continues:</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/32" class="indent">&quot;Whilst HIV/AIDS led to 380,000 child deaths in 2006, malnutrition is&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/33">perhaps&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/34" class="indent">&quot;responsible for 1.5-2.5 million children dying annually.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/35">In a way, it is in invidious to compare one budget with another, but DFID's budget should surely be focused on an issue which affects so many people and which causes so many children to die each year. It is therefore welcome to read in the Government response about the establishment of a nutrition task team as part of DFID's policy and research division, and today seems like an excellent opportunity to give us an update on the team's work.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/36">The Government response states that more than 50 per cent. of DFID's development assistance is spent on</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/37" class="indent">&quot;tackling the underlying causes of...malnutrition by investing in essential public services such as health, water and sanitation, education and social protection.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/38">That is a welcome indication of the Government's recognition of the cross links that exist with other aspects of international development.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/39">On the reference to water and sanitation, however, I note that we debated the Committee's report on water and sanitation in this Chamber on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-29">29 April 2008</phrase>. DFID has admitted that it took its eye off the ball on that issue. Let us not underestimate the importance of water to today's discussion. As the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West has said, world water consumption had tripled over the past 10 years. A shortage of clean water is almost more important than a shortage of food, because so many people are dying as a result of contaminated water. The Committee's report on water and sanitation notes:</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/40" class="indent">&quot;water availability decreased substantially between 1975 and 1995&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/41">and that trend is likely to continue as a result of increasing drought, desertification and extreme weather events. That is all part of the pattern of global climate change, which not only affects water supplies, but leads to food shortages.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/42">As a farmer, I think that our international development programme has neglected agriculture, and that has been recognised by the Committee and by many in the development community. However, I reiterate the Committee's view that this is not the time for blame, but for looking forward to see how we can redress those issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/43">That belief was reinforced last summer, when I took part in a project in Rwanda. I met a man who runs a charity called Send a Cow, and he is a real expert in agriculture. He suggested that 80 per cent. of the people in Rwanda gain their living and income from agriculture in one way or another and that one of the quickest ways to help those people, who are so dependent on agriculture, is a free agricultural advisory service. I went away and did a little work on that. I got an institution in my constituency&mdash;the Royal Agricultural College&mdash;to do a feasibility study. I sent that study to the Minister, who replied that Rwanda's agriculture is improving significantly. However, I believe that there are many poor countries where a free advisory service to farmers could boost agricultural production significantly.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/44">The report makes it clear that DFID spends only &pound;400 million on agricultural research. In a world where a lot of good research is going on&mdash;indeed, research has helped to give a huge boost to our agriculture and that of other civilised countries since this country was kept alive during the second world war&mdash;it is important to carry on such work. I ask the Minister to reflect, without preconceived ideas, on whether his Department is doing enough on agricultural research; I am not sure.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/45">The report touches on the issues of GM crops and biofuels&mdash;two other subjects that could be better informed by research. The use of GM crops remains a matter of great debate and there are clearly significant and sharp arguments on both sides of the subject, but the correct approach is to enable developing countries to take their own decisions on the use of such crops. I believe, as a farmer, that they can play a significant and useful role in boosting food output, particularly where there are difficult agricultural conditions, such as drought or severe pestilence. As to biofuels, in my conversation with the European Environment Commissioner there was no thought that, in relation to targets for inclusion, we should perhaps lower our aim. Again, the subject is fiercely controversial, but if the west's over-demand for the inclusion of biofuels in the general fuel mix is causing a reduction in food production that would otherwise help to feed poor countries, we need to think seriously about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/46">In conclusion, I want to consider the future and ask what the Minister sees as the route to achieving MDG 1, and the role of DFID and the WFP. The Select Committee has remarked on greater integration between the WFP, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Alongside that, it makes recommendations for the WFP to be the UN's leading agency on hunger. On both those suggestions, the Government have said that they will be supportive and offer their encouragement. I hope that the Minister will update us on how that encouragement has been taking shape.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/47">Let us not overlook the important statement in the report that the problem lies not in a</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/48" class="indent">&quot;global lack of food&mdash;there is enough food in the world to meet demand&mdash;but in a long-term lack of access to food for many people&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/49">We can produce enough food in the world, but it is not being universally distributed, and 1 billion or more people go hungry each night. If international development cannot solve that, then we have failed. I ask the Minister what progress we are making.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-21b.491.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" speakername="Ivan Lewis" colnum="491"  time="015:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090521/halltext/90521h0003.htm#09052150000175">
	<p pid="b.491.5/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman. Several hon. Members have raised the question of investment in research, and I shall deal specifically with that in some detail in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.5/2">We very much welcomed the Committee's inquiry last year. Its report was generous, giving credit to the WFP's work in providing a front-line response to hunger in some of the most challenging and difficult environments&mdash;for instance, in Burma, Sudan, Somalia and Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.5/3">The WFP recognises the leading role played by the United Kingdom in drawing attention to the growing crisis earlier in the year. It recognises the importance of nutrition in helping to achieve the millennium development goals. It acknowledges that food security is not only about giving more food aid to people in humanitarian situations, nor even about growing more food in developing countries, although these are both important elements. Social protection&mdash;the provision of cash or food for work programmes for the most vulnerable&mdash;is another hugely important part of the equation. Indeed, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West has raised that particular issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.5/4">The right hon. Gentleman made the point strongly that it is important to get the international policy agenda right. We have to make progress on Doha; we must press ahead in that process. We must also consider how to dismantle subsidies to farmers in rich countries, to ensure a level playing field for farmers in developing countries. We need to end the practice by some donors of dumping surplus agricultural produce on poor countries as food aid, because it undermines incentives to grow more food locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.5/5">The Select Committee report has had a significant influence on Government policy, but it is respected globally because it came at a time when some of the questions that it raised need to be considered from an independent perspective. Since the report was published, international action to address the food crisis has continued, although this has now become inextricably linked to efforts to mitigate the impact of the global economic crisis, particularly on developing countries. That is understandable.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.5/6">Most people are hungry because they are poor. As Members have said, hunger cannot be tackled without tackling the root causes of poverty. With strong UK support, the European Union has finalised its plans to provide an additional &euro;1 billion of new grants to developing countries to improve agriculture and food security.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.5/7">At the Madrid food security conference in January, which I attended on behalf of the UK, the international community signed up to our proposal for a global partnership on agriculture, food security and nutrition. Work is going ahead in Rome and in developing countries to firm up the details.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.5/8">At the highly successful G20 summit in London in February, led by the Prime Minister, $100 billion of additional lending by the multilateral development banks was pledged for developing countries. Increased access to trade finance was also promised, as was a UN proposal to develop a system to monitor global vulnerability and to enable donors better to target those groups most at risk, especially women, children and the elderly.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.5/9">The World Bank has committed itself to increase spending on agriculture by 50 per cent., and its global food crisis response fund is fully earmarked, and substantially spent, with $1.2 billion for food-stressed countries, and 27 million people being able to gain access to seed and fertiliser, or to expanded social protection programmes. It has recently been agreed to continue and expand that programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.5/10">The world has had a food crisis, a fuel crisis and an economic crisis. Throughout, the international community can be proud of the fact that it has responded quickly and effectively to the needs of the poorest. Britain has led that debate in every international forum, with all-party support from the House. The challenge is to ensure that the commitments signed by world leaders, particularly at the G20, are delivered and implemented. Communiqu&eacute;s are one thing, but the need to transfer the commitments and the necessary investment into making a difference for the poorest people in the world is pressing. That is why we have a continued role, after leading the G20 summit, in ensuring that those commitments are implemented and delivered.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.5/11">DFID is working with the Foreign Office and other Departments to ensure that we continue to hold the international community to account for the commitments that have been made to mitigate the impact of the current crisis. However, we should not forget that the fundamental importance of the long-term reform of international financial institutions and other global organisations is vital, if we are to learn from the global recession.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.5/12">Having responded to the Select Committee report and dealt with matters relating to the WFP, I shall now deal with some of the specific points raised during our debate. The right hon. Member for Gordon and the hon. Member for Cotswold spoke about nutrition, and I want to make it clear where we are in that process. We established a nutrition task team in June, and Ministers have asked it to recommend ways in which DFID can strengthen its focus on improving nutrition outcomes in the context of rising food prices. The team is currently looking at what DFID and other development partners are already doing, to see where the gaps are and what support can be given to building a common global agenda on nutrition. That is the sort of progress that has been made, and we will report further in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.5/13">The right hon. Gentleman also raised the US policy of providing food aid essentially in kind. President Obama has already indicated that he is keen to expand the amount of food aid purchased in-country or within the region. That is a significant move in American policy. It is also worth noting that at the G20 meeting plans were announced for a $1 billion package of assistance, including for humanitarian aid and research and technology; and again that came from the new Administration. These are very encouraging signs of a clear and distinct shift in policy and will help the entire international community do what it has wanted to do for some time with regard to food security.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.5/14">Right hon. and hon. Members have asked about research. I want to be very clear about the level of DFID's commitment on this issue. We will spend &pound;400 million on international agricultural research over the current five-year period. That includes &pound;20 million a year to the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, but that figure is likely to rise significantly once reforms of the CGIAR system are complete. We have been at the forefront of efforts to reform that organisation and have been instrumental in levering substantial new funding commitments from a range of donors.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.5/15">Reform will focus on increased accountability and oversight, streamlined financial arrangements and the targeting of resources more effectively and to a smaller number of strategic objectives. We are committed to spending nearly &pound;40 million over the next four years on our &quot;research into use&quot; programme to ensure that small farmers can access new science and technology as quickly as possible. Technology transfer is a key element of strengthening agricultural extension programmes, especially in relation to adaptation in the face of climate change. That will therefore be one of our priorities when spending our research resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.5/16">The hon. Member for Cotswold asked about assumptions about food prices and DFID policy. The assumption is that prices will remain above trend price. Our position remains that we must address poverty, encourage economic growth and support, as the solution, increased household incomes. That returns to the point that most people are hungry because they are poor and that hunger cannot be dealt with in isolation from a total poverty reduction strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.5/17">The hon. Gentleman also asked about biofuels. It is important to make it clear that the impact of biofuels on food prices is not yet properly understood. Much work is still going on in this area. For example, rice prices saw the greatest increase last year, but rice is not used for biofuel production. However, we need to do much more research, and we are currently engaged in research partnerships with the World Bank and others to try to get much more empirical evidence on the impact of biofuels on food prices.</p>
