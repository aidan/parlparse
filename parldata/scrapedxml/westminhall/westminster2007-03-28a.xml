<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-28a.425.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1742" speakername="Brian Binley" colnum="425"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/halltext/70328h0001.htm#07032875000494">
	<p pid="a.425.2/1">It is good to have your direction, guidance and help, Mr. Caton&mdash;I shall certainly need it. I am pleased that this debate was called for this morning because Britain's future competitiveness and the problems relating to ensuring that we are competitive over the next 40 years are vital to all of us. I want to take a positive approach, because I know that my children and grandchildren will be dependent on how successful we are in the task of remaining competitive over that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.2/2">In a way, this is a continuation of last night's Budget debate, in which I was fortunate enough to speak. I spoke on the importance of small business and on the harmful effects of the increase to 22 per cent. of corporation tax for small business, which was contained in this year's Budget. I also discussed the inability of small business to claw back that money through investment and an increased research and development allowance. Those measures will impact on the retained profit of small business, which in most instances&mdash;not all, but most&mdash;is used to finance growth in the first 10 years of the life of a small business. I feel that anything that inhibits such growth is not in Britain's interest. However, that debate is over and the Budget is settled for another year. We now need to move on to address Britain's long-term economic future, the possible impact on that of small business and how it can contribute to well-being.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.2/3">I have to declare an interest. As I said yesterday, I am a small business man. In fact, one only needs to look at me to know that that is not the truth; however, I have started two small businesses that have grown, and I am most thankful for that. As I mentioned last night, I started my first small business in 1989. It builds databases for business&mdash;mostly for the business-to-business publishing industry&mdash;and now employs140 people. That is a measure of what small business can do to contribute to the nation's well-being and to add to the coffers of the Treasury, which is vital. I was then foolish and tried to set up another business in 1993 with a mad South African&mdash;everybody has to come across a mad South African in their lives. It was a small publishing company, and by dint of hard work, sizeable risks and sleepless nights we managed to build that company up to the point where it employs more than 80 people. The contribution of those two small businesses is that they now employ more than220 people, which underlines again the import of the small business sector for providing future job growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.2/4">Although I wish that I were unique, the truth is that I am not. There are thousands and thousands of others like me who have made similar efforts. They did so, of course, first and foremost in their own interests&mdash;I do not deny that that is a major motivating factor. However, as part of that process they have created jobs and wealth for the nation and taxation for the Exchequer. In the UK, small and medium-sized enterprises now account for more than half of the employment&mdash;58.7 per cent.&mdash;of the working population. That is pretty much true for each region of the country. There are 4.3 million small businesses, and I recognise that that number has grown, but much of that growth is down to people incorporating as one-man businesses. I recognise the need to ensure that that loophole is closed because, frankly, it does not help anyone, but I am saddened that the Chancellor used such a large, all-encompassing hammer that impacted so much on many small businesses to close that loophole. I appealed to Ministers yesterday evening to review that position&mdash;not for this Budget because it has been passed, but perhaps for next year. There is a need to free small business and encourage small business creation, while closing the loophole that the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said was the main reason for the Chancellor increasing corporation tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.2/5">Some 97 per cent. of firms in this country employ fewer than 20 people. That is quite startling. Indeed, 95 per cent. of firms employ fewer than five people. Small businesses are a major part of the economic fabric of this country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-28a.426.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1742" speakername="Brian Binley" colnum="426"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/halltext/70328h0001.htm#07032875000496">
	<p pid="a.426.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend and neighbour in Northamptonshire for that question. I assure hon. Members that the question was not planted&mdash;although I wish that I had planted it because my colleague makes a very important point. The sustainable communities project in Northamptonshire will bring 300,000 additional people into the county and add 50 per cent. to our population, so the jobs that he refers to will be required. One of the reasons why I wanted to have a debate on small enterprise is that it is one of the sectors where those numbers of jobs could be created. I thank my hon. Friend for the point that he makes.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/2">The truth is that more than 500,000 people start up their own businesses every year. That is another remarkable fact that smacks people in the face when they see it in print&mdash;indeed, it did so to me, as I did not think that the number would be that high. Again, that underlines the import of business creation. Some12 million people work in small firms in this country. Such firms contribute more than 50 per cent. of UK turnover, which is around &pound;1,200 billion&mdash;wow! I see my own little contribution to VAT and so on, but it is only when one sees a figure of that size that one recognises the contribution that small business makes.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/3">The final but equally startling fact is that 64 per cent. of commercial innovations come from small firms. That is a massive contribution in total and one that I am proud to be part of. The importance of SMEs is further underlined by the forecast that in a 10-year cycle that began some five years ago, although UK plc will shed 1.5 million jobs, SMEs in the UK will add2 million jobs. I have said before that the sector is rather important to our well-being.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/4">We need to enhance the role of small business if we are to face the challenge of the future. It is worth recording what that challenge is. We know that emerging nations are emerging ever more quickly; it is a trend for globalisation that is impacting massively upon our ability to compete in the world at large. Indeed, the challenge will become increasingly important over the next 40 years. For instance, Office for National Statistics figures show that the United Kingdom's deficit in trading goods with China grew in 2005 to &pound;10 billion. That shows how the emerging nations are competing. The size of the global economy is set to increase by 40 per cent. by 2015, and India and China together will represent a quarter of the world's output.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/5">I know from running a business that long-term planning can be a pretty dodgy exercise; it is as much perception, guesswork and hope as it is defying science. However, we have to take the best figures that we can to understand the size of the challenge that faces us. It is expected that India and China alone will be responsible for 60 per cent. of global trade by 2050&mdash;to say nothing of Brazil, Mexico or the other emerging nations that are growing and challenging our trading position. To ensure that our businesses remain competitive, we need to assist them to create more jobs, as that will contribute to our well-being and make a better contribution to our trading competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/6">I have already spoken about job growth in the sector, and I have already mentioned innovation. The Government need to encourage an entrepreneurial rebirth in the sector. I believe that the Government recognise that. I have no wish to be churlish about it; statements have been made and there is a real desire to encourage and enhance the sector. I welcome that, and I am delighted that the Minister is a part of that process. I have heard her speak to entrepreneurs, and I know that they accepted her message and were encouraged by it. However, we are not doing so well at the moment. I have already said that the Budget is putting an increasing burden on small business. Indeed, I believe that it will restrict growth, as growth is financed from retained profits in that sector&mdash;certainly for the first 10 years of the life of a business.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/7">Government support for small business adds up to a staggering &pound;12 billion per annum. Tragically, however, it is not well directed. I am delighted that the Government accepted the National Audit Office report of 2005. It seems to me that the Government have no wish to hide from the fact that we need to do better; indeed, they said so when the report was published. However, the report was scathing. For instance, it said that there were 3,000 different schemes to enhance and help to create small business. Those schemes were falling over one another to get the audience to the marketplace, but they were not very successful. I welcome the Government's promise&mdash;it is work under way&mdash;to have a much smaller number. Whether 100 is the right number is irrelevant. We need the most effective number to do the job in hand. I do not hold the Government to such figures, but I do hold them to their promise to improve, so that we become much more effective in our support of small business.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/8">We all know that regional development agencies are variable in their success rate and in the work that they undertake. It is equally true to say that the Government recognise that. There is much common ground. That excites me and leads me believe that there is hope for the future. However, the overall tenor of the NAO report suggested that the organisation of our support for small business was ineffective, inefficient and wasteful. I am delighted that the Government have seen fit to do something about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/9">The NAO claimed that we need to address a number of factors. Small businesses need better regulation and better access to finance, not only when one-man businesses become employing businesses but, equally important, when owner-managed businesses become board-managed businesses. Indeed, at the time of that leap, businesses have a massive problem with equity. Finding capital to finance change between &pound;250,000 and &pound;3 million is massively difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/10">The NAO says that we need more effective business support and less Government bureaucracy, and I agree. We need clear communication and information from the Government. Of course, we need a favourable tax regime, and I shall say more about that later. Above all, we need a skilled work force. Those are the areas that the NAO said needed attention, and it is generally accepted that it is so.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/11">I turn to education and skills. The Leitch report said that one in six adults in the UK does not have the literacy skills expected of an 11-year-old. An Institute of Directors policy paper stated that only 14 per cent. of British employees have intermediate level vocational qualifications, compared with 46 per cent. in Germany. The British Chambers of Commerce says that the UK faces a skills crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/12">The Foster report said that 17 bodies have monitory or regulatory roles in further education, yet less than half the budget allocated by local skills councils goes to further education and 60 per cent. of it is spent on remedial training at level 1, leaving hardly any money to be spent on intermediate skills. We need to change that so badly it almost hurts. It certainly hurts our business success and our ability to compete.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/13">The Ofsted report of 2005 is, I am sure, well known to the Minister, so I shall not go into detail. However, it said that the lack of skilled teachers</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/14" class="indent">&quot;is exacerbated by short-term and uncertain funding arrangements&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/15">that hamper long-term planning. We are not well equipped to support business. We have a problem. We also have a social wage and regulatory burden that needs to be understood, and we need to do something about it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-28a.428.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1742" speakername="Brian Binley" colnum="428"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/halltext/70328h0001.htm#07032875000498">
	<p pid="a.428.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising a genuine&mdash;I know that we always use that word in response to interventions&mdash;and important point. I promise that I will speak later about what we might do collectively, as we are all in this together. Part of our task in this place is to ensure that people can create businesses not only to keep us going but to keep going all those services that live off the wealth-producing sector. I will revert to the subject later if the hon. Gentleman is content for me to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.1/2">We keep adding to the social wage, and although this is not the right debate in which to go into the areas of employment law, maternity rights and so forth, I want to mark that up as a factor of which we should be aware. The more we impose on small businesses by way of social wage element, the less easy it is for small businesses in particular to compete. That is not to say that we want to return to the 1890s, when workers' rights were largely not what they should be&mdash;we would all be fighting for better workers' rights in those circumstances. We need a balanced perspective, however, and we need to ensure that the social wage element burden on small business is in keeping with our ability to compete, by recognising global standards and taking them into account when framing regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.1/3">The burdens barometer of the British Chambers of Commerce shows that the cost of regulation and red tape for British business has increased by &pound;55.6 billion in the period from 1998 to 2006. More importantly, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants has observed that the cost of complying with red tape can be proportionately 30 times higher for SMEs than for larger firms. That is a massive figure, which we all need to take into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.1/4">Let me mention the national minimum wage, which is indeed a burden on business. Although I do not argue against it, I am against the rate of increase. An increase of 34.7 per cent. in the past five years has created problems&mdash;it is at least three times the rate of inflation. So I hope that the Government now feel that they have achieved their objective and can settle on increases that are related to inflation. That would be a great relief, particularly for small businesses. Those businesses want to employ people and to grow, but they dare not always take the risk, because of the responsibilities that are placed on them by employing people.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.1/5">What else can we do collectively to ensure that our business sector works well and meets the challenges of the future? There are some big issues, and I shall try briefly to address them. The country's national insurance system is badly in need of wholesale reform, and I believe that we should set about that reform&mdash;I was hoping that more would be done in the Budget. The present system costs businesses &pound;760 million per annum&mdash;a figure that rises to &pound;2 billion if all Government payroll demands are taken into account. Perversely, that has a considerably greater relative impact on small businesses than on plcs, and we need to consider that fact.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.1/6">Regulation should be reduced. There was a period when the European Union felt that its only role was to increase regulation on businesses throughout Europe&mdash;as though that had no impact on the continent's ability to compete in a globalised trading system. The cost of regulation to British business should also be reduced, because that too has dramatically increased. I recognise that the increase is not necessarily attributable to the present Government; much of it derives from Europe. However, we need to get a grip on it. I hate to say it, but if that means throwing some regulation back to Europe, let us have the courage to stand up and do that. Somebody needs to do it; somebody needs to stand up to the regulatory burden and say, &quot;We as Europeans can't accept it. Our future as Europeans is bound up with the size, rate and burden of inflation emanating from the EU.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.428.1/7">There is one area for which this country is responsible, however: gold-plating. The Foreign Policy Centre found, I believe, that 62.5 per cent. of the EU regulations that they reviewed had been gold-plated. Do we really need to add to the burden on business by imposing yet more regulation at our end? My belief is that we do not.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.1/8">To get rid of the burden of regulation, or at least to increase awareness of its dangers, we should create a network of enterprise champions throughout the civil service. That is not a new concept; champions exist in many different areas of Government. There should be enterprise champions who are committed to the mantra that regulation costs money and reduces our ability to compete in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.1/9">The Public Accounts Committee has observed that there are no official statistics on the national cost of regulation on small businesses, although it acknowledged, as do I, that the Government have recently embarked on a costing exercise in that respect. That is a move forward and I welcome it.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.1/10">I have already said that red tape has a heavier relative impact on small businesses, and I have referred to the need for better skills. I have a whole list of such skills. We need to ensure that skills packages derive from the shop floor and are not imposed downwards by the educational establishment. We need to reach out to businesses with skills and involve them in creating skills packages, and we need to take skills packages to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" name="Andrew Love">the workplace. The hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love)</phrase> is right that a sizeable number of small businesses are not being reached because they are expected to seek assistance at a higher level than often is known to them. There should be much more involvement in reaching out to them with training packages that are created by business, as well as by educationists.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.1/11">My own local learning and skills council has17 members, of whom only four are businessmen. I am not saying that that is the Government's fault; business has a responsibility to help to work in partnership with the Government at all levels to ensure that skills training is much more effective. However, I want to see a change from control by educationists to a situation in which there is much more business input, and I want that to work on the shop floor, in factory sites, in offices and on the ground in business generally. Will that be expensive? Yes, it might be more expensive than at present, but an awful lot of waste in supporting business has been observed. That could be directed to the training activities that I want to happen, and I hope that that gives one possible answer to the point raised by the hon. Member for Edmonton.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.1/12">I have already commented on how poorly equipped this country is in skills and vocational training, and we need better.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-28a.432.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" speakername="Andrew Smith" colnum="432"  time="010:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/halltext/70328h0002.htm#07032875000505">
	<p pid="a.432.1/1">I am sure that it will be the common currency of the debate to speak of the enormous contribution that small businesses and all who work in them make to our economy. That contribution comes in job generation, local services and innovation and creativity, and in how small businesses help to shape the fabric of our local communities, both physically and socially.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.1/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1742" name="Brian Binley">the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the very positive spirit in which he advanced his analysis. We have had a double benefit: we have listened to him speak from his personal experience and insight twice in the past 12 hours. I can prove that I was listening last night: the hon. Gentleman gave us three very wise precepts for small business success, and they stuck in my mind, although he did not repeat them this morning. He told us that, first, volume is not everything; it is what someone is making out of the volume that is important. Secondly, cash flow is king. Thirdly, what really matters is not investment in plant, but investment in people. The hon. Gentleman might like to turn those three small business precepts into a small booklet to advise people&mdash;it was good stuff.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.1/3">I take the debate as a welcome opportunity to praise the work of small businesses, especially in my own Oxford constituency, and the work put in by area and sectoral local business associations, the chamber of commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses. The hon. Gentleman was right when he said that small business needs to be exercising more purchase on the education and training system. It can do that only through business people giving up their time&mdash;time that they have to spare from the very demanding task of running their businesses&mdash;so we all owe them a debt of gratitude. The contribution that those people make benefits our communities, as well as the economy. Certainly, I find the comments and advice that they give to me locally invaluable.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.1/4">We had a good example recently in the excellent conference put on by the Oxfordshire branch of the FSB. That conference centred on very interesting research that it had commissioned and a resulting report&mdash;I have it with me&mdash;that I think is of broader interest and would certainly be well worth replicating in other areas. It sought to take the sort of evidence-based approach that is applied in the well known FSB &quot;Lifting the Barriers&quot; survey, but to do so on a local basis so as to analyse the impact of small businesses in the local community, thereby giving a picture that, by its nature, cannot be fully picked up in the national surveys.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.1/5">Entitled &quot;The Economic Ecology of Small Businesses in Oxfordshire&quot;, the report was based on a representative sample survey of the 25,000 small businesses in the county produced by the Oxfordshire Economic Observatory, based in the Oxford Institute for Sustainable Development at Oxford Brookes university. The study produced a wealth of information, but I shall mention just a few highlights this morning. It underlined what the hon. Member for Northampton, South was speaking about: the crucial importance of the small business sector. In Oxfordshire, it accounts for 57 per cent. of the county's private sector employment. Business growth has been relatively strong in recent years, as we might expect in a generally prosperous county in a generally prosperous region. The number of VAT registered businesses increased by 9.4 per cent. in the five years to 2006, compared with 6.1 per cent. in the south-east and 6 per cent. in England as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.1/6">With regard to size and type, 85 per cent. are micro-businesses, employing fewer than 10 staff; 21 per cent. have no employees at all; 65 per cent. are family owned; 35 per cent. are home-based; and 17 per cent. are female-led. Most small businesses were in services, with wholesale, retail, estate agency and other business activities accounting for about 45 per cent. of the total, but there was a very important, albeit minority, share of small manufacturing businesses as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.1/7">With regard to the overall challenges and obstacles to business, regulation or red tape and taxation issues predictably topped the list. They were regarded as a major problem by 33 per cent. and 26 per cent. of respondents respectively. On more local issues, 13 per cent. identified housing supply and 10 per cent. transport infrastructure as the major problems. Nearly one third said that they experienced skill shortages when recruiting new staff, thus reinforcing points that have already been raised, and 16 per cent. identified planning restrictions as a major problem as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.1/8">The recent survey showed significant optimism about business growth in the next few years, with 75 per cent. expecting to grow their business through a mix of existing activities, new products and services, and new markets. What the survey particularly brings out is what the report calls the small business economic eco-system&mdash;drawing an analogy with biology and the importance of micro-organisms in ecological systems. It analysed interaction with other local businesses, so it found, for example, that 50 per cent. of the businesses derive more than 50 per cent. of their annual turnover from local sales and that just over one third place half their expenditure with local suppliers. That is a vital reinforcement of the strength of the local economy. Most of the businesses made good use of local shops, local banking and local post offices, thereby helping to sustain those services for the wider community.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.1/9">The study also shows the wider value of small business interaction with the local community. That involves things that all too often are taken for granted&mdash;for example, the extent of work experience opportunities for young people that are provided by many small businesses and the involvement with schools, charities and sponsorship of various kinds.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.1/10">In this age of ever more commuting, with all the congestion and environmental costs that that imposes, it is particularly notable that small businesses also provide predominantly local employment, with 75 per cent. reporting that at least half their staff live within five miles of their business premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.1/11">The survey reveals growing environmental awareness and attention to waste recycling, as well as the importance of reducing water and energy consumption. At the same time, however, it reveals concerns about the lack of information on environmentally beneficial options, the lack of time to weigh options up and fears that they might not be cost-effective or necessarily enhance business prospects.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.1/12">There is a clear case for better promotion of environmental support and advice services locally. In Oxfordshire, we have the Oxford Brookes Environmental Information Exchange and the Oxfordshire Sustainable Business Partnership, but we also have national support and advice from bodies such as the Carbon Trust. At the conference that launched the report, the trust came in for particular praise from a local manufacturer that had used its advice service.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.1/13">I therefore ask my good friend the Minister to look closely with our colleagues in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs at what more can be done to ensure that small businesses can readily access information, advice, support and, where appropriate, incentives to enable them to play their part in reducing waste and emissions and in combating climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.1/14">I commend this path-breaking Oxfordshire report as a whole to the Government and urge that similar studies would deepen understanding of the contribution and needs of small businesses in other parts of the country. If we are to sustain the impressive growth record and employment generation that the stable economy and other Government policies have helped to bring about over the past decade, we need to make even more of the entrepreneurial flair, hard work, innovation and local commitment that we are fortunate to have from the small businesses in all our communities.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-28a.434.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" speakername="Philip Dunne" colnum="434"  time="010:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/halltext/70328h0002.htm#07032875000506">
	<p pid="a.434.0/1">I want to make a modest contribution to the debate. This is an important subject, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1742" name="Brian Binley">my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley)</phrase> on raising it. I follow him this morning, as I did yesterday evening in the Budget debate, and it is a great pleasure to do so, given his expertise on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/2">In the Budget debate yesterday, many of my remarks focused on the importance of business&mdash;particularly small business&mdash;to the economy. I highlighted some of the measures in the Budget that will make life more difficult for entrepreneurs at the smaller business end and I shall not take up the Chamber's time by repeating what I said then. Today, I shall focus on the two issues in respect of which we need to look most carefully at the Government's role.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/3">As my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South told us, the small business sector is the critical engine of growth for the economy, employing more than half the people in the country. In rural areas such as mine, small businesses essentially represent the whole economy; indeed, the largest employer in my constituency, which happens to be an international conglomerate, employs 400 people, but the vast majority of businesses employ fewer than 100, with most employing fewer than 25, and they are typically owner managed. Without the entrepreneurial flair of individuals who set up businesses in rural areas, there would be no employment, so the sector is vital for rural communities in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/4">Those who set up businesses are, by definition, entrepreneurs and risk takers. We have heard of my hon. Friend's personal experience, and I echo his point that many Opposition Members have gone through such experiences. I do not wish to blow my own trumpet or to get into a competition with my hon. Friend, but I also set up a business from scratch, and it ended up employing slightly more people than his did; indeed, by the time I exited it last year, we had more than 2,500 employees. My point is that most people who go into business recognise that they need to take risks to do so. To get their businesses off the ground, many people make significant personal sacrifices that affect their lifestyle, and there are many different reasons for doing that. However, such individuals are used to taking risks, and one of my concerns about the Government's approach to business policy is that they often seek to restrict individuals' ability to take risks. They seem obsessed with the idea not just that they know best, but that businesses cannot be left alone to get on with doing their job and need to be micro-managed in many different ways. I hope to be able to illustrate that in a couple of moments in the brief time that I have.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/5">We hear from all the surveys, and we have heard it again in this debate, that business men's two primary concerns about their relationship with the Government relate to tax and excessive regulation, and I shall focus mainly on those two issues. Many businesses, particularly under this Government, start paying tax before they start trading. I am thinking particularly of measures in the Chancellor's 2004 Budget to reform the stamp duty land tax regime for businesses that open new premises and take on long leases. Such businesses must now pay a substantial amount, which is calculated on the duration of the lease, rather than on the first-year element, as was the case previously. That acts as a genuine barrier to business inception.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/6">My business was in the retail sector, and the Chancellor's measure could affect any retailer, because retail premises were typically let on 15-year leases. For a business that is starting from scratch, which does not know whether it will succeed, to be faced with a bill not of a few hundred or a few thousand pounds but, as in one case with which I am familiar, of &pound;15,000 before it has opened its doors for trading and knows whether it will succeed, the Chancellor's measure is a significant barrier to business inception and entrepreneurial risk taking. Of course, that applies not only to retail premises but to all premises, which are typically let on relatively long leases. I accept that the relevant period is coming down, partly as a result of the Chancellor's measure, and that raises separate issues for business investors in property.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/7">Of course, business fulfils a useful function not only as an employer, but as a revenue raiser for the Government. The complaint that I frequently hear when I talk to business groups around the country is that entrepreneurs regard themselves as acting primarily in the Government's interests as their tax collector. The degree to which new regulations and new taxes impose an obligation on companies to spend much of their time collecting tax in one form or another seems to multiply from Budget to Budget. Clearly, pay-as-you-earn is a significant and efficient form of tax raising, and other obvious examples include national insurance, VAT, business rates and stamp duty land tax. However, there is a host of other measures, such as aggregates tax, which was increased in the most recent Budget, and the tax-collection duty that they impose is an administrative and revenue-raising burden on individual companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/8">As regards the most recent Budget, we are of course focused on the increase in corporation tax on small business. That increase sends small business a serious signal that the Government are not particularly interested in it, and I hope that the Minister will pick that up when she winds up. The attempt to characterise the changed capital allowance arrangements as in some way offsetting that increase is a bit of a joke for small business. It might apply to a small number of sectors whose level of investment in capital will allow them to benefit from the changes, but in most cases, small businesses will be disproportionately affected by the increase in tax compared with what they can offset through capital allowances.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/9">David Frost of the British Chambers of Commerce said:</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/10" class="indent">&quot;The rise in small companies corporation tax will have a particularly damaging effect&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/11">on small business,</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/12" class="indent">&quot;with 71 per cent. of those surveyed saying it would harm their business. As a Chancellor who champions enterprise and acknowledges the importance of small business to the UK economy, many of our members feel let down and are dismayed by the measures taken, which will hit their competitiveness and increase their tax burden.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/13">That is not exactly a ringing endorsement of the Chancellor's measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/14">The Chancellor said in his speech that the extra revenue from the increased small companies corporation tax rate would be recycled to</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/15" class="indent">&quot;legitimate small businesses investing for the future&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/16">What an extraordinary way to characterise small businesses&mdash;to imply that a large number are somehow functioning illegitimately.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/17">The Chancellor may have been referring to the measures taken by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs three weeks before the Budget, when HMRC decided to halt with a sledgehammer the sideways loss relief, an opportunity for investors to invest in high-risk businesses that allowed them, if the businesses failed, to offset losses incurred from those investments against their other income. It was a useful way for small companies with a significant equity gap in external investment to get it from wealthy individuals. That measure has been stopped. It was stopped in order to deal with abuse elsewhere, but the impact on many high-risk sectors will be keenly felt. I urge the Minister to enter into discussions with the Treasury and the Chancellor to modify that measure during the passage of the Finance Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-28a.440.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1631" speakername="Mark Prisk" colnum="440"  time="010:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/halltext/70328h0003.htm#07032875000513">
	<p pid="a.440.0/1">I, too, commend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1742" name="Brian Binley">my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley)</phrase>. As he often does, he spoke with passion and knowledge, giving us a comprehensive view of the issues to be addressed. He began by reminding us why small businesses matter. Economically speaking, they generate more than half our national income and employ 58 per cent. of the private work force, and so are crucial to the economy. As several hon. Members have said, they are often the key innovators&mdash;the ones who make crucial changes in technology and business development that help the economy move forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.0/2">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> rightly said, small firms also make a social contribution. I, too, have read the excellent report by the Federation of Small Businesses team from Oxfordshire. I met the people involved last Friday and had the opportunity to examine what they have said. The right hon. Gentleman rightly said that it is often the local, small enterprise that makes a quiet, positive social contribution to the local community, and does so without wishing to seek to publicity.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.0/3">We have heard about how this Government have failed small businesses, and about the rise in the number of regulations. The equivalent of 15 new regulations are being made every working day. They have a disproportionate impact on the smallest employers. The FSB has shown that the burden of complying with red tape costs each small firm seven hours a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.0/4">The tax system has become hideously complex under this Chancellor. Not only are businesses paying more than &pound;50 billion extra, but the charge is made in a punitive way. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" name="Philip Dunne">my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne)</phrase> rightly pointed out, charges such as stamp duty land tax on long leases impact before a business even starts to trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.0/5">While this Budget has welcome news for large companies, it has dismal news for many small businesses. Whatever Ministers may claim, the Chancellor is seeking an extra &pound;820 million by 2009 from small companies. While it is true that the annual investment allowance will provide some support, it will be of no use to millions of small firms. The point is highlighted by a British Chambers of Commerce survey, which showed that 71 per cent. of small firms believed that.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.0/6">I hope that the Minister will explain why only capital investment is regarded by the Treasury as legitimate. What about innovation? What about the investment in people that was mentioned by the right hon. Member for Oxford, East? Are those things not legitimate? What about shopkeepers, accountants and professional services? All of those small enterprises seek to innovate and change, but they will be completely excluded from any benefit under the allowance in question.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.0/7">The Government's attack on the self-employed is not limited to corporation tax. Their plans to limit managed service companies follows on from the clunking fist's crude attempts with the IR35 legislation. No one is against preventing unreasonable tax evasion, but the crude way in which this Government seek to attack the self-employed damages legitimate enterprises, especially in fields such as IT, health care and professional services.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.0/8">The Minister is meant to be the Minister for small business, so will she tell us what meetings she has held with the Chancellor in order to speak up for those businesses in this matter? Did she put their case? Did she ensure that their concerns were properly represented? We need to know the answers, as do they. As we have heard in this debate, small companies are affected by decisions made across Whitehall.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.0/9">Let us consider the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, whose shameful incompetence over the single farm payment has severely damaged thousands of small family farms. Did the Minister for small business challenge DEFRA over its incompetence? Did she meet, question or hold to account that Department?</p>
	<p pid="a.440.0/10">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport was responsible for a huge rise in bureaucracy when it introduced the Licensing Act 2003. Thousands of small pubs, clubs and bars have been severely affected, but did the Minister for small business meet her colleagues? Did she ask why they were introducing the measures? Did she seek reductions in the bureaucracy?</p>
	<p pid="a.440.0/11">Let us consider the Department of Trade and Industry itself. It is seeking to oversee the closure of more than 2,000 sub-post offices. Many of those businesses tell us that they would dearly love the opportunity to widen the services that they offer, to be able to compete in the market and to offer new services, but Royal Mail and the Minister's departmental colleagues are refusing to allow them to do so. Why is that the case? What has the Minister done to stand up for those enterprises? Has she put their case? She must tell us, and them, what she has done to deserve the title of Minister for small business.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.0/12">Time prevents me from mentioning a number of issues, but I should mention start-ups. Most start-ups occur not in commercial premises but in a home. Home-based businesses offer many advantages, as the right hon. Member for Oxford, East mentioned. Will the Minister tell us what she has done specifically to help home-based businesses? Just as importantly, will she tell us which issues the Government are considering in this field? Such businesses are great for female entrepreneurs, given the particular opportunity that exists to get the right work-life balance. I should be interested to hear the Minister's response.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.0/13">Another part of the Department's remit is business support, which has been mentioned. Sadly, although much money is spent, Ministers all too often have no idea whether their programmes have any effect. The CBI has stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.440.0/14" class="indent">&quot;There is much anecdotal evidence about which schemes work and which ones are less successful. However, there has been no systematic assessment of the business support network to look at what schemes exist and which ones are most effective and add most value.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.440.0/15"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1785" name="James Duddridge">My hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge)</phrase> mentioned an interim report that was published last month. The work was done by a small business taskforce led by the entrepreneur Doug Richard, who is an American citizen. It found that overall the Government are spending roughly &pound;12 billion on small business support, but that they cannot, or will not, say whether the money is working. Part of the problem is the fact that the system has got out of control. Roughly 3,000 schemes are being run by approximately 2,000 public bodies and their contractors. Just as concerning as that complex maze is the value that we are getting, because at best, a third of the money is disappearing in administration. In some cases, all of the money goes towards paying an individual, and there is no money left to be handed out.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.0/16">Equally, business confidence in state advisory services is low. The FSB has shown that just 4 per cent. of small businesses use Government-funded support, whereas more than half consult people such as accountants and those in the private sector. Given the amount of money spent it is remarkable&mdash;although sadly, less surprising&mdash;that the Government can have so little to show for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.0/17">As we have heard in this debate, small businesses matter, but sadly&mdash;I say this with no enthusiasm&mdash;all too often this Government have failed them. Ministers do not understand them, and are taxing and regulating them without recognising that those same enterprises generate the wealth that pays for the schools and hospitals on which the rest of us rely.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.0/18">Last week's Budget typifies what is wrong, because the Chancellor is increasing small company taxes and continuing to tie firms up in red tape, while DTI Ministers are silent on these issues. They have shown themselves to be either of no influence in the Government, or so fearful of the clunking fist at the Treasury that they are unwilling to stand up for small businesses. Conservative Members believe that it is time for a fairer deal for small firms. We want a simpler, fairer tax system, and we believe that it is time to reduce the regulatory burden, and that the Government have failed to provide either an effective or an efficient business support system.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.0/19">In her reply, the Minister must explain herself. She must show us and small businesses what she has done to defend their interests, and why she is supporting the Budget tax hike on more than 1 million small companies.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-28a.443.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" speakername="Margaret Hodge" speakeroffice="The Minister for Industry and the Regions"  colnum="443"  time="010:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/halltext/70328h0003.htm#07032875000514">
	<p pid="a.443.0/1">I join other hon. Members in congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1742" name="Brian Binley">the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley)</phrase> on securing this debate, and the way in which he made his contribution in the best tradition of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/2">I have only nine minutes, so I shall deal quickly with some of the issues that were raised. The most important contribution that any Government can make to ensure the well-being and prosperity of the small business sector is to manage the macro-economic environment responsibly and successfully, and that is what we have done. We have had 58 consecutive quarters of growth, and no stop-go, which we experienced under the previous Conservative Government. We have had low inflation and a huge increase of 2.6 million in employment. That good macro-environment has led to success in the small business sector. I could not disagree more with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1631" name="Mark Prisk">the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk)</phrase>, who does not represent the small business interest well in pretending that this is an environment in which it cannot prosper. I far preferred the contributions of some of his Back-Bench colleagues who celebrate the success of the small business sector in contributing to UK growth and prosperity.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/3">To take a few figures, we have 600,000 more small businesses than 10 years ago, which is a cause for celebration for the many people who work hard in those businesses. The number of people working in small businesses has reached close to 1 million, and that, too, should be celebrated. Of those working in the private sector, 59 per cent. are employed in small and medium-sized enterprises. That is a cause for celebration. The SME sector now contributes as much as the large-business sector to UK output: 50 per cent. of gross value added and 51 per cent. in turnover. Start-ups have exceeded closures for 11 years running, which is good, and survival rates are much higher today than a decade ago. Small firms' productivity growth has exceeded that of large firms over the past 10 years, and that is a cause for celebration. I agree with the hon. Member for Northampton, South that new businesses are the greatest single source of new jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/4">Unlike the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford, I celebrate and congratulate the small business sector, and work with it to build on that good record rather than decrying it. I recognise that SMEs are the vital engine of growth in the UK economy; I recognise that they drive innovation; I recognise that they help to drive productivity growth by providing a competitive spur; and I recognise that they are the greatest single source of jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/5">I very much welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the contribution of my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase>. I had the pleasure of meeting Sandy Lovatt at the Federation of Small Businesses annual conference and listened to his findings. Particularly important was the role that he recognises small businesses can make in their local community by contributing to employment growth and to economic growth through purchasing and selling within their local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1823" name="Lorely Burt">The hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt)</phrase> referred to the Carbon Trust. In an interesting survey in the report, &quot;The Economic Ecology of Small Businesses in Oxfordshire&quot;, one of the respondents said of the Carbon Trust that they regarded it as</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/7" class="indent">&quot;the best organised Government scheme.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/8">Special mention was made of its website and the respondent said that in the future he intends to take</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/9" class="indent">&quot;a second interest-free loan from the Carbon Trust to replace old and inefficient machinery.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/10">That demonstrates the importance of the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/11">Turning to the Budget, I want to hit the nail on the head. Let me be clear again&mdash;we were trying to be clear last night&mdash;about what the Budget is about. We hear the same tedious narrative from the Opposition, full of misinformation and mistakes, which is not worthy of a responsible Opposition&mdash;an Opposition who, when they were in government, caused the two worst recessions since the second world war, allowed inflation to run at 10 per cent., let interest rates go up to 15 per cent. and oversaw an economy in which unemployment hit 1.3 million, and 1.5 million people had their lives destroyed by negative equity. That is not how we will run our Budget. The most important imperative in the Budget was to maintain a strong macro-economic environment and continued stability so that we could have continued growth. We will not return to the stop-go of the years of Tory mismanagement, which is why the Chancellor deliberately crafted his proposals in a fiscally neutral way. Let us see what those proposals achieve for the SME community.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/12">There are 4.3 million SMEs, of which 3.4 million operate as sole traders. Those sole traders will not be affected by the changes in corporation tax for SMEs, but they will benefit from the 2p cut in income tax and will be better off. Two thirds of FSB members are self-employed businesses, and they will be better off. For small businesses, we have responded to exactly what the CBI and the FSB have told us and what we ourselves and I myself believe to be true: that Government support and fiscal policy should concentrate on supporting the growth of the SME sector. That is why, in a fiscally neutral way, we have transferred the resources to increase the tax credit for research and development to 175 per cent. for small businesses; that is why we introduced the annual investment allowance that will support that growth tax free; and that is why&mdash;the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford chose not to mention this&mdash;we introduced the specific initiative asked for by the FSB to reduce business rate relief on empty industrial property.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/13">My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said last night that an SME must increase its investment only by &pound;2,300 in 2009-10 to reduce its tax liability by &pound;500 under the new regime. That will offset the tax increase through investment. Ninety per cent. of tax-paying companies would pay less tax if they invested less than a quarter of their profits back into the business, which is what we want them to do.</p>

	<p pid="a.445.2/1">I want to deal with the Opposition's absurd report on regulation. First, the research comes from a Tory activist working from his flat&mdash;the same Tory hopeful who identified the &pound;21 billion cuts in public expenditure that the Leader of the Opposition is now denying he supports. Those cuts included, interestingly, the abolition of tax credit for films, which would have hit manufacturing hard. The hon. Gentleman asked me what I do for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. I certainly do not support doing away with that tax credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.445.2/2">That report demonstrates yet again the Opposition's complete inability to face in the same direction and display consistency for more than two minutes at a time. They criticise publicly funded support schemes by saying that on one hand we spend too much on admin, and on the other hand we should spend more on admin to ensure that we properly evaluate schemes. Those statements are wrong. First, we do not spend too much on administration&mdash;less than 10 per cent. through the regional development agencies&mdash;and we evaluate schemes because our entire policy is built on what works.</p>
	<p pid="a.445.2/3">Of course we want to rationalise. We were there a year ago, and we knew that we needed to reduce from 3,000 schemes, which is why the Department of Trade and Industry has reduced from 100 to 10&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-28a.449.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1378" speakername="Geoff Hoon" speakeroffice="The Minister for Europe"  colnum="449"  time="011:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/halltext/70328h0004.htm#07032875000519">
	<p pid="a.449.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1893" name="John Randall">the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)</phrase> on securing this debate and on his continuing expert interest in the western Balkans. We may not always agree on the detail, but I acknowledge his real expertise on the questions involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/2">The hon. Gentleman is right to remind us of the work that still needs to be done in the western Balkans, but it is also right to recall how much has been achieved in the region. Progress has been made since the wars of the 1990s. All the countries of the western Balkans are now somewhere on the path to eventual membership of the European Union and NATO; I visited Croatia on Monday and saw for myself the transformative effect of the EU accession process. I am confident that that will be repeated across the western Balkans.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/3">Like the hon. Gentleman, I want to focus on Kosovo today. I remember my first visit there in 1999, when I witnessed the destruction and misery on the faces of Kosovo's people&mdash;a shocking sight in modern Europe. However, Kosovo has come a long way since 1999, as I witnessed on my most recent visit last November. An elected Kosovo Government were gradually taking over responsibility for their own administration from the United Nations. I saw new buildings and new businesses in Pristina. Perhaps most importantly, people appeared more optimistic about their future.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/4">However, Kosovo's economic and political development continues to be inhibited by the uncertainty over its status. The current situation&mdash;an unresolved status while Kosovo is administered by the United Nations&mdash;is fundamentally unsustainable, failing to provide the clarity needed for sustained economic investment or to fulfil the aspirations of the vast majority of Kosovo's population. In recent months, we have seen the potential for instability: in Pristina on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-10">10 February</phrase>, two Kosovar Albanians tragically died when a demonstration organised by the self-determination movement turned violent.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/5">However, after almost eight years of UN administration, the way forward is in sight; on<phrase class="date" code="2007-03-26">26 March</phrase>, UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari submitted his final settlement proposals to the UN Security Council. The recommendations reflect more than a year of negotiations and detailed discussion with Belgrade and Pristina. They strike a balance between meeting the aspirations of the majority in Kosovo and providing far-reaching guarantees to protect the rights of the non-Albanian communities, especially the Kosovo-Serbs.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/6">We would all prefer a negotiated settlement that was mutually acceptable to the parties. However, it was clear from the special envoy's consultation process in Vienna in February and March that the gap between the two sides is, at least for the moment, unbridgeable. The choice is therefore between prolonging the current unsustainable situation or grasping a clear opportunity to move forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/7">Ahtisaari describes his proposals as representing independence for Kosovo, supervised by the international community. That is the outcome that Kosovo Albanians&mdash;90 per cent. of the population&mdash;want and expect, and it would give Kosovo the clarity that it needs to develop politically and economically. Furthermore, the proposals contain robust mechanisms to defend the rights, culture and heritage of Kosovo's Serbs and other non-Albanian communities. Protecting multi-ethnic society in Kosovo is a fundamental element of the plan. In particular, the settlement provides for minority participation in central Government and for far-reaching decentralisation, including through the creation of new Serb-majority municipalities. Furthermore, the plan would create protection zones around more than 40 key Serb cultural and religious sites in Kosovo.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/8">Kosovo will continue to require international supervision, assistance and support in the years to come. The UK will continue to play a role in supporting the implementation of the settlement. We look forward to contributing to both the NATO and European security and defence policy missions envisaged in the proposals. We shall also maintain an active diplomatic presence in Kosovo. Discussions on the proposals have now moved to New York. We are in touch with our Security Council partners and are underlining the need for the Security Council to act decisively to resolve the issue and secure the best possible future for all Kosovars.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/9">The hon. Gentleman asked about Russia in particular. We work very closely with the Russians in the contact group. They, too, have a clear interest in resolving Kosovo's status. Obviously, it is not for me as a UK Minister to go into detail on the Russian position, but I can say that, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, Balkan directors from the contact group countries, including Russia, are meeting in London today. I spoke to all of them this morning, and made it very clear that we now need to bring the process to a successful conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/10">The hon. Gentleman also referred in passing to the EU's position. There has been some discussion. As the hon. Gentleman made clear, there are sensitivities in some states. However, the discussion has consistently led to clear messages in support of the work of the special envoy and congratulations on his efforts. On<phrase class="date" code="2007-02-12">12 February</phrase>, the General Affairs and External Relations Council</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/11" class="indent">&quot;expressed its full support for the UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari and his efforts in conducting the political process to determine Kosovo's future status.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/12">I accept that we will need to ensure that, in the short term, a settlement in Kosovo does not heighten tensions in the region. Keeping Serbia firmly on the path to the European Union will be a priority. As the hon. Gentleman mentioned, I visited Belgrade on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-07">7 February</phrase>. It is very important that Belgrade and Serbia seize the opportunity available to them. It is crucial that when it is formed, the next Serbian Government quickly make sufficient progress on co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia so that the EU restarts stabilisation and association talks. It is also important that Kosovo and Macedonia demarcate their border in an orderly manner; I accept that that is a continuing issue. Having also visited Macedonia relatively recently, I think it important that we find a sensible solution to the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/13">Ahtisaari's proposals provide for a joint technical commission physically to demarcate the border and address other outstanding issues in the next year; there is a mechanism for dealing with the issue. For the sake of completeness, I should say that we remain actively engaged in Bosnia, although the security situation there is now stable, allowing us to withdraw our troops, who have done such an excellent job in the past15 years. However, there is still further work to be done in taking forward the necessary reforms, particularly to the police and armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/14">Kosovo is the last outstanding status issue subsequent to the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. Martti Ahtisaari's proposals offer the Balkans a chance to draw a line under the conflicts of the 1990s, take a decisive step to underpin multi-ethnic, democratic societies and move further down the path towards membership of the European Union. His proposals offer a better future for all in Kosovo, and the Government unequivocally support his recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="a.452.2/1">May I say what a pleasure it is to serve for the first time under your chairmanship, Mr. Caton? It is traditional in the House to offer thanks for the opportunity to introduce such a debate. In one sense I am thankful, but in another, I have an overwhelming sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. It seems to me that I, in concert with many others, have been making the case for a secure subsidy to British theatre for the whole of my adult life. Clearly, my arguments have proved remarkably unsuccessful, so let us hope that I will break that trend today.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/2">I want to begin by paying tribute to our Government, who became an oasis in the financial desert of subsidy for British theatre. They listened to the arguments that had been put to them and, in 2000-01, made a subsidy to the theatre of &pound;120 million. Equity&mdash;I am tempted to say the actors' union, but it does not like that phrase and prefers to be called an association&mdash;made its case for investment in subsidised theatre in an extremely helpful document called &quot;A Brighter Future&quot;, and it made several important points about the benefits that accrue from subsidy to our theatre. The public, the theatre sector and the economy all benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/3">Equity made the point that, from the Government subsidy of some &pound;120 million, the economy benefits by &pound;2.6 billion annually. As Equity says, the theatre sector as a whole benefits, because subsidised theatre increases interest and attracts greater audiences by virtue of the high-quality and in some instances rather difficult work that it can produce. That has a knock-on effect of enormous benefit to commercial theatre. I am grateful to Visit London for an extremely helpful briefing, which makes precisely that point. Visit London would prefer that we did not use the word &quot;subsidy&quot; but &quot;investment&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/4">The briefing from the Society of London Theatre and the Theatrical Management Association, which was furnished to me via Visit London, said that theatre is an enormous attraction for foreign visitors. The briefing gives figures that are exclusively for London, but I am sure that other hon. Members will be able to paint an equally rosy picture of the benefits that have been brought to all the United Kingdom's regions by virtue of what is, in effect, a small amount of money.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/5">Visit London made the point that</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/6" class="indent">&quot;theatre plays a major role in attracting foreign visitors to London&mdash;many of them would simply not have come&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/7">without the attraction of the theatre. It said that</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/8" class="indent">&quot;2006 was a record year for theatre in London. Ticket revenues rose&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/9">by almost 5 per cent.&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/10" class="indent">&quot;and broke the &pound;400m level for the first time, while attendances were at 12.4m. At the end of the year, advance ticket bookings of &pound;57m were double those at the end of 2005.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/11">Visit London went on to make an interesting point, by saying that the massive revenues generated for the Exchequer would pay for</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/12" class="indent">&quot;the equivalent of 130,669 nurses, 92,690 police officers, 53,760 doctors or 108,387 primary school teachers. Increased investment would see an increase in this return. Tourism is already our fifth biggest industry&mdash;in London it generates &pound;15bn of expenditure from visitors, or 10 per cent. of London's GDP.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/13">I hope that I have managed to show that a comparatively small amount of national money produces enormous financial benefits for the country. That has undoubtedly been my experience in other parts of the world. For example, in America, I once did a tour of various cities whose indigenous economy had totally disappeared. Great amounts of money had been invested in those cities to try to re-attract business and to bring visitors. The areas in those cities that had created an endemic economy were sited around centres of cultural excellence&mdash;theatres, concert halls or art galleries. Those are venues to which people are prepared to go regularly, and other smaller businesses therefore grow up around them: caf&eacute;s, restaurants, bookshops and art shops. They were the thriving centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/14">The argument is virtually irrefutable that culture&mdash;certainly theatre&mdash;has strong economic drivers. That has never been the reason for my commitment to subsidised theatre. I am grateful for the fact that the theatre produces economic benefits, but it seems that a society that values its theatre and regards it as something for which there should be consistent support by the nation state is one that acknowledges that the spiritual health of the nation&mdash;I am tempted to say&mdash;benefits from such subsidy. The theatre is not merely entertainment or a place for spectator sport. People should not go to the theatre if their lives are ideally spent as couch potatoes. The theatre makes infinitely greater demands than that on those who participate and those who visit. Only the subsidised theatre can begin to explore such demands if the overwhelming and crushing burden of having to make a profit at the end of every week is lifted from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/15">I am not arguing for any kind of feather-bedding for the theatre. My argument has always been that, when the country is doing well and if we genuinely value our theatre, it should have a proper share of the national cake. If the economy is not doing very well, the theatre, along with the other vital factors of a cultivated society, should consider cuts. The central crucial argument for me&mdash;it has still not been made, put away and accepted totally&mdash;is that theatre is as vital for our society in many ways as anything else that the state regards as a basic function that it should provide for its citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/16">It is entirely shocking and utterly disgraceful that the birthplace of the greatest dramatist that the world has ever and is ever likely to see&mdash;William Shakespeare&mdash;has still not accepted that argument. Shakespeare did not chose to express his genius by writing a book or a pamphlet, or by putting notices on the wall. He chose the very medium that can most directly and fundamentally express the exchange between what happens in the lit and passes through to the dark.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/17">It has always been my somewhat idealistic belief that theatre at its best is a model for an ideal society. What happens when people go to the theatre? It is quite remarkable. For no reason other than that they think, &quot;Oh, I'd like to go and see that tonight&quot;, a large group of strangers decide to go to one theatre on one night of the week. They sit there in the dark, and another group, who are strangers to them, come on into the light. When it is working well, an energy goes from the light into the dark, is reinforced and is sent back. On a really good night, a perfect circle is created. It is a unique and transforming experience. As an actor, it lasted no longer than the walk from the stage to the dressing room. For an audience, it might last no longer than the walk from the seat to the exit. However, it happens; it is real; and it happens nowhere else. It is a remarkably unique experience. It does not happen every time, but it happens often enough for people to have tasted it, to have felt it and to want to experience it again.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/18">I have referred to Shakespeare, and he is not the only reason why theatre's value in our society should be treasured and valued. We should not have to make the same old argument every decade or so that it must be invested in by the state. I have made the point that the amount of investment from the state can transform not only the theatre and those who practice in it, but attendant industries and businesses. There are other benefits, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/19">The Government, to their credit, have acknowledged those benefits. They have supported, for example, programmes that invest in interesting young children in how the theatre can be part and parcel of their lives in the most practical sense. Such programmes work: young people do become interested, and they find that the disciplines that are an absolute requirement of any professional or theatrical performance can have a profound effect on how they view the world. They learn how to work in teams, and take on responsibility and carry it through to the end. I hope that hon. Members will not take this personally, but if this place had to run according to the disciplinary mores of the theatre, we would get through 10 times the amount of business in one quarter of the time and probably at a fraction of the cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/20">We have also seen at the other end of the age scale how drama and the telling of a story in an exchange between human beings can have a profound effect&mdash;for example, in respect of elderly people who suffer from Alzheimer's and are losing their memory. An interesting programme of work was carried out by an organisation called Age Exchange. Its director processed her experience in theatre and education into working with elderly people, initially in hospitals and residential homes over a wide area. The work that she did with people who are suffering the loss of memory has been taken on board by the medical profession not only in this country but in other European countries. It has immense potential for the exploration of whether there is some way to break through the barrier of forgetfulness, and it is drama&mdash;that exchange&mdash;that seems to do it.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/21">We know also of the immensely valuable work that drama can do in assisting people who are in prison. I do not have the actual data on the tip of my tongue, but there is undoubtedly an improvement and a reduction in recidivism when people in prison are engaged in such programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/22">We have seen the enormous benefits of organisations and companies working with homeless people. They give back to people something that is easily lost but can be immensely difficult to restore: a sense of themselves as being human beings who, by virtue of their humanity, are valuable. That is, in essence, one of the most valuable things about theatre, and it is why we would be foolish as a nation to ignore the possibilities to maintain, retain and enlarge it.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/23">To go back to the greatest dramatist that the world has ever seen or is ever likely to see, what are the questions that Shakespeare poses in a variety of guises in pretty much all of his plays? There are three of them, and I have always thought that they are very simple. All he ever asks is, &quot;Who are we?&quot; and &quot;Why are we?&quot; and &quot;What are we?&quot; No one has or ever will have the answers, but the pursuit of the questions and the possibility of answers are central and essential to our being human.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/24">In my humble opinion, there is no better arena for examining and pursuing such quests than the theatre, which is why I hope that the Government, to whom I pay full credit for what they have done in the past, will think about the minute amount of money that is required to maintain British theatre in its excellent state and to give it possibilities of expansion. I understand that the amount is as minuscule as &pound;3.5 million a year. To go from the sublime to the ridiculous, and having mentioned Shakespeare, that is surely a mere spit in the ocean. I have seen the odd nod here and there, so I am fairly certain that other Members will help to ensure that the argument about whether this country should put money into its theatre will never have to be made again.</p>

	<p pid="a.455.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Caton. I shall be brief.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.1/2">It is a great privilege to follow that very fine speech by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1614" name="Glenda Jackson">the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson)</phrase>. I agree with every word that she said. As I cannot begin to match her eloquence, I shall make a much more pragmatic and mundane contribution to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.1/3">I want to speak about one thing. Although I agreed with every word that the hon. Lady said, we must remember that this debate is not just about London, although it is tremendously important. I declare an interest: I am a passionate theatre-goer, and a strong supporter of the Royal Shakespeare Company in particular. I was privileged to see Patrick Stewart's extraordinary performance as Prospero in &quot;The Tempest&quot; only the week before last. That company gets 43.4 per cent. of its income in grants of one kind or another. For the sake of propriety, I should declare that my son is currently at drama school training to be a stage manager or technical theatre expert.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.1/4">Theatre, like all art, has always been subsidised. I sometimes hear the argument that art should stand on its own two feet, but great art has almost never done that. There have been patrons of the arts down the centuries: princes, kings, counts, dukes and rich people of one kind or another sought to immortalise themselves through their patronage. The leading patron now perforce must be the state.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.1/5">I welcome the increase in funding that the Government have made available to the Arts Council over the years, but we must remember two things. First, theatre funding is 0.02 per cent. of all public expenditure, so it is hardly a great sum to maintain against all the other competing priorities. I hope that that will help the Minister in his negotiations with the Chancellor. Secondly, there have been net reductions in real-terms funding for the arts since 2005. I agree that they have been modest, but I hope that we can at least put the arts back into a period of stability again, after the welcome growth that they experienced earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.1/6">I am concerned about the financial pressures that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and Arts Council England are likely to be under, as their core funding&mdash;and, therefore, the funding for individual theatres&mdash;is threatened. I am also worried about the lottery, which, since its inception under John Major, has made such a big contribution to theatre life. I do not want to be partisan in what should be a bipartisan debate, but I fear that the rising costs of the Olympics could have serious implications for many theatres the length and breadth of the United Kingdom. I look for reassurance from the Minister about how he hopes to maintain the funding streams to performing arts in general and the theatre in particular in the face of that real challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.1/7">I said that not just London is involved. There is a huge variety of theatre. Theatre companies that serve my constituency, broadly defined, include touring companies such as Shindig, and Collar and Tie, which go to schools and rural communities. We should not forget amateur theatre in this debate. There is a small amateur theatre in Droitwich Spa, the Norbury, which faces huge challenges to keep itself on the road. It would normally have looked to lottery funding to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.1/8">There is an absolutely fantastic arts centre called No. 8 in Pershore, which is just outside my constituency. We should pay tribute to the work done by many councils. For example, Wychavon district council provides No. 8 with its accommodation at a peppercorn rent, which enables it to do a fantastic job for the people of Pershore. The theatre works almost entirely with volunteer management and staff. It hopes to apply for core funding from the Arts Council, but it thinks that the funding taps are being turned off because of the Olympics and so on and that theatre groups and art centres that are not regularly funded organisations at present will find themselves left out in the cold. Its excellent managing director, Ray Steadman, is genuinely apprehensive that the tendency will be to concentrate money in strategic areas&mdash;mainly urban areas&mdash;leaving rural areas to suffer.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.1/9">The financial pressures on Worcestershire county council mean that it no longer has an arts officer or assistant. It will be interesting to see how Arts Council England will negotiate an appropriate settlement for No. 8, should it be minded to pay it at all, because, historically, the advice of the county council has been of great importance to Arts Council England.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.1/10">I think of Malvern Theatres, which has benefited hugely from lottery funding and modestly from continued funding from Arts Council England. It is privileged to get many west end try-outs. I saw Felicity Kendal in &quot;Amy's View&quot; there a few weeks ago before its west end run. Again, the facility exists in its current fine form only because of the huge amount of money that it has had from the lottery. The Birmingham Rep is a fine repertory theatre, and the Hippodrome was a huge lottery winner. Millions of pounds were spent on refurbishing that theatre, and many of the companies that perform in it are subsidised by Arts Council England or other parts of the Arts Council budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.1/11">On other parts of the Arts Council, I particularly wish to highlight the threat to funding in Northern Ireland. Those of us in the performing arts alliance group were very disturbed indeed to hear a presentation from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland about the significant real-terms cuts in funding for theatre there. At a time of great hope for peace in Northern Ireland, it would be tragic if the arts, which can make such a major contribution to building a sense of social cohesion, spirit and harmony, were to suffer a significant reduction in their budget. All the evidence points to that happening, and on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-21">21 March</phrase> &quot;The Stage&quot; website said:</p>
	<p pid="a.455.1/12" class="indent">&quot;Northern Ireland's theatre companies are facing a third successive year of cutbacks after the arts council announced standstill funding allocations for 2007/8.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.455.1/13">Such matters are of real concern, and I want to reinforce everything of a philosophical and powerful nature that the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate said. I issue a strong plea from the provinces at all levels for Arts Council of England funding, for adequate funding for councils to do their job and for the lottery, which has done such fantastic work in my constituency and county over the past years. Of course, I also issue a plea on behalf of the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford, whose fine new theatre is shortly to be developed. The last performance in the old theatre will take place sometime this week&mdash;on Saturday, I think&mdash;after which the old auditorium will close for major refurbishment.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.1/14">I wish to draw the Minister's attention to one other thing, if he is not already aware of it. Not only does the theatre face significant cuts in funding in real terms, but it may face an increased bill from the Government if Ofcom proceeds with its auction of spectrum, as it currently intends. I have heard hopeful indications that Ofcom is rethinking its position and promising a new consultation paper after the first consultation ends on the programme-making and special events sector, which covers drama, news gathering, sports and all kinds of other sectors, too. If the auction of spectrum proceeds on its current basis and is released for the digital dividend, there is a real risk that the radio microphone frequencies might be no longer available. If theatres cannot get that spectrum, it would mean the end for large swathes of theatre, and if they get it at a high price, it would mean a huge new bill for large sections of the performing arts in the UK. So I plead with the Minister to keep a careful eye not only on the Arts Council of England to negotiate sharply with the Chancellor, but to watch what Ofcom is doing, too. If the Government do not do that, we could land a massive new bill on our theatres with serious consequences for all of them.</p>

	<p pid="a.457.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1614" name="Glenda Jackson">my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson)</phrase> on securing this important debate&mdash;it was not before time. It is a privilege to follow my hon. Friend, who is not only a fine friend and parliamentary colleague, but one of our most distinguished actors with whom we cannot hope to compete in terms of speaking ability. I wish to declare an interest as my son is a member of Equity and I love the theatre. Beyond that, theatre is important for all of us&mdash;for our culture and our future. That is not just because the greatest playwright of all time is one of our past countrymen, but because it is important to how we develop as human beings.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/2">We are fortunate that we have the English language, which means that we have a thriving commercial theatre in London that serves a massive worldwide English-speaking audience. Many countries do not have that and subsidise their theatres to a much greater extent to sustain their own languages and cultures. We have the benefit of English, but that is not enough. We boast about our wonderful theatres in London but neglect the base from which our performers and domestic audiences come. We must spend more locally and regionally and redevelop a professional theatre at that level.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> said that the arts in general and theatre in particular have always been subsidised. There has been some mass popular theatre, but of course that took a big knock in the 20th century from radio, television and film, which provide a very different experience from a live performance that is life-enhancing and stimulates the imagination. We learn to suspend disbelief when we see a live play on a stage and two or three people pretending to be someone else. That is different from watching soap operas on television that attempt to look like reality. Theatre provides wonderful exercise for the mind, but also looks in a very intense way at the human condition&mdash;fear, love, war and all the things that we debate in this Chamber and, indeed, in Parliament can be found in theatre. I sometimes think that we have been half expecting what I would call a &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; moment in our own party&mdash;although it will not actually happen as I think that the relevant person is retiring from the scene. Nevertheless, something in Shakespeare will always fit with what we are doing at a particular time in politics. Shakespeare had a wonderful understanding of politics and the things that drive human beings in politics and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/4">My own children both love the theatre and performed when they were young. However, nothing was as great as when the Royal Shakespeare Company once came to Luton about 23 years ago with a travelling theatre&mdash;they set up their own stands and seats. Both my children saw Fiona Shaw in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; and &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; and went behind the scenes and met the actors. It was an experience that they never forgot, but the Royal Shakespeare Company has never been back. Why not? Why do we not say that the Royal Shakespeare Company should visit every town regularly? That would make a real difference but would require money and subsidy.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/5">I love the familiarity of the magical world of performance and have seen young people transformed by performing at school. However, nothing compares with seeing professionals performing brilliantly, which also provides something to aspire to. Amateur theatre is fine and we all have local amateur theatres that do a great job, but it is not the same as seeing professionals. The same can be said for music, which is another passion of mine. The experience of seeing the great orchestras of the world and musicians play is very different from going to see the local town band&mdash;although that is both welcome and enjoyable. It is important for everybody to see the arts at their best and in their locality.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/6">The issue of local theatres is my main theme. Some 40 years ago there were two theatres in Luton, but they were knocked down to make room for a large shopping centre and various car parks, which were considered more important. I consider that an act of barbarism. Since then, we have tried to build a new theatre in Luton, but there has never been enough money. We have a bowling alley and various other enjoyable things that make money, but we do not have a theatre and young people from the schools in the town cannot see a professional performance. I would like to have a subsidised local theatre in all major cities so that every schoolchild would consider it normal to be taken to the theatre during school time to see professional acting, to be inspired and to feel a sense of wonder at proper theatre. Of course, initially some children may find theatres embarrassing because actors are a bit like politicians and when they speak they are rather intense and embarrass people. However, although we happen to be a naturally reserved people, we should perhaps break out of that and learn that intense experiences and understandings deserve to be expressed in an intense manner and there is nothing more intense and wonderful than the theatre. As I have said, theatre is about human relationships, an understanding of the human condition, and politics.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/7">I want local theatres to be expanded and for the Government to spend a lot more on them. My hon. Friend talked about the figure of &pound;3.5 million, but losses from VAT fraud alone amount to &pound;1 billion every month&mdash;I want a bit of that. We should collect a bit more VAT with a few more VAT inspectors and spend it on theatre&mdash;that would be very good value for money. We still do not take the arts in general and the theatre in particular seriously in this country. On the continent of Europe they spend a lot more on such things.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/8">I will finish with an anecdote. When Vaclav Havel and his new Government first came to Britain to meet Mrs. Thatcher after the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia, as it was then, he brought about12 people with him. They went to Downing street and Mrs. Thatcher was introduced to the spokesmen for foreign affairs and for energy and transport. There were also five other people there and when she asked who they were President Havel said that they were representatives for culture. It is unimaginable that Britain would take 12 people abroad, five of whom are representatives for culture. I know that he was a playwright and had an interest in such things, but nevertheless I believe that on the continent they take cultural issues more seriously than we do. We should imitate that. As my hon. Friend said, we believe that we have the greatest playwright in history. I certainly believe that, and it is about time that we celebrated it by having a properly funded theatre ourselves.</p>

	<p pid="a.459.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1614" name="Glenda Jackson">the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson)</phrase> on obtaining this important debate. I recognise that time is short, so rather than covering the full range of topics I will focus on one issue&mdash;the relationship between spending on the 2012 Olympics and funding for the theatre through the lottery. When, in 2005, we heard that London had been awarded the Olympics, it was moment of joy and celebration for me, as for many people. It meant even more to me when I heard that there was to be a cultural Olympiad. I do not wish to be a pessimist, but it is probably unlikely in that in 2012 people will leave London talking about the extraordinary prowess of the British in sports and games. However, there is a good chance that they will go away imbued with admiration and feeling much enriched by the cultural life on offer in London and the United Kingdom. That is something to be valued and we must hold on to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.0/2">In order for that cultural happening to flower, we have to ensure that the roots continue to be nourished. The roots of great theatre in London and of the great performances that we see in the big theatres are to be found in our local theatres, but they have been under pressure and are somewhat in decline. I look with great pain at some of the cuts in lottery funding; they go to the heart of the issue by threatening some of that regional and local theatre funding. I hope that we hear today an assurance that that will not happen, but I have seen the numbers. There is a cut in the Arts Council of England lottery funding of about &pound;112.5 million; for Scotland the figure is &pound;12.5 million; for Wales it is&pound;8.1 million and for Northern Ireland it is &pound;4.5 million. Those are terribly serious numbers for that sector of our communities.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-28a.460.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" speakername="Susan Kramer" colnum="460"  time="014:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/halltext/70328h0006.htm#07032875000526">
	<p pid="a.460.1/1">I thank the hon. Lady, but the community to which I speak expresses a great deal of concern and worry, and it is looking for reassurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/2">In my community, we have the Orange Tree theatre. It calls itself a mini-National Theatre, but although it is only one small theatre the talent that it nurtures stimulates the infrastructure of the commercial theatre in our area. We had a meeting in the House with actors, ranging from those who will be familiar to everyone in the House&mdash;many of them at the late end of their careers&mdash;and young schoolchildren. The children were incredibly excited and were invigorated by being able to share in that meeting. It struck me then that communities can be built upon the relationship that the theatre uses to bring people together across age groups and generations. In my community and in much of London, that kind of connection is sorely needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/3">My community also has the Barton Green theatre. It is a small, amateur youth theatre in the heart of the community, yet virtually nothing else is on offer for the young. It will be applying for lottery funding; otherwise, the roof will fall in. The great fear is that, as all the various sources of funding disappear&mdash;a bite taken here and a large chunk taken there&mdash;those projects will be <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the ones to suffer. As the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> so eloquently said, once we lose those theatres the chances of bringing them back are minimal. If the theatres are not there for the oncoming generation, that generation will be lost to the theatre. I am extremely concerned about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/4">We have a unique opportunity to use the Olympics to express a great deal more than our sporting prowess; we can use them to build up the arts and culture, and to build up the theatre. As part of that, we must look back to the roots. I should like to hear how the Government intend to fund that sector, and how it is to be protected and nourished.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/5">I have one niggle, but it is not a partisan point. The Olympics funding includes money being set aside for contingencies&mdash;in other words, money that people hope will never be spent. For that to be a reason for losing local theatres would be a tragedy. Money provided for the Olympics by the private sector has not yet been pulled together and does not yet seem to be available; that that should be a reason for taking funding from our theatres would be another tragedy. I hope to hear answers on those issues today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-28a.461.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1779" speakername="Chris Bryant" colnum="461"  time="015:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/halltext/70328h0006.htm#07032875000527">
	<p pid="a.461.0/1">I declare a very minor &pound;1 interest in the National Youth Theatre, as an associate. I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1614" name="Glenda Jackson">my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson)</phrase>, not least because in her acting career she did more than many could aspire to do for British theatre, even making some shows commercially viable that many might have considered to be commercially impossible. For instance, productions such as &quot;The White Devil&quot;, &quot;The House of Bernarda Alba&quot; and &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; are all doing extraordinarily well in this country, and &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; is also doing very well abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.0/2">There are many utilitarian reasons why the theatre is vital. Its importance to the economy has been cited. Stratford says that the Royal Shakespeare Company brings to the region about &pound;58 million a year. That simply would not happen if it were not for the theatre. In London, three times more people go to the theatre than attend football matches. Theatre plays a key role in London's economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.0/3">Theatre also has an important role in education. We will have no great teachers of drama in schools without a strong theatre tradition throughout the United Kingdom. Theatre in schools can make a dramatic difference, enabling some of the kids who have had a difficult family background to achieve self-confidence and the ability to communicate that they would otherwise never achieve. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate said, that is true also in many prisons. It applies also to youth clubs. The ability to communicate is sought by most employers. Those who do not have the personal confidence that acting on a stage can give&mdash;even if only in a small part&mdash;will not have such good opportunities at work.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.0/4">Acting also gives individuals the skill of working in a team and the understanding that it is not enough for them to shine on their own if the entire cast are not performing together, and that if one does not turn up on time, the rehearsals cannot fail to happen. All those disciplines are essential to the skills that people need&mdash;in life and in work.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.0/5">As my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate said, theatre is important also to the British tourism industry. When questionnaires are put to tourists asking what were their main reasons for coming here, an extraordinary number cite the British theatre; it is either first or second on the list of priorities for the majority of international tourists.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.0/6">The theatre is vital for training people in the television and film industries. Apart from the United States, Britain is the only country that has a positive balance of trade in television shows. In large measure, that is because of the training that people have had, both backstage and on stage, and the skills that they have acquired through their experience of theatre and of performing before live audiences. The UK can be proud of our Oscar winners; not a single one of them would have risen to prominence without experience in the subsidised theatre. The spin-offs for all sorts of creative industries are dramatic.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.0/7">The last of the utilitarian reasons why it is important to have a strong theatre industry, but the most important to the Treasury, is the VAT that the theatre pumps into the Treasury&mdash;to the tune of &pound;100 million a year. That is only &pound;20 million short of the state's subsidy for the theatre. The truth is that British theatre receives only &pound;20 million from the state. It is a pretty poor show.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.0/8">However, there are less tangible reasons why we should be passionate about supporting the theatre. We have referred to Shakespeare, but his understanding of holding a mirror up to nature is vital. Politicians should be forced to go to the theatre more often, especially when it shows us at our worst.</p>

	<p pid="a.468.0/1">I join hon. Members in congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1614" name="Glenda Jackson">the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson)</phrase>. During the opening remarks, I was looking at my notes, hearing what was being said rather than listening to the individual words. It reminded me of something that I realised to be the many impassioned passages that I heard the hon. Lady deliver in her previous career as an actress, for which I admired her greatly at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/2">We have heard eloquent accounts from all Members who have spoken of the value of the theatre to education and society, to the economy and to them personally because of how it moves people. We heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> about the appallingly low wages that are all too often the norm in the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/3">As we have heard, public subsidy to the theatre is &pound;120 million, but &pound;100 million of it comes back in VAT, so we are talking about not 0.02 per cent. of public spending but less&mdash;&pound;20 million net, once the VAT return from the sale of theatre tickets is taken into account. It is a very small sum. What do we get for that small investment? We get a contribution to the UK economy of about &pound;2.6 billion, 19 million theatre visits and the social, not just economic, enrichment of theatre activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/4">Public funding is less in this country than in Europe but more than in the USA, where reliance on sponsors puts a dead hand on innovation and the theatre's ability to experiment. The balance in the UK might be seen as quite a good one. It is enough to encourage innovation and creativity and promote healthy, cutting-edge theatre without creating a complacent, overfunded public sector or imposing the dead hand of commercial sponsorship.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/5">Public investment also enables the development of creative and technical skills on and offstage. It helps subsidised theatre to provide a training ground for many performers and technical staff who then go on to work in commercial theatre. Subsidised theatre is often the breeding ground for performances such as &quot;The History Boys&quot; and &quot;Jerry Springer: The Opera&quot; that go on later to the commercial world. It is the same sort of argument that we often hear, and that I have certainly made, for the BBC and funding through the licence fee, because of the knock-on value to the rest of the sector, although the theatre is much less well funded than the BBC.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/6">The effect in not only felt in London and the west end theatre; there is council investment. Examples include the Sage in Gateshead or the Lowry in Salford Quays. At the other extreme we find groups such as the Kneehigh Theatre in Cornwall, which has developed over 20 years with Arts Council funding and has increased its audiences by 30 per cent. It tours extensively domestically and abroad and has an international reputation. It works with young people and helps local festivals, bringing a range of benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/7">Some local theatres such as the Pomegranate theatre in Chesterfield simply would not exist without the help of small authorities such as our local borough council. Without them, people who are interested in theatre would have almost no local access to theatre but for an excellent amateur group, the Hasland theatre company, which runs its own small theatre, and various other amateur groups that need venues at which to perform. Instead, people would have to drive some distance to places such as Sheffield or Nottingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/8">There are problems across the board. The Arts Council does good work: it is putting &pound;1.8 million into youth theatre and is increasing diversity with the Eclipse theatre that it supports. The fact that it is an arm's length body is valued, but there is a professional perception that that arm's length status is being eroded a little and that it has lost some expertise and has scrapped the peer review process when awarding grants. There is also a problem with having to choose between giving organisations some stability of funding and switching funding into new and innovative theatre groups, but that choice has to be made because public funds are so small.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/9">Local authorities are also under pressure. As a result, Battersea arts centre and Northampton's theatres are under threat. Even in Chesterfield, the Labour Opposition group is arguing, in the local election campaign, that if Labour wins control of the council on <phrase class="date" code="">3 May</phrase>, it will cut funding to the council theatre.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/10">Touring theatre has had difficulty accessing Arts Council funding since the council cut its touring department, and there is a constant tension between funding core costs and funding performances. As we have heard, many theatres are historic, listed buildings that are expensive to maintain, but they are a crucial part of our culture and built heritage. However, there is no point in funding the buildings without enabling performances to take place within them.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/11">Private funding and philanthropy will support a thriving sector that is stimulated by public investment, but, as we saw in the 1980s and 1990s, if public funding is cut, the private sector will not replace that funding. Since the heavy funding cuts of those decades, there has been a welcome reintroduction of funding back to pre-1980 levels. In the 2005-08 spending review, Arts Council grants were frozen by &pound;34 million in real terms, and there is a threat of further cuts or freezes in the next round, up to 2011. Those dangers are made much worse by the threat of a smash-and-grab raid from the lottery, which will further undermine efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/12">In conclusion, the Government must maintain theatre investment. In surveys, 79 per cent. of the public say that they support the concept of public subsidy to the arts. The current subsidy is 0.02 per cent. or less of public spending, for which we get thriving, subsidised theatres that help to stimulate the rest of the sector and make an invaluable contribution to the economy. They also make an invaluable and immeasurable contribution to the social and cultural capital of our nation.</p>

	<p pid="a.469.0/1">I get <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1614" name="Glenda Jackson">the impression that the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson)</phrase> does not like being complimented, so I shall merely congratulate her on securing the debate. I shall not detain colleagues by praising the elegance, eloquence and passion of her wonderful speech. I was privileged to force a contribution from her in our December debate on British films, which was well worth hearing, as was her contribution today. At that time, I said on my blog that I hoped that the next Prime Minister, who is present in the Chamber, would include her in his ministerial team at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, alongside my good friend the Minister with responsibility for the arts.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/2">I thank the various organisations that have provided important briefings for today's debate: Equity, the actors association; the Theatrical Management Association; the National Campaign for the Arts; and the Society of London Theatre. The other day, my sister's neighbour, the theatre producer Matthew Byam Shaw, told her that I am not interested in the theatre, because I have not been to see &quot;Frost/Nixon.&quot; In fact, I have been to see it, but my wife and I paid for our tickets&mdash;unlike other hon. Members, perhaps. I suspect that that is why I did not appear on his radar screen.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/3">I saw that play a week before the birth of our first child Joseph, six months ago, and I have not been able to go the theatre since. When I was preparing for the debate, I made a list of the plays that I am desperate to see: &quot;The Seagull&quot;, &quot;Rock'n'Roll&quot;, &quot;Whipping it Up&quot;, &quot;Boeing-Boeing&quot;, &quot;The Entertainer&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; at the Roundhouse. That list gives a flavour of the cultural vibrancy in our theatres in London and around the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/4">We keep talking about theatre being subsidised, which almost gives the impression that it is somehow a bit-part of our culture and society. The theatre is a mass market. There were 35,000 theatrical performances in the country last year, which is about 100 a day. Almost 20 million tickets were sold, bringing in nearly &pound;500 million in ticket sales alone. The theatre is at the heart of British cultural life and, as many hon. Members have pointed out, boy, do we get bang for our investment buck. For the price of &pound;120 million a year, we get back not only &pound;100 million in VAT, but, it has been argued, almost &pound;2.6 billion-worth of contribution to the economy. On any argument, that is an investment worth making.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/5">I am a friend of the arts lobby, and it upsets me that it seems to be forced on to the ground of its detractors and that it has to respond to the fatuous arguments against subsidising theatre. I expect that the &pound;120 million subsidy is extremely well spent. Some newspapers will alight on a performance that did not work or to which only three people turned up and cite it as an example of waste in the arts, but we should compare that investment with the &pound;1 billion spent on the dome, the tripling of the Olympics budget or the money that might be wasted on an NHS computer system. Compared with all the money spent on public sector organisations&mdash;I emphasise that I do not regard the theatre as a public sector organisation&mdash;we probably get extremely good value from the theatre.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/6">When I was given the post of shadow Minister with responsibility for the arts, a Labour Member said to me, &quot;Ah, you are representing entertainment that cannot pay its way.&quot; Why do we assume that sport, for example, is not subsidised? Of course it is at its grass roots. The premiership is subsidised by talented footballers who get subsidies as they start their careers, so why on earth is it wrong to subsidise the arts and theatre?</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/7">Now that I have got all that off my chest, I shall address some of the key arguments that hon. Members made in what I thought was an important outbreak of consensus. I hope that the consensus will continue to the next election and beyond. First, there is no room for complacency. The comprehensive spending review is of huge concern to the arts world and the theatre world. There are two main elements of concern, one of which is the date of the review. It sounds relatively unimportant&mdash;when the Chancellor will come to the House to announce the details of the review&mdash;but people who work in arts organisations rely on the ability to plan for the long term, and we do not even know the date of the review yet. A hint was given that it might be in the autumn, but arts organisations need to know so that they can plan for the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/8">The second concern about the comprehensive spending review, which is at the heart of the matter, concerns funding. We know that arts and theatre organisations are being told to plan for a 5 per cent. cut or a freeze. We do not know what will emerge, but I tell the House that freezing the arts budget now, after the freeze that began in 2005, will cause immense damage.</p>

	<p pid="a.471.0/1">I hate to inject a partisan note into the consensus, but I want to quote the comments of Michael Lynch, the chief executive of the Southbank centre. He said, of the Government's funding:</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/2" class="indent">&quot;The money has been a real achievement. The Government has played a pretty substantial role in these past seven or eight years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/3">Many others from the theatre world have congratulated the Government on their investment in theatre. We must guard against future problems, but will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that this Government have put a lot more money into theatre than the Conservative Government took out?</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-28a.471.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-28b.471.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-28a.471.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1905" speakername="Edward Vaizey" colnum="471"  time="015:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/halltext/70328h0008.htm#07032875000539">
	<p pid="a.471.1/1">I do not regard that comment from the hon. Lady, who is one of my oldest friends and who was a companion at university, as partisan. I agree with her, and I am happy to give the Government praise where praise is due. How nice it is to have a member of the Garrick club join our proceedings as we debate the theatre. I am happy to acknowledge praise where it is due, just as I hope that she will acknowledge criticism where it is due.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/2">That situation explains why there is such concern about the comprehensive spending review. As was mentioned, increasing the arts budget in line with inflation would require a sum in the region of &pound;3.5 million, which these days is the cost of about half a house in some of London's more affluent parts. Those of us who have read today's <i>Evening Standard</i> will know that houses in Kensington and Chelsea are now going for about &pound;11 million, so we are talking about a tiny sum<i>&mdash;[Interruption.]</i> I am glad that I have stimulated some reaction from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1779" name="Chris Bryant">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/3">We are concerned about not only the comprehensive spending review, but the continuing raid on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">the lottery. The hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase>, among others, pointed out that the Arts Council is to lose &pound;112.5 million. The Heritage Lottery Fund, to which theatres can turn for some of their capital requirements, will also lose a substantial sum. I apologise for banging on about this, but the point of the lottery was to protect our cultural institutions from the rounds of cuts stimulated by political expediency. The lottery was supposed to be separate from all that. That is why it was created and why it is so galling that the lottery is continually raided for political purposes&mdash;that must stop.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/4">I should make a couple of quick points before I conclude. I have had only a few minutes to speak; it is testament to the commitment of Members of this House to the theatre that so many hon. Members have spoken in this debate. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1497" name="Paul Holmes">The point made by the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes)</phrase> about touring theatres was brought to my attention by the Theatrical Management Association too. There is real concern that the Arts Council has cut its touring unit, because touring theatres are a crucial aspect of the theatrical world.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase>, who is the co-chair of the all-party group on theatre and a great and passionate supporter in this House of the theatre, discussed the widespread concern among performing companies of all kinds about the digital dividend review and the potential loss of channel 69, on which so many of them rely.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/6">The final issue that I shall raise was brought to my attention by the National Campaign for the Arts, and it relates to changes in immigration law. I would welcome the Minister's comments on this area. Many of our theatres rely on intercultural exchange and on visiting actors and actresses, so we must consider the rise in the cost of visas. There is also some concern in the arts world about the new points-based system.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/7">I should leave hon. Members in no doubt about the commitment of Conservatives to our subsidised arts and subsidised theatre. In the great scheme of things, we are talking about small sums that are efficiently spent, and which generate an enormous amount of artistic and economic return. Theatre forms an essential part of our civilised society.</p>

	<p pid="a.473.1/1">I am pleased that I have been able to continue discussions with Ministers in the Department for Education and Skills, specifically in relation to creative partnerships&mdash;they are, as my hon. Friend knows, joint projects with schools&mdash;and also in relation to the music manifesto. There are dimensions to the music manifesto and more recently, the dance review that affect theatre. Dance, and its impact on theatre, has been incredibly important.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/2">The point that my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow makes about diversity is hugely important. In some of our central debates in society, we can connect with and reach out to some of the Muslim youth in this country and the sort of communities that occupy my constituency to enable them to tell their stories to a wider audience. That is hugely important. My hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate has the Hampstead theatre in her constituency and will know that it is doing that through many of its productions in new facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/3">We have heard about the economic impact of theatre. Last year, total ticket revenues for the west end theatre broke through the &pound;400 million mark for the first time. The total value of the west end theatre to the economy has been estimated at &pound;1.5 billion, and of theatre beyond the west end an additional &pound;1.1 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/4">It is right to acknowledge local authorities' role&mdash;that came up in the debate&mdash;and the major contribution that success brings to this country. &quot;The History Boys&quot; is an outstanding example. It began at the National Theatre, won six Tony awards in New York, including best play and, for Nicholas Hytner, best director. It has brought earnings of &pound;1 million to the National Theatre, which will be invested back into programming. The film director, Stephen Frears, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Many of us currently earning money for British cinema have spent our lives working within some form of the subsidized arts, and have benefited from the wise decision of the government to support the arts properly.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/6">Our funding for the arts in this country is based on a mixed economy. We want institutions that can produce revenue, and we want to attract private and commercial investment, but public subsidy is vital to inspire innovation, and to produce core funding to encourage organisations to move forward, and we are committed to that. We are having this debate largely because hon. Members know that we are in a spending review period and they can be assured that we continue to have these discussions with colleagues in the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/7">Hon. Members referred to the national lottery. It is important that during its first 10 years more than&pound;441 million of lottery funds were invested by the Arts Council in theatre and drama. We have seen real growth and success from lottery capital funds invested in the sector, with most of the capital projects now completed; for example, the Unicorn and the Young Vic. Throughout the country many of those capital projects have come through.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/8">Existing lottery commitments will not be affected by the recent announcement of lottery contributions towards the Olympics. There will still be almost&pound;500 million of new lottery money for the Arts Council between 2009 and 2012. The total contribution from lottery funds to the arts for the Olympics will be worth &pound;28 million a year if taken over the four years, as we expect, notwithstanding the outcome of the spending review. The total combined Government and lottery investment for this year equates to just 5 per cent. The Olympics are exactly the sort of one-off national event that the lottery was intended to support and the arts will benefit as a result post-2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.475.1/1">I am pleased to have this debate on the treatment of asylum seekers. The atmosphere in which asylum is normally discussed in this country has become deeply poisonous because of the role of much of the media in misreporting the plight of many asylum seekers. That in turn encourages politicians often to ignore their plight, and our feeling of humanity towards people less fortunate than ourselves is hardened and, to some extent, almost disappears. In this country, we are very good at exaggerating our role in history concerning people who are seeking asylum and a place of safety in this country, but when we consider how they are currently treated in this country and the delays and horrors that they go through, not just in this country but throughout Europe, we should take a slightly different view.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.1/2">At the moment large numbers of people try to escape from poverty, oppression, difficulties and sheer misery in many very poor countries, mainly in Africa but also in parts of the middle east and south Asia. The reports one reads of the plight of people trying to get from the coast of west Africa to the Canary Islands from which they can gain entry to the European Union are horrific. An eye-witness account of what happened in October last year off the coast of the Canary Islands states that 20 migrants were missing after their inflatable boat sank off the Canary Islands on <phrase class="date" code="">5 October</phrase>. Another report states that 17 people died after their boat went adrift off Sicily channel, among them five women and three children, on <phrase class="date" code="">7 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.1/3">The reports go on. For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.475.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Nineteen people died on August 11, after a gas cylinder exploded aboard a boat directed to Canary Islands&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.475.1/5">and:</p>
	<p pid="a.475.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Twelve died and 22 were missing after a pirogue heading for the Canary Islands sank&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.1/7">So it goes on.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.1/8">In March last year, a representative of the Red Crescent was asked to describe the situation, and said,</p>
	<p pid="a.475.1/9" class="indent">&quot;they are prepared to commit suicide. For them it is like the Russian roulette game; I arrive or I die.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.475.1/10">It was then believed that between 700 and 800 people, the majority from Mali, Gambia and Senegal, attempted to cross each day.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.1/11">I mention that, not because it is the direct responsibility of the British Government or the House, but because it is a Europe-wide phenomenon and we are part of a Europe-wide border arrangement. The horrors of what is happening to many desperate and very poor people who are trying to get to the Canary Islands, Sicily and other southern European countries is very serious, and for the sake of humanity we should have some respect for the lives of those people and see what we can do to assist them.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.1/12">The reports that are eventually published show the shocking desperation that some asylum seekers face. For example, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-19">19 March</phrase> last week, the BBC website stated, and it was widely reported in the media, that:</p>
	<p pid="a.475.1/13" class="indent">&quot;Uddhav Bhandari, 40, set himself alight in the Eagle Street Building, Bothwell Street, Glasgow, which is home to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.475.1/14">He was clearly desperate.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.1/15" class="indent">&quot;The father-of-two had been living in Edinburgh for six years and worked as a volunteer, helping to recycle bicycles.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.475.1/16">He set himself alight and died. Robina Qureshi, director of Positive Action in Housing, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.475.1/17" class="indent">&quot;Uddhav Bhandari spent six years trying to seek refuge here and bring his wife and two kids over to this country...Forbidden to find paid work, he worked as a volunteer...Last night, he died alone in hospital a few days after setting fire to himself...He was a victim of an asylum policy that persecutes and tortures the victims of persecution and torture.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.475.1/18">Tragically, that is not the only time that somebody has taken their own life, either in that dramatic setting or alone in cells in various detention centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.1/19">Will the Government, when formulating policies to deal with asylum, immigration and detention, have greater regard for people's human feelings and sense of desperation? No Member in this room has ever had to seek asylum&mdash;that sense of having to give up everything to try to seek safety somewhere else.</p>

	<p pid="a.476.0/1">My hon. Friend's debate is timely, if a little premature, because on Friday, the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which I chair, will publish a full and detailed report on the treatment of asylum seekers. Although it remains confidential until it is published on Friday, the evidence that is already in the public domain clearly illustrates the horrific stories that we have heard about the way in which people are treated. It is a breach not only of the European convention on human rights and the Human Rights Act 1998, but of basic common humanity, which in far too many cases is not observed.</p>

	<p pid="a.476.1/1">I am pleased to hear that intervention from my friend, who is the chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights.

	<p pid="a.476.3/1">I thank my friend for drawing the House's attention to that story; it is not, unfortunately, an isolated case. I assume from the Chair of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the Joint Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase>, that the Committee's report will take up such issues. Such treatment is a disfigurement of any civilised society. Those people have not committed any crime other than to seek a place of safety for themselves, their partners and their children, and we must mend our ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/2">I represent a constituency in which a large of number of people have sought asylum; it has traditionally been such an area. Much of my casework relates either to local issues&mdash;housing problems and the other normal problems that MPs receive&mdash;or to asylum seekers, who are often desperate simply to get answers from the Home Office to their letters. Sometimes, half the people that I see at a Friday advice surgery come to me not with a problem, but with the question, &quot;Why can't the Home Office answer the question, answer the case and respond to letters?&quot; They laugh wryly when they read the part saying that a reply will be sent within13 weeks. I say, &quot;It didn't say the year in which the13 weeks was up,&quot; at which point it is laboriously translated, and the humour is often lost in translation.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/3">People who come to this country to seek a place of safety want to do a number of things, such as learn English and contribute to society, and they are keen to do their best. If we take away the opportunity for English lessons that are paid for by the public purse, what are we doing? We are not saving ourselves any money; we are preventing a great many people from learning English, which is not a sensible policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/4">Although I realise that the Minister responding to the debate is not responsible for that issue, he knows that I have entered into correspondence with the Minister for Higher Education and Lifelong Learning about concerns raised by City and Islington college in my constituency. I imagine that other Members from other constituencies would raise similar points about the need for English for speakers of other languages&mdash;ESOL&mdash;teaching.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/5">The absence of any access to legal aid, and, when people are eligible for it, the shortage of legal aid solicitors to represent them, is also stressful for many people. Many strong cases are lost, forgotten or badly represented, because the applicant receives poor advice and poor representation. Once poor representations are made, it is hard to retrieve a case. I hope that the Minister present realises that justice means not only the provision of a judicial system, but the right to be represented within it. Legal aid is an important part of that system.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/6">I have constituents who receive National Asylum Support Service vouchers and accommodation. The plethora of companies and agencies that are meant to be responsible for the administration of the vouchers and accommodation is quite bewildering. The administration is often inefficient, grossly incompetent and quite cruel to the individuals concerned. I shall not name them, because it would be embarrassing to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/7">However, I can think of an elderly man in my constituency from west Africa who relies entirely on those vouchers for his existence. There is no way&mdash;I hope&mdash;that he would ever be deported, because of his age and condition. He does not find walking or getting around very easy, and the vouchers often do not arrive, or they are late, or they are for the wrong amount. However, what are his options? He cannot draw money out of a cash machine; he does not have any. We should think about the sort of lives that people have to endure.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/8">NASS often changes the accommodation arrangements for people whom it has housed, moving them from an area where they have relations, the same community, and linguistic and community support. Such areas are important to them: if one comes from a war-torn society or a place of political oppression, having people from a similar background nearby is important for building up one's self-esteem and sense of connections. Unfortunately, NASS has great difficulty in recognising that factor, and it looks around for yet another accommodation agency to place an applicant. They are shunted outside London, if they previously lived there, or to somewhere miles away. All that community support is lost, and a sense of isolation and depression takes over, or worse, they suffer racist attacks. I hope that those concerns will be understood when the Joint Committee's report is considered&mdash;and indeed in the Minister's response today.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/9">The Government have been keen on getting tough on asylum seekers. I shall make two points about that issue. First, section 9 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 is used to withdraw benefits from people, which forces them into poverty. Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International, provided a strong quotation to <i>The Guardian</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-07">7 November 2006</phrase>, when she said:</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/10" class="indent">&quot;Forcing people into destitution as an attempt to drive them out of the country is backfiring badly and vulnerable people are suffering. Refused asylum seekers are being reduced to penniless poverty&mdash;forced to sleep in parks, public toilets and phone boxes, to go without vital medicines even after suffering torture, and to rely on the charity of friends or drop-in shelters to survive.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/11">In my constituency, I know of situations in which a poor family&mdash;perhaps surviving on income support&mdash;have come from another country, gained status legally in this country, and then taken in another family who have no income whatever. The very poor are looking after the desperately poor. I am sure that my colleagues have similar stories. We must be far more reasonable about the issue. Around London, the people who one sees begging are, increasingly, asylum seekers who are exercising their legitimate right to appeal, but who are not allowed to gain any support in the meantime.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/12">Secondly, there is the question of detention, which sits with that issue. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">My hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> will be well aware of the lack of safety in Harmondsworth detention centre. Anne Owers last year described the centre, which holds 500 men facing deportation at any time, as having slipped into</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/13" class="indent">&quot;a culture wholly at odds with its stated purpose&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/14">since a riot took place there in 2004. She went on to describe the centre's conditions, of which my friend will be well aware.</p>

	<p pid="a.484.1/1">The Minister has looked accurately into his crystal ball. I certainly am saying that prison sentences should be longer, and I shall explore that in more detail in a few minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.1/2">The reason that prisoners reoffend has nothing to do with prison. The Minister has been very perceptive; it is largely due to the fact that people do not spend long enough in prison. As the Home Office report suggested, most prisoners go to jail via the magistrates courts, and many have a drug addiction, too. The maximum prison sentence that a magistrate can impose is six months. If a criminal pleads guilty, they are likely to get a third knocked off. That reduces the sentence to four months. They are then likely to serve only half of the remaining time. In effect, that means that in many cases magistrates can send people to prison for only two months. They go into prison as drug addicts, and we should not be surprised that they come out as drug addicts to start their crime spree all over again. They need to be in prison longer, not only to be punished properly for their crime&mdash;or crimes, as few are sent to prison for their first offence&mdash;but to have time to kick their addiction.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.1/3">Given that since 1997 alone, more than 7,000 crimes were committed by people who were tagged or were released before the end of the jail sentences handed down by the courts, ensuring that prisoners served the full sentence handed down by the courts would help to reduce crime, too. The public have no faith in the criminal justice system, and honesty in sentencing would do a great deal to reassure them as well as to reduce reoffending. Prisoners should not be let out of prison early for good behaviour; they should be left in prison longer for bad behaviour. When I was at school, if I behaved properly that was what was expected of me and I was allowed to leave school on time. If I misbehaved, I was kept back for detention. Can the Minister explain to the British people why he thinks that that should not apply to prisoners, too, and why they should not serve the sentence handed down by the courts in full?</p>
	<p pid="a.484.1/4">The public know that that all makes sense. Surveys that I have conducted in my constituency show that84 per cent. of people believe that prisoners should serve the sentence handed down by the courts in full. The police know that that makes sense, too. In my time on the parliamentary police scheme, working with my local Keighley division of West Yorkshire police, many police officers told me that if their top 10 persistent criminals were in prison, crime would be reduced by about half. If the top 20 persistent offenders were in prison, crime would be reduced by about 90 per cent. Does the Minister agree with that analysis by the police?</p>
	<p pid="a.484.1/5">The Government are at sixes and sevens. They started off knowing that to be tough on crime they needed to send more people to prison. However, because the Chancellor has consistently refused to invest in building more prisons, that has resulted in their being full. The Government now have to pretend that prison does not work after all, and that it is tougher not to send people to prison and to give them some so-called tough community sentence. We saw pictures in the papers this week of such sentences, with people lying on benches instead of doing any work. That seems a laughable position for the Government to hold. Will the Minister make it clear whether he believes that prison works or not? If he does, will he commit to not letting dangerous criminals out early and to abandoning the plans that we have read about this week to avoid sending people to prison at all costs?</p>
	<p pid="a.484.1/6">I want to touch on the prison regime in this country, which I believe is far too lax. The fact that more than 1,500 prisoners have Sky TV in their cells&mdash;not in a communal area but in their cells&mdash;will disgust most decent people. I am sure that many people in my constituency wish they had Sky TV and could watch premiership football, but they cannot afford it. Why should they have to pay through their taxes for a regime that allows prisoners to enjoy such a luxury? It has also recently emerged that roughly 60 per cent. of prisoners have keys to their own cells. Most people could be forgiven for believing that that is just typical of the Government's determination to put the human rights of criminals and prisoners above the rights of victims and decent, hard-working, law-abiding people in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.1/7">Successive chief inspectors of prisons and judges are parts of the establishment with a lot to answer for in respect of prison life. Those people leave their luxury, idyllic homes to visit prisons and report back on what an awful place they are. They do not consider the environment from which many people in prison come: not luxury homes in idyllic locations, but drug and crime-ridden estates. During my time on the parliamentary police scheme, a custody sergeant said to me that in her experience the biggest deterrent to crime was the prospect of being sent to prison for the first time. People were genuinely afraid of that. However, she said that once they had been sent to prison, they found that many of their friends and associates were there, they got three square meals a day, they had access to a gym, which most of us would have to pay for, and other facilities, and their quality of life was higher in prison than on the outside. That cannot be right.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-28a.488.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" speakername="Gerry Sutcliffe" colnum="488"  time="016:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/halltext/70328h0011.htm#07032875000567">
	<p pid="a.488.1/1">Let me read the briefing note that I have on the issue. I am sure that it is in line with the answer to the hon. Gentleman's parliamentary question. If it is not, I shall be asking questions as well. Prisoners can have televisions in their cells as part of the incentives and earned privilege scheme. TVs must be earned and can be withdrawn if a prisoner fails to comply with the prison regime or breaches discipline. A small number of prisoners have access to freeview in their cell. Like the rest of the country, the Prison Service must prepare for the switchover to digital TV, and that will mean that prisoners who have earned the right to have a TV will have access to additional channels, because everybody will have that access with the move to digital TV. As I said, prisoners pay &pound;1 per week to rent a TV from the Prison Service. That is a million miles away from the hon. Gentleman's comments about watching Sky TV or Sky Sport on television in prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.1/2">The hon. Gentleman's argument trivialises the tremendous work that is being done in prison. There are different types of prisons. For example, there are local prisons, where people are sent immediately. There is one close to his constituency and mine&mdash;Armley prison in Leeds&mdash;which he may have visited. I do not know whether he has. If he has not, he should visit it. It may change his view about prisons being holiday camps. They are about making sure that offenders are managed properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.1/3">I read out the figures for where we are nationally in trying to reduce reoffending. The rates are far too high, and the hon. Gentleman makes a serious point when he talks about drugs in prisons and people entering prison with a problem. They may enter detoxification, but the solution involves not just what prisons do but what society does. The Government have involved primary care trusts in health provision in prisons because we need to consider how to manage offenders from end to end.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.1/4">From the minute someone is arrested, we try to find out what caused the offence&mdash;why have they offended? We must consider the different types of offenders. As I said, the prison population is at a record level of 80,000. Of those, fewer than 4,000 are women. We must try to find out what causes offenders to offend and do something about it, but something must be done by society, not just the prison regime. We must try to find education and work solutions so that people come out of prison not to reoffend but to find sustainable work or education. That is the way to stop reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.1/5">That is why the National Offender Management Bill is important. The hon. Gentleman voted against it, as did the hon. Member for Kettering, and I am concerned about that. They must think through the issues. Yes, the public must be protected, and we must lock up dangerous and serious offenders, but not everybody in prison is a dangerous or serious offender. We must look at ways to reduce reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.1/6">One way to deal with the problem is by involving a wider range of people. One of the problems is that when people are released from prison, there is no proper resettlement plan to help them avoid going back to what they were doing before. Offenders need housing and educational support. I believe that alternatives to custody are important, and that the public will understand and accept that they are not soft options.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.1/7">I refer the hon. Member for Shipley to the north-west, where community justice is taking place. Communities identify projects that need to be carried out in their communities. Magistrates sentence against those projects and everybody wins: the communities see the work being done and that it is not a soft option, and they benefit from what is taking place, and the offender's skills are developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.1/8">We must consider alternatives to custody. I was pleased by the comments of Lord Phillips, the Lord Chief Justice, that we need to look at alternative custody as a way not of dampening down the prison population but of offering up an alternative to try to cut reoffending rates. We have been working with the youth justice scheme. I know that the hon. Gentleman was on the police scheme, so he will know how many youngsters are involved in crime. We must try to nip that in the bud by supporting those young people, and ensuring that that they do not end up in a warehouse situation in prison as that can lead to a vicious cycle. We have to consider those alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.1/9">I have just received further information on Sky TV. The hon. Gentleman is right on the figures; there were 1,500 Sky sets in cells and the parliamentary answer was correct. As I said, we changed the system in relation to the digital position.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.1/10">We have an ambitious target of reducing reoffending by 10 per cent. by the end of the decade. Adult prison places cost &pound;40,000 a year, and young offender places cost &pound;50,000. That cannot be the right way to progress. We need to consider the alternatives and find ways of ensuring that people understand what prison is about. Elements of punishment are quite right when the punishment fits the crime, but so is rehabilitation and trying to bring people back into society by using the expertise of a number of bodies that work with prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.1/11">This is an important debate, because we need to understand that prison is only part of the solution. The hon. Gentleman was right to raise the subject of public confidence in the criminal justice system. That was one of the things that the Home Secretary brought about when we took over as a new ministerial team. We were concerned that people did not understand existing sentencing policies. It is important that we have an independent judiciary, and that judges base their decisions on what is before them. However, it is also important to ensure that the public understand and have confidence in sentencing. We are embarking on that through consultation to ensure that people understand that reductions in sentences can sometimes be about the witness and the victims not having to go through the court procedure, and that it can be a benefit if someone pleads guilty. Nevertheless, such a process must be carried out in a good spirit and should not become the norm, it has to be appropriate and proper.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.1/12">We will ensure that prison places are provided for serious offenders, but we need to drill further to find out what motivates people to offend. We estimate that offending is often drugs-related, and we are trying to deal with a 974 per cent. increase in drugs spending in prisons. It is not about addressing that problem only in prison; it is about ensuring end-to-end offender management so that people are supported in the community when they come out. Whether it is an educational matter or a drugs issue that needs to be addressed, rehabilitation should be a continuous process. I believe that the public will accept that.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.1/13">There was a recent poll on women in prison. The hon. Gentleman will know about the work that Baroness Corston has done on vulnerable women, which indicated that prison should be the last alternative for women. The impact on women prisoners who have families often means that those families then have problems with crime. There are other problems associated with dysfunctional families.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.1/14">It is important that the people who offer alternatives to prison are not seen as left-wing liberals, as described by the hon. Gentleman. Such people have witnessed what has happened to the prison system over many years.</p>
