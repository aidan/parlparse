	<p pid=".435.3/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the subject of asylum seekers and Zimbabwe, which has been much discussed in recent weeks. It is a pleasure to see the Minister. I am sure that I speak on behalf of all my colleagues who have contacted his office in the past few weeks when I tell him how grateful we are to the staff there for their courtesy and speedy responses, which really make a difference. The responses may not always be what we would wish for, but that is not their responsibility. The work of the Minister and his team is appreciated.</p>
	<p pid=".435.3/2">The situation in Zimbabwe is well known in the Chamber and outside: it remains desperate. I know that a number of colleagues want to speak about Zimbabwe, especially about the Home Office decision to continue to return to that country those whose asylum claims are not successful, and I shall allow them to do so in the next 90 minutes.</p>
	<p pid=".435.3/3">I begin by putting in a nutshell the British position as far as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is concerned. I received a letter from Bemma Donkoh, who is the representative to the UK, reminding me of the UN's current position. In it, she says:</p>
	<p pid=".435.3/4" class="indent">&quot;Under the current circumstances UNHCR's recommendation for States to suspend all removals to Zimbabwe (initially made by UNHCR in March 2002) remains current and valid. I would like to note that on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July 2005</phrase> the EU Parliament passed a Resolution advising EU member states against the return of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".435.3/5">It is interesting that she comments on the first UNHCR decision in March 2002, because that was rather similar to the decision made here to impose a moratorium on the return of asylum seekers to Zimbabwe. I wish to relate the decision to impose a moratorium, and the November 2004 decision to lift the moratorium, to current circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".435.3/6">Rather surprisingly, the Home Secretary did not respond to the growing pressure from the press, interested parties and the world in general to reimpose the moratorium. In a statement, he gave a variety of reasons for not doing so, one of which was:</p>
	<p pid=".435.3/7" class="indent">&quot;The blanket suspension of all removals to any country can only encourage those who seek to get around our controls for reasons nothing whatsoever to do with their political activity or fear of persecution.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June 2005</phrase>; Vol. 435, c. 1023.]</p>
	<p pid=".435.3/8">He did not claim that the situation in Zimbabwe had improved markedly since the moratorium was imposed in 2002, as that would have been patently ridiculous, so he sought to justify the decision to continue to return those whose asylum claims were not successful on the basis that the suspension had been misused and the process abused. I challenge that assertion.</p>
	<p pid=".435.3/9">Rather than announce to the House the lifting of the moratorium, the then Minister for Citizenship and Immigration, who is now the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, released a written statement, in which he said:</p>
	<p pid=".435.3/10" class="indent">&quot;It is clear that the absence of enforced returns increasingly acts as a 'pull factor' for Zimbabweans, and for others posing as Zimbabweans, who do not need international protection but nonetheless make asylum claims confident that even when unsuccessful they will not be forcibly removed. This is a misuse of the asylum system.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-16">16 November 2004</phrase>; Vol. 426, c. 79WS.]</p>
	<p pid=".435.3/11">The two main grounds on which the Home Office relied in lifting the moratorium and keeping it lifted were its pull factor and the fact that the system was being misused. Let us therefore examine those grounds.</p>
	<p pid=".435.3/12">One might expect the pull factor to become evident first in a substantial rise in the number of Zimbabweans claiming asylum during the moratorium. That would be the obvious point to make but, strangely, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June</phrase>, the Home Secretary did not give the House the figures for the number of people applying for asylum during that period. Now, that might have been carelessness&mdash;he might not have picked them up when he left the office&mdash;but I doubt very much whether his officials would not have given them to him. It seems blindingly obvious that someone would take such figures with them when making such a statement, but the Home Secretary did not have them with him.</p>
	<p pid=".435.3/13">I, however, managed to get the figures for the number of people applying for asylum, because I was given them by the Zimbabwe Association, and they have been reproduced in the excellent Library pack for this debate. I subsequently asked the Home Secretary in a written question whether he would confirm the figures that I had, but his answer simply referred me to the Library. Although it took me only five seconds to find the figures, it would have been more helpful all round if the answer had simply included them. It would have been nice to see them in a written answer, but not including them presumably spared someone the embarrassment of having them in <i>Hansard.</i> Let me, however, repeat them.</p>
	<p pid=".435.3/14">In 2002&mdash;the year the moratorium was imposed&mdash;7,655 people from Zimbabwe applied for asylum. In 2003, the figure had become 3,295 and in 2004, it had become 2,050. At first glance, one might say, &quot;Some pull factor!&quot;, because the number of people applying for asylum during that period actually fell. Those figures were confirmed by the asylum statistics in the Home Office statistical bulletin, which was published at the end of November 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".435.3/15">When the Home Secretary was challenged on the figures, he said that he would write to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase>, and he subsequently did so. In his letter, he makes no mention at all of the number of people applying for asylum; instead, he deals with the percentages of claims and how successful they are. In doing so, he indicates that the number of claims accepted at the initial stage and the number of successful appeals had dropped. He says that it is</p>
	<p pid=".435.3/16" class="indent">&quot;notable that during the time that the enforced removal of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe was suspended, the percentage of Zimbabwean asylum applications that were rejected at the initial decision stage increased from 62 per cent. in 2002, 78 per cent. in 2003, to 89 per cent. in the first nine months of 2004.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".435.3/17">The statistics published by the Home Office are not much out of line with those for other asylum seekers at that time. Page 4 of Home Office statistical bulletin says that the statistics show:</p>
	<p pid=".435.3/18" class="indent">&quot;The proportion of initial decisions granting asylum fell in 2003 to 6 per cent. from 10 per cent. in 2002 . . . Correspondingly, overall it is estimated that 28 per cent. of applications in 2003 resulted in grants of asylum . . . This compared with 40 per cent. of applications in 2002&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".435.3/19">Across the board, therefore, it appears that the number of applications and the success rate for Zimbabwean asylum seekers were not much different from, and not out of line with, those of other asylum seekers.</p>
	<p pid=".435.3/20">Again, let us remember the numbers with which we are dealing. By 2004, we were dealing with just over 2,000 asylum applications from Zimbabweans, out of a total of 80,000. The country is hardly being overrun by Zimbabweans looking for protection.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.437.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1396" speakername="Patrick Hall" colnum="437"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h01.htm#50720h01_spnew1">
	<p pid=".437.0/1">Given the acknowledged growing political and economic pressure on people in Zimbabwe, does not the hon. Gentleman think it remarkable that the effects of that pressure are not being felt vis-&agrave;-vis the seeking of asylum in this country, and that the numbers are relatively small and appear to have dropped substantially in recent years?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.437.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" speakername="Alistair Burt" colnum="437"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h01.htm#50720h01_spnew2">
	<p pid=".437.1/1">That is quite extraordinary, but people find other ways to leave countries in these situations. They are certainly encouraged to do so by the decision taken by this country in 2002 to impose a visa requirement, and those leaving Zimbabwe now have to apply for visas to do so. It is hardly credible that someone seeking political asylum will turn up at the high commission in Harare and claim that that is why they want a visa to leave Zimbabwe. It is one way of encouraging the flow to reduce.</p>
	<p pid=".437.1/2">As statistics on the number of people being granted asylum on the first decision show a drop across the piece, perhaps the situation has something to do with the Government's targets. We know that, if the Home Office wants things to happen, occasionally the statistics turn out to prove its case. We are not always certain why, but unfortunately there is enough evidence of concealment in the operation of the Home Office in recent years. I shall not go back over the removals target that led to the building of Yarl's Wood in the first place and how that target was ridiculously optimistic even to officials in the Department, or over the problem of the Czech Romany Gypsies whose visas were prevented from being granted by order from the Home Office, but it seems remarkable that at a time when the Government wanted to appear tough on asylum decisions, the figures for those being granted asylum in the first instance fell. That is not my central point, however. It is that the figures for Zimbabwe seem more or less in line with others.</p>
	<p pid=".437.1/3">Accordingly, let us compare the situation when the moratorium was imposed with the situation in November 2004, when the decision was taken to lift it. What has changed? The situation in Zimbabwe is palpably no better and arguably much worse. The number of people applying for asylum has fallen substantially and the number of decisions being taken about whether, in the first instance, they are good asylum cases shows very little difference from the numbers across the piece. Why, then, was the moratorium lifted? What on earth are the reasons that encourage the Minister and the Home Secretary to persist with the current policy in the face of international opinion, opinion in this country and the opinion of the UNHCR?</p>
	<p pid=".437.1/4">If we go on from <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June</phrase> and consider the events of the following couple of weeks, we find a couple of interesting things. The first is the case of the mystery memo. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-14">14 July</phrase>, a deportation case was, according to the press, thrown into confusion by a Home Office official who said that asylum removals had been stopped. Brought in as evidence&mdash;I have a copy of this in case the Minister has not seen it&mdash;was a memo from the Croydon enforcement unit dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-24">24 June</phrase>. I shall return to the date in a moment. The memo says&mdash;I am interpreting the abbreviations used&mdash;that removal directions for <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-26">26 June</phrase> and escorts are deferred and that the Croydon enforcement unit</p>
	<p pid=".437.1/5" class="indent">&quot;have notified us all Zimbabwean RD's need to be deferred until further notice.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".437.1/6">As I said, that memo was dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-24">24 June</phrase>. The Home Secretary's statement of <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June</phrase>, which stated the policy as we knew it to be and reasserted the policy of no suspension of removals to Zimbabwe, did not mention the memo. So what is this memo? Was it known to the Home Secretary on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June</phrase>? I doubt that very much. Deliberate concealment of such a memo does not strike me as in any way credible, but who issued the memo, and why? What was its status and what is its status? The problem of the date is that it appeared to chime with a rumour that removals would not be encouraged during the G8 summit, because the world's press seeing an emaciated hunger striker in handcuffs being stretchered to an aeroplane to be returned to Zimbabwe was hardly likely to encourage the reputation that the Government seek. However, the Home Office subsequently said that the memo had no effect. I have never received a clear statement from a Minister on its status and what it means. If the Minister does not have a copy to hand, I am more than happy to pass one to him. I also have copies for his officials. Has the memo been countermanded? How was it issued? What on earth did it refer to?</p>
	<p pid=".437.1/7">There are real people behind all the political argument, the rhetoric and the discussions in newspapers and around the world. My constituency case involves detainees who happen to be women, because my constituency contains the detention centre at Yarl's Wood, where some of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1396" name="Patrick Hall">the detainees are women. The hon. Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall)</phrase> and I have visited them. Their stories are sad and, I suspect, no different from those of many others seeking asylum in this country, about whom the Government must take hard decisions.</p>
	<p pid=".437.1/8">I restate that the Opposition understand, as we would, that tough decisions must be taken. We appreciate that in order to conduct an effective asylum policy, some people might be forced to return to countries to which they do not want to return. However, such policy has currency and effect only if it is based on justice and decency. That is patently no longer the case in relation to Zimbabwe, which is why the policy should be suspended and why the things that happen to detainees have a particular poignancy, bearing in mind the country to which they are being returned.</p>
	<p pid=".437.1/9">The number of detainees is falling. I understand, again from the debate pack prepared for us, that 134 were in detention on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-07">7 June</phrase>. That number had fallen to 105 on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-05">5 July</phrase>, and I believe, although the Minister might correct me, that about 60 people are currently detained. That reflects the fact that some detainees have been released on temporary admission, but that more have been released on bail. In other words, the courts are taking the view that it is not particularly wise at the moment to detain people with no prospect of their removal. I am delighted that the courts are taking that view, but it does throw their decision into sharp relief against the authorities' decision to remove people and place them in detention.</p>
	<p pid=".437.1/10">Most women who I come across in Yarl's Wood have not committed offences in this country or failed to comply with any regulations relating to their status, and most have reported regularly under any restrictions placed on them. What happened to them was that one day, when they went to sign on and report, they were lifted by the security services, dispatched to a detention centre, and sometimes given very early decisions on their removal. In some cases, they were not allowed to return home, to collect clothes, or even to speak to friends. That cannot be acceptable for people who have committed no offence and who have been living entirely in accordance with the rules set out by the country to which they have come.</p>
	<p pid=".437.1/11">I make a couple of pleas on behalf of those women. First, I remind the Minister of the concerns that have been expressed about the escort services, which take detainees from the place of their detention to their point of departure. Many detainees do not want to go, so it is a difficult job for the escort services to do. Allegations of mistreatment are not uncommon. There is nothing to protect one side or the other.</p>
	<p pid=".437.1/12">The Home Office has ordered closed circuit television to be introduced in the vehicles that take people to points of departure, but not all the detainees are taken in such vehicles. In the case of Yarl's Wood, many people are transported in private cars. There is usually one detainee&mdash;one woman&mdash;to three guards. There is no CCTV. If allegations of mistreatment are made, there is no independent observation of what might have happened.</p>
	<p pid=".437.1/13">Following an incident at Yarl's Wood that was reported to me, I asked the Minister:</p>
	<p pid=".437.1/14" class="indent">&quot;if he will ensure that no asylum detainee is transported to a port of departure pursuant to a deportation order in a vehicle without CCTV, or the offer of escort by an independent observer&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-04">4 July 2005</phrase>; Vol. 436, c. 116W.]</p>
	<p pid=".437.1/15">That was coupled with another question, which he answered. He did not, however, answer my first, so I asked him again.</p>
	<p pid=".437.1/16">My second plea is to draw attention to the small acts of carelessness that affect the lives of these detainees who, as I said, might have been living absolutely normal lives in this country for several years before being put behind bars. Sometimes they are moved around the detention estate with little or no explanation, and such movement may disrupt bail hearings and relationships with lawyers, friends and supporters.</p>
	<p pid=".437.1/17">I had a case of a woman who was moved from Yarl's Wood to Colnbrook in London for a week, then up to Scotland on the Sunday. As a result, she could not attend her bail hearing, which was scheduled for the following day in Birmingham. I investigated the situation, the Home Office apologised and said that a mistake had been made, and the bail hearing was reinstated for a few days later. Unfortunately, refugee organisations tell me that such instances are not rare. They happen all too frequently to be put down to an administrative mistake.</p>
	<p pid=".437.1/18">I shall not repeat to the Minister the embarrassing conversation that I had with an immigration service official one evening when I was investigating movements around the detention estate. When I asked why a woman was being moved, the reply was, &quot;Reasons? We don't need to give reasons.&quot; That betrays an unacceptable attitude to detainees. The carelessness of the way in which they are treated is wrong. Accordingly, will the Minister do everything in his power to ensure that such attitudes are corrected and people are treated properly? Even if tough decisions have to be made, a degree of respect is necessary for those who, having committed no crime, are under lock and key in our country. We have allowed that situation to continue.</p>

	<p pid=".440.0/1">Although the majority of the women at Yarl's Wood whom we met recently said that they had been there or elsewhere on the estate for about four weeks, we came across people who had been detained for between four and eight months. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it would be in everyone's interest to detain people for much shorter periods?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid=".440.1/1">I agree. The hon. Gentleman has that right. Arrangements cannot always be made to dispatch people within a few days&mdash;that was what Yarl's Wood was first set up for&mdash;but one has to wonder why they are held in detention for a month or longer. I do not understand why they are not allowed to continue their normal business. Perhaps the cases of some of the people who have been in detention for a long time could be reviewed by the Minister. I would be grateful if he would comment on that.</p>

	<p pid=".440.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be a good idea for the Minister to indicate whether we might have joined-up government on this subject, and whether we might have a Home Office and a Foreign Office Minister attend future debates so that MPs who are rightly concerned about the situation of Zimbabweans in Zimbabwe and in Britain can question both parts of the Government? We cannot have a clean look at the issue by pretending that it is just a Home Office matter or by talking only about the pressures that the Government are trying to put on Zimbabwe to get it back on to a better course.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.440.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" speakername="Alistair Burt" colnum="440"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h01.htm#50720h01_spnew6">
	<p pid=".440.3/1">My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. It is perfectly plain that the relationship between the Foreign Office and the Home Office must be close. There must have been discussions between the two Departments. Indeed, there have been rumours in the press that the Home Office and the Foreign Office are not as one in respect of the decision to return people to Zimbabwe. It would be interesting to have both Ministers available for questions at the same time.</p>
	<p pid=".440.3/2">Mr. Bayley, you have been generous in allowing the situation in Zimbabwe to be included in the terms of the debate. It is a fundamental aspect of the decision of the Home Office not to reimpose the moratorium. I hope that the Minister will take note of what my hon. Friend said, and perhaps a joined-up debate might be possible.</p>

	<p pid=".441.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1945" name="Peter Bottomley">the importance of what my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley)</phrase> said is underlined not least by the statement in June by the Home Secretary and by his speech on Second Reading of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill last week? In that speech, he vaguely referred to procedures for monitoring as best as one could the safety of those who are returned to Zimbabwe and other countries with similar problems, but his statement was studious in its ambiguity and lack of specificity.</p>

	<p pid=".441.1/1">I absolutely agree. My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Colleagues will refer to the situation in Zimbabwe and the inadequacy of the monitoring procedure. The issue is the balance of risk. In a sense, that is at the heart of this debate. Where is the risk in the situation, and who bears it?</p>
	<p pid=".441.1/2">The number of people who apply for asylum from Zimbabwe or who have escaped to other countries&mdash;particularly Malawi&mdash;in order to come here to apply for asylum is not terribly high. The risk that the Minister and the Home Office accept in reapplying the moratorium is that the pull factor might be reintroduced. Our argument is that the pull factor is low and it is better for the Government to bear that risk than to return people to Zimbabwe. The risk of damage to those people in Zimbabwe is substantially greater than the risk currently carried by the Government. The absence of an effective monitoring system&mdash;not through any lack of will, but purely through the circumstances pertaining in Zimbabwe&mdash;makes the risk to individuals rather greater than the risk faced by the Government.</p>

	<p pid=".441.2/1">I am pleased that my hon. Friend secured this debate. Does he agree that the mark of a civilised society is an adequately functioning asylum policy and that, all in all, we certainly do not have one at the moment? That is illustrated by a case, of which he is aware, of my constituent, Miss Tande, who has just been instructed that she must make immediate arrangements to leave, even though what I consider to be almost overwhelming evidence has been put forward to demonstrate that she will be at risk if she returns. A former senior assistant commissioner with the Zimbabwean police has said:</p>
	<p pid=".441.2/2" class="indent">&quot;it will be self-deceiving to believe that it is safe for you to return.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.441.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" speakername="Alistair Burt" colnum="441"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h01.htm#50720h01_spnew10">
	<p pid=".441.3/1">My hon. Friend is right to raise that case. As he would suspect, and as many of us here know, it could be replicated a number of times. I know that other colleagues will wish to draw attention to it. The security of our asylum policy depends on both us and the outside world seeing it as just and decent. The problem is that it is being undermined because of the situation in Zimbabwe and the Government's decision. For the asylum policy to be re-established in all our minds as safe and secure, an urgent reappraisal of Zimbabwe is necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".441.3/2">To bring things up to date, as the House will know, a decision was made last Thursday by the Home Office that, pending the resumption of the judicial review hearing by Mr. Justice Collins on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-04">4 August</phrase>, there will be no further removals to Zimbabwe. Although I am grateful for what is obviously a common-sense decision, which would, in any case, have been enforced by the courts&mdash;I cannot see any judicial review of the case of any asylum seeker who is due for removal failing before <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-04">4 August</phrase>&mdash;I think that the move is a grudging one. It is also wrong. It is not for the courts to make a decision about whether it is safe for the Home Office to return people to Zimbabwe; it is for the Home Office, the Foreign Office and the Government to make that decision. It cannot be right for the Government to hide their embarrassment behind the skirts of a judge's cloak before taking decisions on returning people, bound, in every sense of that word, to Harare.</p>
	<p pid=".441.3/3">I ask the Minister to say that he need not wait for the decision on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-04">4 August</phrase> and that he is going to reimpose the moratorium and stop people being returned to Zimbabwe for the period of time that it takes for that country to return to normal. Then, those people we have been visiting, who we know want to return to Zimbabwe, will have the chance to do so. They will be safe. The Government's asylum policy will be safe and perhaps the country's reputation for justice and decency will have been restored after the knock it has taken over the past few weeks.</p>

	<p pid=".442.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase> on securing this Adjournment debate and also on the fantastic speech that he made on the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill. It was one of the best speeches that I have heard in the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid=".442.2/2">I want to carry on from where the hon. Gentleman has left off and first of all challenge the lifting of the moratorium last December. The Foreign Office annual report on human rights, which came out in November 2004, says that the human rights situation in Zimbabwe remains in crisis. There are ongoing violations of human rights, including the stifling of opposition, police abuse, torture and absence of freedom.</p>
	<p pid=".442.2/3">That report came out a month before the moratorium was lifted. It seems to me that the only reason it was lifted is not the situation in Zimbabwe but the Home Office deciding that it needed to get its statistics down. The Zimbabweans have, on the whole, reported diligently when asked to. Some have been reporting weekly&mdash;sometimes daily&mdash;for more than two years. It seems that they were the easiest group to pick off. I hope that the Minister will assure me that that is not the case. What other justification can there be for sending people back to a country that is now in a much worse state than it was even last November when the report stated how bad it was?</p>
	<p pid=".442.2/4">I do not want to repeat all the things that I said in my Adjournment debate in the House following my visit to Zimbabwe, but I will say that it is clearly a much more sinister country than it was even last year. It is a country in which people are fearful about everything. Every aspect of their daily lives is monitored. There are security officers everywhere.</p>
	<p pid=".442.2/5">It is ridiculous to think that we can send people back to Harare on a plane from London and that the Central Intelligence Organisation will not be there waiting to receive not only the deportee but, usually, the Home Office officials who were sent to escort them. The first thing that happens is that the person is detained and questioned. We have evidence of that. The Minister and the Home Secretary talked about needing evidence of people being treated badly after being sent back. I challenge the Minister on how he expects that evidence to be provided.</p>
	<p pid=".442.2/6">The Home Secretary, perhaps intending to talk about all countries, talked about non-governmental organisations being the eyes and ears of the Government. What a shocking thing to say about Zimbabwe. The NGOs are under huge attack. They are terrified that they will be kicked out, and the idea that they are going to go round finding out what is happening to individual detainees who have been deported and then report back to the British high commission is nonsensical.</p>
	<p pid=".442.2/7">It is nonsense to think that an asylum seeker who has been sent back, beaten up, tortured and perhaps left to die&mdash;as some have been&mdash;will get up, dust themselves down and trot off to the British high commission to say, &quot;Oh, British high commissioner, I've been badly treated and you sent me back.&quot; I do not believe that the intelligent officials in the Home Office believe that that will happen. We must put a stop to the deportations.</p>
	<p pid=".442.2/8">I have never been a great fan of lawyers, but, after the last three or four weeks, I must say, &quot;Thank goodness for lawyers in this country&quot;. I will not use the word &quot;brave&quot;, but we have had some forthright lawyers who have tackled the issue head on. Yes, politicians who make representations about particular Zimbabweans get listened to. We occasionally manage to stop someone being deported, but in the end it is the courts that have stopped it happening and forced the Home Office to stop deportations until <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-04">4 August</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".442.2/9">I tell the Minister that, even if something goes wrong in the court case on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-04">4 August</phrase> and a permanent stop is not put on deportations, every single asylum seeker who is to be deported to Zimbabwe will be fought over tooth and nail in the courts. How much has been spent in the last month on the ridiculous attempts by the Home Office to send their senior officials to court to try to force people to be sent back to Zimbabwe, when they must have known that there was evidence that would stop those deportations?</p>

	<p pid=".443.0/1">I strongly agree with what the hon. Lady is saying. Does she agree that even if the NGOs in Zimbabwe were not terrified and could gather and transmit information, it would not be their responsibility to do so? Is it not the responsibility of Governments that remove people to ensure that they are safe where they have been removed to? It is a classic case of buck-passing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.444.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" speakername="Kate Hoey" colnum="444"  time="09:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h01.htm#50720h01_spnew15">
	<p pid=".444.0/1">I absolutely agree with the hon. Gentleman. Of course, he visited Zimbabwe the year before last and knows quite a lot about what is going on. I remind hon. Members that the Prime Minister last week talked about &quot;the abhorrence&quot; that we feel for what is happening in Zimbabwe. Who is speaking for the Government? Which part of Government is making the policy? The Prime Minister clearly feels that the situation is abhorrent, and yet somehow people continue to be sent back.</p>
	<p pid=".444.0/2">I want to raise the case of Naison Sani, who is being deported to Malawi tonight. He is a Zimbabwean, and that is another complicated issue. The Home Office refuses to listen. Many people, including Crispen Kulinji, did not travel here on a Zimbabwean passport. The only way in which this young man, Naison Sani, could get out of the country was on a Malawian passport. He is being deported tonight and has not had proper legal advice. The Minister will get a legal representation later today, and I ask him now to stop that deportation and to look separately at the question of people travelling on Malawian passports. They are Zimbabwean&mdash;the Home Office knows that. In cases such as that of Crispen Kulinji, the Home Office knows that they have been tortured; it still sends them back to Malawi.</p>
	<p pid=".444.0/3">I want to raise how we treat people in detention. I have visited Harmondsworth twice in the past three weeks. The second time was on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase>, late in the afternoon, when I went to see two of the asylum seekers who had been on hunger strike for some time, Timbha Mqhubeli and Harris Nyatsanza. Both were in the medical wing and in a weak condition, particularly Timbha, who had been on hunger strike for nearly a month. He was very weak indeed. I said to the person in charge, &quot;Why has he not been taken to hospital?&quot; They said, &quot;Oh, well, our doctor comes in every now and again&quot;&mdash;I think that that was the phrase he used&mdash;&quot;and at some stage he will say he should be taken to hospital.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".444.0/4">We went back that night and got permission from the two of them to say that they wanted to see an independent doctor. Frank Arnold went in the next morning, saw them and immediately said that they should both be in hospital. The immigration department still refused to send them, and they had to go to court to get a ruling. That afternoon, at the last minute, while they were in court&mdash;presumably while the Home Office was still paying huge costs&mdash;the department agreed that Timbha could go to hospital that evening. Harris's case had to go back to court the next morning, and in the meantime the Home Office agreed that he, too, could go to hospital.</p>
	<p pid=".444.0/5">Timbha was sent across London in an ambulance, handcuffed the whole time, with three people guarding him. He arrived at the hospital, where, one of his Zimbabwean friends called to tell me, he continued to be handcuffed in bed. I phoned the detention centre at Harmondsworth and the man who answered said that they would look again at the security advice. He rang me back 10 minutes later and said, &quot;We have looked at the security advice; we can take the handcuffs off and remove one of the wardens.&quot; Two wardens remained.</p>
	<p pid=".444.0/6">The next morning the two wardens said that they had been told to sit at the foot of the bed and watch everything that that young man did. He could not do anything anyway&mdash;the idea that he was going to abscond! The doctor is making a formal report, because the detention centre manager had insisted that the patient be handcuffed in the ambulance and stay so after the delivery to hospital. That is despite the fact that the detention centre rules state:</p>
	<p pid=".444.0/7" class="indent">&quot;The purpose of handcuffing detainees is to reduce the risk of . . . absconding&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".444.0/8">as well as a list of other things. They also state that handcuffs should not be used</p>
	<p pid=".444.0/9" class="indent">&quot;On detainees attending for medical treatment if the detainee's medical condition renders handcuffs inappropriate&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".444.0/10">and</p>
	<p pid=".444.0/11" class="indent">&quot;When a doctor so recommends on health grounds.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".444.0/12">A doctor had done so, and when he contacted the centre manager he was told that it was because the recommendation had not been made by the centre doctor. However, the first doctor had tried to get hold of the centre doctor.</p>
	<p pid=".444.0/13">I know that I have gone into detail on one particular case, but my experience in dealing with these cases over the past three or four weeks has shown the shocking state of what is going on in detention centres. I urge whoever chairs the Home Affairs Committee&mdash;I cannot remember who it is&mdash;to suggest an inquiry into detention centres. These are huge issues that affect all asylum seekers, not just those from Zimbabwe.</p>

	<p pid=".445.1/1">Yes, all of us who have been involved in this matter will be writing to my right hon. Friend. Terrible things are going on in our detention centres. Zimbabwe is a special case; we have a particular responsibility for what is happening there and we have not done nearly enough.</p>
	<p pid=".445.1/2">Last week, New Zealand announced that all Zimbabweans who had managed to get to New Zealand would be allowed to stay. We are a much bigger country than New Zealand in terms of our economic power; if they can do it why cannot we? Every Zimbabwean I have met has been well educated and is capable of working and contributing to our economy&mdash;Timbha and Harris were teachers. They all want to go back to Zimbabwe but, because of the situation there and because they have been in detention here and the British Government are sending them back, they all risk being &quot;lifted&quot; when they arrive, whatever the Home Office says. If the Home Office says that it wants evidence of that, it means that it wants to see a dead body. I find that shocking, and I hope that this debate will highlight what is happening in Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid=".445.1/3">I plead with the Minister not simply to go along with the officials and the statistics, but to stand up, ask that the moratorium be reinstated and treat these people with the dignity and decency that they deserve.</p>

	<p pid=".446.0/1">I will do my best to cut what I have to say so that I keep as near to five minutes as is possible, which will be difficult.</p>
	<p pid=".446.0/2">I congratulate my geographical constituency neighb<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">our, the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase>, on securing the debate and on the measured way in which he presented his case. I visited Yarl's Wood twice recently on 8 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-15">15 July</phrase> to meet the Zimbabwean female detainees who were due for removal, some of whom were on hunger strike. I met 16 women and formed a definite view that some of them were very politically aware. They were able to answer our questions from all sorts of angles and could only have come to that position, and developed that political awareness, by being politically active. Their fears of reprisals on return to Zimbabwe seemed to be reasonable.</p>
	<p pid=".446.0/3">There is no doubt that conditions in Zimbabwe are appalling and deteriorating. There is a rapidly growing danger for anyone who is, or is suspected of being, a critic of the regime and its leader. I have information from Zimbabweans living in Zimbabwe now who recently visited Britain for family reasons and whom I have met through mutual friends. These Zimbabweans are white, middle-class professionals who have never been politically active in Zimbabwe and are not members of any political party. For obvious reasons, I will not identify them, but I thank them for allowing me to refer to their views. I should like to have cited some of their experiences of day-to-day life, but I will not have time to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".446.0/4">In a nutshell, those people described a situation in which hundreds of thousands of people in Zimbabwe are at risk&mdash;that includes anyone speaking out against the regime, members of trade unions, members of NGOs, political opposition party members, of course, and groups concerned about the mass starvation, mass unemployment, house clearances and farm invasions. The risk is of death threats, of physical intimidation, including murder, of poisoning and harassment of all kinds. Telephone and e-mail tapping is the norm. People are followed by agents and others and subjected to repeat prosecutions for minor and bogus offences, such as blocking the pavement. They are held at road blocks and police stations by the police, the army, war veterans or ZANU-PF youth militia. The people I met cited examples of day-to-day harassment, which perhaps I shall be able to explain to the House on another occasion.</p>
	<p pid=".446.0/5">My friends&mdash;I do call them that&mdash;are clear about the risks that returned failed asylum seekers face. Whether or not those individuals were political activists, the very fact of them having sought asylum from the regime is seen as bad enough in the eyes of that regime; having sought asylum in Britain, of all places, is even worse. Anyone seeking asylum from Zimbabwe in white colonial Britain will be judged a traitor and deemed guilty, so the enforced returnees are regarded as political enemies by ZANU-PF. Of that my contacts have no doubt.</p>
	<p pid=".446.0/6">My contacts believe that returned detainees are routinely targeted. If they return to Harare on their own they are targeted at the airport by the Central Intelligence Organisation and are likely to be tortured, beaten up, held and dumped somewhere miles away, perhaps some days later. If they are met by large numbers of family and friends they will be targeted later, unless they go into hiding. Their families will be punished, especially if they live in rural areas where control by chiefs is strong.</p>
	<p pid=".446.0/7">Actions against them can result in losing the ability to buy food from the grain marketing board or losing access to the politically motivated food distribution system that operates in Zimbabwe. Children can be excluded from school as a punishment and Government employees can lose their jobs, be demoted or moved far from their homes at great personal inconvenience.</p>
	<p pid=".446.0/8">Of course, among asylum seekers from anywhere&mdash;including Zimbabwe&mdash;a proportion will be economic, rather than truly political in their motivation. However, surely the question before us is whether, whatever a person's reason for coming to the United Kingdom, it can, in all reason, be judged safe for any failed asylum seeker to be returned. The situation in Zimbabwe is well understood, and I do not understand how the return of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe, which is current Government policy, squares with what they themselves acknowledge. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary recently spoke in a statement about understanding the nature of the Mugabe regime, the abuses of human rights, the political persecution, and the denial of basic freedoms across the board, yet the Government still insist that it is safe to return failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid=".446.0/9">I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to think again. In his statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June</phrase>, the Home Secretary said, among other things, that there were</p>
	<p pid=".446.0/10" class="indent">&quot;no substantiated reports of mistreatment on return&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".446.0/11">that the Government would keep</p>
	<p pid=".446.0/12" class="indent">&quot;in close contact with civil society and opposition parties in Zimbabwe&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June 2005</phrase>; Vol. 435, c. 1023.],</p>
	<p pid=".446.0/13">and that a detailed review of the situation in Zimbabwe is taking place in the Government here.</p>
	<p pid=".446.0/14">On the first point, I agree that it is very difficult to obtain such evidence. Yesterday I spoke on the telephone to a Zimbabwean Member of Parliament who told me that no information is made available in Zimbabwe about failed asylum seekers being returned from the UK. Therefore, what happens to them cannot be measured. It is not reported.</p>
	<p pid=".446.0/15">However, the CIO has several offices at the airport in Harare. That organisation in the rest of the country takes part in and incites beatings and torture, and the dumping of people out in the bush. That is how it behaves. If it has officers at the airport. What must we think they are doing there? They threaten families and make people think carefully about complaining about what is done to them. Those people are more likely to go into hiding and keep quiet.</p>
	<p pid=".446.0/16">As a result of the way in which the regime operates, the definitive proof of ill treatment that the Government seek is unlikely to be obtained. However, I contend that on the balance of probabilities, returnees are highly likely to be at risk. Where does my hon. Friend think that the balance of probabilities lies? Where is his evidence that it is safe to return anyone to Zimbabwe?</p>
	<p pid=".446.0/17">As to the Home Secretary's other two points, what picture is the Minister receiving from people on the ground in Zimbabwe? Given the grave urgency of the situation there and the situation facing people in detention here, when will the detailed review referred to by the Home Secretary be completed? The parliamentary recess begins this week. When will the House have the opportunity to debate the outcome of the review and its consequences? Zimbabwe is on the brink of utter disaster. I urge the British Government to do the right thing and cease enforced removal to Zimbabwe until further notice.</p>

	<p pid=".448.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase> on securing the debate. It is invidious to pick out individuals, but I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" name="Kate Hoey">the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase> not only on keeping the subject at the top of the agenda but on speaking so powerfully about it. We have to be aware that Home Office Ministers have been under almost unprecedented pressure, and that must filter down to their officials. Perhaps the toughness of life in the Home Office over the past few weeks explains the inability to adjust to the emerging facts. As hon. Members said, it is not easy to run an asylum system in which there must be a balance between controlling economic migrants and people's desires to better their lives with the popular wish within this country for strict controls and asylum being given strictly to those most in need. It is not easy.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/2">However, it is not denied that children are being deliberately bulldozed to death in Zimbabwe as a matter of Government policy. The Prime Minister recognises that the situation is abhorrent, and at the end of June the Home Secretary said:</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/3" class="indent">&quot;There is no doubt that political persecution, abuses of human rights and denial of basic freedom persist in Zimbabwe&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June 2005</phrase>; Vol. 435, c. 1024.]</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/4">He then went on to say that we are going to carry on sending people back there. It is not possible to align those statements and come to a conclusion.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/5">On the train this morning, a senior business man said to me, &quot;What is going to happen? Surely nobody is suggesting that we should send people back to Zimbabwe. Not now, as things are deteriorating all the time.&quot; I said that yes, that is the case, and a Minister will, under a lot of pressure, tell us why it is acceptable to send people back to a blood-stained tyrant such as Mugabe, in the full flood of his abuse of power. That is the invidious job that someone will have this morning.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/6">It is all about the balance of risk. That is why I asked the Home Secretary to reverse the evidential test. That test should not be for people to show that they are coming to harm, but for the Government to show that people will not come to harm. That is the nub of what we are discussing today, about which hon. Members from all parties feel so passionately. We hope that there will be a change of heart, if not in today's debate, then as part of the process by which the Government recognise the situation and change their tack.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/7">I should like to raise the case of Ashleigh McMaster, the daughter of a constituent of mine. Gary McMaster's farm in Zimbabwe was confiscated and he was branded an enemy of the state. His daughter applied to university and was told that she would have to join the National Youth Service before she would be allowed to go. The level of abuse within that service, including allegations of rape and other atrocities, is well known so, understandably, she did not wish to go into it. Mr. McMaster flew to Zimbabwe to try to get his daughter out, and was forced to use bribes to obtain a passport to get her into this country. That was two years ago. She is now 19, and is a bright young woman, but is in a highly nervous state. Her first application to remain was turned down, so she went to the adjudicator, who said:</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/8" class="indent">&quot;I have concluded from the objective evidence that there is a real risk, irrespective of whether the Appellant applies for further education, of the Appellant being forcibly recruited into the National Youth Service and thereby of course subjected to gross cruelty, rape and beatings&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/9">That was the adjudicator's decision, which was then overturned on appeal by the Home Office. Gary and his daughter will be coming to Parliament later today, and I am grateful to the Minister, who has agreed to speak to me, when we can grab a moment, to discuss her case.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/10">The recent death of the former Prime Minister, Edward Heath, raises an interesting reminder of one of the most distinguished acts of his political career. When the Ugandan Asians were being afflicted by Idi Amin, he took the politically unpalatable and difficult decision to admit them here, as was right and proper to do in the proud traditions of this country. Those traditions will be best served by the Government and the Minister having a change of heart, and refusing to allow anyone to be returned to Zimbabwe at the moment.</p>

	<p pid=".449.0/1">I start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase> on his clear and reasoned statement describing both the current situation and a possible way forward.</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/2">Back in January 2002, deportation was suspended owing to unrest in Zimbabwe. I say to the Government that I am really haunted by the unanswered question of what difference between the situation then and in November last year could possibly justify the recommencement of returns. That is just as true of the period since November. Surely no one could describe the situation in Zimbabwe as having improved.</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/3">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" name="Kate Hoey">the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase> on raising these issues in such a timely way. Her points were well argued and related to the situation of the people, as well as the mechanisms that are failing so badly. In an Adjournment debate on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June</phrase>, she gave a harrowing description of her recent visit: the destruction of homes, businesses and the economy, the continued abuse of power and the escalation of brutal activities. That is the background to today's debate.</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/4">I shall refer to a particular case throughout the debate, while making some general points. The case is that of Tendai Williard Chinhanhu, who I shall refer to as Williard. Until last week, he was in Harmondsworth detention centre, where he had been since February 2004&mdash;a considerable time to be held somewhere when no crime has been committed.</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/5">I see two strands to Williard's case. I find it difficult to understand why he was not granted asylum seeker status in the first place. When I read the statement made by the Home Secretary in the House, I found it quite reassuring:</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/6" class="indent">&quot;In particular, members of the opposition in Zimbabwe or others who establish that they have engaged in activities that will cause them to be persecuted by the Zimbabwean Government will continue to be granted asylum.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June 2005</phrase>; Vol. 435, c. 1023.]</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/7">Why were some of these people not granted asylum? Did they have adequate legal representation?</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/8">We then come to deportation. The hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire demolished the pull factor argument that everyone would come flooding in if we had a blanket suspension of all removals. We must not get distracted by that type of argument.</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/9">To return to the case of Williard, interestingly, he is a runner and might have become an Olympic champion in other circumstances. He met members of the Movement for Democratic Change when he was running in other countries, such as Holland and Germany. He agreed actively to oppose Mugabe and began organising help to evacuate families from farms around Harare. He explains:</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Mugabe's men would come and destroy these farms and they would be carrying guns, while we were only armed with sticks and bows and arrows . . . I saw some families killed, men and women, some of them had even been decapitated . . . They destroyed my house, burning everything and harassed my lodger. I went to the police but they refused to do anything&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/11">Williard went to his father's house&mdash;his father was eventually killed&mdash;and then he fled to London. He has spent some time in my constituency while in the country, and was an active and supportive member of Poole Runners until his detention. In one of his statements, he says:</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/12" class="indent">&quot;All I know is I cannot go back because I will not be safe. They will be waiting for me at the airport and I will disappear.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/13">I cannot express the situation any better than that, which is why I am using this individual case.</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/14">At the time of the election we all became aware of the heightened sensitivity surrounding asylum and immigration. The negative campaigning had an impact. I come from an area where there are relatively few asylum seekers, but it was a huge issue on the doorstep, perhaps because people did not have day-to-day meetings with asylum seekers. I was proud to stand on the doorstep and say that this country has a wonderful reputation for taking in persecuted people and looking after them. It is a proud tradition that we should continue and pass on to young people, and, yes, we should also sort out all the administrative problems facing the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/15">Not surprisingly, I have received a lot of representations about this very popular runner, several from young people. I want to convey an idea of the effect that the Government's action is having on the attitudes and beliefs of the next generation. A 15-year-old told me that until now he did not believe that in a modern country people could be sent to their death bed. Another writes:</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/16" class="indent">&quot;I am writing to you because of Williard Chinhanhu and I am in fear of his life. I do not want him to be sent back to Zimbabwe because there is a possibility that he will not make it there for very long.</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/17" class="indent">If there is absolutely anything I can do to help stop William from being deported I would do it. I may only be 14 and there isn't much a 14 year old can do, but I want to try.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/18">A 13-year-old writes:</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/19" class="indent">&quot;I don't believe that Williard will be safe if he has to return to Zimbabwe. His family have been killed and because of the current situation in Zimbabwe and the fact that he is opposed to Robert Mugabe's regime and was a member of the Movement for Democratic Change, I think his life will be in danger if he returns.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/20">I have received many comments from adults, but those from youngsters are the most moving. They show what our country is about; they show its future.</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/21">I ask the Minister what evaluation has been made of the deteriorating situation. What is preventing the Government from realising that the current policy is inappropriate? Why are we relying on the courts? We are told that individual cases are being looked at, but in how many have the Government decided to defer deportation? Does the Minister acknowledge that there are some failed asylum seekers in this country who, if returned, could face persecution for the simple reason that they applied for asylum from a regime that would not consider their rights if returned? I repeat an earlier question: what monitoring is taking place so that the Government can say, hand on heart, &quot;Of course it is safe to be returned&quot;? Surely it is not safe.</p>
	<p pid=".449.0/22">Another telling point was made. What message are we giving to Mugabe and his regime if we say that it is perfectly safe to return there? I find that incredible. On behalf of my former constituent&mdash;I know that he is staying somewhere else and dutifully reporting in at the moment&mdash;and all the other Zimbabweans in this country, I call on the Government not to wait for the court's decision, but to reintroduce the suspension of the deportations as soon as is practical.</p>

	<p pid=".451.0/1">I join others in saying that this has been an excellent debate. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase> not just on the way he has spoken today, but on his truly outstanding speech on the Second Reading of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill a couple of weeks ago. I am grateful to all who have spoken today, particularly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1396" name="Patrick Hall">the hon. Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".451.0/2">It was about 14 years ago that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" name="Kate Hoey">the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase> and I were on a parliamentary delegation to Zimbabwe. I came back from that visit optimistic and hopeful; I thought that Zimbabwe had a great future, although there were obviously worries. Those worries have increased over the years. We are grateful to the hon. Lady for her comments today. For many years she has taken an interest in Zimbabwe and the House owes her a debt of gratitude for her work and commitment. As I said, I was a little worried when I returned from Zimbabwe 14 years ago, but I am much more worried today. The whole House is worried. I cannot find an hon. Member who is not concerned about the position in Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid=".451.0/3">During the past few weeks many of us have written to the Foreign Secretary following representations from constituents. The reply stated:</p>
	<p pid=".451.0/4" class="indent">&quot;We are fully aware of the appalling situation in Zimbabwe and share&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".451.0/5">your constituent's</p>
	<p pid=".451.0/6" class="indent">&quot;concerns. The latest crackdown by the authorities . . . is an outrage. It has led to over 30,000 arrests and the wanton destruction of thousands of homes affecting over 200,000 people, many of whom are left homeless. However, this is typical of the actions of a regime that for five years has pursued disastrous policies backed by brutality and intimidation resulting in a broken economy, food shortages and enormous suffering.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".452.0/1">Just to add to the hon. Gentleman's point about the house and shelter clearances, my sources have told me that that policy is moving into the affluent suburbs, where officials are harassing people about, and removing, garages, garden sheds and satellite dishes. It is all part of turning the screw on people and putting them under pressure.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.452.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1933" speakername="Humfrey Malins" colnum="452"  time="10:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h01.htm#50720h01_spnew23">
	<p pid=".452.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. My understanding of what is happening is exactly as he portrayed it. Yet there is a sense of helplessness in the House. What can we do to change Zimbabwe's awful regime? I believe&mdash;I think I speak for many of us&mdash;that it must be confronted head on. I hope that the EU can take tougher action and impose tougher sanctions, perhaps widening them to freeze the assets of those who bankroll Mugabe. The Government could consider taking the Zimbabwean Government to the United Nations Security Council and proposing a resolution to send UN observers to Zimbabwe to monitor not just food distribution, for example, but returned asylum seekers. There is a need for us in this Parliament and the Government to become even more involved in trying to improve matters there.</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/2">As some colleagues mentioned this morning, many asylum seekers from Zimbabwe have come here over the years. Some 15,000 came between 2001 and 2004, although the number has fallen this year. We are all interested in the fate of failed asylum seekers who have been returned to Zimbabwe. We know that some 95 were returned between January and March this year. Looking back at the number of applications from Zimbabwe for asylum in this country over the past five years, it is plain that many were refused. It is also plain that a huge proportion of those who failed in their claims were not removed from this country and must still be here. One of our concerns should be their distress and worry about the present uncertain policy and about what might happen to them in the middle of the night if an official chose to lift them and remove them.</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/3">The 95 who have been removed in the past few months are of great concern to us all, and I hope that the Minister will go into detail about his knowledge of what has happened to them and to others who were removed from this country earlier. Is he aware of any cases in which a failed asylum seeker has returned to Zimbabwe to face death, torture or other brutality?</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/4">That brings me to monitoring&mdash;having people on the ground in Zimbabwe to find out what is going on and, in particular, what may be happening to some of the failed asylum seekers who have been returned&mdash;and how the Government get their information. We know about the regular country reports that are produced. Some of us over the years have wondered about the standard of those reports, but we know that the report in April about Zimbabwe documented serious human rights abuses, and that the position has got much worse since then.</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/5">The hon. Member for Bedford referred to the campaign that has been going on for a while in Zimbabwe, which I think translates as &quot;drive out the rubbish&quot;. It has involved forced evictions, terrible destruction and a motivation that many of us believe to be extremely suspect. The motivation is political and not, as Mr. Mugabe would have it, the restoration of sanity and order in urban and other areas through a cleaning-up campaign. We do not think that is what it is at all.</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/6">Others have referred to the numbers affected by that appalling campaign. According to the Department for International Development, a third of a million people were affected. However, the hon. Member for Vauxhall said to the House that up to 1 million people may have been displaced.</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/7">We had a no-removals policy. I remember very well when it was introduced. At the beginning of 2002, the then Home Secretary, now the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, introduced the policy of not returning failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe. I was part of the shadow Home Affairs team then, and I remember that in discussions with him, he approached the matter sensitively and properly.</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/8">Incidentally, I say to the Minister that the Government have approached the matter sensitively, and there is more unity than political division between us in the sense that I hope to goodness that we are all seeking the same ends. We supported the no-removals policy, but we were concerned when it was withdrawn at the end of 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/9">There are several examples of no-returns in our asylum system and removals policies over the past few years. I checked the records to find that, over the past seven or eight years, we have had a no-returns policy for a period in relation to at least a dozen countries, including, interestingly enough, Turkey, from July 1999 to December 2000. It is true that our Government have from time to time said to themselves that a policy change is needed, and that we shall have a no-returns policy. Changing the position back at the end of 2004 might, as was said earlier, have been thought odd, given that the situation in Zimbabwe hardly got better during that period.</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/10">The Home Secretary said last month that he had considered whether to reinstate the suspension of forced removals to Zimbabwe, but had concluded that there were insufficient grounds to do so. By then the position was getting acute, but the Home Secretary said:</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/11" class="indent">&quot;The blanket suspension of all removals to any country can only encourage those who seek to get around controls for reasons nothing whatsoever to do with their political activity or fear of persecution.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June 2005</phrase>; Vol. 435, c. 1023.]</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/12">I do not think that over the years the Government have routinely monitored the treatment of those who have been returned. I recall, as the House will, the exchange in the other place between Baroness D'Souza and Baroness Scotland of Asthal about substantiated or unsubstantiated reports of ill treatment of individuals. I understand that the Refugee Legal Centre, among others, has evidence of the systematic abuse and torture of returned failed asylum seekers.</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/13">The level of concern has increased enormously in all parties over the past few weeks. Even now, there are large numbers of detainees on hunger strike. There are 70 or more applications before the High Court from people who are fighting removal. Only a few days ago, Mr. Justice Collins urged the Home Secretary to halt removals to Zimbabwe, pending the full hearing on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-04">4 August</phrase>. Following a case only a day or two ago, the Home Office decided to suspend forced removals to Zimbabwe until after <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-04">4 August</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/14">I conclude with a few questions to the Minister. Do any other European countries have a no-returns policy? Can he tell us a little more about how the Zimbabwe issue affects asylum seekers in other European countries? Do those countries have many applicants from Zimbabwe? What do they do with failed applicants? Do they send them back? Is the Minister in discussion with any European Governments on what they are doing as regards a no-returns policy? Can he please try very hard to set up a system for monitoring failed asylum seekers who have been returned to Zimbabwe? We need genuine information about the burdens and the brutality that they may face. Monitoring is a very important policy, because we just do not know what is happening to some people, although we fear the worst. Will the Minister please now reinstate the no-removals policy and not just leave us in limbo?</p>

	<p pid=".454.0/1">Before I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase>, I caution <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1933" name="Humfrey Malins">the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins)</phrase>, who speaks for the Opposition. There are no hunger strikes at the moment and there is no uncertainty about policy&mdash;a point that relates partly to the purpose of the debate. Clearly, many hon. Members want to change policy, but, with the greatest respect, I would not go around confusing things or throwing into the pot things that simply are not facts.</p>
	<p pid=".454.0/2">I congratulate the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire not only on securing the debate&mdash;that is customary&mdash;but on the nature of his contribution. These are emotive and sensitive issues, and I thank him for his kind words about my officials and others. Without wanting to make this a mutual back-slapping event, let me return the compliment by commending him on his courtesy and respect for those involved, who are doing such difficult work. I may contradict those remarks shortly, but I make them with the best of intentions.</p>
	<p pid=".454.0/3">This is, and will continue to be, a very emotive and sensitive matter. I know entirely where the UNHCR stands on it, and it has made that very clear. It is entirely fair to put that in the public domain. I hope to come on to some of the generalities of our policy, but the time that I have might be better spent focusing first on some of the serious matters raised by individual hon. Members, in particular the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire.</p>
	<p pid=".454.0/4">The hon. Gentleman talked about escort services. He said that people were being escorted in vehicles, such as vans and cars, that were not equipped with CCTV, and I shall ensure that that ends. Indeed, I believe that it is ending and that the one contractor that still operates in that way is getting CCTV fitted. However, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman under separate cover to ensure that CCTV prevails and that it is the norm throughout all cases involving escorts. All the main contractors' vehicles are certainly equipped with CCTV, but, as he says, there are occasions when that is not the case.</p>
	<p pid=".454.0/5">I do not agree that we can go from admitting that there have been mistakes and careless acts within the detention estate to a broader, blanket condemnation of all that goes on in it. Detention is a key element of any asylum process. I profoundly disagree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" name="Andrew Tyrie">the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)</phrase>, who gaily slipped in, condemned our entire uncivilised asylum system and all who work in it, and then left. Although there are serious&mdash;almost life and death&mdash;issues to be addressed, they are not sufficient for any Member of this House to condemn the entire system and all who work in it because of errors or because they do not agree with a particular aspect of what we are doing. That is to malign public servants in a way that is beneath any Member of the House. I seriously traduce it.</p>
	<p pid=".454.0/6">The impression was given that maltreatment is the norm in our detention state, but that is not the case. I would cheerfully welcome a detailed consideration of our detention state by the Home Affairs Committee. Many dedicated, professional and committed people do difficult jobs, and it is not sufficient for any Member of the House to malign them on the back of one, two or more particular cases, however emotive.</p>

	<p pid=".455.1/1">No, I will not. <i>[Interruption.] </i>I will come to my hon. Friend's points in a moment and may give way then, but I will not have the entire estate and the entire civil service body working within it maligned for some mistakes, carelessness, and&mdash;we have investigated this before&mdash;attitudes to asylum seekers.</p>
	<p pid=".455.1/2">Although it is a truism, I cheerfully state that people in our detention estate have committed no crimes. They are in detention for specific reasons, such as the fear that they will abscond, as a prelude to their removal, or because decisions on their cases will be made quickly. That is part of the system. They have committed no crimes, and are entitled to, and overwhelmingly receive, civilised and decent treatment. That is certainly the case in the parts of the estate that I have visited. Over the summer, I shall visit the rest of it. I happily undertake to raise with relevant officials whatever carelessness, mistakes and attitudinal matters need correction, but I suspect that they are limited and rare, rather than the norm, as has been suggested.</p>
	<p pid=".455.1/3">The hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire asked about a missing memo. I say quite frankly that I have not seen it. I believe that it was generated from a local level. There has been no change in policy&mdash;I can say that with some integrity as I have been party to these matters throughout. In the first instance, some removals were deferred post-<phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June</phrase>, because we undertook to put in the final check specifically for Zimbabwe. The notion that removals were suspended for any specific reason, such as the G8 or any embarrassment that might be caused, simply is not the case.</p>

	<p pid=".456.0/1">I will leave a copy of the memo with the Minister. Will he write to me on whether there has been any inquiry into how that situation arose? I take his point that the policy had not changed at the time, but the memo obviously came from the Home Office, and clearly states:</p>
	<p pid=".456.0/2" class="indent">&quot;all Zimbabwean RD's need to be deferred until further notice.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".456.0/3">How did it get written, and who sent it? We now know that it has no status, but the Minister cannot be happy that that sort of thing goes flying around in his name.</p>

	<p pid=".456.1/1">I certainly shall deal with that in a letter because it is not the case. That sort of decision would have been taken by me or the Home Secretary, and it was not. I shall explore the matter outside our deliberations and I reiterate that there was no blanket suspension before or after G8 or any other event to save embarrassment or otherwise.</p>
	<p pid=".456.1/2">The hon. Gentleman asked for a debate on this subject with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in attendance, but if a Minister from the FCO were also here, he would hear the same refrain. The rumours in the press are just that: rumours in the press. I do not know what happened to it, but there was an innovation whereby three, four or five Ministers lined up to answer questions and hold mini-debates with a thematic approach in this place rather than in the main Chamber. I do not know whether we still do that, but, again, I would welcome such a development.</p>
	<p pid=".456.1/3">As I said, we are not hiding behind the skirts of a judge's cloak because of our embarrassment. The hon. Gentleman knows that. This is what today's debate is about; our policy on enforced returns has not changed, but we respect the judiciary's position as set out in comments made by two judges, Collins and Ouseley, on enforced returns, and we will not force failed asylum seekers to return to Zimbabwe before the hearing on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-04">4 August</phrase>, at which we, and I am sure everyone else, hope for some clarity at the very least. Hon. Members will know, however, that failed asylum seekers continue to return voluntarily to Zimbabwe, and that there are voluntary and enforced returns among those on the non-failed asylum seeker route. I place that on the record for the sake of balance.</p>
	<p pid=".456.1/4">We were asked why we had taken the decision now when we said that the policy had not changed after Mr. Justice Collins's comments. We took our decision to respect the judiciary's position as set out in comments made by both judges. It was said that the judges were about to impose a suspension anyway. In a blanket sense, they were not about to do so. I suspect, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" name="Kate Hoey">my hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase> intimated several times, that a range of people would suspend legal and other activities by stealth until <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-04">4 August</phrase>, which is entirely a matter for them. I intend to give way to my hon. Friend in a moment so that she can say something about that.</p>
	<p pid=".456.1/5">We start from the premise that the asylum policy and returns must be based on the concerns, circumstances and all the other elements that relate to an individual rather than the collective.</p>

	<p pid=".457.3/2">My hon. Friend suggested that our policy is all about statistics and picking off easy targets in an attempt to secure Government policy. That is fundamentally not the case, and I assure her that no one will be returned to Zimbabwe or anywhere else on my watch simply for the governmental convenience of achieving a target.

	<p pid=".457.7/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall mentioned the case involving the use of Malawian passports. I have not had any representations about that. I understand that there will be no removals tonight, but I do need to see representations. It remains the policy that the focus is on the individual and that individual representations are judged on their merits. That is the most appropriate way to protect not only those who would be at risk, but the overall integrity of the asylum system.</p>

	Football-Related Violence
</major-heading>

	<p pid=".458.1/1">It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair in this Chamber, Mr. Bayley. I chose the title of the debate very carefully. I should put down a marker: I love football; along with politics it is perhaps one of my great loves. I am a patron of AFC Telford United, and I am very proud of the club and its traditions. It went out of business just over a year ago and has been taken over by a supporters' trust, which is doing fantastic work in the local community. The club sits in the constituency neighb<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">ouring mine, that of the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase>, but as I said I am proud to be a patron.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/2">I shall focus on two themes in the debate. The first is the general issue of football-related violence and the second is an incident concerning one of my constituents, Mr. Jamie Turner, and problems that he encountered at a football match he attended in Southampton earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/3">We all know that football prompts great passion. It is a fantastic game and people get incredibly involved in it. It is our national game and we should be proud of it. There have been many studies of football as a social phenomenon. In 1981, the great anthropologist Desmond Morris wrote a book called &quot;The Soccer Tribe&quot;, in which he considered football as an extension of tribal rituals that the human race has enjoyed over many years. The book is interesting because he talks about football as a &quot;stylised battle&quot;, a process whereby communities come together to do battle with each other. That is fine on the pitch.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/4">Social scientists have talked for a long time about the search for an identity through football. People say that we live in a world dominated by globalisation in which people feel increasingly remote from their communities; they find that football gives them a contact with their local community, with their town and with society around them. There is probably some truth in that and we should understand it, but if people are going to use violence as part of the process, they should search for their identity in a different way. It is okay for people to support their local club very passionately, but it is not acceptable for them to be violent in their support. We should be very clear that people who are violent in and around the environment of football are criminals, not football supporters, and should be treated as such.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/5">Clubs are doing a great deal to root out the problem of violence at grounds. An awful lot has been done in the past 20 or so years following incidents such as Heysel. The bigger clubs have gone in for all-seater stadiums. CCTV is now prevalent in many clubs, right through the divisions. Indeed, the club that I follow, AFC Telford United, has CCTV fitted around the ground, even though it is in one of the lower leagues. We should congratulate football clubs on taking a lead on that and on matching up with other campaigns, such as &quot;Kick racism out of football&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/6">Often nowadays violence is displaced away from football grounds and into neighbouring communities, and many of those involved in violence have already been excluded from their football clubs for violent conduct at the ground. On match day, we sometimes see groups of men&mdash;predominantly young men, it has to be said&mdash;floating around the ground and the environment near their club, looking or &quot;cruising&quot;, as some of them call it, for trouble with opposing fans. We hear stories of groups of supporters e-mailing one another and using mobile phones and the computer network to set up pitched battles in locations near grounds. That has nothing to do with football any more. It is loosely associated with those clubs, which rightly distance themselves from such behaviour. It is a social phenomenon&mdash;a criminal phenomenon&mdash;in which groups gather to fight some form of battle connected with an honour for their community which is completely misplaced. I am sure that that view is shared throughout the House.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/7">What I am describing can happen in football at all levels. It happens not only in top-flight football but throughout the structure. AFC Telford United played a friendly game against West Bromwich Albion on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-09">9 July</phrase>, and several supporters from, it is thought, Wolverhampton Wanderers turned up. They are not really supporters so much as people who associate themselves with that team. I do not think that they actually attended the match, but they caused a fight in a pub just outside the ground.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/8">I can do no better than echo the words of the chairman of my club, Lee Carter, which appeared on the club website after the event. He said:</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/9" class="indent">&quot;The likelihood is that the people who were involved in the trouble did not attend the match. The match was a magnificent occasion attended by over 2,000 well behaved, true supporters from both sides. Each one of us who attended the match on Saturday should be extremely angry that a minority of mindless idiots have tarnished the name of football of AFC Telford United and of the whole town by acting no better than circus chimps outside the stadium. Essentially it was a public order offence but we shouldn't deny that the incident only occurred because there was a football match in town. We can't wipe our hands of the matter and if there is a way that we can prevent people who were involved from coming into the stadium we will.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/10">That was a responsible statement from a club chairman: he did not deny that violence occurred because there was a football match in town; he acknowledged the problem; and he wants to work with the community and police to put things right. That is no more than I would expect from a club that is as well rooted in its community as AFC Telford United now is.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/11">There was a game on the following Tuesday evening, <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-12">12 July</phrase>, against Wolves, which went extremely well. After that game, Lee Carter had this to say:</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/12" class="indent">&quot;Everyone, press and public, who vigorously reported and promoted the trouble that occurred after the WBA game should do the decent thing and promote the true reality of football at the New Bucks Head. As on Saturday, over 2,000 well behaved, true supporters from both towns enjoyed a magnificent occasion in a stadium that is owned by a Trust and club that are committed to creating a family friendly atmosphere.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/13">Again, he was quite right. It is interesting that that game did not receive coverage on the same scale as the game of the previous Saturday. No one wants to talk about football matches that go well, where everyone enjoys themselves. Of course, that is what happens at 99 per cent. of games in this country and around the world.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/14">I do not think that we can apply a social science model, however attractive that may appear. We can use it to understand what happens when football violence occurs, but we cannot deploy it as a defence for criminal behaviour. We should never do that.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/15">The Football Association is doing good work in this respect. It is committed to eradicating violent behaviour at football matches in England and matches involving England teams abroad. The FA is working in several areas domestically and internationally to achieve that goal. For example, it is working with the Government to explore ways of tightening the regime governing ticket touting, the unauthorised sale of tickets that is one of the main factors leading to hooliganism, undermining as it often does the segregation at football grounds. I support the FA in that and in seeking far harsher penalties for ticket touts who operate outside grounds.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/16">In recent years there has been huge progress in preventing the hooligan element from following the England team abroad. I understand that only one arrest was made before, during or after any of the four games that England played in Euro 2004 in Portugal. I thought that our supporters did us proud there, and I hope that England fans will follow in that direction in future. That was in no small part due to work done before and during the tournament by the FA, the police authorities&mdash;I am sure that the Minister will want to comment on that&mdash;the Home Office, and clubs and other colleagues in Portugal, ensuring success both in the security arrangements and in the eradication of hooliganism.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/17">The FA has started similar preparations for next year's World cup in Germany. I hope and expect that the England team will be followed by people who want to enjoy their football in that country.. The FA is right to call for magistrates throughout the UK to ensure that football banning orders are applied consistently and rigorously and to take all relevant offences into account. We can stop trouble makers travelling abroad if the process is managed firmly.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/18">I want the Minister in his reply to tell us about the Government's efforts to lobby for the Schengen border agreement to be suspended for the duration of the tournament, as it was in 2004. We need to control people who have a record of committing violent football-related offences and who may intend to travel to Germany.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/19">The FA is working hard with outside agencies to promote diversity among England fans, which is most important. The profile of people watching England games is very different from that of 20 years ago, which is a good thing. We need to get more families and women involved in the game, to encourage a multiracial view of football and to get more people engaged across the board. I am pleased that the FA recently fined Millwall &pound;25,000 following racist chanting by their fans at a Carling cup game last season. We must be tough on that kind of abuse.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/20">We will hear more about police activity in relation to football violence in a minute, but I shall turn first to what happened to my constituent and friend, Jamie Turner, who is a Telford resident. Jamie and his wife Karen, who is also a friend of mine, run a successful IT business in Telford. Jamie, who is a Manchester United fan, was 46 yesterday. He has followed Manchester United all his life and goes to games with a group of friends who travel together and enjoy their football.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/21">Jamie was assaulted by a gang of Southampton fans while on the way to the last game of the season on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-15">15 May</phrase>. He met some of his friends in a local park and they walked towards the ground; they crossed a main road and started to go through an estate. A number of individuals&mdash;I will not call them football supporters, because they are not; they are criminals&mdash;emerged from a local working men's club, or drinking club, and set about the group of supporters with baseball bats, with chair legs and, some have said, with metal bars. It was an unprovoked attack on a group of people who just wanted to go and watch a football match. To my knowledge, Jamie has never before been involved in trouble relating to football. Several of the supporters involved in the incident pleaded with those who attacked them to leave them alone, because all they wanted to do was go and watch the game.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/22">Jamie tried to walk away from the incident and was attacked&mdash;he was hit on the head with a baseball bat. For a time I thought that Jamie would not reach his 46th birthday; he will have to live with the legacy of the incident for the rest of his life. His family have been incredibly strong in supporting him and they deserve our respect. Jamie was unconscious for a considerable time; he was in a critical condition in the intensive care unit at Southampton general hospital. I stress that the incident was nothing to do with real Southampton supporters because, I repeat, the people involved are simply criminals.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/23">At the time, Karen said to the press:</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/24" class="indent">&quot;It appears that Jamie was ambushed totally at random by a group of people who were intent on causing trouble before the game.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/25">That is an appalling scenario: a group of friends who have been watching football for many years travel together for the closing game of the season, sit in a local park for a few minutes and enjoy themselves before the match, then head off towards the ground, when somebody nearly kills one of them. It is incredible that that should happen to someone while they are walking to a football match.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/26">The police have been painstaking in their work, and I know that Karen wants to pay tribute to them. She has not seen eye to eye with them on some of the things that they have done, but, all in all, she thinks that they have done an incredibly painstaking job in trying to resolve the matter. Many local people have bravely come forward to give evidence, although they must be scared. Witnesses are also afraid that they themselves might be branded as trouble makers, football hooligans or criminals. Such an incident can become a melee. Things move quickly and people try to get out of the way&mdash;they run in an effort to remove themselves from the situation. Events become a blur, and people cannot remember exactly what happened or who did what. The police are trying to focus on that problem.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/27">Several people have appealed for witnesses to come forward and give further evidence. Bobby Charlton made that appeal on behalf of Manchester United. I hope that anybody in the Southampton area, any Manchester United supporter or any genuine Southampton supporter who knows what happened on that day will come forward and give further evidence to the police. We must catch the individual, or group of individuals, who committed this crime. Quite frankly, it is not safe to have them walking around on our streets. They must be brought to justice.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/28">I close by asking the Minister to ensure that this case continues to have a high profile and that we will not rest until we find the individual or individuals who attacked my constituent and friend, Jamie Turner, when he went to Southampton to enjoy a football match with his friends. I am sure that the Minister will commit himself to ensuring that we continue with the inquiry and that we press as hard as we can to find the individuals involved in the incident.</p>
	<p pid=".458.1/29">Football is a great game. It is one of the great loves and passions of my life and the life of many people in our nation. It will always be a great game. We must ensure that we talk carefully about football-related violence, which has nothing to do with football, and never should have anything to do with it. Those who perpetrate it are criminals.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.462.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department"  colnum="462"  time="11:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h02.htm#50720h02_spmin0">
	<p pid=".462.0/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" name="David Wright">my hon. Friend the Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase> for raising the issue of football disorder. As he made clear, substantial progress has been made in recent years, but there is still a problem. We cannot afford for a moment to be complacent about it. This debate gives me an opportunity to outline some of the initiatives that the Government have taken and continue to take to deal with it.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/2">First, I want to say a few things about the specific incidents that my hon. Friend related this morning. I was aware of the appalling attack on his friend that took place in Southampton in May. Indeed, my hon. Friend and I discussed the incident soon afterwards. I assure him that my officials have maintained close contact with the Hampshire police throughout the intervening weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/3">As my hon. Friend indicated, the incident occurred before a football match between Southampton and Manchester United. He described the circumstances in which the attack took place. The police confirmed that the visiting group were chased through a nearby housing estate before two of their number were seriously assaulted. One of the attacks was on my hon. Friend's constituent and personal friend, who sustained serious injuries. Mr. Turner has been discharged from hospital, but his treatment will continue for some time. I take this opportunity to send the good wishes not just of myself but of the whole House to my hon. Friend's constituent for his sustained recovery.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/4">The assault was serious, and the Hampshire constabulary immediately set up a major incident team to investigate it. I assure my hon. Friend, his constituents and their family that the inquiries are thorough and ongoing. I endorse the call that he made this morning: if anybody has any information that could help the police, they should come forward with it. I am not able to go into further detail about the police investigation, but I emphasise that Hampshire constabulary is wholly committed to bringing its investigations to a satisfactory conclusion. I know that everyone in the House fully supports the view that serious criminality of that kind cannot be tolerated for a second.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/5">My hon. Friend also cited an incident that occurred the weekend before last. A small group of troublemakers who associate themselves with my hon. Friend's football team, AFC Telford United, and with Wolverhampton Wanderers, attacked a public house in which visiting West Bromwich Albion fans were drinking after a football match. The incident resulted in one serious assault and three arrests, and it demonstrates my hon. Friend's point: football-related disorder can occur at all levels of football. I was shocked to find out that nine individuals who associate themselves with AFC Telford United are subject to banning orders.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/6">In recent years, we have made great strides in dealing with football hooliganism. Incidents between groups of rival hooligan supporters still occur from time to time&mdash;we heard evidence of that this morning&mdash;but the problems are not of the same magnitude as they were. That is because the Government, police, football authorities and supporter groups have come together; they are intolerant of that besmirching of the name of football. We have found ways of working together to counter the influence of hooliganism.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/7">As we know, the dynamic of football disorder is complex and fluid. It ebbs and flows in scale, and its character changes continually. We need to keep a clear eye on what is taking place. Football matches can be highly charged and passionate affairs, with raw emotion and community spirit holding sway. The potential for a minority of fans to exploit that opportunity to lose their discipline and self-control and pose a danger and threat to others is always there. It can never be a justification for violence.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/8">Let us be clear that the scope for spontaneous misbehaviour in grounds has greatly reduced as a result of the improvements in ground structure and safety that have taken place. I pay tribute to football clubs and all those associated with football who have made that happen. My hon. Friend is right: today, football is a game with a much more diverse supporter base. More families and women attend and feel safe, secure and unafraid. That is a wholly good thing for the game and for the atmosphere in which it is played.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/9">The appalling incident in Southampton demonstrates an important point: football disorder can be violent and can have serious consequences. These days, it is largely pursued away from the public eye and is, as my hon. Friend mentioned, dispersed from the immediate area of the football stadium. That is also a challenge for the police and one that they are ready to meet.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/10">The House will be aware that, in recent years, there has been a major reduction in the numbers involved in football disorder. That has been achieved through a range of measures. The use of football banning orders has been fundamental, as has more effective public order policing. We have had a much more focused, intelligence-led police operation, which has helped. There has also been a discernible change in the attitude of football supporters. They are no longer prepared to be complicit in hooliganism, because they know that it is wrong and intolerable.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/11">Domestic football disorder is rarely a major issue these days for crime statistics and the impact on local communities. It would not rate as the highest priority on a local policing agenda, given the other problems that the police face. During the 2003&ndash;04 season, the total number of football-related arrests, which includes any arrests that take place during the 24 hours either side of a match, was fewer than 4,000. That is 1.62 arrests per football match and represents a 10 per cent. decrease from the season before. That is a good and improving record. Data from last season will be published in the near future. I cannot confirm the figures, but all the indications are that progress is continuing.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/12">Perhaps an even stronger indicator of the extent to which things have improved is the fact that about 25 per cent. of all premiership and Football League matches take place completely free from police involvement, which shows that the sport takes its responsibilities seriously.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/13">We know the history, which goes back as far as Luxembourg in the 1970s. We remember the terrible events in Dublin in the 1990s, and in Copenhagen, Brussels and Charleroi in 2000, when we had a wake-up call telling us that something had to be done about football hooliganism. During the Euro 2000 finals in Belgium, 945 England fans were arrested and deported. It seemed at that time that England's future as a football nation was at stake. However, it gave us the impetus to do something. I am sure that all Members of the House will welcome what has been achieved since and agree that the reputation and behaviour of England football fans overseas has improved dramatically since our new strategy was introduced. This is shown by the significant reduction in the number of arrests of English people for football-related disorder during the European and World cup finals. As my hon. Friend said, compared with the 945 arrests in 2000, there was just one confirmed arrest during Euro 2004 in Portugal, an impressive achievement when 80,000 football fans travelled to Portugal.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/14">The UK's efforts to minimise the threat also received public acclaim from UEFA, the Portuguese police and Government, the Independent Football Commission and the fans themselves. There were, of course, problems with drunkenness and disorder in the Algarve, but the Portuguese made it clear that that was not football-related disorder in the traditional sense; it was antisocial drunken behaviour of the sort witnessed too often in our high streets and some Mediterranean resorts. In Spain alone, more than 2,000 British tourists are arrested annually for drunken violence and disorder. That is a regrettable and disturbing trend, which the Government are working hard to address, but it is a wider social problem rather than a football-related one.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/15">That success has not happened by accident. It is the result of a great deal of hard work by a number of agencies and the fans, as well as the comprehensive Home Office-led initiative born out of the terrible scenes that we remember from 2000. The legislation allowing football banning orders is fundamental to the strategy and gives the police and the courts power to prevent domestic football disorder and the export of the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/16">In the next few weeks, I shall place in the Library a detailed report on the impact of the legislation. The new laws are delivering on every front. The number of orders has risen dramatically since Euro 2000 when around 100 individuals could be prevented from travelling to Belgium. Today the number of banning orders exceeds 3,000. Indeed, the 10 per cent. reduction in arrests reported for the 2003&ndash;04 season was accompanied by a 45 per cent. increase in the number of banning orders. The police can identify those people and take the appropriate steps to prevent them from travelling and thereby associating with football matches.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/17">It is important to pay tribute to the effectiveness of public order operations by local police in suppressing the risk of football violence and in reassuring local communities. It is also important to pay tribute to football fans. They and their organisations, particularly the Football Supporters Federation, have played a major role in helping the police to combat football-related disorder.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/18">I know that hon. Members share the widespread pleasure in what we have achieved in our national sport. We all like to participate in one way or another and support our teams. We can all take pride in what has been achieved and the fact that our national game is no longer blighted by mass disorder on the terraces or in the streets of European cities that host football tournaments.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/19">The legislation and strategy introduced in the wake of the violence during Euro 2000 is working well, but the problem of hooliganism may not have been eradicated and the threat may remain, so we must not be complacent. However, the number and scale of incidents both at home and overseas has decreased dramatically. Relatively small and isolated incidents will occur from time to time, and some, like the appalling incident in Southampton that my hon. Friend described, remind us of the need to retain the initiative and prevent troublemakers from shaming our national game.</p>

	EU Access to Ports Directive
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.466.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" speakername="John Denham" colnum="466"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h03.htm#50720h03_spnew0">
	<p pid=".466.1/1">I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for selecting this debate and also for the interest and support that has been shown by colleagues on both sides of the House. I know that my hon. Friend the Minister will want to reflect carefully on the points made. As a Minister, she does not have much choice about being here, but it is at some personal cost to her and I am grateful.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/2">I am, by inclination, a supporter of the European Union and have been saddened by the turn against it that has been manifest in a number of European countries in the past few weeks and months. I am also one of the first to recognise that one of its problems is its ability to inflict damage needlessly on itself. On occasion, we need to step in to prevent EU institutions from doing that. We are in such a situation with the directive today.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/3">We are told that we are in a period of reflection, following the various referendums. Among other things, it is directives, such as this one, on which we should reflect. As far as I can see, the EU access to ports directive is not wanted by the people who own the ports in this country, those who manage them, or those who work in them. If those things are true, it is difficult to understand why we should have such a directive and why, given its long and chequered history, anyone should press ahead with it. Has someone made a convincing case that the resistance from the owners, managers and workers represents a close-knit and self-serving cartel? If such evidence exists, the EU Commission has not yet produced it or said that the directive would be the right response.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/4">The Commission appears to be pursuing the directive with a single-minded bloody mindedness, introducing a new directive without real consultation, after the failure of the first version at the hands of the European Parliament. If ever there was a case of a solution looking for a problem, this would be it.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/5">It is no secret that I was initially prompted to seek the debate by members of the Transport and General Workers Union, who supply the labour in many of our ports. However, I start by quoting not the TGWU, but the briefing produced in June by the UK Major Ports Group, which represents the owners and managers of the ports. The group stated:</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/6" class="indent">&quot;It is striking that Europe's most liberalised ports oppose a directive that aims to liberalise Europe's ports. The problem is that far from liberalising Europe's ports, this Directive will impose a regulatory burden that will diminish investment and threaten jobs. In terms of ports, surely the Commission should be addressing the more pressing challenges of globalisation and growth and the need to create a level playing field&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/7">The union has a different focus. Their briefing to me and to other hon. Members states:</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/8" class="indent">&quot;ports are dangerous places to work . . . The last thing we need is another Simon Jones.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/9">That is a reference to the young man whose death has done so much to prompt the call for corporate manslaughter legislation. Everyone is brought together by the fear that the directive will undermine the long-term investment on which the success of all the ports, and therefore the jobs that go with them, depends.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/10">In setting the scene, I may be getting a little ahead of myself, because it is worth setting out briefly what the directive is supposed to do and why there are good reasons for saying that it will not achieve that. It aims to open up greater competition in the provision of port services by, under certain conditions, requiring port services such as cargo handling to be put out to tender, enforcing the requirement to allow additional entrants into the market for port services, and extending the range of workers who can handle cargo.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/11">A more far-reaching version of the directive was first introduced in January 2001. The cornerstone of a communication to the European Parliament and the European Council called &quot;Reinforcing Quality Services in Sea Ports: A Key for European Transport&quot; was a proposal for a directive on market access to port services. The Commission hoped, quite reasonably, to shift passenger and goods traffic towards maritime transport, which is a relatively environmentally friendly mode of transport. There was a wide-ranging debate between the Council and the Parliament, as well as with the ports industry.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/12">The directive was initially adopted by the European Parliament in November 2001, but some key issues were still outstanding. The most controversial was cargo handling, a sector in which thousands of the Community's dockers are employed to load and unload cargo. Delegations from the Parliament and the Council negotiated hard under a conciliation procedure and appeared to have reached agreement in September 2003. However, the deal had still to be approved by the full Parliament, and its plenary narrowly rejected the text on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-20">20 November 2003</phrase>. The main sticking point was cargo handling. A majority of the Members of the European Parliament took the view that the definition of self-handling by the shipowner would still allow workers from boats to carry out unrestricted loading in European ports, which would have significantly downgraded safety.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/13">The new draft directive was introduced in October 2004. The main change involved keeping the idea of self-handling, but restricting it to land-based staff. The European Parliament is now considering the directive. It held a hearing in June, and a report is due to be discussed at the November-December plenary session. It is clear, however, that opposition has not diminished: owners, operators and trade unions maintain their opposition to the directive.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/14">The EU rapporteur, Mr. Jarzembowski, has so far said that it is &quot;debatable&quot; whether the proposals will be acceptable to the transport committee and the Parliament. Those hearings involved many different organisations, including the port owners, the European Boatmens Association, the European Tugowners Association, the European Transport Federation and the European Maritime Pilots Organisation, all of which criticised the directive, in whole or in part.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/15">That is where we are today. The question for my hon. Friend the Minister is whether, given the United Kingdom's presidency of the EU, our Government should tell the Commission quietly to drop the draft directive because it does not serve the purposes for which it was introduced.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/16">The first of the major arguments about the directive relate to health and safety issues, and that case has been put with great strength by the Transport and General Workers Union. We would all recognise that ports today are not the highly regulated and protected workplaces that they were 20 or more years ago. There is substantial competition.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/17">Although I will not go into this today, I have written that the competitive gains made by UK ports have been derived, at least in part, from reduced wages, diminished or abolished pension provisions, and tougher working conditions for those who work at those ports. That is not the industry that would have been recognised in the years immediately after the dock labour legislation. Indeed, as the United Kingdom Major Ports Group says in its briefing, there is already significant competition in UK ports. It states that there is self-handling in UK ports, but adds:</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/18" class="indent">&quot;we believe that arrangements should be a matter for the port and not governed by prescriptive rules.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/19">The union view, which I share, is that the forced introduction of unskilled or poorly supervised labour into a dangerous working environment can only make things worse. Markets and competition can be powerful, and sometimes positive, forces for change, but not at the high cost of human life and lasting injury. The majority of accidents to a dock's work force is caused by falls from heights, slips and trips, and workplace transport, while musculoskeletal disorders are a significant occupational health problem.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/20">It is probably not widely recognised that the ports industry is, person for person, far more dangerous than construction. Compared with the national average, a person employed in dock work&mdash;&quot;supporting water transport activities&quot; is the Government's official definition&mdash;is 24 times more likely to be killed at work. A dock worker is three times more likely to be killed than someone employed in the construction, building or civil engineering industries. The likelihood of a major injury is similar to that of construction, but the chances of an injury that would keep someone off work for more than three days is nearly twice as high in ports as in construction. A genuine fear about the directive is a reduction in health and safety, which, as I have made clear, is already a significant problem for people working in the industry.</p>

	<p pid=".468.0/1">Will my right hon. Friend comment on the safety implications not just for people directly involved in loading and unloading activities, but elsewhere in ports and their vicinities? The port in my constituency does not have the commercial business that it once did, but a similar amount of other industrial activity, including retail activity, often goes on nearby. Does he agree that there are safety implications for those involved in other activities within the vicinity of ports?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.468.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" speakername="John Denham" colnum="468"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h03.htm#50720h03_spnew2">
	<p pid=".468.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point, and I hope that he expands on it. Although I do not want to paint too rosy a picture of how things are structured at the moment, it is fairly clear where responsibility for health and safety matters lies with regard to employers and others. The directive introduces, in effect, artificial and bureaucratic arrangements for changing those structures and responsibilities. That is bound to lead to unclear lines of accountability and responsibility, and increased dangers in lots of different ways.</p>
	<p pid=".468.1/2">The second argument relates to the threat to investment. Port development in this country is largely a private sector activity. Before it was blocked by a decision taken by the Department for Transport&mdash;I do not wish to re-open old wounds&mdash;the proposed expansion of the port of Southampton to Dibden bay was an entirely private sector proposal, depending on no public investment whatever. The investment was planned to the tune of at least &pound;600 million. Even much smaller schemes can run into tens of millions of pounds, for which the private investor takes the total risk. In practice, investment in UK ports does not come from independent developers. The concept of the speculative ports development has yet to take off in a big way in this country. Ports tend to be developed by those who are planning to develop and operate them, and who want to provide port services.</p>
	<p pid=".468.1/3">The effect of the directive is that, in a relatively short period of time&mdash;perhaps 10 or 15 years after development&mdash;the company that has taken the risk and made the investment may, in effect, be required to pass their assets over to another operator, which can compete to provide the service without ever having taken the risk on the investment.</p>
	<p pid=".468.1/4">In a preamble to a brief provided for this debate, P&amp;O points out the contradiction between that effect of the directive and its stated aim. It says:</p>
	<p pid=".468.1/5" class="indent">&quot;It is important to ensure that the development of new ports and port facilities in encouraged by this directive.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".468.1/6">It goes on to talk about the different circumstances in which current investment might be endangered, but those circumstances primarily involve cases in which a private sector company has taken the risk of investing in acquiring land and taking risky and uncertain business decisions to develop new port capacity. The directive appears to put such investments and decisions at risk. We often debate the private finance initiative. I do not want to do that now, but merely point out that a company that invests, say, &pound;2 million to build a school is generally protected for 30 years under the standards contract before it has to open up to competition to provide facilities management.</p>
	<p pid=".468.1/7">Under the directive, significantly greater investments would be protected for a much shorter time. It does not take much insight to realise that the effect is likely to be a reduction in investment, not increased competition in the ports industry, and a cut in essential competition between UK ports, because of the possible reduction in their capacity.</p>
	<p pid=".468.1/8">As a port MP, I am concerned about the management of the ports, their managers and those who work there. The loss of the expansion of the port at Dibden bay was a huge blow, and I am afraid that the Department for Transport deserves little credit for its failure to develop a coherent port strategy. The port of Southampton remains vital to our economy, and change and expansion are still necessary in some form, but the directive does nothing to make that expansion more likely. Nor does it do anything to secure the necessary investment. It certainly does nothing for the people who work day in, day out to provide port services.</p>
	<p pid=".468.1/9">I end as I began by telling the Minister that we can view the directive as a test of the Prime Minister's determination to reform EU institutions to make them concentrate on the essential issues and to be more effective. At the moment, the directive seems to be driven by nothing more than institutional inertia. It is almost a case of, &quot;We have started, so we will finish.&quot; I hope that the Government and my hon. Friend have the will to recognise that and to step in and stop the process.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.470.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1852" speakername="John Gummer" colnum="470"  time="14:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h03.htm#50720h03_spnew3">
	<p pid=".470.0/1">I much agree with what has just been said, and I begin by making the same sort of comment with which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" name="John Denham">the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase> began his remarks.</p>
	<p pid=".470.0/2">A mature approach to the European Union is one that accepts, and with pleasure, our membership and our centrality to it. The EU is perhaps the most important step that has been taken in peace time for 100 years. I am proud that Britain is part of it, and I want us to be an active, lively and leading member of it. I look for closer relationships with our neighbours because I am sure that that enables us to have a greater say in the world and to have considerably more influence.</p>
	<p pid=".470.0/3">The trouble is that our attitude to the EU is rather juvenile, which means that one cannot criticise it without appearing to criticise the whole institution. I am pretty rude about the Government, but that does not mean that I do not want a Government. I am pretty rude about the Prime Minister, but that does not mean that I do not want to have a Prime Minister. I am pretty rude about the way in which the Government do many things, but that does not mean that I am opposed to democracy or that I do not want the Government of Britain to be elected in the way in which they are.</p>
	<p pid=".470.0/4">My job is to try to make the Government better. I take the same view about the EU. I am a committed enthusiast for Europe, which means that I have a greater duty to try to make it do things right than those who want to pull it down and diminish it, as, I fear, so many short-sighted members of the press and some politicians do who do not understand just how remarkable the ability of 25 nations is to work together for our common future.</p>
	<p pid=".470.0/5">When we make a thorough muck-up&mdash;I was going to say something rather rude instead&mdash;of it, it is we, the enthusiasts, who really should be the first to say that something is wrong and does not work, and that we want something different.</p>
	<p pid=".470.0/6">I represent the port of Felixstowe, which is Britain's premier container port&mdash;indeed, Britain's premier port. It is we who managed to get rid of Britain's out-of-date and unacceptable practices under the dock labour scheme, and we who lead the ports of Britain with a companionable management-work force relationship. From time to time, I am approached by a trade union saying that management has got it wrong, or the other way about, but, in general, the port has a remarkable history of labour relations and success, so it should be encouraged by the legislation proposed by the EU. It sets an example that I would like the rest of Europe to follow more widely, but, unfortunately, the port's management and work force would be universally disadvantaged by the proposals, which the right hon. Gentleman has rightly brought to the attention of the House with this debate.</p>
	<p pid=".470.0/7">Clearly, all is not well in the European ports industry. The issue could be addressed with more enterprise, less national and municipal interference in the system and less distortion. I am constantly asked by trade unions and employers in the port of Felixstowe to complain that some of their competitors are unfairly supported with light dues, for example, and right across the scale to the way in which so many of the costs that fall on British ports are taken on by the community as a whole rather than paid for in port dues.</p>
	<p pid=".470.0/8">We want to end such uncompetitive practices. Were we looking for a directive, it would be one that does just that: one that says that Antwerp, Rotterdam and other ports in mainland Europe should carry the same costs as we do in the British ports system. If we are to have a directive, it should carry that message. It should help our competitive system to compete more effectively with ports in countries that use all sorts of protectionist measures to ensure that their ports do better than they should. However, the directive does not do that. Instead, it makes it more difficult for leading European ports to do the job as they would wish.</p>
	<p pid=".470.0/9">I have been the Minister with responsibility for health and safety in this sector, and I declare an interest, as I have just written a book on health and safety. I help people, I hope, to improve their health and safety provision. It is widely known that there are many serious accidents in the construction industry, but accidents in the port industry are greater in number and severity, so health and safety in the port industry is not yet at the level that it should be. Some suggest that the case has been presented from a point of view that is parti pris, but I do not think that one can be parti pris about health and safety. It is an absolute issue that must be at the top of the list of important issues. I wholly agree with the right hon. Gentleman's comments on that.</p>
	<p pid=".470.0/10">A healthy ports industry is one in which a successful management is able to expand the port that it runs. Those of us who represent ports will know that that is not easy, because the moment one wants to expand a port, one finds that there is a rare plant immediately next door to where one wants to expand. I have often thought that we should find more unusual plants in the world if we threatened every area of the coast with a port, because it is surprising how rapidly the lesser spotted trefoil is discovered in those circumstances. I speak as a dedicated environmentalist.</p>
	<p pid=".470.0/11">I have been involved in Felixstowe in all sorts of discussions arising from the need to carry out much expensive work&mdash;particularly the replacement of the bird habitat&mdash;to get the necessary expansion of the port. The redevelopments that I am so pleased about in Felixstowe, which will redevelop the old part of the port, are just as difficult environmentally. The lighting, the fact that people cannot watch their television sets, and the things going on across the water in Bathgate create considerable difficulties for the port owners. The Dibden bay example is another way of saying that we already have strict containment of competition, deriving from the proper view of the environment. Let us not think that the business is an easy one to expand.</p>
	<p pid=".470.0/12">I think that the management has an important case to make: if we are to compete effectively, we need to remove the disadvantages&mdash;partly by reducing protectionism in the EU and partly by making it possible to continue, both here and elsewhere, the good processes that are available in Britain. I do not mind competing on a fair basis, and I should like the rest of the ports of Europe to enjoy the same regime as exists in this country. I do not want things to get worse because of the directive.</p>
	<p pid=".470.0/13">I know that the Minister is new to the job and has gone to great trouble to be here today, and I thank her for that. I should like to feel that the Government were more completely and publicly direct about their position. I should like the Minister to be precise about what she intends to do, how she intends to do it, who is on her side, how many meetings she and her colleagues have had with our colleagues in the rest of Europe, whom she has on board and how what she intends will happen.</p>
	<p pid=".470.0/14">I think that I have negotiated longer, and on more occasions, in the EU than any Minister. In 16 years that happened to be my experience. My experience is that working hard with one's colleagues means that they will reciprocate. Someone who spends real time with them, getting them to understand that we are on their side, that we want the EU to work but that the matter in question is bad for them and for us, will get support. I should like today to hear the Minister say, &quot;I am not going to let this happen. I am going to be out there. I will win supporters and show that we can win the argument and win the vote.&quot; It is not just a question of the presidency getting the Commission to drop something; it is a question of the presidency getting colleagues to understand why the idea is nonsense.</p>
	<p pid=".470.0/15">I have no doubt that in the new Europe, where there are so many new partners, the Minister could get exactly the sort of support that I have described. If I may dare to give her a little advice, I think that her debut in such a debate will be hugely successful if she is able to make us all feel that she will be a feisty battler for Britain&mdash;no: a feisty battler for a sensible port system for the whole of Europe.</p>
	<p pid=".470.0/16">It may sound slightly odd coming from a Conservative Member, but although we may not always agree with the decisions of the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and although we often feel that she is pretty distant from agricultural constituencies such as mine, the one thing that we know about her is that if there is a battle in Europe she is a feisty fighter. I suppose that 40 years of watching one's back in the Labour party makes a person a pretty good fighter in that way; she is extremely good at that.</p>
	<p pid=".470.0/17">I wonder whether someone rather younger may prove to us today that she will be precisely as feisty and tough as that, so that we know that the Government are on the side not only of Britain but of a sensible ports industry. That is part of the enterprise economy that we want to make Europe have. It is the only way that Europe will compete effectively and provide the world with a friendly alternative to some of the more extreme versions of capitalism on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>

	<p pid=".472.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" name="John Denham">my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase> on securing the debate, which is certainly timely. I have been approached on several occasions by many people who work in the port of Great Yarmouth regarding ports packages 1 and 2 proposed by the European Commission. In addition, I hosted a meeting at Westminster nine months or so ago with some of my constituents and many people from the Transport and General Workers Union, who raised the subject, so I am particularly pleased that the debate is taking place.</p>
	<p pid=".472.0/2">I fully endorse early-day motion 476, tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1550" name="Gwyn Prosser">my hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Gwyn Prosser)</phrase> and entitled &quot;Access to Port Services Directive&quot;, which calls on the Government to withdraw their support for the directive. It is essential that we provide the safest working environment possible for those employed at UK ports and that we keep our port services at the highest professional level. British ports are, on the whole, the most effective in the world, but the proposed directive will threaten their commercial viability while, more seriously, risking the lives of those who work in them and use them.</p>
	<p pid=".472.0/3">The European Commission's drive systematically to promote liberalisation and competition in port services across Europe stemmed from the 1997 Green Paper &quot;Sea Ports and Maritime Infrastructure&quot;. That was followed on <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-13">13 February 2001</phrase> by the Commission's adoption of ports package 1, the cornerstone of which was the draft directive on market access to port services. The need underlying that package of port liberalisation measures was to incorporate new member states in a successful and liberalised European ports system and to establish an effective trans-European ports network to reduce demand on other transport routes and stimulate business and employment prospects.</p>
	<p pid=".472.0/4">Port workers who provide services locally in Great Yarmouth have no problem in accepting those laudable concepts, especially when promoted as part of a package that holds safety and security in equal measure. However, it has become increasingly transparent through the evolution of the directive, which was rejected by the European Parliament in November 2003 and has now been reincarnated as ports package 2, that safety is being sacrificed in favour of measures that will, in their effort to achieve the goals of a package for the whole of Europe, stifle the individual competitiveness of UK ports.</p>
	<p pid=".472.0/5">The UK heads up an EU port infrastructure that is among the most productive in the world. The cost to unload a 40-ft container is, on average, $100, compared with $200 in North America and $300 in Asia. I am delighted that in Great Yarmouth the outer harbour development is nearing its final stages after receiving Government assistance based on the area's unique needs. However, on the whole, UK ports are distinct within the EU in that almost all investment in them is privately financed, with limited peripheral support from central or local government.</p>
	<p pid=".472.0/6">The UK has the largest port industry in Europe, with 120 ports handling about 560 million tonnes of cargo annually and 68 million passengers. It does that and does it well. It has been outlined in detail why imposing measures under the directive&mdash;such as mandatory authorisation for port services, reducing durations of authorisation and introducing new tendering requirements&mdash;will directly undermine the competitive edge of the UK's ports through inadequate regulation and over-regulation. Furthermore, transitional arrangements surrounding current port authorisations, compensation for companies affected by the arrangements and concerns about state aid guidelines will prove immensely challenging to the practical implementation of a directive which will provide a field day for lawyers.</p>
	<p pid=".472.0/7">Even more pressing for me are the serious health and safety concerns. Ports are dangerous places to work. My right hon. Friend said this, but it is worth repeating: someone employed in supporting water transport activities is 24 times more likely to be killed compared with the national average, and three times more likely to be killed than someone employed in the construction of buildings and civil engineering work. Despite that, ports package 2 has proposed self-handling by customers, reintroduces technical nautical services as a port service open to competitive tendering and forces compulsory competitive tendering on ports. All those measures to create intra-port competition will instead create what has commonly been described as ports of convenience across Europe, dramatically undermining safety.</p>
	<p pid=".472.0/8">On self-handling in cargo-handling operations, including loading and unloading, stevedoring, stowage, transhipment and other intra-terminal transport, there is simply no need for regulation under the directive to increase competition, given the already adequate terms of competition that exist in the UK. More dangerously, however, the proposed introduction of self-handling risks safety by the casualisation of jobs that only qualified professional dockers can carry out to high safety levels.</p>
	<p pid=".472.0/9">I have already illustrated the safety hazards associated with the work, with 3,000 accidents per 100,000 workers. If the work were to be carried out by land-based personnel of user companies, often contracted on a short-term basis, it is inevitable that safety will suffer and that the appalling safety record will get worse. The reintroduction of technical nautical services, including pilotage, towing and mooring, into the debate on competitive tendering&mdash;wisely withdrawn in 2001&mdash;will take what has always been an effective in-house service and create a service in which standards are undermined by commercial pressures.</p>
	<p pid=".472.0/10">The services are based on public safety. The most hazardous period of a shipping vessel's voyage is when it enters or exits a port, or when it navigates within a harbour, often within restricted or dangerous water. That presents a series of risks not only to the vessel, but to surrounding vessels and to the local environment. Indeed, many view those services as a maritime safety public service. It is madness to open such vital services to compulsory competition.</p>
	<p pid=".472.0/11">Under UK law, the provision of pilotage services is a matter for port authorities and all pilots are either employees or de facto employees. The service has worked well. For example, rather than having competition between pilot service providers, the port of the Humber and its operators have benefited from the increased co-ordination in pilot services. Only similar local authorities, including the one in my constituency, have the necessary experience to do what is best. Regulations should be left to the member states and not subject to all-encompassing EU legislation. Assurances that necessary safeguards will be put in place do not hold true, and to create a competitive market in such a safety-critical sector is absurd.</p>
	<p pid=".472.0/12">The general concept and ill effects of compulsory competitive tendering as proposed by ports package 2 will not stop there and will affect passenger services and ports in a similar way. Lack of safety management, lack of control of contractors and lack of training in all such matters will inevitably become serious issues for workers. Even under the current system, the increasing casualisation of many port services is a serious matter and the directive would open the floodgates. Indeed, it offers no additional safety and security protection for dock work other than those already used by the individual member states.</p>
	<p pid=".472.0/13">It is essential that the Government pursue greater health and safety measures nationally and internationally to reduce the unacceptable level of accidents in UK ports and across Europe. They should not increase those numbers by supporting an unworkable and impractical European directive.</p>
	<p pid=".472.0/14">The UK has not signed up to International Labour Organisation convention 152 on occupational safety and health for dock work, yet it is essential that the Government recognise the convention if they are to demonstrate their commitment to the international health and safety issues relating to dock work. Other ILO conventions on such issues, which the Government must also sign, are conventions C137 and C145. I would welcome the Minister's comments on the Government's position. If she is unable to inform me of that today because of time constraints, I will be happy if she writes to me.</p>
	<p pid=".472.0/15">Other important issues that could be resolved without the need for the directive, or through a reduced directive, are those on inter-port competition as opposed to intra-port competition, and the establishment of greater transparency in state funding for ports. It is also essential that any future directive does not exclude ports other than those deemed category A so that they might also benefit from legislation under a new and significantly reduced directive along the lines that I have outlined.</p>
	<p pid=".472.0/16">It is unacceptable to adapt and change legislation that is fundamentally flawed. In their presidency of the EU, the Government have time to ensure that ports package 2 is defeated in the European Commission and the European Parliament. The new directive will not achieve their aim of successful, sustainable and safe ports in the UK, as outlined in their recently published policy paper &quot;Modern Ports: A UK policy&quot;. Therefore, the directive should be dropped.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.475.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1550" speakername="Gwyn Prosser" colnum="475"  time="15:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h03.htm#50720h03_spnew5">
	<p pid=".475.0/1">During my sea-going career on deep-sea and coastal vessels and on cross-channel ferries, I spent much of my time negotiating and arguing the case for the workers with various shipping companies and shipowners.</p>
	<p pid=".475.0/2">Since leaving the sea I have settled in Dover, near the busiest ferry port in the world. It is one of the premier ports. We all have generous things to say about our own ports, but Dover is particularly special to me, not least because Her Majesty the Queen opened two brand new berths there four hours ago. During my time ashore in Dover I have spent quite a lot of time making representations on behalf of port workers, members of the Transport and General Workers Union and members of the GMB over various grievances when the trade union system did not quite deliver the goods or it wanted a little bit more help. I cannot remember one instance when a new rule, regulation or piece of legislation has not caused quite dramatic differences in view across the negotiating table.</p>
	<p pid=".475.0/3">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" name="John Denham">my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase> said, the extraordinary thing about the directive is that it has succeeded in uniting us all: the port industry, both the ports associations, the shipowners, the terminal operators and all the trade unions. They are united in their condemnation of the European Commissioner's new directive. We are calling it mark 2. It seems from the flavour of the debate today that it is also uniting the political parties. We are building up a strong bow wave of opposition to this unnecessary directive.</p>
	<p pid=".475.0/4">It is gratifying to see so many members of the distinguished and influential all-party ports and merchant navy group present this afternoon. In the previous Parliament the group considered this issue and wanted to reject the directive. I have taken some soundings and have listened to the contributions this afternoon, and it is clear that when we consider it formally in this current Parliament the group will oppose it again. When the Transport Committee looks again at the new directive and all that it entails, it will undoubtedly produce a robust response. All the arrows point in the same direction.</p>
	<p pid=".475.0/5">The terminal operators are concerned about having to re-tender for services that they have provided for many years. They are not afraid of competition, but they are afraid of being outbid by powerful, cash-rich interests, and perhaps by interests whose long-term objectives are not the running of ports and the sailing of ships, but the selling of land, the building of houses and the making of money. That has to be borne in mind.</p>
	<p pid=".475.0/6">The issue of investment has been raised. One of the great problems that we are starting to face, and which we will be facing even more in future, is port and infrastructure congestion. We are told that freight through UK ports will probably double in the next 10 years. That is great for the expansion of some of our ports, especially on the south coast, but it is a challenge in terms of providing the infrastructure and keeping the traffic moving. However, investment in the berths must be continued, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1852" name="John Gummer">the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)</phrase> pointed out. Currently concessions are allowed over a period of 46 years, so at least we can say that for nearly 50 years, no matter which way the tide is flowing, we can invest big money and get returns in the future to meet the increasing demands. We are told that the directive reduces that to 30 years. That is another unnecessary limitation.</p>
	<p pid=".475.0/7">We know that the International Transport Workers Federation has pointed to the growing problem of being unable to expand and compete without the encumbrance of third parties being involved. However, the main problem in the directive&mdash;the one that caused so much anguish and grief during the first directive&mdash;is the vexed question of self-handling, especially by the ship's crew. There is talk of pressure for that text to be dropped, and that it will not be part of the final text, but it is early days yet.</p>
	<p pid=".475.0/8">We have already heard about the accident rate in ports&mdash;it is higher than that of the construction industry, and was higher than that of the mining industry when that industry was thriving&mdash;but the accident rate at sea is still a major issue. Moreover, we know that 90 per cent. of accidents at sea can be related to fatigue. In a sea-going career, the worst scenario in the world would be for sailors to come from a deep-sea passage to prepare for stand-by&mdash;preparing the lines and berthing the vessel&mdash;and then for those sailors to have to turn out on deck, not just to tie up the ship, which is part of their function, but to start discharging the cargo, with all the extra risks that that entails. That scenario would be particularly bad in today's environment, in which crews are getting smaller and the demands greater.</p>
	<p pid=".475.0/9">Even if that text is dropped, the directive will still give an incentive to ship operators and ports to bring in casual labour. The right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal mentioned the dock labour scheme. I grew up in Swansea, and am old enough to remember my grandfather, who was a Swansea docker, leaving the house at 6 am or 7 am to walk down to Swansea docks to stand in a great mass of people and wait to be picked out from that crowd&mdash;by luck or by other means&mdash;to get a few hours' work on that day. The decision to select people was not to do with their commitment, energy or previous work history, but more to do with who they knew. That was not the free market; it was worse than a flea market. Those were the bad old days of organising ports.</p>
	<p pid=".475.0/10">Although we have lost that entirely unregulated scurrilous scheme&mdash;we have not quite gone back to the way that things were all those years ago&mdash;the directive would still put pressure on the port operator to take the lowest bidder. That could mean a build-up of agencies that might recruit in the back streets, and might even take on illegal workers, or people with no history in port work, with no feeling for safety or the proper procedures. That would increase the danger.</p>
	<p pid=".475.0/11">In the port of Dover&mdash;my constituency&mdash;I have been approached and lobbied by my friends Gary Punton, who represents the TGWU, and David Clements, who represents the GMB. Both the seafarers' unions have also lobbied me: the officers' union, the National Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers, in which I declare an interest, because I am still a member; and the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, in which I also have to declare a registrable interest, because that union supported my campaign in the last election. Those unions are saying much the same things as hon. Members are saying in today's debate.</p>
	<p pid=".475.0/12">Another issue that the directive causes problems with is the International Labour Organisation conventions on registered dock workers. Many people, especially the trade unions, look on the directive as a means of undermining not only the specific conventions, but the entire structure of union membership in our ports, which would be a bad thing.</p>
	<p pid=".475.0/13">I will be in danger of repeating many of the issues that other hon. Members have raised if I continue too far along that track. I shall finish by saying that if we can convince the Minister of the need to support us in opposing the directive&mdash;I am sure that we are getting there&mdash;she will be on the side of that growing constituency of people who say that it is unnecessary and that it will do more damage than good. The only winners will be the solicitors and lawyers, who will make a great deal of money from all the claims and counter claims. I hope that the Minister will join us in opposing this unnecessary directive.</p>

	<p pid=".478.0/1">Order. I need to call the Front Bench speakers to make their winding-up speeches at 3.30 pm, and I see that two further Members wish to speak. I hope that they can calculate the time allocation.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.478.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" speakername="Alan Whitehead" colnum="478"  time="15:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h03.htm#50720h03_spnew7">
	<p pid=".478.1/1">I will attempt carefully to calculate my time allocation.</p>
	<p pid=".478.1/2">I have followed the progress of the directive for some time, and I am delighted that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" name="John Denham">my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase> has secured a debate on the matter. I also submitted a request for a debate to the Speaker's Office in my indecipherable handwriting. I think that the Speaker's Clerk may have concluded that we did not need a debate on the excess of pork surfaces and thrown my proposal in the bin.</p>
	<p pid=".478.1/3">Nevertheless, we have secured this debate and it is important that the issues relating to the port directive are made clear. The Minister must be equally clear on the matter and I hope that she will be able to assist whatever needs to be done to secure an EU port directive that makes sense in relation to the original suggestions of what a port directive should consist of, instead of the directive currently before the European Parliament. The existing directive displays a misunderstanding of what is meant by a level playing field in the context of what it claims to do.</p>
	<p pid=".478.1/4">Creating a level playing field is not just a question of not building it on the side of a mountain, but of what people do on that level playing field. We expect two sides to turn up and that there should be the same rules for both. There should be a referee and the game should proceed in an orderly fashion. The rules should protect the players from being injured or killed. Contrary to that, the directive appears to suggest that the rules can change during the game. For example, the manager might recruit someone from the crowd during the game to play in the match or, during half time, a player might be sold and come out during the second half for the opposite side.</p>
	<p pid=".478.1/5">The directive concentrates on inter-port competition in a way, as my right hon. Friend set out clearly, that does not do anything either for investment in ports or for health and safety matters relating to the running of ports. In the directive's second incarnation, it claims to begin considering the question of transparency of competition between ports, but in my view it does not significantly address that. It is important that the UK considers that area carefully in addressing the directive.</p>
	<p pid=".478.1/6">It is certainly the case that ports throughout Europe have different definitions of what constitutes a port. In Germany, for example, ports are treated as part of the transport system. In France, there is substantial investment in port infrastructure, dredging, buoys, lighting systems and so on through regional and national assistance, which varies in different parts of France.</p>
	<p pid=".478.1/7">In elements of the directive, the assumption is made that ports somehow exist independent of the trade that goes on in them, so that the trade can be deregulated in the way suggested by the directive without harming the infrastructure. If we are to have an infrastructure directive that produces a level playing field, the issue of who funds what in relation to ports must be addressed. In the UK, ports are regarded as commercial entities in their own right and, as hon. Members have already mentioned, they must pay their own way in terms of all infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid=".478.1/8">Even so, there are clearly issue of definition, for example, in relation to what happens on the landward side of a port in terms of the infrastructure to and from it. Hon. Members have already made some mention of that. For example, what about rail links to and from ports? In the port of Southampton, a key issue is whether the freight rail link from Southampton to the midlands should be upgraded to deal with the new high box containers. That might be outwith the infrastructure and investment handled by the port itself.</p>
	<p pid=".478.1/9">That is what the directive ought to consider. That would be a directive that those who are interested in ports could sign up to. As it stands, the directive does the opposite of most of those things, and it is significant that every speaker in the debate and every party representative in this Chamber agrees that, without those substantial changes, the directive can only harm the interests of British and indeed European ports, rather than advance them as it claims to do.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.479.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" speakername="Andrew MacKinlay" colnum="479"  time="15:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h03.htm#50720h03_spnew8">
	<p pid=".479.0/1">I shall be mindful of the time constraints, but even in the main Chamber the speeches from the two Front-Bench spokesmen sometimes take less than half an hour. Also, I have something new to say: there will be no more Mr. Nice Guy, because we are sometimes far too polite in relation to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" name="Alan Whitehead">the Government. Even my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead)</phrase> seems to accept the concept of a directive. I say that it is not necessary at all, and I want to elaborate on that. My mandate for being here is that I represent the port of Tilbury&mdash;the last working part of the historic port of London&mdash;and also 18 miles of river frontage, which includes wharfs that will not be covered by the directive. If the directive were put into practice, it would create some distortion and unfairness in relation to the enterprise of the port of Tilbury and those smaller wharfs. That needs to be spelt out. The port of Tilbury is owned by the Forth Ports group, which is a significant player when it comes to ports in the United Kingdom. Its headquarters are in Leith.</p>
	<p pid=".479.0/2">Assuming that the Minister will not accept everything that I say this afternoon, I invite her to at least give some idea of the logic behind the directive. Who is driving it? Is she mindful of the fact that the European Parliament basically rejected it? I know that it has been resuscitated and had some fine tuning, but basically it is the same animal. I want to be reassured that there is not a scintilla of truth in the rumour that our Ministries used leverage to try to get Labour MEPs to support the directive initially. This is my hon. Friend's opportunity to repudiate that charge.</p>
	<p pid=".479.0/3">Employing some dexterity, I am socialist who believes in the market economy. There should be a free market, even for labour, subject to the fact that there must be regulation of health and safety standards, proper means for reviewing service conditions, and free negotiations. In relation to that, it is time that the Government enacted the International Labour Organisation conventions, to which reference has been made. When I said that there would be no more Mr. Nice Guy, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" name="Anthony D Wright">my hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase> said from sedentary position that the Minister could write to me. It is time that a Labour Government implemented the conventions. Her brief no doubt says, &quot;If someone mentions ILO, pretend you haven't noticed.&quot; I want her to respond to my point about the ILO conventions, because the issue has been raised time and time again since I have been a Member, and certainly since 1997. We need to look at that.</p>
	<p pid=".479.0/4">The driver&mdash;the so-called Lisbon agenda&mdash;said, &quot;Let's open up the markets, particularly in the services area.&quot; In principle, I do not lie awake at night anxious about the Lisbon agenda of the European Union, but I do not see how the directive translates into a way of fulfilling the Lisbon agenda. Indeed, I see it as the opposite of the market approach. In the United Kingdom, we have a good market in the ports sector. We are an island. It is worth drawing the House's attention to the fact that the cost to shipping lines of handling containers in UK ports is about $100 or &pound;68. That compares with an average of about $134 or &pound;91 in north Europe and $200 on the east coast of north America.</p>
	<p pid=".479.0/5">The important comparison is between the UK, which has a really good market in terms of port handling, and the rest of northern Europe. I suspect that there is protectionism in relation to the national ports in all those areas, and many countries in the European Union are up rivers. The Danube covers several European Union countries, and the prescription does not fit all of them. The UK can legitimately say, &quot;Don't wreck our highly competitive market&quot;&mdash;because the figures that I have before me stand up&mdash;&quot;to address high prices elsewhere in northern European ports.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".479.0/6">The Commission consultation has been parlous. Originally the directive did not include, for instance, cargo handling; it related only to some of the technical services. They should not be covered by the directive, but it has been extended to cover stevedore functions and cargo handling. The fact must be flagged up the fact that the Commission cannot pretend that there has been adequate consultation about that matter.</p>
	<p pid=".479.0/7">The directive will encourage greater use of poorly trained or casual staff, as a consequence of the reduction in safety standards. It will deprive people, companies and corporations that have invested in UK ports and made them very competitive, and it could jeopardise further investment in UK ports. The directive will also mean that customers and port owners cannot benefit from economies of scale. For that reason, if the directive were allowed to go through, it would do the opposite of promoting the market.</p>

	<p pid=".481.1/1">I shall, Mr. Bayley. As well as providing a response on the ILO issue, I hope that the Minister will tell the Minister of State, Department for Transport, and the Secretary of State for Transport what has been said today. It is fair to remind the Minister that the Foreign Secretary has repeatedly said in the House in relation to European legislation that he wants to be sensitive to what the House says. I do not think that there is not a person in the House who supports the directive. If there is, hands up he or she.</p>
	<p pid=".481.1/2">The message must be conveyed that the directive must not pass. During our presidency and during the presidency of Austria, which does not have an abundance of ports, except on the Danube, the matter should be deemed to be dead.</p>
	<p pid=".481.1/3">We are exercised by security. I certainly am. One of the benefits of the port of Tilbury is that it is self-contained. It is the nearest thing to a walled port, which will become the trend in ports. It is literally walled, in the sense that it is protected to combat crime, theft and so on; and also, when a small number of employers are based in a port, they can be controlled and identified. The great investment can be spent on knowing precisely who those people are, where they have been and where they have come from. If we create a multiplicity of employers in those ports, the objective will be diminished.</p>
	<p pid=".481.1/4">For all those reasons, I hope that the Minister will be bold and say that she takes the mood of the House and that she will use her best endeavours and offices to frustrate and eventually kill this crackpot directive.</p>

	<p pid=".481.2/1">I shall be brief. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" name="John Denham">the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase> on having raised the subject, and all the Members who have spoken. The debate has been an education for me. I must admit that I would not be comfortable dealing with this topic on &quot;Mastermind&quot;, but after the debate, I think that I would cope a little better.</p>
	<p pid=".481.2/2">The right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen asked what was the problem that the directive is meant to address. Fundamentally, the problem is fair trade in one form or another. There have always been conflicts of interest concerned with merchant shipping, going right back to conflicts between ports and port owners and shipowners. If we go right back to the days of ancient Greece and to the unfortunate affair of Troy, we shall see that the problem has existed for a very long time.</p>
	<p pid=".481.2/3">In the old days, ships essentially took what deal they could at the port, and if they did not like the deal, they simply went elsewhere. None the less, ports have always been interested in attracting more and more trade, and in forcing down their costs. The ports' disputes with which we are familiar are normally those between the dock owners and the dock workers. I know about that, sadly, because I was involved in a rather futile effort at conciliation during the dock workers' strike in Liverpool, an historic dispute of many years ago, because I was a leader on the council. I remember discussing with both sides their relative fears about the industry. The dock owners voiced their fear of union exploitation and the stranglehold exercised by the unions. They would start by saying, &quot;Can I take you back to 1954?&quot; The unions would express their fear of casualisation and say precisely the same thing. Those fears were genuine and real.</p>
	<p pid=".481.2/4">There was a brutal battle about the various interests. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1852" name="John Gummer">The word used by the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)</phrase> to describe arrangements at Felixstowe was &quot;companionable&quot;. That word certainly did not apply in the case to which I refer. It must have taken a special genius for the EU directive to have united forces that have normally been at one another's throats.</p>
	<p pid=".481.2/5">As far as I can see, the only supporters of the directive will be big shipowners, who might relish competition on issues such as pilotage, the possibility of self-handling and the erosion of, and some attacks on, what they see as vested interests. I dare say that some of them would argue for a further degree of liberalisation&mdash;for a financially transparent regime, in which there are underlying rules related to safety and ensuring that everyone involved in the enterprise has adequate and appropriate expertise to conduct themselves properly and an environment in which no one is held to ransom and bargains are free and fair. That is the theory of liberalisation.</p>
	<p pid=".481.2/6">Whether it is called the Lisbon agenda or whatever, that theory sounds all right. In this case, the practice appears to be different. We must accept that ports are vital to a nation in a way in which other service industries are not. Ports are vital because they affect a much wider economy than themselves, because use of the ports, rather than of the roads, is vital to the environmental imperatives that dominate our agenda, and because they are related to national security, although to a lesser extent than formerly.</p>
	<p pid=".481.2/7">Any Government ought to be, and most are, uncomfortable about leaving ports to the free market. That is why the issue is so difficult. It sets some tricky dilemmas for the Government. Transport policy, whether port or road policy, is essentially a form of economic intervention. In the context of Europe, that always raises complicated issues about state aid.</p>
	<p pid=".481.2/8">The Government also have overriding imperatives to do not with transport but with the environment. The right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal mentioned wild flowers. Environmental arguments cut both ways. We may save a few wild flowers, but if the net effect is that we put more lorries on the road, the effect on the environment is not to the better.</p>
	<p pid=".481.2/9">As I see it, the directive is about having the benefits of the market without the pitfalls. The pitfalls have been well analysed. They are poor safety, environmental damage and economic uncertainty. We would all accept that that is the consensus about the directive. It is too prescriptive. It makes things mandatory that should be optional. It is insensitive to the economic investment needs of ports. The right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen analysed that well. It is also, as other Members said, unmindful of the dangers of casualisation and the health and security issues attaining to that.</p>
	<p pid=".481.2/10">It seems to me that there is good commercial practice in the ports industry. Good commercial practice needs no further recommendation. It does not need a set of imperatives from Europe to bind and establish it further. To endeavour to do that restricts the market or leads to an undesirable form of Euro-fudge.</p>
	<p pid=".481.2/11">In a nutshell, I appreciate the concerns of both Europe and the Minister, but however those concerns are addressed, the directive does not seem to be the most appropriate way of addressing and furthering them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.483.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1954" speakername="Greg Knight" colnum="483"  time="15:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h03.htm#50720h03_spnew12">
	<p pid=".483.0/1">We have had a good debate. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" name="John Denham">the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase> not only on securing it but on his forceful and common-sense contribution to it.</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/2">When considering the directive, the most striking feature is the wide opposition that it has created. I have rarely encountered such unanimity. That is clearly a view shared by the right hon. Gentleman and by most other speakers who have contributed. Members of all parties, the Transport and General Workers Union, representatives of the major ports and the European Parliament are all united against the proposal.</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/3">I pay tribute to Timothy Kirkhope, MEP, the leader of the delegation of Conservative MEPs, and his colleagues, who have led the opposition to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">the proposal. Perhaps the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase> should go to the European Parliament and have a quiet&mdash;or, in his case, noisy&mdash;word with his Labour MEP colleagues. At one point, even the UK Government seemed to have joined the opposition. In February this year, they stated:</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/4" class="indent">&quot;The UK Government is less certain that the impact of these new proposals on the UK ports sector would be realistic or proportionate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/5">Had they stuck with that line, they could have included the official Opposition among their fellows. However, despite all the Prime Minister's fine words in Brussels, it seems that there may be yet another climb down by the Government on an important issue. I hope that I am wrong and that the Minister will reassure us that that is not the case.</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/6">We all ought to be able to criticise the European Union when it gets something wrong. I entirely agree with what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1852" name="John Gummer">my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)</phrase> said. One problem with the EU is that it does not like to be rebuffed. If the people of a nation state reject one of its schemes, they are asked about it again and again until they give what is considered to be the right answer. If one of the major players in Europe throws out a proposal such as the constitution, many in the EU act as if nothing has happened. Now we see what happens if one of its own institutions, the Parliament, rejects a directive. Does the Commission respect the decision and drop the proposal? No, it proposes it again. The right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen is right in saying that that is exactly the type of behaviour that has alienated many of the Union's citizens from its institutions.</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/7">During Britain's presidency of the EU, the Prime Minister has a perfect opportunity to refuse to be a party to such an insult to democracy, and to encourage our partners to drop the proposal. However, despite that golden opportunity to put a stop to unsatisfactory legislation that nobody wants, there are signs that the Government may acquiesce in yet another dose of Commission-inspired bureaucracy. Even if the proposal had not been rejected by the European Parliament, there are good reasons to drop it on its own merits, as we have heard this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/8">It is fair to say that the directive is not really aimed at British ports. That came out in the flavour of the contributions today. Its aim is to inject some much-needed liberalisation into the ports of mainland Europe, many of which currently sit under the heavy hand of state control. In many respects, such ports lag way behind ours. As Michael Everard, the former president of the Chamber of Shipping and chairman of its Ports and Pilotage policy committee, said to the Transport Committee:</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/9" class="indent">&quot;I have been going to Sweden for the last 30 years. I used to say when I went there that I wished our ports in the UK were as efficient as Sweden. Now things have totally turned round. We are far more efficient than they are.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/10">My right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal made an excellent case. He referred to his book but did not tell us what it is called. Perhaps he should send a copy to every member of the European Commission. The proposal&mdash;even the amended one&mdash;will introduce a formal framework of competition to the provision of commercial port services. As I have said, that may be very well for some parts of Europe, but it is not necessary in Britain, mainly because British ports underwent liberalisation in the 1980s as a result of the policies of the trail-blazing Government led by Lady Thatcher, of which my right hon. Friend was a distinguished member. Consequently, for this country, the directive is not a liberating experience but a straitjacket.</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/11">Take, for example, the forced tendering of contracts for cargo handling. That may be necessary in other parts of Europe, where the ports do not deal with that side of the business&mdash;they farm it out to other contractors&mdash;but UK ports normally handle it themselves. Forced tendering will result in fragmentation of the companies that run our harbours and could lead to increased use of casual labour. I agree with the comment that one likely consequence is a deterioration in the quality of work and, therefore, increased health and safety risks. Those risks cannot be exaggerated.</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/12">No one is happy about the directive&mdash;not the unions, not the ports and not the European Parliament, which cited the proposal as its main objection to the original directive. Even the Government have conceded that the directive will change Britain's ports to a more European model, although Ministers have alleged that the changes will take place over a couple of generations.</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/13">If the proposal is approved, there will be an increase in regulation and paperwork across the board. That will, as the TGWU argued,</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/14" class="indent">&quot;discourage much needed investment in the UK port industry and make it harder for UK ports to offer an efficient service to their customers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/15">That argument was echoed by several hon. Members during the debate.</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/16">The directive will force British ports to back-pedal in the name of liberalisation, and there seems to be some doubt whether it will help the ports of our European neighbours. The chairman of the European Sea Ports Organisation was dismissive and said:</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/17" class="indent">&quot;I am afraid that the proposal we now have on the table is not going to help ports in facing their common challenges. Instead of creating an attractive climate for much needed investments in ports, it will probably scare potential investors away.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/18">The pilotage sector of the industry has also expressed deep concern about the directive's impact. The European Maritime Pilots Association said that</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/19" class="indent">&quot;under no circumstances should pilot services come under the scope of the proposed directive&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/20">One of the main arguments for throwing the directive out of the European Parliament in November 2003 was fears about the employment of casual labourers. Changes have been made to the directive, but it looks highly unlikely that the European Parliament's committee on transport and tourism will deem them to be sufficient. I hope that Members of the European Parliament will continue to block the measure.</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/21">I understand that no fewer than 220 trade unions throughout the EU are gearing up to oppose the measure because they believe&mdash;I agree&mdash;that it will undermine safety standards in harbours throughout the EU. We have manifold reasons for rejecting the directive, even in its slightly amended form. It serves neither the interests of mainland European ports, nor our British ports. It has been rejected once by the British Parliament and has not had the amendments necessary to merit its approval. It will jeopardise safety in the name liberalisation and it will jeopardise our liberal UK regime by imposing additional red tape.</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/22">I hope that the Minister will give a robust response to the debate. The essence of the answer was touched on by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1550" name="Gwyn Prosser">the hon. Member for Dover (Gwyn Prosser)</phrase> when he said that the issue should be deemed to be one of national competence. If the EU accepted that, it would be the answer to the problem. Let the British Government go their own way because the matter should be one of national competence. I hope that the Minister will say that she takes the same view and do what she can to persuade her fellow Ministers in the EU to abandon the proposal or, at the very least, argue for the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/23">The hon. hon. Member for Dover rightly said that a large bow wave of opposition is facing the measure, and I hope that the Minister agrees with him. She should do her best to ensure that that bow wave sinks this unwanted vessel.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.485.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" speakername="Karen Buck" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport"  colnum="485"  time="15:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h03.htm#50720h03_spmin0">
	<p pid=".485.0/1">I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" name="John Denham">my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase> on this timely debate, which focuses the House's attention on the challenging proposal for legislation throughout the EU on the market for port services. I congratulate him on not only obtaining the debate, but on the characteristic cogency and power with which he delivered his contribution. It has been a debate characterised by excellent contributions from hon. Members representing ports authorities, bringing a great deal of expertise and local knowledge. It has been characterised also by a high degree of cross-party unanimity, which represents, through hon. Members' contributions, what I hear as a high degree of cross-sectoral concern, spanning business and the trade unions. I can assure hon. Members that I have heard that message.</p>
	<p pid=".485.0/2">The Minister of State, Department for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" name="Stephen Ladyman">my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)</phrase>, will be the lead Minister on the issue, but I can assure hon. Members that I shall report back to him fully on what has been said today. As everyone in Westminster Hall knows, the UK currently holds the presidency of the European Council, so our role in the next six months is to act as a fair and neutral broker, taking forward the Council's agenda. We act as an advocate for common EU policies and are responsible for brokering agreements and delivering results. I am therefore reluctant to dive too deeply into the controversy of the proposal for a national perspective, as the presidency's role is impartially to take forward the agenda of the EU, which the UK has helped to shape.</p>
	<p pid=".485.0/3">Within that agenda, some things are clearly more important to us than others. Presidencies that are perceived to focus exclusively on national interests soon lose credibility and undermine their capacity to deliver. That said, the proposal clearly matters to us. The Commission has said that the whole thrust of the directive is to introduce a permissive rather than a mandatory regime. It also argues that its aim is to ensure that the market is aware of the opportunity for the provision of competitive services existing in the port sector. The Commission believes that the directive will allow for market access, providing that there are suppliers seeking to enter the market. Those are admirable intentions.</p>
	<p pid=".485.0/4">It is clear from listening to today's contributions, however, that hon. Members share the concerns of a wide cross-section of their colleagues in the European Parliament that those aspirations have not been translated into a realistic or proportionate proposal. My right hon. Friend's concerns, and those expressed highly consistently&mdash;albeit with different local illustrations&mdash;by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1852" name="John Gummer">the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)</phrase>, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" name="Anthony D Wright">my hon. Friends the Members for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase>, for Dover (Gwyn Prosser), for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead), and for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay), set out some of the apparent shortcomings of the proposed directive. They expressed crucial concerns about the impact on future port investment, the impact of levels of potential uncertainty, and the impact of work force casualisation on health and safety. Such concerns have also been raised by a significant majority of member states. The clear view, strongly expressed at last December's Transport Council, was that the current text could be regarded only as a starting point for long and hard negotiation.</p>
	<p pid=".485.0/5">As hon. Members will be aware, one of the Government's overarching objectives is better regulation across the board. That will be a major theme running through our presidency of the European Union. Following extensive consultation across the UK ports sector and its users, we have already carried out a thorough regulatory impact assessment of the proposed directive, which is being submitted to the European Scrutiny Committee of this House. As my right hon. Friend pointed out, our assessment amply confirms that there is a greater level of market discipline at work in the UK than elsewhere in Europe. The UK ports sector in general already provides port users and service providers with the market freedoms proposed by the directive&mdash;several hon. Members emphasised that point.</p>
	<p pid=".485.0/6">We do not expect that the intended consequence of the directive would have a significant impact on the fully liberalised, commercially independent UK ports sector or its stakeholders. However, we accept that there is a real possibility of serious unintended consequences, which would have an adverse effect on the continued efficiency and effectiveness of the sector. We do not so far see that those would be adequately balanced by any compensatory advantage. Clearly, this is not a satisfactory situation.</p>
	<p pid=".485.0/7">Our ports are vital to the continued economic well-being of the UK. The directive would have an impact on the 45 UK ports, which have an average annual throughput of more than 1.5 million tonnes, and 200,000 passenger movements per annum, if calculated on currently available data for 2002&ndash;03. These ports handle 95 per cent. of the UK's trade by tonnage, and it is vital that any regulation that impacts on them is of net overall benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".485.0/8">As many hon. Members have recognised, the directive has a long and contentious history. In his opening remarks, my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen made it clear that the European Parliament rejected the original proposal at the conciliation stage in 2003. The revised proposal was issued in October 2004, and initial deliberations were taken forward under the Luxembourg presidency. The published Luxembourg-UK presidency programme commits us to progressing that dossier.</p>
	<p pid=".485.0/9">The UK took a leading role in steering the original proposal into what was generally regarded as a reasonable and proportionate measure by member states, but not, in the end, the European Parliament. If there is to be a directive on opening up port services, our European partners now look to the UK, as a major maritime player in the Community, to grasp the nettle once more. They want us to move towards a workable and workmanlike proposal that delivers market liberalisation where it is required, but with full regard to the commercial realities of the European port sector.</p>
	<p pid=".485.0/10">I can assure hon. Members that we intend to rise to that challenge in Europe. Departmental officials are taking an active role in discussion with colleagues in other member states, sharing our assessment of the directive's impact on the port sector and soliciting their views and ideas. We have built up significant support in the Commission and among other member states. We are consulting widely at home and abroad with the various parties involved, as we did on the previous directive. I can assure my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock that there is no truth in the allegation that we are pressurising Members of the European Parliament to take a contrary view.</p>

	<p pid=".488.1/1">It is a bit late to mention that.</p>
	<p pid=".488.1/2">The Government have also taken the lead in persuading the Commission to undertake an impact assessment of its proposal, and it has now been accepted that the Council cannot resume discussion of the proposal until that assessment is available, which is expected to be in the autumn. The assessment should be able to demonstrate that there will be an overall net benefit from the proposal for port users across the Community.</p>
	<p pid=".488.1/3">During our presidency, we intend to continue to work with other member states, comparing their national impact assessments with that produced by the Commission. In doing so, we hope to develop sufficient consensus to formulate the substantial revisions that are clearly needed to the proposal.</p>
	<p pid=".488.1/4">We are well aware that, as has been reconfirmed this afternoon, uncertainties surrounding the directive are already having a significant impact on UK port investment plans. There is therefore a clear need to resolve the position as soon as possible. Even if the Council or the European Parliament eventually rejected the text, however, the Commission would be obliged to return to the subject in the years to come. We have a good opportunity now to achieve a sensible outcome, which would be preferable to allowing uncertainty to remain, with its potentially debilitating impact on the port sector's continuing effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid=".488.1/5">As the UK holds the presidency, we have to act on the consensus among member states. So far, that consensus is to achieve a significant outcome through substantial revision of the proposal.</p>
	<p pid=".488.1/6">In summary, the Government have indicated from the outset that the proposals must be realistic and proportionate in their impact on UK port sector interests. In addition, the directive must clearly recognise the diversity of the European port sector and the opportunities already provided. Our RIA clearly supports the view that significant improvements are needed to many aspects of the proposal if it is to meet those requirements. During our presidency, we are in a good position to begin work to deliver those improvements for the benefit of the European port sector and its customers.</p>

	Department for International Development (Mr. Howard Horsley)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.489.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" speakername="Austin Mitchell" colnum="489"  time="15:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h04.htm#50720h04_spnew0">
	<p pid=".489.1/1">I secured this debate on Howard Horsley, whom the Department for International Development has treated badly, because he is a friend and for many years was the head teacher of a tough school in Grimsby, at which he gave distinguished service. He is also an idealist who is passionately concerned about international development. Indeed, he has done aid work in Africa and the West Indies.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/2">When the incoming Labour Government expanded the aid programme, Howard gave up his teaching career to become the head of the largest British educational aid programme ever initiated in Ghana. His reward has been to be treated abominably by DFID. The problem was that he blew the whistle by drawing the attention of the Department in London to the programme's lax budgetary and other financial controls, which Ghanaian and foreign aid agencies in Ghana had drawn to his attention and which could give rise to corruption in purchasing, for instance, Land Rovers and computers.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/3">Howard expressed his concerns in London to the then head of the Ghana desk, who told him that she shared many of them and that they would be addressed. The issue should have been treated as whistleblowing on malpractices under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998; instead, however, Howard was fired after he had just recovered from typhoid at home and was about to return to Ghana. No dissatisfaction with Howard had been expressed before, and none of DFID's disciplinary procedures, as set out in its 1999 documents on safeguards&mdash;hearings, the right to produce evidence, the right of appeal and the need for advance warnings&mdash;was applied.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/4">Howard asked to return to Ghana to prepare his defence. He was told that he could, and should, do so and that his files would be protected. He arrived back in Ghana to find that his computer files had been expertly wiped and all his physical files had vanished on the instruction of a senior DFID official. He was told to return home immediately, and that he must not talk about the events to people such as me, his former MP, because the Official Secrets Act applied and sanctions would be exercised if he did.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/5">On his return, Howard took up the issue with Sir John Vereker, the then permanent head of DFID, who said that an internal inquiry would be initiated. Only when those internal procedures had yielded nothing and he had exhausted internal remedies, of which there were few enough, did he refer the matter to a tribunal. At the tribunal, he was given no access to papers or to the accusations. The tribunal gave directions on disclosure that were not fully fulfilled, and the Treasury solicitor made inaccurate claims that Howard had been warned that the Official Secrets Act would apply and that all relevant documents had been disclosed.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/6">Lord Goldsmith is an honourable man, but the claims were wrong. When Howard and I met him, he agreed that the claims were wrong, but said that they had been made in good faith on behalf of DFID, and that there was no obligation on the Treasury solicitor to check the accuracy of claims made by the client. However, the court was in effect misled, and it refused jurisdiction on the issue.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/7">Only when the National Audit Office began to inquire were the disclosures required by the tribunal given to Howard, by which time the tribunal hearing had finished. Again, they were honourable men, and it was said that there had been a misunderstanding.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/8">At this point, I became involved to try to help Howard, whom I regard as a man of idealism and good faith. I found that other means of redress had started to fail. First, Sir John Vereker, the permanent secretary, who is an honourable man, had said that a full internal inquiry had been initiated and carried out, but he seems to have been wrong. We learned from later correspondence that no inquiry had been initiated or requested. The ombudsman, with whom I took up the matter, has no jurisdiction on matters of employment. The data protection people's writ does not operate outside the UK; the events took place in Ghana.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/9">I took the matter to Baroness Prashar, the senior civil service commissioner, who was receptive, responsive and helpful, but she told me that there had been confusion over the capacity in which Howard Horsley had been employed. He was not a civil servant, although the post was advertised as a civil service job and he was interviewed as such. Had it been a civil service job, he could not have been dismissed in such a fashion. Neither was he a technical co-operation officer, because that covers British officials seconded to foreign Governments to handle British aid programmes. He was working not in that capacity but directly for DFID. Had he been a technical co-operation officer, he would have been better protected and would have had more rights against dismissal.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/10">Baroness Prashar said that he was employed under the royal prerogative, which is a rather mysterious category of employment. She explained that it was rather like the secret service. That had me baffled, because it meant that he had no protection. However, Baroness Prashar wrote to the Cabinet Secretary saying that such people should have their position recognised and regularised. I am grateful to her for doing that. Provisions for regularisation of such posts were put into force in DFID when the posts were all transferred to civil service staff in 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/11">I wrote to the Cabinet Secretary as head of the civil service and therefore, presumably, the protector of somebody treated in such a fashion, asking for an inquiry and asking him to meet Howard and me after we had trailed around all those other bodies trying to get them to intervene. He declined to initiate an inquiry and declined to meet us. He told us that there had already been a full inquiry; that was not true, but, of course, the Cabinet Secretary is an honourable man.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/12">I also went to Sir John Bourn at the National Audit Office; he was very helpful. He considered the issue, and officers were sent out to Ghana to look at what had happened there. He found that the financial controls in DFID in this country were lax and that similar laxities applied in Ghana. He said that that should be put right. He agreed that, in view of the laxity of the controls, corruption was possible, but he did not find any. He did not, it is fair to say, speak to any of the other foreign aid agencies operating in Ghana, which might have told him a different story.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/13">At first, Sir John found that Mr. Horsley's predecessor had not complained. He later corrected that when we demonstrated that Mr. Horsley's predecessor had complained about the same issues and that at the end of his period of service his contract was not renewed and he was out of a job. That was corrected in the NAO report.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/14">Sir John also found no reference to, or record of, the payment of &pound;18 million that Mr. Horsley complained about. I want to digress at this point. Apparently, when the Chancellor sold part of the gold stocks, the gold price fell, producing severe difficulties for Ghana and its agricultural exports. That was discussed in a meeting in London with the then Secretary of State for International Development, at which the Ghanaian deputy Education Minister was present, and the Department considered making a payment to help the Ghanaians. The Ghanaian Education Minister was in London at the time but was not called to the meeting. Howard Horsley and the overseas aid community in Ghana knew that there would be a payment to help them in that situation.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/15">On <phrase class="date" code="1999-09-23">23 September 1999</phrase>, Mr. Horsley was called to a meeting with the Ghanaian equivalent of the Comptroller and Auditor General. He went with a representative of the British high commission, a Mr. Stuart, and was told that &pound;18 million had arrived and it would shortly release money for educational purposes in Ghana, where he was working at the time. Many people knew of this but the NAO went through the ledgers of payments overseas by the Treasury, the Overseas Development Administration and other agencies and could find no trace of the payment.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/16">Sir John Bourn, the Comptroller and Auditor General, wrote to me to say that the British embassy official, Ian Stuart,</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/17" class="indent">&quot;has confirmed to my staff that he was present at the talks, and that the then Secretary of State (Ms Clare Short) lent a sympathetic ear to the Ghanaians regarding the fall in the gold price, and the price of agricultural commodities such as cocoa and coffee. He added, however, that he was 'absolutely sure' that there was no rapid disbursement of funds to Ghana following the talks.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/18">That is a very equivocal statement. The NAO was not able to enlarge on it for us. What does it mean? No rapid disbursement of funds does not mean that there was no disbursement of funds. It presumably means that there was no immediate disbursement of funds. That was the statement. This issue of why the &pound;18 million was paid and what happened to it is very mysterious. I put it no stronger than this, but it may account for the way that Howard Horsley was being treated by the British Government and why there was so little response to his points.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/19">Indeed, as a result of the NAO report, a document entitled &quot;A Review of Safeguards Against Misappropriation and Diversion of Aid&quot; was issued. It states:</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/20" class="indent">&quot;Appropriate channels for reporting corruption should be established&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/21">That is what Howard Horsley tried to do. The document continues:</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/22" class="indent">&quot;Internal procedures for reporting suspicions should be clear and made known to staff&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/23">There is a direct endorsement of what Howard Horsley was saying, which had been ignored by DFID. At least something resulted from our interviews and the work of Sir John Bourn and the NAO.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/24">This has been for me a sad and deeply frustrating experience because we have gone round from one body, which is there to help redress grievances and to see that the rules are observed, to another. We have received a little help from all&mdash;substantial help from the NAO&mdash;but no resolution of the basic issue of why Howard Horsley was treated in this disgraceful fashion and fired from a job to which he had committed himself through idealistic motives.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/25">We have been batted around like two shuttlecocks, almost going round to all these bodies holding hands. Everyone knew that it was an issue of concern. Everyone had some information to offer and a little help, but nobody could resolve the major issue. In the end they have all put up the shutters, which is why I am here today raising this issue. If nothing can be done, details of the abominable situation that has been allowed by DFID to arise in the face of a manifest injustice should at least be put on the record.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/26">I should add that as a final piece of vindictiveness Howard Horsley was refused a reference by DFID. He was offered a senior, well-paid administration job in education. But a reference is needed before that can be finalised. DFID at that point, despite my pleas, refused him a reference. He has not worked since. He is now 60 and he has not worked because of this disgraceful treatment over all these years.</p>
	<p pid=".489.1/27">First, there is a need to strengthen the whistleblowing protections that exist under the Public Interest Disclosure Act and to stop using the Official Secrets Act to avoid embarrassment to Departments. Most of all, DFID needs to do justice to this man over this case. There should either be an independent inquiry into the matter, or&mdash;I would prefer this&mdash;Howard Horsley should be reinstated in the job in which he was doing such good work, and to which he was so committed. Had he been a technical co-operation officer employed by a foreign Government to attend to the disbursement of British aid, the good governance requirements that DFID imposes on foreign Governments who work in that capacity would have prevented his being treated in this way. A foreign Government would not have been allowed to treat him as DFID has. Had they done so, there would have been a cut-off of aid. DFID should observe the standards that it preaches to other Governments. Instead of rewarding Mr. Horsley's manifest commitment and idealism, it treated him in a disgraceful fashion, and that should not have been allowed. It is never too late to do justice.</p>

	<p pid=".492.0/1">As is traditional, I start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> on securing the debate, although I recognise that it will bring him no joy. It certainly brings none to me, or, I am sure, to those who watch or read the proceedings.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/2">I welcome the opportunity to clarify the record regarding Department for International Development management practices at what is a hugely important time for development and for aid generally. I shall address Mr. Howard Horsley's dismissal, but first I shall make some general remarks about the Department's management practices and touch on the issue of Ghana.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/3">Earlier this month, at Gleneagles, the G8 countries made an historic agreement. They agreed a comprehensive package of measures to accelerate development in Africa and the developing world. Because of that agreement, Africa can make faster progress toward achieving its millennium development goals. The package is a momentous and important result for Africa, the UK and the international community. Inevitably, it gives DFID a great opportunity and a great challenge, and I am confident that it will meet that challenge.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/4">It is important to point out that others share my confidence in DFID. In January, the Prime Minister said that it is</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/5" class="indent">&quot;probably the most respected such Department in the world.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-12">12 January 2005</phrase>; Vol. 429, c. 295.]</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/6">Praise for the Department has come from a range of other sources. The Canadian Institute of International Affairs recently said that DFID is generally considered to be the best development agency in the world. In 2003, a BBC &quot;Westminster Hour&quot; survey panel that included a former Minister, lords, MPs, former civil servants and journalists rated it as the top-performing UK Government Department. Therefore, I have reason to be proud of DFID's performance. If one is proud of one's Department's performance, one must inevitably be proud of the way in which it is managed.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/7">I turn to some specifics about DFID's management practices. In all our work we stress the importance of sound management, which must start with a clear focus. Our public service agreement sets out that focus. The agreement is centred around achieving the ambitious and internationally agreed millennium development goals, but it essentially has one aim, which is reconfirmed in the International Development Act 2002: to work towards the elimination of poverty in poorer countries.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/8">In mid-2004, following direction from Ministers, our management board set out a programme for the next three years that highlighted delivery and performance against that single, overarching aim. Part of the agenda was a wide-ranging efficiency programme. We believe that gains worth &pound;400 million can be achieved in the period 2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08. We monitor our efficiency gains as part of our effort to monitor and report on our performance. Like all Departments, we publish progress against our public service agreement twice a year and we report publicly on our website.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/9">The public service agreement includes a value-for-money objective, which includes the aim to increase the proportion of our bilateral programme excluding humanitarian assistance to low-income countries from 78 per cent. to 90 per cent. in the current financial year. The Department knows that it can enhance its performance through collaborative working, so of course we join our efforts to those of other Departments, not least the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence on conflict prevention.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/10">We have a range of sound management practices that protect that value-for-money objective. They include a system of internal control that has been commended by the National Audit Office, annual statements of assurance from each of nine divisional directors, a very active internal audit function and a thorough approach to risk management. In 2004, we also launched further anti-fraud, anti-corruption measures, seeking further to adopt a zero-tolerance stance.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/11">Our sound management practice does not stop at financial issues. In the end, the Department's achievements are about the achievements of our staff and ensuring that their unfailing energy, skill and determination is maintained. That is why this year we launched a major new programme further to improve people management, our approach to which embraces constant efforts on diversity. Those in turn have been bolstered by the launch in 2004 of the &quot;Diversity Vision and Strategic Priorities&quot; paper, senior managers being responsible for delivery against the priorities identified. In summary, we have a range of management practices that ensure strong performance and delivery against our poverty elimination aim.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/12">I shall mention our work in Ghana, a country where Mr. Horsley worked. As hon. Members know, Ghana is a very poor country; more than a third of its population, about 7 million people, live on less than a dollar a day. In Ghana, my Department spends about &pound;70 million a year. The programme is firmly targeted on the poor and on creating the conditions for economic growth. The country has a thriving democracy and a reputation for using aid well. Our programme has succeeded in helping Ghana to bring down poverty by about 10 percentage points since the 1990s. Poverty has reduced to about 37 per cent. of the population today, putting Ghana on track to reach the income poverty millennium development goal by 2015. It is one of the few countries in Africa that is on track to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/13">Our support for Ghana's progress on poverty would not be possible without sound management in the DFID Ghana office. Our internal audit department carried out a further health check of that office in February 2003, judging its management systems to be robust. My hon. Friend may be interested to know that the National Audit Office is expected to visit DFID Ghana again in December further to review our management systems and practices in that office. I will welcome what it has to say.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/14">On people management, DFID Ghana was inspected in 2003 as part of our Investors in People accreditation process. An independent assessor interviewed all 45 staff in Accra and rated DFID Ghana's management environment as good.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/15">I shall refer to the specifics of the case that my hon. Friend raised&mdash;the dismissal of Mr. Howard Horsley. My hon. Friend will understand that I cannot breach confidences about Mr. Horsley's personal information and employment in this setting, but I can confirm some key facts about the case. The Department employed Mr. Horsley from May 1999 to January 2000. He was dismissed on <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-06">6 January 2000</phrase> on performance grounds. Since then, my hon. Friend has written some 17 letters to the Department about Mr. Horsley's case. Two DFID Secretaries of State, two DFID permanent secretaries and two Cabinet Secretaries have considered the matter. Mr. Horsley commenced employment tribunal proceedings in April 2000. The litigation ended following a number of hearings in November 2003, and Mr. Horsley was not successful. The NAO has investigated my hon. Friend's concerns about financial practices in the DFID Ghana office and found no evidence of impropriety. There has also been a series of DFID internal, civil service commissioner and Attorney-General investigations and reviews since the dismissal, which my hon. Friend alluded to. My Department estimates that its costs for investigating and reviewing the case now exceed some &pound;40,000. I recognise that my hon. Friend's constituent has also had huge costs.</p>

	<p pid=".495.0/1">Those costs, of course, would not have arisen had Howard Horsley not been so badly treated, and had the requests not been refused. I am delighted to hear of all the improvements that have been put in place since this case, but they are all subsequent to it. According to the memorandum, the procedures for dealing with staff problems in the Department apply to all employees of DFID, so why was Mr. Horsley not accorded the same procedures, rights of appeal, including internal appeal, and right of internal warning, that the procedures set out?</p>

	<p pid=".495.1/1">I recognise that my hon. Friend will not like my answer, but I return to the point that I just made. The case has been considered by two Secretaries of State, two permanent secretaries in the Department, and two Cabinet Secretaries, as well as the employment tribunal. Mr. Horsley has not persuaded those individuals and the tribunal of the merits of the case.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.495.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" speakername="Austin Mitchell" colnum="495"  time="16:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h04.htm#50720h04_spnew3">
	<p pid=".495.2/1">Of course the matter has been considered by two Secretaries of State, because I kept on raising it. However, one of them was told by Department officials that Mr. Horsley was litigious and that therefore no information should be given. I come back to the point that all this trouble would not have been necessary had proper procedures been followed.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.495.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" speakername="Gareth Thomas" colnum="495"  time="16:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h04.htm#50720h04_spnew4">
	<p pid=".495.3/1">I hear my hon. Friend's point. The advice that he says was given to previous Secretaries of State does not mean that the case has not been extensively and thoroughly investigated. I recognise that my hon. Friend has a different view of the outcome, but I repeat that the case has been thoroughly investigated.</p>
	<p pid=".495.3/2">Following the various tribunal proceedings, investigations and reviews that have taken place, the Department strongly believes that no outstanding issues remain to be dealt with. I recognise that that will disappoint my hon. Friend's friend, and, indeed, my hon. Friend himself.</p>
	<p pid=".495.3/3">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State wrote to Mr. Horsley in May 2004 and said that he did not see then how the matter could be taken any further. The Department considered the matter closed then, and I believe that it is closed now. I recognise that that is not the answer that my hon. Friend wanted, but it is an accurate picture.</p>

	<p pid=".496.3/1">Thank you, Mr. Bayley, that is splendid.</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/2">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the subject of the proposed reorganisation of urology services in east Kent. I am delighted to see the Minister in her place. She will know that the new model of care in east Kent has been through a traumatic birth and that finally, after a six-year battle, things settled into the new configuration in February. In a moment I shall describe how the proposals that I want to discuss this afternoon, for the provision of surgery for bladder and prostate cancer in Kent, threaten the heart of the new model of care. However, I want first to raise a number of specific objections to the proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/3">Briefly, the proposals would remove bladder and prostate surgery from the new east Kent urology centre at the Kent and Canterbury hospital to two hospitals in west Kent. My first specific objection relates to the issue of quality of clinical care. In January last year, a Kent and Medway cancer network internal peer review, including external reviewers, identified the East Kent Hospitals NHS trust as an excellent provider of surgery for bladder and prostate cancer. The unit was described as having the most advanced multidisciplinary team in Kent.</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/4">A recognised and internationally used measure of quality and cost-effectiveness in those procedures is the average post-operative length of stay for patients. Audit of radical prostatectomy in Canterbury shows a post-operative stay of 2.6 days. That is outstanding compared with other major providers&mdash;two that I could find the figures for were Bristol at 3.6 days and Basingstoke at 5.3 days. America publishes a national league table, in which the spread is from 2.4 to 4.8 days, so Canterbury, by American standards, would be one of the very best. Perhaps the most impressive statistic of all is that 96 per cent. of Kent and Canterbury patients were fully continent one year after the radical prostatectomies.</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/5">That audit was carried out against the criteria laid down in 2002 by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, which stated that a unit should perform a critical mass of around 50 operations a year to maintain standards. Kent and Canterbury, with about 60 a year, was well within those guidelines. However, the goalposts have now been arbitrarily moved. An amendment to the improving outcomes guidelines changed the requirement to insist that each unit serve a population of 1 million in order to perform that surgery. Time prevents me from going into much detail on that matter, but no academic evidence that I know of has been offered to suggest that that is a good idea. Indeed, I have received e-mails about a whole string of studies that suggest that it is not. One study in Glasgow, carried out by McCabe et al., suggests that for radical cystectomy, for example, a case load of eight operations a year&mdash;a very low case load&mdash;is associated with the lowest mortality rate.</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/6">Such a population base is, in practice, outside the reach of most British district general hospitals. Implementing the IOG is causing havoc in Kent and across the country, threatening to ruin carefully developed models of care and to disrupt teams of surgeons, anaesthetists and nurses who provide excellent standards of care.</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/7">We are therefore faced with a situation in which important cancer services are reshaped according to theoretical criteria, rather than the actual outcomes, which have been shown to be excellent. Kent and Medway cancer network says:</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/8" class="indent">&quot;This review was about making a judgement on what would be the most sustainable and deliverable configurations of prostate and bladder cancer surgery.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/9">Yet, barely nine months after the excellent report that I mentioned earlier, the external review panel said, on the one hand, that East Kent Hospitals NHS trust scored extremely poorly on the critical criterion of clinical quality but, on the other hand, that it had</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/10" class="indent">&quot;a currently excellent service with low lengths of stay, strong nursing support, patient focus, community-based post-operative care and a newly formed urology team at Kent and Canterbury Hospital.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/11">That team, which has taken seven years to develop, is under threat from the theoretical criteria that have generated that ghastly exercise in tick-box planning.</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/12">I have worked with the Minister in a number of capacities, when we were both Back Benchers, and I do not believe that she wants to take the NHS into territory where words start to mean whatever the speaker wishes. If both the peer review and the report acknowledge that the service in east Kent is excellent, there is something bizarre about theoretical criteria that are used to tick boxes and conclude that the service is of poor quality.</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/13">I shall speak more briefly on my second objection to the proposals, which concerns accessibility. The effect of the reorganisation would be to leave no facility at all in east Kent but to provide two units in west Kent. Those units are only 12 miles apart and have an excellent road connecting them. Patients in east Kent will have great difficulty if they are reliant on public transport to access those units, and our ambulance service is already overloaded. How will east Kent patients benefit from travelling many miles for operations that, based on current audit data, will be performed no better in west Kent than in east Kent? In fact, they will be performed slightly less well, according to current figures. Obviously, the proposals must be considered on their merits, but to people living in the comparatively poor area of east Kent, they conform to an all-too-typical pattern across many public services, some of which are completely unconnected with the NHS. The team of nurses, anaesthetists, surgeons and recovery staff, who were carefully put together and have built such a good reputation in a short time, would go to waste.</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/14">Those are the specific objections, but the most important objection is more general and involves the threat that the proposals pose to the whole model of care so painfully assembled in east Kent over the past six or seven years. That model of care provides two acute hospitals in east Kent, supported by a specialist hospital in Canterbury, which in practice is by far the most accessible of the three sites, especially for elderly people. It has a local emergency care centre, the first of its kind in the country. Medical specialties such as acute medicine, coronary care, health care of older persons and the Kent renal unit are also included. All those services require 24-hour resident surgical cover. The arithmetic is that, between them, the urology unit and the vascular surgery unit have just enough posts to provide the necessary number of doctors for a safe and sustainable surgical rota.</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/15">The proposed removal of those operations and the resulting changes in consultant posts would reduce training opportunities and experience. House officer and trainee posts at Canterbury would be at risk of losing the crucial training recognition from deaneries and colleges. Even without a loss of training recognition, the loss of income from the operations would severely reduce the number of training posts at Canterbury. It would then be impossible to run an on-call rota for surgical emergencies that complied with the European working time directive on the Canterbury site. The whole edifice of the model of care, built up over seven years of battles, would simply collapse under the current proposals, unless there was further reorganisation that provided surgeons from another source.</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/16">We are talking about the loss of the local emergency care centre. Acute general medicine, coronary care, health care of older people and the Kent renal unit would become non-viable on the Canterbury site, as would vascular surgery and in-patient urology in the long run. Would the additional capital and revenue required to provide those services elsewhere in east Kent be made available? Would east Kent develop yet another new model of care after all the changes and reorganisations, or would yet more of east Kent's specialist services be moved to west Kent?</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/17">The primary care trusts expressed concerns on that when they arrived at a verdict in favour of the changes by a six-to-three vote. I need hardly say that it was the three easternmost PCTs that voted against. They all made it clear, however, that the changes must be contingent on not undermining that critical mass. They put the Canterbury and Coastal PCT&mdash;one of the three that opposed the proposals&mdash;in charge of the change process, with a brief specifically to that end.</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/18">Survey after survey has shown that Canterbury is by far the most accessible hospital in east Kent. For the people living in Canterbury, Whitstable and Faversham&mdash;I am particularly glad to have my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent here&mdash;and the people in most of the villages, which provide more than a third of the population of east Kent, Canterbury is the most accessible site. The devastation of its model of care and the undermining of the whole settlement in east Kent is threatened by these terrible proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/19">I shall ask the Minister another question as I come to a close. I understand that the reviewer of the process was supposed to be independent. He was independent in the sense that he came from outside Kent, but will the Minister tell us whether that reviewer, who I suspect had a hand in formulating this bizarre policy with the critical mass of 1 million and the rest of it, has ever been called in anywhere and found in favour of a distributed rather than a centralised model? I ask that because the view locally is that he is an avowed centraliser brought in by the Kent and Medway cancer network to rubber-stamp its solution rather than a genuinely independent figure.</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/20">There is too much at stake to leave the matter to drift away. The first local emergency centre in the country is running well. After some extremely painful teething problems&mdash;one of the staff nurses happens to be a close neighbour of mine&mdash;it is now a fully recruited establishment. At one point it did not think that it would achieve that. It would be monstrous if all that were put at risk by the empire-building of one small group of people.</p>
	<p pid=".496.3/21">I welcome the fact that Kent county council's scrutiny committee has insisted that there should be a public consultation noting that the recommendation does not support the interests of east Kent. That scrutiny committee is led by an experienced doctor whose constituency lies far to the west of Kent, and I hope that that consultation will be a genuinely independent process. I urge the Minister to support the professionals in the East Kent Hospitals NHS trust and the people of east Kent, by rejecting this illogical and unbalanced proposal.</p>

	<p pid=".499.0/1">I apologise to the Minister for not declaring an interest in this debate. I should tell her that my constituency is in a curious position because it spans both hospitals. My constituents in and around Faversham&mdash;the Swale borough council area&mdash;almost all use the Kent and Canterbury hospital referred to by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" name="Julian Brazier">my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)</phrase>. My constituents in the Maidstone area benefit from the Maidstone hospital.</p>
	<p pid=".499.0/2">Having considered the matter as a whole, I am convinced that the proposal is very poor. There are five reasons for that. First, the Kent and Canterbury hospital has just got over a long and bitter fight concerning its future. Secondly, very specific undertakings were given by the Government, and there is a feeling that in sucking urology away from Canterbury, the proposal breaks the spirit, if not the letter, of that agreement. It certainly goes against the spirit of what the Secretary of State told my hon. Friend and me a short while ago.</p>
	<p pid=".499.0/3">Thirdly, it is immensely unsettling for staff. Many of the nurses who work in the hospital live in my constituency, and I have had many letters from them about the matter. Fourthly, there is the worry locally that sucking the service away will undermine the critical mass of the Kent and Canterbury hospital.</p>
	<p pid=".499.0/4">Finally, if one happens to live in Faversham or in the marshes beyond it, which have no public transport and are on a pretty dodgy road network, it is extremely difficult to get to Maidstone. Quite a lot of elderly and vulnerable people live in that area and, for them, getting to Canterbury is a reasonably viable proposition. Getting all the way over the top of the downs and turning right to go to Maidstone is extraordinarily difficult, and there is no direct public transport link from Faversham to Maidstone. For all those reasons, I entirely support my hon. Friend. I hope that the Minister will see fit to overturn the proposal.</p>

	<p pid=".500.2/1">I thank the hon. Member for Canterbury for warning me which issues concern him most.</p>
	<p pid=".500.2/2">I want first to say something about the significant progress made towards the objectives set out in the NHS cancer plan to reorganise, standardise and rejuvenate cancer services so that we can compare to the best in Europe. We are delivering better treatment more quickly to more people than ever before. Cancer mortality in the under-75s has fallen by over 12 per cent. in the past six years, which equates to around 33,000 lives saved. Some 99 per cent. of patients with suspected cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks of being referred by their GP, and in the hon. Gentleman's area nearly all suspected cancer patients&mdash;99.9 per cent.&mdash;received an appointment within two weeks at the East Kent Hospitals NHS trust. I am sure that he agrees that cancer services must continue to modernise to improve the service to patients.</p>
	<p pid=".500.2/3">We need to establish in Government how clear national standards and securing unprecedented increases in resources can contribute to empowering local health communities to deliver high-quality cancer services for their population. One way that we are doing that is to ensure that the NHS has clear guidance, and the NHS cancer plan set out the intention to make available authoritative guidance on all aspects of cancer care. The guidance is aimed at helping those involved in planning, commissioning, organising and providing cancer services to ensure that those services are organised to ensure appropriately high-quality care.</p>
	<p pid=".500.2/4">In September 2002, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence issued guidance on improving outcomes for urological cancers, which is being used as a framework for the NHS to ensure delivery of high-quality services for patients with those cancers. The guidance recognises that the diagnosis, treatment and care of a person with a urological cancer can be complex and is best provided by bringing together people with all the necessary skills, knowledge and experience. My understanding is that the patients requiring radical surgical management of bladder and prostate comprise less than 5 per cent. of the urology patients treated at the Kent and Canterbury hospitals.</p>
	<p pid=".500.2/5">There is, generally, an increasing demand for urology services. Therefore, it is highly likely that we will need to at least maintain the level of consultant cover, to ensure support both for all urological services and for the hospital in general. It is for that reason that the guidance recommends that all patients with urological cancer should be managed by multidisciplinary urological cancer teams. Another key recommendation, which was mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, is that radical surgery for prostate and bladder cancer should be provided by teams typically serving populations of 1 million or more and carrying out a cumulative total of at least 50 such operations per annum. I take on board the point that the hon. Gentleman made about there being 60 operations per annum at his hospital.</p>
	<p pid=".500.2/6">The NICE guidance is based on sound evidence, which is available on our website. It is supported by a wide range of key stakeholders, including the prostate cancer advisory group and signatories to the prostate cancer charter for action. It has been widely supported throughout the cancer network and community. The guidance is not about recommending change for change's sake but about considering how outcomes can be improved for future patients by centralising expertise in highly specialised fields. As I mentioned, there will be an increased need for other services in the area at local level.</p>
	<p pid=".500.2/7">As the hon. Gentleman is aware, responsibility for delivering cancer services rests with the 34 cancer networks that have been established throughout the country. In Kent and Medway, there is a local commitment to bringing specialist urological cancer services up to national standards. As the hon. Gentleman knows, specialist urological services are provided by East Kent Hospitals NHS trust, Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS trust, Medway NHS trust and the Dartford and Gravesham NHS trust.</p>
	<p pid=".500.2/8">Following the publication of the NICE guidance in 2002, the Kent and Medway cancer network agreed to undertake an external review to test the feasibility of centralising specialist urological cancer services for more radical treatments at one or two sites. The review was chaired by Mr. Mark Fordham from the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen Hospitals University NHS trust. He is one of Britain's leading authorities on urological cancers. The panel also included specialist urologists, oncologists, pathologists, radiologists, clinical nurse specialists and local service users.</p>
	<p pid=".500.2/9">I am aware that concerns have been raised locally about the review process. The hon. Gentleman has added his voice to those concerns. However, I am assured that the process was both thorough and objective and that the criteria used by panel members, and their relative weightings, were agreed by medical and surgical specialists from all local trusts providing that service.</p>

	<p pid=".502.0/1">The Minister is right on that point. However, crucial to those criteria was the agreement that quality of service should be high. I set out for the Minister in detail why the quality of service in east Kent was, by any objective measure, very high indeed. It is higher than in west Kent or in other parts of England and America. The measure that the panel used on quality meant something different. It was considering theoretical criteria so, absurdly, the same organisation with a service rated as excellent was deemed to be poor in the review process. The service did not meet the theoretical criteria, although the performance has been excellent on all the objective measures that I listed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.502.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" colnum="502"  time="16:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h05.htm#50720h05_spnew6">
	<p pid=".502.1/1">In addition to what the hon. Gentleman just said, he mentioned that an internal peer review carried out by the Kent and Medway cancer network last year praised the team and the work being done at Kent and Canterbury hospital. However, the peer review commented only on the current provision of services and did not inform the Kent and Medway cancer network on the future strategic direction of specialist urological services.</p>
	<p pid=".502.1/2">That is why we return to the NICE guidance about planning cancer services for the future. That was why the network had to commission an external review to consider how services throughout Kent could be brought in line with national best practice guidelines.</p>
	<p pid=".502.1/3">I hear what the hon. Gentleman said. I know that he has been in discussion with various people from the strategic health authority and other organisations. Although there is no doubt that the work at Kent and Canterbury hospital is to be praised, it fell short when lined up against other centres in the determination of which hospitals and sites were best served to provide the complex package of surgical procedures. That was a process that Kent and Canterbury hospital understood and contributed to.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.502.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" speakername="Julian Brazier" colnum="502"  time="16:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h05.htm#50720h05_spnew7">
	<p pid=".502.2/1">I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, but what she just said is incorrect. Kent and Canterbury did not fall short of any other centre. No other centre anywhere has been shown to be superior, to the best of my knowledge, and certainly not the other centres in Kent. All that it was found to fall down on were theoretical tick-boxes of population sizes and other factors, which were in the NICE criteria. In the actual measures of performance, it out-performed not just the rest of Kent but other comparable places in this country and in America. It performed far above the national average on all the performance criteria, such as length of stay and the proportion of people who were still continent at the end of the process.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-20.502.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" colnum="502"  time="16:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/halltext/50720h05.htm#50720h05_spnew8">
	<p pid=".502.3/1">As I have said, I do not doubt issues of performance and quality of care, but the review took into account a range of factors, in order to identify the best way in the future to provide the best services within that part of the country. That is not to say that no other services will be needed in other parts of the Kent and Medway cancer network area. As I said, patients requiring the radical surgery that we are discussing comprise less than 5 per cent. of the number of urological patients treated at the Kent and Canterbury hospital. After considering a wide range of issues, including performance, it was felt after the review that that hospital would not be included in the future site.</p>
	<p pid=".502.3/2">I hear what the hon. Gentleman says about the criteria and the weighting of scores, although he obviously disputes that weighting process. However, that is the conclusion to which the team came. It recommended that Maidstone hospital and Medway Maritime hospital should be the chosen sites. That recommendation was subsequently endorsed by all nine primary care trusts at a meeting in May 2005. It is important to stress that the proposals developed by the cancer network are about how to provide the best possible specialist urological, bladder and prostate cancer services for the future. The proposals are not about the relocation of the entire urological cancer service or about urological services as a whole. Under the proposals, the urology unit at the Kent and Canterbury will still have a key role to play.</p>
	<p pid=".502.3/3">I appreciate the concerns raised by the hon. Gentleman about the distance that his constituents and other residents in east Kent will have to travel&mdash;that point was also made by the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent. The external review team gave that consideration, but it was also impressed by the views of both hospital staff and service users that patients would be prepared to travel for higher quality specialist care. The result will mean that patients will get better care because the change in provisions represents progress towards national standards.</p>
	<p pid=".502.3/4">As the hon. Gentleman will know, the next steps on the matter have been discussed locally by representatives of primary care trusts, the Kent and Medway cancer network and the local authority overview and scrutiny committees. It was agreed at a meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-29">29 June 2005</phrase> that some form of further consultation on the proposals would occur. The Kent and Medway cancer network has been considering how that further review should best be implemented, and I understand that the chair of Kent and Medway strategic health authority has spoken to the hon. Member for Canterbury in the last few days.</p>
	<p pid=".502.3/5">This week, following legal advice, it has been decided that the PCTs in Kent and Medway will not implement their decisions about future radical bladder and prostate cancer surgery pending the outcome of a further review of the impact of the decision on services at Kent and Canterbury hospital. The hon. Gentleman made a number of points about whether there would be a knock-on effect on other services, which may feel that their future could be jeopardised because of other services moving away to another centre. That change in services is solely about specialised urological cancer surgery, and the east Kent review will consider the impact of the change in the Kent and Canterbury hospital. I hope that that will be an opportunity for the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent, and others, to take part in the process.</p>
	<p pid=".502.3/6">The overview and scrutiny committee process is meant to play a part in the issues. In preparing for the debate, I asked some questions about how that had been done. The Kent county council overview and scrutiny committee was contacted before the review was carried out and before the process of the review was agreed to determine how it wanted to be involved and whether at that stage it thought that any consultation was necessary. I am advised that in response it asked only to be kept informed. It was given an opportunity to comment on the criteria, and I understand that no formal response was received. It was given an opportunity to shadow the external review, and I understand that it did not offer any names.</p>
	<p pid=".502.3/7">I bring those points to the debate because it is important to have confidence in the overview of such processes and the way in which such discussions are held. It is important that the overview and scrutiny process works well and involves local stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid=".502.3/8">I have taken into consideration the remarks made by the hon. Gentleman, and also his concern. I urge him, the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent and their constituents to take part in the further review that the east Kent PCTs will undertake. The details will be announced locally, and I hope that all views will be heard. The PCTs throughout Kent and Medway will, I hope, be reassured that their final decision will deliver the best services.</p>
