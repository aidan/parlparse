<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-03b.167.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" speakername="Andrew Dismore" colnum="167"  time="010:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090203/halltext/90203h0002.htm#0902037000496">
	<p pid="b.167.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1881" name="Anthony Steen">the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen)</phrase> on securing this debate and on his tour de force of a speech. I will take your comments to heart, Mr. Olner, because he did not leave a great deal for the rest of us to cover.</p>
	<p pid="b.167.1/2">The Joint Committee on Human Rights, of which I am Chairman, has done a lot of work on the issue. We started an inquiry on it some three years ago and were all pretty horrified by what we found. The inquiry is still open, and we have been nibbling away at the Government throughout the period, as the hon. Gentleman has, to improve their response. Compared to three years ago, the situation now constitutes a significant and major improvement&mdash;I do not think that anyone would dispute that.</p>
	<p pid="b.167.1/3">One issue that we raised in our report following the inquiry was the lack of hard evidence about the scale of the problem. That issue remains. Operation Pentameter 2 was helpful in that it found 167 victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation. However, the figures also show how difficult it is to track down the traffickers, because many operate out of private homes, and many victims are unwilling to co-operate with the police or simply disappear. Like the hon. Gentleman, I am particularly concerned about child victims of trafficking. Operation Pentameter 2 discovered 13, six of whom were returned to their home country. I am very concerned that not enough is being done to protect those victims.</p>
	<p pid="b.167.1/4">A key issue on trafficking&mdash;the hon. Gentleman focused on victims, which I will address in a moment&mdash;is the importance of the police operation to track down, arrest and prosecute traffickers. I was concerned when I heard that the Government were withdrawing funding for the Metropolitan Police Service human trafficking team next year. I wrote to the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1887" name="Alan Campbell">the Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell)</phrase>, on behalf of the Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-09">9 December</phrase> about that, and received a prompt reply from him:</p>
	<p pid="b.167.1/5" class="indent">&quot;the Home Office has decided to provide additional one-off funding for the Metropolitan Police Service Trafficking Team&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.167.1/6">for 2009-10. Everyone will agree that the team is the country's leader but, obviously, that prompts the question: what will happen after that period? The reply stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.167.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Human trafficking is now part of core business for all police forces. This funding is designed to enable the MPS to mainstream this work into its daily activities in a planned and organised fashion&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.167.1/8">The inference is that the money will not continue beyond the financial year. We were told that the idea is</p>
	<p pid="b.167.1/9" class="indent">&quot;to find more efficient methods to mainstream this work effectively&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.167.1/10">but that is like trying to get a quart out of a pint pot. The MPS is always having its budget squeezed&mdash;London MPs have had lots of representations about that this year, as we do every year&mdash;and it would be very difficult for the team to be maintained in the absence of the relevant funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.167.1/11">The hon. Member for Totnes did a good job when he spoke about victim-focused issues. I entirely agree with him on the recovery and reflection period. When we investigated the matter, my Committee recommended a far longer period than the 45 days that is currently provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.167.1/12">I disagree with the hon. Gentleman on compensation to this extent: it is appropriate for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority to pay the compensation, because to do otherwise would lead to significant delays. The CICA is slow enough as it is, but if we rely on the proceeds of crime, which might be seized much later than the orders are made, the victims would go uncompensated for even longer. That money goes into central funds. He had a point when he said that it might be useful to earmark it for particular projects of a more general nature, but it should not be for individual compensation&mdash;that would simply lead to delays and further problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.167.1/13">The hon. Gentleman was right to point out the difficulties of accommodation. The Joint Committee received a note from the Home Office, in reply to inquiries that we made following a session last autumn with my hon. Friend the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing, saying that the Government are seeking to grant fund 55 intensive crisis refuge places for victims in England and Wales. However, that will not begin until the next financial year, as the hon. Member for Totnes said earlier. It is difficult to understand why we have a hiatus of three months or so before such things are put into place. The hon. Gentleman also made the important point that the POPPY project does not cater for under-18s, so we have something of a lacuna in the provisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.167.1/14">The Committee welcomes the decision to lift the reservations on the UN convention on the rights of the child. That is an important development, and I hope that it will lead to additional protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.167.1/15">The ratification of the Council of Europe convention has been a long and painful process. The hon. Gentleman's all-party group and my Committee were bashing away at it for some time, as were hon. Members in all quarters of the House. I do not know how many debates we had about the issue, but, eventually, they bore fruit, and, although the hon. Gentleman has highlighted many of the bad things that we have seen, dealt with and haggled for over the years, it has become apparent that we in the UK do receive international recognition for our good practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.167.1/16">We have much to learn from other places, however, and my Committee, like the hon. Gentleman, learned much from what happens in Italy. He and I went to the Inter-Parliamentary Union special conference in Vienna last year. We both made presentations to people from around the world, and it was linked to the United Nations conference. In April 2008, I was invited to speak at the IPU assembly as its rapporteur on the issue of people trafficking. Again, I described the good practice in this country and what ought to be done in other countries, so we are able to put our experiences to good use around the world. This week, we have the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference, which will focus on trafficking. Again, the hon. Gentleman and I will participate in it to try to spread our good practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.167.1/17">Although we beat up the Minister and the Government because of all the things that have not been done, we should not throw the baby out with the bath water. We should recognise that over the past three years, since the problem started to hit the news, we have moved on an awful lot.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-03b.171.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" speakername="Tom Brake" colnum="171"  time="010:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090203/halltext/90203h0003.htm#0902037000502">
	<p pid="b.171.1/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1881" name="Anthony Steen">the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen)</phrase> and other hon. Members, all of whom are articulate speakers and campaigners on this issue. I shall restrict my comments to allow the Minister time to respond to the many points that have been raised, perhaps at the start of her speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.171.1/2">Some 200 years ago, slavery was abolished by William Wilberforce's campaign, but about 12 million people are now estimated to be living in slavery, at least half of whom are children and many of whom are trafficked. We have thus not eradicated that scourge yet. The statistics are very depressing. A May 2000 report from the university of North London estimated that between 142 and 1,420 women were trafficked into the UK every year. The range of that estimate underlines the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> about how difficult it is to obtain accurate statistics about the scale of this problem, even though we know that it is significant and alarming.</p>
	<p pid="b.171.1/3">The profit from traffic in human beings amounts to about $7 billion a year. In financial terms, human trafficking is on a par with drugs trafficking, so that gives us an idea of the scale of the problem with which we are dealing. Estimates suggest that half a million women were trafficked into the European Union in 1995. Many Members have mentioned Pentameter 2. During that six-month operation, back in July 2008, 167 victims were found, including 12 children, and there were 522 arrests, with the seizure of &pound;3 million-worth of money and assets. Those statistics lead me to my first question. Is the Minister in a position to confirm how many of the people who were arrested were been taken to court and how many were convicted? What lessons have been learned from that operation, and are they now being implemented? UNICEF's report found that 183 of 330 trafficked children who were put into care in the UK later went missing, which leads to further questions about what work the Government are doing with local authorities to tackle that problem and to ensure that children who go into care do not simply disappear a few days later.</p>
	<p pid="b.171.1/4">The Council of Europe's timeline for taking action against the trafficking of human beings dates back some years&mdash;the oldest reference I have seen was from November 1996&mdash;so clearly this situation has been ongoing for many years. A recommendation was put to the Council in 1997, and much action&mdash;through many early-day motions, reports and so on&mdash;has been taken in Parliament. Obviously, it is pleasing that we have now reached the point of ratification, but it a great concern that that has taken so many years. I am sure that the Minister will argue that the Government have been taking action on other fronts&mdash;perhaps the most recent example is action on prostitution in the Policing and Crime Bill. However, there is not a unanimous view on the likely effectiveness of their approach, and there is a risk that their proposals will simply push prostitution further underground, perhaps leaving women even more vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="b.171.1/5">We have also heard references to the reduced funding for the Metropolitan police initiative, the welcome establishment of the Human Trafficking Centre and funding for the POPPY project. However, as the hon. Member for Totnes underlined, the latter scheme is available only to over-18s, and because it is based in London, it will not be readily accessible to people in other parts of the United Kingdom. Some progress is being made, however, and I believe that 25 places are available on the POPPY project. Has the Minister assessed the demand for such a service and, therefore, whether there is a shortfall in the number of places? If there is a shortfall, what plans are in place to ensure that additional provision is made?</p>
	<p pid="b.171.1/6">The convention has some clear benefits. The Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1887" name="Alan Campbell">the hon. Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell)</phrase>, confirmed in a letter that the Government believed that, in some cases, the 45-day period would be increased to 90 days or perhaps even longer. In what circumstances does the Minister expect the period to be extended from 45 days to 90 days or beyond? Various organisations, such as Amnesty International, are keen for the Government to deliver on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.171.1/7">The hon. Member for Totnes said&mdash;I think&mdash;that the Human Trafficking Centre would be the only specialist organisation able to investigate whether trafficking had occurred, but the look on the Minister's face suggested that that was news to her. Perhaps she did not believe that that was necessarily the case. I hope that she will clarify whether the Government have made a decision on what a competent authority is and that she will bear in mind the view of a variety of organisations that specialist organisations should be involved. That is our best chance of helping the victims of trafficking early on.</p>
	<p pid="b.171.1/8">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office explanatory note on implementation states:</p>
	<p pid="b.171.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Primary legislation through an amendment in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 ensured that automatic deportation of victims of trafficking under the UK Borders Act 2007 cannot take place where it would breach our obligations under the Council of Europe Convention against Human Trafficking.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.171.1/10">Will the Minister clarify whether the counterpart of that would be that in some circumstances&mdash;I assume that there are no such circumstances&mdash;the automatic deportation of victims would be allowed because it was not in breach of the UK's obligations under the convention? If there could be such circumstances, however, what would they be?</p>
	<p pid="b.171.1/11">I will draw my comments to an end to enable the Minister to respond, hopefully in some detail. Clearly progress is being made in this area. However, there are concerns about the effectiveness of the convention. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1767" name="Mike Hancock">the Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock)</phrase> has expressed his concerns that the convention might simply be ratified by many countries, but observed by far fewer. I hope that the Minister can reassure us about the effectiveness of the monitoring organisation that will be set up, with the group of experts. Will it be able to ensure that the very large list of signatories, from Albania to Romania, observe the convention?</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-03b.173.0" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-03c.173.0" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-03b.173.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1379" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="173"  time="010:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090203/halltext/90203h0003.htm#0902037000503">
	<p pid="b.173.0/1">I think that we should offer more than the conventional pieties of congratulation on securing a debate to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1881" name="Anthony Steen">the Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen)</phrase>. He and his all-party group have done extraordinarily good work in the past two and a half years. Unlike, frankly, most all-party groups, that group has moved the boulder a few inches up the hill, for which it deserves a lot of congratulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/2">The Conservatives are grateful that the Government have at last ratified the convention. We called for ratification as long ago as the beginning of 2007, not least because of the powers of my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes to persuade me and the then shadow Home Secretary, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2034" name="David Davis">the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase>. Having called for ratification for more than two years, it is good that we start 2009 with the position resolved. However, as has already been said, implementation of the convention is clearly key and the relatively slow progress that we have seen up to now is in danger of being repeated.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/3">I have some suggestions and questions for the Minister. One important point, although it has barely come up in this debate, is that we should not merge debates and disputes about human trafficking with debates and disputes about prostitution. That point was briefly referred to by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" name="Tom Brake">the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase>, who speaks for the Liberal Democrats in this area. However, previous debates on this issue have been almost entirely about prostitution, which is obviously a hugely difficult and sensitive subject in itself. My fear is that if the debates get merged, action on trafficking might be delayed. Not all prostitutes are victims of trafficking and not all victims of trafficking are prostitutes.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/4">For a few years now, many Members, including me, have been citing figures showing that one of the shocking changes in prostitution is that 85 per cent. of prostitutes working in Britain now come from abroad, and most are the victims of trafficking. However, in recent weeks and months, those figures have been questioned and there is now a legitimate debate about them. Therefore, I fear that framing legislation on combating prostitution might delay necessary moves against trafficking, which would be wholly counter-productive.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/5">Mr. Jorgen Carling, who has studied the trafficking of Nigerian women to Europe, says that</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/6" class="indent">&quot;it is rarely possible to draw the absolutely clear line that policymakers want between 'innocent victimhood' and 'willing participation'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/7">There is clearly a spectrum, so I hope that the Government will not get drawn into merging the two debates on prostitution and trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/8">I now want to talk specifically about trafficking. The steps that the Minister will take between now and April will clearly be welcome. As she has already heard from hon. Members from all parties, there will be some urging of faster movement and questioning about why we have to wait until April for the implementation of the provisions on the reflection period, the renewable one-year residence permit and the formal identification measures, which are the first steps that we are assured that the Government will take. I hope that she can give hon. Members an assurance that the Government will hit those target dates and address the practical problems raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes, particularly about the length of time of the reflection period.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/9">I would also like the Minister to deal with enforcement, as people have legitimately questioned the effectiveness of the policy. So far there have been 92 convictions for trafficking for sexual exploitation, and four for trafficking for forced labour. In 2008, 19 people were convicted of trafficking for sexual exploitation and, of those, four received suspended sentences. In 2008, there were four convictions for trafficking for the purpose of forced labour. The average length of sentence for the offence of trafficking is 4.69 years and the maximum sentence is 14 years. The Home Secretary has said, in response to parliamentary questions, that since 2006 the Home Office has invested almost &pound;4.5 million in the law enforcement response to human trafficking, and that 15 per cent. of the Serious and Organised Crime Agency's resources are committed to tackling immigration crime, of which trafficking is a significant part.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/10">Looking at those figures as calmly and objectively as one can, it does not seem that the amount of resources devoted to this is being reflected in the amount of effective enforcement activity. Even when the relatively few people who are caught and prosecuted go through the process, the sentencing seems relatively lenient compared with the maximum sentence that the Government have rightly put into legislation. I hope that the Minister will address those issues in her closing remarks.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/11">Thirdly, I hope that the Minister can respond to the recent remarks of the French immigration minister, who said that the problems at Calais&mdash;of which trafficking forms a significant subset&mdash;are essentially Britain's fault. He said that officials in London had failed to act against human trafficking and that there was poor border security at Calais. She and I are veterans of many debates over Calais, and everyone agrees that things have improved since the darkest days of the Sangatte camp and the large illegal movements across the border. I was not only disturbed by the remarks of the French immigration minister, but surprised. I hope that the Government were too, because if conditions at Calais are getting worse again, we will experience an increase in trafficking. Given the progress we have seen, that would be a significant and unfortunate step backwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/12">In addition to the questions that I wished to ask the Minister, I have some suggestions. She has already heard from various hon. Members that the POPPY project, while doing good work, is clearly constrained and should be allowed to take in girls under the age of 18, and perhaps to expand its reach geographically. We have also suggested the need for separate interviews at all airports for women and children travelling alone, or with an adult who is not a parent, guardian or husband, so that identification is easier; for better co-operation between the relevant Government departments and SOCA, because the lack of a properly coherent approach has dogged this issue for many years; and to ensure that each police force and each local government authority has a strategy for dealing with suspected victims of trafficking, because as my hon. Friend said, those who think that trafficking victims are only to be found in our big cities are, sadly, wrong&mdash;this crime also takes place in small rural communities. We also suggest that a proper helpline should be set up to provide information to women who have been trafficked and those who suspect exploitation. As an overall point, of course, we believe that there should be a proper border police force and that that force should have the necessary powers to act effectively against trafficking, as well as other cross-border crimes.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/13">In every debate that we have had on this topic, Ministers have had to curtail their remarks because responding to questions has taken longer than the time allowed, so I will conclude. I wish the Government well on this issue, but everything seems to be happening slowly and without enough of a sense of urgency. I hope that the Minister will convince us that that sense of urgency is now coming through in this important policy area.</p>

	<p pid="b.178.1/1">I will ensure that the hon. Gentleman receives an answer to his letter very soon. We are still considering the matter, but the POPPY project has been given Government money and work has been done to regionalise that. Not all NGOs want to be so closely associated with the Government that their core funding comes from the Government, so it is clearly a matter for discussion. We are still considering the matter and I will ensure that the hon. Gentleman gets a letter fairly soon.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.1/2">As part of our efforts to ratify and implement the convention, we have made some significant decisions, including the granting to victims of the 45-day reflection period, but longer if necessary. I think it was the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington who asked how we would decide whether it should be longer. The answer is that it depends on individual circumstances, and that is why we need to rely on the expertise of the UK Human Trafficking Centre. I am happy to write to him with more detail on how such decisions would be made, or to get the UKHTC to do so. We also offer one-year temporary residence permits in certain circumstances. Both measures go further than the minimum standards outlined in the convention, which are for 30 days and six months. We have therefore already set the bar higher, and I hope that European colleagues will learn from that.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.1/3">We are also setting up a national referral mechanism. It will be a nationwide system that will enable the proper and consistent identification of victims to ensure that they receive the necessary care and support. That applies to all victims of all ages&mdash;children as well as those over the age of 18. I hope that that addresses some of the points made by the hon. Member for Totnes about co-ordination and access for local forces and services. We will be making announcements in the near future about how that will work. We are working out the full details, but we will work collaboratively with all key external organisations, including non-governmental ones, whose expertise, as the hon. Gentleman said, has proved invaluable throughout, whether on the action plan, Pentameter or the convention.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.1/4">We have made an announcement on the competent authority function. There has been some concern about having a single competent authority, but we are considering something that is multi-agency and we are working closely with other partners. It is important that we set off with a body that can do the job well and effectively, but, once things have been going for a while, we can always look at how it is working. If hon. Members have issues and concerns, we will be keen to review the situation, and we will study the work of the all-party group and others. However, it is important that we start as we mean to go on, with an organisation that can do the job effectively, identify victims and provide support. Several organisations can refer to it. If the police find someone, they can work with a local non-governmental organisation, and that body can refer to the UK centre. It is important that we get that right.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.1/5">The competent authority will be based at the Human Trafficking Centre, and that will be the key, central point of contact. The UK Border Agency is a separate but linked competent authority. The link with immigration is important, because trafficking is often raised during an asylum claim. It would be foolish to decouple the two issues. Immigration is not always an issue, but that is a sensible approach, and in my work on immigration, the issues often arises.</p>

	<p pid="b.181.5/1">My hon. Friend makes an excellent point that has been highlighted in many debates in the House. I am sure that the Minister will take it on board and comment on it later. If there is a wish is to produce affordable housing on garden land developments, there is a problem, because such developments often fall below the quota level that a local authority requires to be able to insist that a proportion of the properties are made available for those needing affordable housing.</p>

	<p pid="b.194.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hancock. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> on securing the debate and on his comprehensive remarks&mdash;only soured somewhat at the end by a rather churlish coda, to which I shall return later.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.2/2">The sad thing about the tenor of the debate is that there is so much consensus on the main issues, and to be fair to the hon. Gentleman, he generously alluded to the role that my hon. Friends the Members for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) and for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) have played in promoting private Members' Bills and ten-minute Bills, and notwithstanding the efforts of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1823" name="Lorely Burt">the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt)</phrase>. We will hold the Government to account on their decision to instigate a review of garden grabbing. The Minister for Local Government said on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-14">14 January</phrase> in <i>Hansard </i>column 768W that, following the Planning Bill, it would be undertaken and concluded shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.2/3">We concede that the Government have made some progress on the specific issues that Members have raised over the past few years, and that they have talked about the importance of local development plans and the issuance of supplementary planning guidance to protect gardens from overdevelopment and separate them from other types of brownfield land. It would be churlish not to support that. They also brought in PPS3 on housing in April 2007 and referred to the powers under part 2 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 in respect of local development documents. The Government's attempt to strengthen strategic housing market assessments for local planning authorities is right, at least in theory, but as I shall make clear later, it is all very well doing that, but the reality is that planning applications are effectively decided by the Planning Inspectorate in Bristol, and under forthcoming legislation, by the regional development agencies.</p>

	<p pid="b.197.8/1">I accept your admonition, Mr. Hancock.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.8/2">I think the hon. Member for St. Ives and the Liberal Democrat Front-Bench team have missed an opportunity to focus on what we have worked together on, certainly since 2006. We have worked together sensibly, and he has sponsored a Bill promoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden. We both believe that garden development needs to re-examined so that we can protect gardens, and, which is more important, that there needs to be much stronger local control.</p>

	<p pid="b.198.0/1">It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hancock. Although I have enjoyed today's debate, I have, at times, felt slightly uncomfortable. Watching the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats sparring was rather akin to watching a man and wife have a fierce row.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> on securing this debate. He said at the start how lucky he was to secure the debate. I have to say that he seems to be incredibly successful in securing Adjournment debates. I recall responding to his debates on at least half a dozen occasions in respect of housing, planning and development. He serves his constituents extremely well and is extraordinarily knowledgeable about the situation. I also enjoyed the meeting that we had a week or two ago about second homes, which is an issue that really concerns him. I hope that we can have a follow-up meeting on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/3">The issues raised today have been very well rehearsed, not least in Opposition day debates, on private Members' Bills and during the passage of the Planning Act 2008. As has been mentioned several times, the debate is also very timely. We are shortly to make it clear how we propose to begin a review of the evidence of the extent to which development of gardens is taking place. Today has been a good opportunity to hear views before we take our final decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/4">In the time that I have, I should like to do two things. First, I want to set out the existing policy and planning framework, which local authorities can deploy to restrict developments in gardens. Secondly, as I have alluded to, I want to outline our plans to review this matter to ascertain the precise nature, scale and incidence of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/5">Let me start by talking about the existing policy framework. We have a robust planning framework in place to address so-called garden grabbing when it is considered to be a problem. The hon. Gentleman&mdash;because he is very knowledgeable about the matter&mdash;rightly put PPS3 at the heart of his argument. That guidance, which we published about two years ago, strengthened local authorities' hand on the quality and design of their buildings and their effect on the neighbouring environment, and reinforced the need for all development to be in suitable locations. Let me cite a number of the parts of PPS3, which are very relevant to today's debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/6">Paragraph 38 gives local planning authorities more flexibility to determine how and where new homes should be built in their area. They also have greater responsibility to ensure that the homes are built. Paragraphs 14 and 16 make it clear that local authorities can put strong emphasis on urban and green space&mdash;those very much welcomed green lungs&mdash;which includes gardens, parks and play areas. Crucially, paragraph 43 also gives local planning authorities greater powers to have particular policies in their area, such as setting out the circumstances in which the proposed development on back-garden land may or may not be permitted. If I have time, I might cite a number of local authorities that have just done that and taken advantage of PPS3.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/7">I also want to mention annexe B of PPS3, which gives local authorities a key power. It says:</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/8" class="indent">&quot;There is no presumption that land that is previously-developed is necessarily suitable for housing development nor&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/9">and this is the crucial bit&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/10" class="indent">&quot;that the whole of the curtilage should be developed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/11">In a nutshell, that demonstrates that local authorities are very much in the driving seat. Within their overall policy for the location of housing, they can decide how much reliance to place on previous residential sites, including gardens, as opposed to vacant and derelict sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/12">The idea that has been hinted at today&mdash;that central Government are dictating to local authorities and telling them to consider infill on gardens&mdash;is simply wrong and misleading. As the hon. Member for St. Ives said, it is cheap party political point scoring of the lowest order, and it should be stopped. Central Government are not saying that; they are saying that local authorities have considerable autonomy and discretion to decide the plans and the framework that are suitable for their particular area.</p>

	<p pid="b.201.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a strong point. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> said, appeals are an historic part of the planning process, and no one wants to get rid of what is perceived to be natural justice. If a local authority has a robust local development framework in place and it is tested through appeal, it will be in a strong position.</p>
	<p pid="b.201.1/2">In the hon. Gentleman's own area, the North Cornwall district local plan contains the following text&mdash;I believe that it is called HSG 3&mdash;to support its policy on intensification of residential use:</p>
	<p pid="b.201.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Restricting the subdivision of large garden plots therefore retains the environmental quality of these areas.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.201.1/4">So there is an idea that the council wants to strengthen it as much as possible. Brentwood's replacement local plan of 2005, for example, has specific policies reflecting local circumstances that any new development should reflect the character and density of the surrounding area and shall have minimum net plot sizes and minimum building line frontages.</p>
	<p pid="b.201.1/5">I do not wish to be party political about this, but the London Borough of Bromley&mdash;which is not yet the socialist republic of Bromley&mdash;has the following text regarding housing density and design policy. It is worth quoting to show what local authorities can do, and how they can be in the driving seat in this regard. It says:</p>
	<p pid="b.201.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Backland development, including development of land surrounded by existing properties, often using back gardens and creating a new access, will generally also be resisted. Private gardens can be of great importance in providing habitats for wildlife, particularly in urban areas. Except in Areas of Special Residential Character, such development, however, may be acceptable provided it is small-scale and sensitive to the surrounding residential area. Lower residential densities than those outlined in table 4.2 will usually be required and there should be adequate access. Additional traffic should not cause an unacceptable level of disturbance to neighbouring properties, and a high standard of separation and landscaping should be provided.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.201.1/7">That provides robust analysis and evidence to ensure that planning applications can be brought forward in that context&mdash;something that is important and places local authorities very much in the driving seat.</p>
	<p pid="b.201.1/8">I do not have time today to move to the second part of my contribution, relating to the review promised by my right hon. Friend in respect of the deliberations on the Planning Act, but I will write to those hon. Members who have contributed to the debate. It is an important point. Let me reassure&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.203.1/1">I always seem to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hancock, and it is a privilege to do so once again. I am delighted to have a chance to speak on a subject that might be slightly controversial, but something that I think that we can support. First, however, I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1924" name="John Penrose">the Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose)</phrase>, in whose constituency the barrage will be located. He has played a vital role in moving the barrage to its current state.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/2">My comments today are less about this Government and more about the operation of successive Governments. The problem is that, owing to their boldness, the plans for the Severn barrage have been on the drawing board since 1974, when I was still at school. They say that a week is a long time in politics; 35 years must be getting on for a bit of a record. I wish all Ministers well in their jobs, but I must remind a few people of the facts. Ministers, rather like barrage blueprints in Somerset, come and go quickly. If I were to list every hon. Member, living and dead, to have taken responsibility for this project, we would be here until well after bedtime and the snow would be falling again.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/3">I suspect that no one really wants to be responsible for making a decision. The Government have tried to confuse us&mdash;I say this in the nicest possible way&mdash;by deliberately changing the names of the Ministries in charge. Until very recently, barrage experts were all based at the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, which is known colloquially as &quot;brr&quot;&mdash;which is rather appropriate, given my struggle out of Somerset this morning. The Department has now become the principality of darkness and the Prime Minister's new best friend&mdash;dare I say it?&mdash;Lord Mandelson, is now in charge. Whatever I might think about the noble Lord, he has a very good nose for trouble. When he took over at BERR, the controversial subject of energy was promptly shunted off to another Ministry&mdash;of silly names, dare I say it?&mdash;the new Department of Energy and Climate Change. DECC has nothing to do with our famous northern friends, Ant and Dec, although I suspect that the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change might be looking at the barrage and saying, &quot;I'm a celebrity, get me out of here&mdash;quick!&quot; In short, the project is one of the most poisoned chalices faced by any Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/4">One of the problems is that the scientists are at loggerheads. Energy experts say one thing and the green lobby something completely different. They are complete rivals. Engineering firms are dying to win contracts, and consultants are crawling over everything for a fat fee, and that is not to mention a whole raft of do-gooders&mdash;unelected and unaccountable&mdash;and busybodies, such as my favourite whipping horse, Mr. Humphrey Temperley, who is in charge of the flood defence committee&mdash;God help us! He has managed to get himself on so many flood defence committees that he now wears wellies in bed, I am told. He is a menace to the success of this project.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/5">The Government have allowed all those different groups to deluge them with views over many years, which helps to explain why, after umpteen reports, inquiries and consultations, we are still discussing the idea, rather than the reality&mdash;I say that advisedly. Twenty two years ago, after 65 million quid of public money had been spent on surveys, the Severn tidal power group came out in favour of a barrage&mdash;great! However, the Government of the day fudged it. Seven years ago, the tidal power group revamped its findings, but the Government said that the project was too costly and might damage the environment&mdash;in other words, they fudged it again. The whole thing then festered until three years ago, when an outfit called the Sustainable Development Commission was given a big bung to do more&mdash;guess what&mdash;research. At our expense, it ordered no fewer than five new reports&mdash;wow! It also took a large volume of evidence from a wide range of organisations and consultants&mdash;cor! It also got stuck in the politically correct agenda, and I have to quote the commission because this is such appalling stuff:</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/6" class="indent">&quot;We undertook a programme of public and stakeholder engagement to explore opinions and attitudes towards tidal power in the UK and the Severn Estuary resource&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/7">In other words, it did more talking.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/8">Throughout this sorry saga, there has been too much talking and&mdash;I again say this advisedly&mdash;too little action. The project is now under the control of Ant and DECC, but Miliband minor may have actually come up with a few surprising signs of movement. Just a few days ago, the Government thankfully nailed their colours to the mast and produced a shortlist of possibilities, for which we are grateful. They have done the courageous thing: they have made a choice&mdash;sort of. The Government now have&mdash;wait for it&mdash;five different ideas for the Severn estuary, with plans for three possible barrages and two lagoons. First, there is the Shoots barrage up near the toll road over the Severn, which is estimated to cost &pound;3.2 billion and designed to generate slightly less than 1 per cent. of the UK's electricity&mdash;the rough equivalent of a very large coal-fired power station.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/9">Secondly, there is the Beachley barrage, which is slightly smaller and further upstream than the Shoots barrage. It is priced at &pound;2.3 billion, but it would generate much less electricity. Thirdly, however, there is the monster: the Cardiff to Weston barrage, between Brean down and Lavernock point, which could provide more than 5 per cent. of the UK's electricity. This is the one that the environmentalists&mdash;to their shame&mdash;really hate. Critics say that the birds will have nowhere to feed, that the construction might get in the way of shipping and that it could cause flooding.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/10">Next there are the lagoons: Fleming lagoon, over on the Welsh shore of the estuary between Newport and the Severn road crossing; and the Bridgwater bay lagoon, which will be on the English side of the estuary between Hinkley Point and Weston-super-Mare. This is the one that could really affect my constituency. Will the Minister give me cast-iron assurances today that a lagoon so close to Hinkley Point nuclear power station would not hinder its vital supply of cooling water or the outflow? She is well aware of the new developments at Hinkley and the possible building by EDF of two new reactors, but I wonder what the impact will be on the seaside holidaymakers who are absolutely crucial to that part of the coastline, not just in Weston-super-Mare but in Brean and in Burnham, which are in the constituencies of my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase>. Tourism is an absolutely vital ingredient of our local economy and we just cannot avoid to lose the seaside because of a lagoon.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/11">I sympathise with the dilemma facing Ministers. There are a great many unknowns, and I suspect that there always will be, but so much research has already been done that I wonder whether the latest round of consultations are a convenient excuse to put everything on the back burner again. As the Secretary of State might say about this case, &quot;My indecision is final.&quot; One might say, &quot;Shall we have lunch, Secretary of State? Perhaps you would like to see the menu? Perhaps not. Suppose we add some extra courses?&quot; When we look more closely at the Government's position, we find that they have actually announced that there will be yet another three-month consultation before any one of those five plans can be rejected.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/12">But hold on, there is a little more. An extra half a million quid of public money is about to be spent on developing other innovations, such as the tidal reef and the tidal fence. So, again we might be saying, &quot;Bring on the new technologies and let's have another hugely expensive public consultation exercise. How about next year&mdash;after lunch?&quot; It is up to the Minister to decide.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/13">Somewhere over the rainbow, perhaps after the next election, someone might make some sort of decision about this, but then again, perhaps not. I yet again urge the Minister to clarify what the Government would like. I represent Bridgwater and west Somerset. I am keen on using natural energy, if it works, but I am keener on keeping the lights burning in places such as Minehead where we need to keep people warm, so I am delighted&mdash;I mean this&mdash;that the Government have taken the future of nuclear energy seriously.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/14">EDF Energy now runs Hinkley B nuclear power station, which it has taken over from British Energy, and it plans to build new reactors on the site. Not only will that contribute enormously to the UK's energy needs and our energy security, but&mdash;more importantly, from a personal point of view&mdash;it will create vital jobs in the local economy and at our local colleges.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/15">The difference between nuclear power and harnessing the tidal flow is that nuclear has a proven record&mdash;it is possible to look at it both ways, but it has a proven record. The estuary has never been given a chance. Even in France, the tidal project that is up and running is Mickey Mouse compared to what we are looking to do in the UK. I applaud the Government for what they are doing, but there is no real equivalent anywhere in the world to a civil engineering project on such a scale.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/16">I live close to the Bristol channel. I have spent my time going down to the sea&mdash;occasionally wanting to chuck myself in when it all goes wrong&mdash;and watching the behaviour of oyster catchers and ringed plovers. I live in the most beautiful part of the world. However, to be brutally frank, I have witnessed swifter decision making by our visiting feathered friends. The water birds wade in the waves and get on with it. Dare I say that consecutive Ministers have wallowed and wavered? Yes, hon. Members have guessed it: the only winner after three decades of Government indecision are the blessed birds themselves. The Severn estuary is designated a special area for conservation. There is nothing wrong with that; in fact, it is absolutely right. I know that it is a special place&mdash;I live there&mdash;but this is why I tried to secure the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/17">Every year, up to 85,000 migrating birds pass through my constituency and stop off at our beautiful estuary, so there is an awful lot of flapping, squawking and carrying on. People cannot move for curlews and dunlins, and all sorts of greedy waders fill their beaks on the mudflats of Bridgwater bay. What will happen to those mudflats if one of these three barrages is built? Will the birds take off and simply fly elsewhere and, to be brutally frank, does it matter if they do&mdash;they are birds? I am not sure of the answer, but I do not know whether the Minister is sure, either, because this area has not been explored. The only people who say that they are sure are the bird lovers of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, who are forever on the local television, condemning everybody. The RSPB is so sure of itself that it has got involved in some high-powered and very expensive lobbying, which, I am afraid, makes the recent antics of a handful of Labour Lords look like chicken feed.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/18">The RSPB is backing the idea of lagoons as though it was the holy grail. It supports an American company called Tidal Electric, which says that it can construct shallow lagoons to trap incoming water and then release it through turbines when the tide goes back out. The RSPB paid for an impressive report by the British engineering giant WS Atkins, which handles huge Government contracts&mdash;for example, it takes care of the roads in Somerset&mdash;but the firm will write a report for anybody, providing they foot the bill, because that is the name of the game. Guess what? Atkins now favours lagoons&mdash;funny that, especially when it does a lot of work in Somerset.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/19">Meanwhile, Tidal Electric insists that its lagoons could generate almost as much power as the best barrage, but that that would cost the taxpayer absolutely nothing. It sounds like the bargain of a lifetime, but most bargains, as we Members of Parliament know, are too good to be true. We have free lagoons versus billions on the barrage. The cost of constructing the biggest barrage is already being talked about as being in the region of &pound;20 billion at today's prices, although it might be slightly more or less than that. For months, I had the uncomfortable task of sitting on the Committee that considered the Crossrail Bill and watching the public cost of Crossrail going up like a high-speed taxi meter in a gridlocked London traffic jam, which is rather pertinent given the conditions of the past two days. The cost of the barrage might be &pound;20 billion now, but by the time whichever Government makes the decision to actually build it, it will cost a few squillion more.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/20">Even the bargain basement lagoon will not be cheap and, as always, the taxpayers will end up footing the bill. I am afraid that I do not think that the lagoon will be free and I am certainly not seduced by the RSPB. No one has, to my knowledge, ever built a working lagoon of this size, but there are not a whole lot of working barrages like the ones planned for the Severn either.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/21">What I am getting at with this? Some 35 years ago, when the prime source of electricity in this country was coal, people started dreaming up ways to trap the energy of the sea, which was fantastic. I was 15 then, and I am heading for 50 in a month's time, yet we are still too far from that point and still too busy talking about whether it would be a good idea. We do not know all the answers&mdash;we accept that&mdash;and perhaps we never will, but we must try to understand.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/22">The gossip is that Ministers favour the big 10-mile barrage but do not want to upset the bird lovers by saying so. Britain is used to innovation; we are a country of innovation. Brunel left his mark on my part of England because he took risks. The time for shilly-shallying is over. I say to the Minister: please make the decision, build the barrage and to hell with the RSPB. Let us get the job done as quickly as possible.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-03b.207.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" speakername="Joan Ruddock" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change"  colnum="207"  time="012:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090203/halltext/90203h0008.htm#0902037000570">
	<p pid="b.207.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1451" name="Ian Liddell-Grainger">the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Liddell-Grainger)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the way that he presented his case. I am rarely amused in Westminster Hall, but I have been thoroughly amused this morning, and I thank him for it.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/2">The hon. Gentleman said that it had taken all of 35 years, and that he is familiar with it all. Coming from south Wales, and having been at school there, I am also familiar with the proposals over the period that he mentioned. For me, it was always an exciting possibility, but one that clearly had huge impacts on the local environment, no matter which side of the estuary one came from.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/3">As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change said at the launch of our first consultation on the issue last week, we want an open debate about whether a Severn tidal power scheme can help us meet our climate change and energy goals. Although it has been a long time coming, the consultation is serious and focused, lasting three months. It is occurring because we want to go to the next phase and make a decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/4">There must be an open debate with stakeholders, with the public and here in Parliament. To help inform that debate, we have published alongside the consultation document a number of detailed reports covering the range of issues under consideration. They include the scope of the strategic environmental assessment, the potential finance and ownership options, the regional economic impacts and a preliminary review of compensation and mitigation requirements under the habitats directive. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, who spoke at the Severn tidal power parliamentary forum last week, has already offered to hold two further parliamentary briefing sessions during the consultation to cover in more detail the economic and environmental impact work done so far in the feasibility study.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/5">Combating climate change while ensuring secure energy supplies is the biggest long-term challenge that we face. Hon. Members will know that we have committed to providing 15 per cent. of our energy from renewable sources by 2020 and adopted a domestic target of an 80 per cent. reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050. To meet those requirements, we will need greater energy efficiency coupled with low or no-carbon generation, including nuclear power and renewables. Our actions must be not only ambitious but fair and sustainable, and we must consider all reasonable options.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/6">In that context, consideration must be given to harnessing the power of the Severn estuary, with its phenomenal 14-metre tidal range. As the hon. Gentleman said, it could provide some 5 per cent. of UK electricity from a renewable, indigenous resource. It is a hugely important option. The Cardiff-Weston barrage, which he favours, could save 7 million tonnes of CO2 a year and have an operational life of more than a century, which would be more than equivalent to turning off two medium-sized coal-fired power stations.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/7">Of course, before we take a decision on whether to support a Severn tidal power scheme, we must understand all the pros and cons. As the hon. Gentleman said, that takes time. We must understand the potentially considerable effects on the estuary's unique and internationally important environment, the possible impacts on flooding, the impacts on the people and economies&mdash;he mentioned tourism&mdash;of the south-west and Wales and how a scheme could be financed and owned. Only when we have that information will we decide whether we want to support a scheme, and that decision will be a question of which of all the alternative low-carbon options offers the best, fairest and most sustainable way to meet our climate change goals.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/8">Over the past year, we have begun the work that we need to do, building on the valuable work done by the Sustainable Development Commission, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. We have assessed, in high-level terms, the costs, benefits and impacts of 10 possible schemes and are consulting on a list of the five schemes that we consider are technically and economically feasible&mdash;the schemes that we believe could be built. The consultation will cover the process used to move from the long list to the shortlist, the proposed shortlist and the proposed issues for further investigation, including the scope of the strategic environmental assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/9">As the hon. Gentleman said, the shortlist includes two lagoons&mdash;one proposed for Bridgwater bay and one on the Welsh shore of the estuary&mdash;a larger tidal barrage between Lavernock point and Brean down, known as the Cardiff-Weston barrage, and two smaller barrage proposals, at Beachley and Shoots. Those schemes vary in cost between &pound;2 billion and &pound;21 billion. They also differ in respect of potential environmental and regional impacts and the way in which they could be financed and owned. The hon. Gentleman has said that the taxpayer will always have to pay. That is not our assessment. We believe that there would need to be very serious public money for the Cardiff-Weston barrage because of the huge cost, but it is not impossible that some of the smaller proposals could be funded entirely by the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/10">All schemes would impact on the estuary's unique environment by reducing designated intertidal areas, displacing protected bird species and threatening migratory fish, with the scale of the impact varying between the different schemes. Clearly, that is why we have to assess all of them. More work will be done this year further to understand the scale of the potential impact on the environment and how those impacts could be mitigated or, if not mitigated, compensated for as required by law. We do not take threats to biodiversity lightly, but climate change is probably the greatest threat to biodiversity, not least through rising sea levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/11">All the schemes are likely to have, on balance, positive regional economic and employment benefits, with the Cardiff-Weston barrage potentially bringing 1,500 net additional jobs over a seven-year construction period and smaller schemes bringing an additional 500 jobs over a five-year construction period. Of course, we also recognise the potential impacts on the estuary's ports and other industries such as fishing and tourism, to which the hon. Gentleman alluded. Clearly, that has to be taken into account in any of these debates. As I said, the smaller schemes could be constructed by the private sector alone, but we believe that the Government will be required to help if the largest of the schemes goes ahead.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/12">The hon. Gentleman raised a number of points, particularly about the impact on Hinkley. We recognise that there is concern about flooding in the Severn region if a Severn tidal power scheme goes ahead. We will need in-depth investigation involving the Environment Agency to examine that issue. We already know that much more work will be needed over the coming year, but at this stage we do not expect the higher low-tide levels behind a barrage significantly to affect any upstream flooding caused by rain&mdash;the hon. Gentleman will be familiar with the major floods in Tewkesbury in 2007. It is even possible that some schemes could provide extra protection from flooding caused by strong storm surges from the sea. That was one of the aspects advanced in support of the outer barrage, which has not been included in the shortlist because we consider it simply unaffordable.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/13">The hon. Gentleman asked about the impact on Hinkley. Again, that needs to be fully understood and examined. The strategic environmental assessment that we are doing within the study will examine the impact of a Severn tidal power scheme on existing and planned infrastructure in the Severn estuary region. That is the assurance that I can give him: we are entirely mindful of the present infrastructure and any future developments. That all has to be taken into account. A decision on whether we want to support a Severn tidal barrage will have to take in the wider context of all our alternative options for meeting our climate and energy objectives. As he said, nuclear power will play an important part in meeting those objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/14">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the tidal reef and tidal fence. I want to say a quick word about those technologies, which are not on the shortlist. We are keen not to rule out those innovative new schemes but they are not sufficiently developed technically at the present time, so there must be more detailed evaluation if they become technically feasible.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/15">We are committed to considering the progress of those technologies before taking a decision in 2010, after a second public consultation, so that is why we will need to see what technical developments they can bring on stream in time for that second consultation. In order that those technologies should have a fair chance of being selected, we have provided &pound;500,000 of public money to examine them. They have their supporters, they are interesting schemes and we must give them a fair chance as we are progressing.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/16">The hon. Gentleman said that he thought that perhaps we just wanted to prevaricate further and put this issue on the back burner. I can assure him that that is absolutely not the attitude of Ministers. We have taken seriously our commitments on climate change and on renewable energy, and we know that this scheme could play a very significant part in meeting those commitments, so we are very keen to move ahead as fast as is reasonable, while treating consistently all the issues that must be discussed.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/17">We do not think that it will be possible to deliver on our climate change goals without radical action and without making tough choices. We are absolutely committed to ensuring that we take those choices in a way that is fair to people, communities and businesses, and in a way that is also sustainable. As I have said, we are also absolutely committed to entering an open dialogue on whether or not harnessing the vast power of the river Severn has a role to play in meeting our goals.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/18">I am so sorry to tell the hon. Gentleman this, because it is exactly what he does not want to hear, but to that end there will be a second public consultation. However, at that point, we will have so much more material&mdash;so much more concrete evidence&mdash;to put before people and it is only in that way that we can move towards making a proper decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/19">Meanwhile, I hope that all hon. Members will join in the current debate, keeping an open mind until we have the evidence we need to make an informed decision on whether or not we want a Severn tidal scheme to go ahead. I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving us the opportunity to have a very interesting exchange; I know that it will be the first of many that we will have.</p>

	<p pid="b.213.2/1">It is a great pleasure to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1692" name="Nia Griffith">the Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith)</phrase> and I congratulate her on securing this important debate. As she indicated, we follow two very important figures not only in Welsh politics, but in British politics: Jim Griffiths, a former deputy leader of the Labour party and the Minister who introduced national insurance; and Cledwyn Hughes, a predecessor of mine, the second Secretary of Wales&mdash;he followed Jim Griffiths into the office&mdash;who introduced the Welsh Language Act 1967, which was the first such Act. I am proud to follow my hon. Friend, and it is fitting that I do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.2/2">Jim Griffiths and Cledwyn Hughes believed in a Welsh identity in a British context. They believed that they could be proud to be British and proud to be Welsh, and saw no contradiction in those things. Both men were instrumental in promoting the legal status of the Welsh language through the 1967 Act. My hon. Friend alluded to some of the provisions, including the right to have forms in the Welsh language. The Act set that important precedent.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.2/3">Jim Griffiths and Cledwyn Hughes were pragmatists. They understood that problems of this nature had to be dealt with incrementally, so that people could catch up with the changes. They understood both what was practical and what could be achieved. It is important to refer to those very important parliamentarians&mdash;they graced Westminster and were well thought of for their Welsh identity, and for the way in which they represented Welshness in British politics.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.2/4">It will be no shock to the Minister that I am not a fan of ID cards per se, but the debate has moved on, and we are now looking at the practical elements and asking how to move forward. We should do so by introducing a Welsh text on to the ID card. Welsh identity is important. To many Welsh people, that identity is partly expressed through the Welsh language, along with history, culture, heritage, and a sense of belonging.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.2/5">I welcome the early attention that the Minister has given to Welsh text and bilingualism, and the discussions that she has had with me and other parliamentary colleagues. It is important to have such a dialogue. In the few minutes that I have to speak, I intend to say what I think is the practical way forward, so that our aspirations can be met.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.2/6">I am mindful of the debacle that surrounded the 2001 census&mdash;a Welsh box was not on the original forms&mdash;which rightly caused uproar. People in Wales felt that their identity was being sidelined. That situation will be rectified by the 2011 census, but if there had been greater consultation and dialogue prior to the database being set up, the debacle could have been avoided. There is no problem with it now, but there would have been no problem at all had there been such consultation. I thank the Minister for having such an open dialogue and, indeed, the Home Office for consulting more widely. As many of us in Wales say, the Welsh language does not belong to any one group, and certainly not to any one political party: it belongs to the people of Wales.</p>

	<p pid="b.220.1/1">I am pleased to have secured this debate, and I welcome the opportunity to put concerns to the Minister on behalf of my constituents. However, it is regrettable that so long after the identification of the problems with the tax credit system, mistakes are still occurring and even getting worse.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/2">Difficulties with tax credits cause stress and heartache at the best of times, but in this time of economic hardship, sudden demands for repayment could be enough to push many families over the financial edge. It is therefore more important than ever that the Government act to reduce the misery caused to families across Britain by the maladministration of tax credits.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/3">The fundamental problem with the administration of tax credits is that the system is too complicated. It is not only claimants who find it difficult to understand what their entitlements are; Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs officials have found the system so difficult to administer that an endless catalogue of mistakes has resulted in the loss of more than &pound;14 billion of public money through overpayments, fraud and error since April 2003. If the system is not simplified, that figure will surely continue to rise. In this short debate, I will highlight three major problems with tax credits: overpayments, underpayments and the worrying non-claiming of tax credits by many who are eligible.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/4">In 2006-07, one in five families claiming tax credits was overpaid, which means that some 1.2 million families were overpaid a total of &pound;1.1 billion by HMRC. In the past four years, nearly 2 million families have been overpaid more than once, and some 60,000 have been overpaid three or more times. Although the Government have acknowledged that there is a problem, the figures indicate that it has not been addressed. On the contrary, it has got worse: 400,000 more families were overpaid last year than the year before. The parliamentary ombudsman has referred to the situation as systematic maladministration.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/5">Let us be clear about the situation that people are in. After filling in all the forms and providing all the information requested, their lives are made a little easier by tax credit payments. Then one day, out of the blue, a letter drops through the door demanding the repayment of a large sum. Understandably, many families are shocked and anxious when they read such a letter.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/6">The average overpayment in 2006-07 was &pound;916, which is a considerable amount, especially when one considers that most claimants are families on low incomes. For many families, the overpayment is several thousand pounds, which is an unthinkable sum for a working family to have to find suddenly. Some of my constituents have been in that situation. One constituent wrote to me and said that they were &quot;traumatised&quot;. That is an intense word to use, but it describes what people feel when a financial bombshell is suddenly dropped on them. Dealing with the tax credit office can involve many phone calls and letters. A common feeling was summed up by one of my constituents who wrote:</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/7" class="indent">&quot;I am completely frustrated and disillusioned.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/8">Elizabeth O'Brien is a single mother in my constituency. When her son left school in 2005 and she continued to receive tax credits, she immediately contacted the tax credit office, both by phone and in writing, to check whether she was still eligible. Despite her efforts to keep the tax credit office informed of her situation, she was eventually overpaid &pound;1,982.92.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/9">Mrs. O'Brien was distressed when she came to my surgery and explained that she was having difficulty affording the repayments. She has even had to cancel her monthly &pound;8 union subscription. It is somewhat ironic that the policies of a Labour Government are leaving people unable to afford their union dues. Although the tax credit office was responsible for Mrs. O'Brien's overpayment, it refused to write it off so, at the rate of &pound;25 a month, she will be paying for the tax credit office's mistake until 2015. That is not an isolated case. The need for continual updates to claimants' information has caused huge difficulties. Surely it would be simpler to have a system of payments fixed on a six-monthly basis to reduce the risk of miscalculation.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/10">The system is so complex that even the tax credit office cannot seem to work out how much people are due. Another couple in my constituency, Mr. and Mrs. MacMillan, have received a number of contradictory letters. I have copies of two award notices&mdash;from <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-10">10 November 2006</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-06">6 December 2006</phrase>&mdash;that list exactly the same income for the couple, but give different award amounts. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-10">10 November</phrase>, the award was &pound;3,026.06, but less than a month later, using exactly the same information, the award was calculated as more than &pound;1,000 lower, at &pound;1,897.66. If the tax credit office cannot decide how much people are due, how on earth can ordinary people be expected to work it out? That, however, is exactly what the Government ask people to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/11">It is not uncommon for scanning or input errors at the tax credit office to result in overpayments. My constituent, Mrs. Gallacher, was overpaid almost &pound;5,000 after the tax credit office incorrectly recorded her and her husband's income as &pound;340 rather than the correct amount of about &pound;30,000. Although she had provided accurate information from the start, she did not spot the tax credit office's mistake, and the overpayments continued for more than two years. Mrs. Gallacher is a carer and her husband is a teacher. They have had to remortgage their house and are struggling on their current income, so the repayments demanded by the tax credit office are making life even more difficult for them. Like many others, they are unable to sell their home because of the present market. I wrote to the tax credit office about their case in December, but have so far received no response, and the money continues to be recovered. That couple now face the possible repossession of their home as a result of those problems. I would be grateful if the Minister would agree to look into that particular case and get an answer for my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/12">More generally, I ask the Minister to offer all claimants a statutory right of appeal against overpayments and to write off overpayments that result from official errors. If nothing else, that might be an incentive for the tax credit office to get things right. In cases in which the tax credit office, not the claimant, has made an error, surely the office should carry the burden of proof, instead of expecting claimants to identify its mistakes.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/13">Another of my constituents, Claire Robertson, was able to resolve problems with an overpayment, but then found, when she went to the cash point one day, that &pound;6,000 had been put into her account with no explanation or warning. Given her past experience, she was understandably suspicious. She said:</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/14" class="indent">&quot;I was yet again left in a state of shock and disbelief. Not being able to obtain any details relating to the transaction until Monday morning I once again had a worrying weekend. It transpired that the money was an automatic pay in from Tax Credits for an amount oustanding! I feel the manner in which this institute deals with people's lives and emotions is disgusting. First of all I am facing legal proceedings with an amount of approximately &pound;10,000 now I receive &pound;6,000 with no explanation or warning. I don't think my nerves can take much more.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/15">These cases demonstrate that whether a mistake has been made by the claimant or the tax credit office, and even when the claimant has diligently contacted the tax credit office to point out its mistakes, the claimant is still made to suffer, often through many years of repayment. At a time when the Government are keen to be seen as cracking down on benefit fraud, this system provides a disincentive to claimants to demonstrate honesty in coming forward when a mistake has been made. More and more families are being taken to court over this issue by HMRC, and the average number of court cases each month in this tax year is nine times higher than that in the previous year. Between April and October 2008, 5,697 families were taken to court to recover money that was lost through overpayments, and all at the expense of the taxpayer. Not only is HMRC so cavalier with taxpayers' money that it pays out too much to more than a million families, but it then compounds its mistakes by starting thousands of costly court actions.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/16">Overpayments are not the only problem&mdash;there are also many underpayments. Since 2003, 3.3 million people have been underpaid tax credits; again, those mistakes have often happened multiple times. Some 555,000 families have been underpaid more than once, and 82,000 have been underpaid three times or more. In 2006-07, 135,000 families were underpaid by more than &pound;1,000, and 326,000 families on an annual income of less than &pound;15,000 were underpaid. Missing out on &pound;1,000 of income would be extremely difficult at the best of times, but in the current economic climate, the impact will be felt even more deeply. Hard-pressed families deserve that money and need it to buy basic groceries and children's clothes, and to pay essential household bills.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/17">In 2004-05, HMRC estimated that only 61 per cent. of eligible families claimed working tax credit and that 82 per cent. claimed child tax credit. Some of the people who are not claiming simply do not know that they are eligible, while others say that the claim procedure is too complicated. Perhaps most worryingly still, others, including some of my constituents, have claimed tax credits in the past but have decided not to do so again because they had such a bad experience the first time. A system that was meant to help people has proved so frustrating and worrying, and caused so much misery, that people are now reluctant to claim. That is a truly damning indictment of the tax credit system.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/18">In 2001, when the Government announced the introduction of the working tax credit and the child tax credit, the then Paymaster General, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" name="Dawn Primarolo">the right hon. Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo)</phrase>, announced in a press release:</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/19" class="indent">&quot;The Government is delivering on its promise to introduce a new streamlined system of tax credits&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/20">and</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/21" class="indent">&quot;will provide a secure stream of income for children, whether parents are in or out of work&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/22">However, it became clear early on that the system was not as streamlined as promised, and in 2005 the right hon. Lady announced:</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/23" class="indent">&quot;The Government has looked to learn from the early operation of the system and will continue to do so.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/24">The cases I have described and many others like them clearly demonstrate that, more than three years on, the complexity of the tax credit system is still a fundamental flaw. If the Government's objective was to provide a secure income stream for families with children, they have, by their own standards, failed. As the cases I have cited show, claimants feel anything but secure. Why has the application system not been simplified to eradicate the problems that the tax credit office is having in processing them correctly? Given the complexity of a system in which nine out of 10 families are eligible for some means-tested tax credits, would not it be more sensible and cost-effective to use the existing universal benefits system? Will the Minister at least consider an official review of the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the present system?</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/25">I conclude with the words of one of the many people who have suffered at the hands of the tax credit system. After one of my constituents had the particularly harrowing experience of receiving a letter from the tax credit office demanding &pound;17,000, she wrote to me stating:</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/26" class="indent">&quot;I wish I had never received family tax credits and not because I do not think it's a wonderful concept, but because of the way it is implemented. This has to stop.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/27">I quite agree, and I look forward to the Government's response.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-03b.223.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1563" speakername="Stephen Timms" speakeroffice="The Financial Secretary to the Treasury"  colnum="223"  time="013:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090203/halltext/90203h0011.htm#0902037000584">
	<p pid="b.223.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> on securing the debate. She has made several important points and raised some cases from her constituency, and I am concerned to hear what she said about them. If she wants to drop me a line about those, I will certainly investigate for her.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.0/2">Tax credits provide support to almost 20 million people in this country, in around 6 million families and including 10 million children. In the hon. Lady's constituency the average award is &pound;3,820 a year, which according to the most recent figures is above the national average&mdash;by December 2008, 5,700 families and 8,800 children in East Dunbartonshire were benefiting from them. Tax credits have been central to reducing the tax burden on low to middle-income families, helping to ensure that around four families in every 10 in Britain pay no net tax at all.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.0/3">Tax credits play an important part in helping the unemployed move into work and those who are in work to move up the employment ladder, ensuring that work pays more than welfare. They have also played a key role in reducing child poverty: as a result of all the changes to the personal tax and benefits system since 1997, families with children in the least well-off fifth of the population are now an average &pound;4,100 better off in real terms, and that will rise to &pound;4,400 in the new financial year.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.0/4">The hon. Lady raised some points about take-up, but the take-up of tax credit is actually very high when compared with all previous in-work family support programmes, and low-income families are the most likely to take up their entitlement. The latest figures show that in 2005-06 the take-up of child tax credit was 82 per cent., with over 90 per cent. of the money available being claimed. Take-up among those with incomes of less than &pound;10,000 a year is now 96 per cent., which is up from 93 per cent. in the first year of tax credits. That is significantly higher than for any previous system of income-related financial support for in-work families. Take-up was 50 per cent. in the early years of the family income supplement, 57 per cent. for family credit and 65 per cent. for the working families tax credit. Of course, we would like the numbers to be even higher, but it is clear from the figures that there is no widespread phenomenon of people having claimed once and choosing not to do so again. I hope that nobody is in that position; at any rate, it is not a widespread problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.0/5">The Government want to ensure that as many families as possible take up the available help. We have set up a taskforce of experts from local authorities and the third sector, which will report in the spring with advice for local authorities on how to improve further the take-up of tax credit and benefits. We are also taking steps to ensure that childless workers claim and receive the support to which they are entitled through working tax credit. In the 2008 pre-Budget report, the Chancellor drew attention to initiatives to increase take-up of such assistance. In particular, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs has been working in partnership with other organisations to promote working tax credit in new ways. HMRC is extending its marketing of the credit to 44 organisations with 660,000 employees.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.0/6">In the year ahead, HMRC will aim to increase coverage further, working with employer corporate social responsibility programmes and using the national employment partnership to draw employers' attention to working tax credit and the opportunities for their employees. HMRC will also work alongside Jobcentre Plus to ensure that people who find a job through a jobcentre also get advice on the tax credit support available. A big programme of work is under way to ensure that people take up the help available to them, so that we can increase further the already high rates of take-up of tax credits.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.0/7">The hon. Lady was right to draw attention to some of the difficulties, especially in the early days of tax credits. However, matters have improved considerably since then and HMRC is generally, but not invariably, providing a good service. I recognise, however&mdash;the cases to which she referred underline this&mdash;that there is room for further improvement. I am optimistic that the tax credits transformation programme will lead to a substantial improvement. It started in 2006 to improve the services that families receive. Through that programme, HMRC aims to provide the help that tax credit customers need when they need it. It involves a new set of services and communication products tailored to customers' needs. Four new national services have been introduced and the programme is building on this with further pilot projects with a view to implementing them at national level once they have been proved. For example, the first of them will help customers at a difficult time in their life&mdash;during a breakdown of a relationship. That service allows HMRC to take the new claim over the phone in just one call so that the customer can get back into payment with, potentially, no delay.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.0/8">In last year's Budget, we announced a number of additions to that programme, including: increased proactive support for vulnerable customers renewing their tax credit claims; the roll-out of new services to make claiming tax credits easier and quicker; greater engagement with customers to ensure that they report changes affecting their awards and that could lead to overpayments if not reported; the introduction of more robust identity authentification of tax credit customers; new communications and guidance to ensure that people have more accessible information, allowing them either to take the right action or know where to ask for help to take it, and work with the national network of children's centres set up over the past decade to identify the best way to deliver tax credit advice and services to families with children under five. On that last point, HMRC officers have been going into children's centres&mdash;I have spoken to officials at children's centres in my constituency&mdash;and finding valuable channels through which to provide the information on tax credits that parents need. A great deal of work is being done to improve the service, although I recognise that there is further scope for improvement. HMRC is committed to making whatever potential for improvement exists into a reality.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.0/9">End-of-year adjustment leading to overpayment had already fallen very significantly in 2006-07. I think the hon. Lady was referring to 2006-07 when she said that the number of overpayments had gone up, but that is not correct. The number of overpayments fell sharply in the period, by roughly a third, to &pound;l billion, as a direct result of the successful implementation of a package of measures to improve tax credits announced by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, the then Chancellor, at the pre-Budget report in 2005. That might be the package to which the hon. Lady was referring. The current level is less than half what it was in the first year. Overpayments constitute only 5 per cent. of gross spending on tax credits, which is ahead of the projection that was made in 2005 for the fall in overpayments that would follow from the changes that we announced.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.0/10">The number of families affected by overpayments is down from 1.9 million to 1.3 million, and the average overpayment is down from &pound;827 to &pound;738. In the hon. Lady's constituency, the number of families affected is down from 2,200 in 2003-04 to 1,300, bringing the total amount of money down by more than a half, from &pound;2.1million to &pound;800,000. Of course, she is right that a single overpayment can still cause real problems, but I wanted to underline how significantly lower the number of instances is. We want to do better in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.0/11">The policy on recovering overpayments is set out in HMRC code of practice 26, entitled, &quot;What happens if we've paid you too much tax credit?&quot; which was significantly amended at the start of last year. Previously, the policy was that an overpayment was written off if there was an official error and if it was reasonable for the customer to believe that their award was correct. However, the &quot;reasonable belief&quot; test caused serious concern, particularly because people's views on what is reasonable can vary greatly.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.0/12">We replaced that test in COP 26 with a much clearer test that sets out HMRC's and customers' responsibilities for checking factual information. In effect, it represents a contract of responsibility. It builds on the existing practice of giving customers the responsibility for checking the factual information that HMRC plays back to them: for example, how many children they have and their income. HMRC also expects customers to check that the amount going into their bank account matches the amount in the award notice.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.0/13">This is important, and I am keen that hon. Members draw their constituents' attention to it: if people check the accuracy of the information that is obtained from them, which is set out in the award notice that is sent to them, and check that the amount that is paid into their bank account matches the amount set out on the award notice, they have done all that is required of them. There is no expectation that they will know the formula, and they will not be expected to check the calculation. If there is an overpayment as a result of an official error, but the customer has met his or her responsibilities as I described, by checking the accuracy of the information on the award notice, the overpayment will be written off.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.0/14">The hon. Lady drew to hon. Members' attention, perfectly fairly, to a case in her constituency, which I am aware of, where the award notice stated a household income of &pound;340 when it was actually &pound;34,000. If the recipient had informed the tax credit office of that error on the award notice, there would not be a recoverable overpayment. It is important that people check those notices and that if they find a mistake they let the tax credit office know. Once they have done that, their position is protected.</p>
