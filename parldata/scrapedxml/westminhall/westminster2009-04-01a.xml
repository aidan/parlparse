<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-01a.240.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1791" speakername="Jeremy Wright" colnum="240"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090401/halltext/90401h0001.htm#09040159000541">
	<p pid="a.240.1/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman, and I hope that he listens to that part of my speech when, as he correctly predicts, I come to it a little later. He is absolutely right, and emphasises my point that we simply cannot afford to ignore dementia, yet for years we have effectively done just that.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/2">The Minister's predecessor used to say that his objective was to bring dementia out of the shadows. With the help of campaigning groups such as the Alzheimer's Society and some immensely courageous individuals, the Government have largely succeeded in that objective. Dementia is unquestionably higher up the political agenda than even two or three years ago. But now that we have the strategy and it stands in the glare of new-found and welcome public attention, it is vital that it stands up to scrutiny, so we must discuss what happens next: how will the strategy be put into practice? I hope that the debate will focus on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/3">The national dementia strategy is wide-ranging, as it should be, and I cannot do justice today to everything in it, so I shall concentrate on several aspects of what it seeks to achieve. I shall begin in a logical place&mdash;diagnosis. The strategy recognises that we do not diagnose dementia as often and as early as we should. Unless a sufferer's dementia is identified, none of the strategy comes into play. Encouragingly, the Government have said that they intend to look at the training of general practitioners so that those who are often confronted first with the early signs of developing dementia may have more confidence to make the appropriate diagnosis. Perhaps the Minister will update us on precisely what is to be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/4">We all recognise that general practitioners are just that&mdash;general practitioners&mdash;and cannot be expert in every condition. They must also have the opportunity to refer to specialists, as the strategy states. It is crucial that following diagnosis, appropriate advice and support is offered, and I am pleased that the strategy both recommends that and recognises that the voluntary sector has a lot to offer in fulfilling that role. It is not only GPs who need more training. Objective 13 of the strategy refers to</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/5" class="indent">&quot;An informed and effective workforce for people with dementia&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/6">As the Minister knows, the all-party group on dementia, which I chair, is working on an inquiry into the training needs of those who provide care for people with dementia in residential care homes or in their own homes. I do not want to pre-empt any conclusions, but I want to make some personal comments about a matter that is crucial to the strategy's success.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/7">Given that two thirds of the care home population is estimated to have some form of dementia, it is shocking that no training in dementia is required for those who work in care homes. How can good quality care be provided to those people if those providing it have no real understanding of the condition? Surely we must have such training for all those who work with the elderly throughout the health and social care sectors, and we must have it soon. That is why I am worried about what the strategy impact assessment says. Paragraph 5.109 on page 30 states that</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/8" class="indent">&quot;in developing the strategy we have become aware of the complexity in making change to undergraduate and vocational curricula and in terms of securing the ability to deliver training in social care settings, especially those that are outsourced or provided by private companies. We have therefore made such change a longer-term goal that needs to follow a period of at least two years detailed consultation and joint development work co-ordinated by the Department but including all training providers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/9">I hope that the Minister can reassure me that the sense of urgency that should run through this part of the strategy is present in Government thinking. If the Government are to succeed&mdash;I fervently hope that they will&mdash;in persuading providers and commissioners of care to pay much more attention to the need for the caring work force to understand dementia better, we must ask who will provide the necessary training. The strategy deals with that on page 29 and states:</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/10" class="indent">&quot;There is currently a range of training and education providers in dementia care but there is no nationally recognised system of quality assurance. Some form of 'kite-marking' of good practice would assist commissioners and care providers in selecting effective training.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/11">That seems to understate the problem. If the market for training expands, as it must, so will the number of signs above doors stating &quot;dementia trainers&quot;. There must be a way to distinguish which training providers offer a product of the requisite quality, and again I hope that the Minister can offer us some reassurance on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/12">I would also like some reassurance on anti-psychotic drugs. As the Minister knows, the all-party group produced a report on the subject last year, which concluded that the over-prescription of such drugs for people with dementia was widespread and had very damaging consequences. We made several recommendations about how such overuse might be reduced, so we were pleased that the Department of Health press release of <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-19">19 June 2008</phrase>, which announced the consultation on the national dementia strategy, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/13" class="indent">&quot;The Government's announcement today includes a number of immediate actions, as well as other proposals which will be consulted on over the coming months. These include: An immediate review&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/14">that was first in the list&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/15" class="indent">&quot;into the prescribing and use of anti-psychotic drugs to treat sufferers of dementia. This work will be completed before the publication of the National Dementia Strategy in the Autumn.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/16">We know that the timetable for publishing the strategy itself was subject to change, although I do not want to cover that this morning. The point that I do want to draw from that quote is the sequence to which it refers, of a review of anti-psychotic drugs coming before the strategy's publication. That sequence is important because if, as we concluded in the report, the overuse of those drugs is a serious problem for people with dementia and the solution is to be found in better training of staff, more frequent reviews of medication and closer involvement in prescribing of family and friends, among other things, all of which are central to other objectives of the national dementia strategy, it would surely be sensible to integrate the response to the over-prescription of anti-psychotic drugs into the strategy itself.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-01a.243.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1791" speakername="Jeremy Wright" colnum="243"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090401/halltext/90401h0001.htm#09040159000545">
	<p pid="a.243.1/1">I am always gratified to be in tune with the mood of the House, and once again the hon. Gentleman anticipates something that I am going to say. I agree entirely: it is right to be concerned about the lack of ring-fencing. There is another issue of concern, too. I am conscious of the time and that other hon. Members wish to speak, but I wish to make two more points. The lack of ring-fencing is one, but if he will forgive me, I shall deal with the other first.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/2">I hope that today marks a new dawn in the regulation of dementia care&mdash;a matter that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1770" name="Paul Truswell">the hon. Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell)</phrase> raised. During the last all-party group inquiry into the overuse of anti-psychotic drugs, we took evidence from the Healthcare Commission and from the Commission for Social Care Inspection, and the gap between them was striking. In essence, CSCI told us that it was not responsible for regulating the prescription of those drugs, because drug prescribing was a health care matter, and the Healthcare Commission told us that it was not responsible for it either, because the drugs were being used in a social care setting.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/3">The creation of the Care Quality Commission, which begins work today, means that the gap has disappeared. As a regulator of both health and social care, it can, I hope, do a great deal to improve dementia care, which, as we know, awkwardly straddles the artificial boundary between the two. However, the CQC will need to focus on dementia care to make that happen. Therefore, will the Minister tell us today that dementia will be a priority for the CQC, as well as for the health and social care systems that it regulates?</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/4">Finally and perhaps inevitably, we need, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1454" name="David Lepper">the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper)</phrase> said, to talk about money. When the national dementia strategy was published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-03">3 February</phrase> this year, the Department of Health press release that accompanied it referred to</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/5" class="indent">&quot;The first National Dementia Strategy, backed by &pound;150 million over the first two years&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/6">I think that most of us who read that press release assumed that that was &pound;150 million of new money and that it was to be devoted to delivery of the dementia strategy. I am not sure that we were right to assume either of those things.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/7">I had a letter from the chairman of my local PCT. He wrote to me, in part about the strategy, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-03">3 March</phrase>, and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/8" class="indent">&quot;The PCT and Warwickshire County Council are planning to consider together how to deliver the Dementia Strategy through redesign of existing spend, given the financial challenges facing both the Council and the PCT currently.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/9">That, as hon. Members might imagine, caused me some concern, given what I had read about &pound;150 million of apparently new money, so I asked the chairman of the PCT for clarification of what he meant by that statement. In his letter of <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-12">12 March</phrase>, he gave this explanation:</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/10" class="indent">&quot;The money does not come ring fenced&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/11">just as the hon. Gentleman said&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/12" class="indent">&quot;and alongside of the block funding come a number of priorities that the Government would like the local health and social care economy to address. The local health and social care economy then has to decide how it prioritises addressing these within the block funding, and on a value for money basis, what possibilities exist within existing funding streams for service redesign.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/13">My point is not that it is wrong in principle for local PCTs to have a degree of discretion over how they spend their money. However, it is interesting that the Minister himself had given further clarification a few days before, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-24">24 February</phrase>&mdash;again in answer to a written question from my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire. He explained:</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/14" class="indent">&quot;The &pound;150 million is revenue, not capital expenditure. It is being made available as part of primary care trusts'...overall general allocations. These are increasing by 5.5 per cent. in each of 2009-10 and 2010-11, a total increase of &pound;8.6 billion over the two years of which the dementia funding is part. PCTs have flexibility over the use of these resources in line with the operating framework.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-02-24.640"><i>Official Report</i>, 24 February 2009; Vol. 488, c. 640W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/15">The operating framework was published with the revenue allocations to which the Minister referred in that answer on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-08">8 December 2008</phrase>&mdash;almost two months before the national dementia strategy was published. It is true that the operating framework mentions dementia as one of the priorities to be determined and set locally by each PCT, but there is nothing like the detailed guidance provided by the strategy. It is clear that the &pound;150 million mentioned in connection with the strategy is, as the hon. Gentleman said, not ring-fenced for delivery. Nor is it impossible that PCTs and locally authorities will already have decided their spending plans for the next two years before even having laid eyes on the dementia strategy. If that is so, how can we be sure that the funding necessary to deliver the strategy's objectives will be available?</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/16">In conclusion, I say again that I welcome the strategy and I again congratulate the Government on introducing it. However, none of us can go on simply taking curtain calls for its existence; we must make it a reality and make it work for the people with dementia who need it. I do not doubt the Minister's commitment to the task or the commitment of those who work with him on it, and nor do I doubt the difficulty of that task. However, I ask him to take this opportunity to deal with the points that I have raised and to use this debate to discuss the next steps in addressing this fundamental challenge, which we are no longer ignoring, but which we are still some way from defeating.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-01a.245.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="245"  time="009:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090401/halltext/90401h0002.htm#09040159000546">
	<p pid="a.245.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1791" name="Jeremy Wright">the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright)</phrase>, who is almost a neighbour of mine. He has a long-standing interest in this issue and is always lucid and thoughtful in debates on it. I congratulate him on securing this urgently needed debate at the fourth or fifth time of asking.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/2">As was his custom, Albert Einstein neatly captured the essence of a broader ill in society when he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/3" class="indent">&quot;The intuitive mind is a sacred gift, and the rational mind its faithful servant. We have created a society that honours the servant and has forgotten the gift.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/4">For a long time, Governments of various colours could be accused of having forgotten the gift. While other terrible diseases, such as cancer and heart disease, have benefited from long-term research funding, the same cannot be said for dementia, and the difference in the improved treatment and understanding of those other diseases is clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/5">With the advent of the national dementia strategy, however, there has been some hope of a cogent and coherent plan to tackle this terrible condition, which affects more than 1,000 people on average in the constituency of every one of us in this Chamber and in this House. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, the strategy is welcome and a huge step forward. We acknowledge that, and its contents are certainly encouraging.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/6">As some hon. Members may be aware, I introduced a ten-minute Bill on the management of dementia in care homes during the previous Session. On work force planning and training, one of its objectives was to make dementia training, including the use of antipsychotics, mandatory for care home staff, because it is not mandatory at the moment. As the hon. Gentleman said, that is shocking, and I will return to the issue later in my contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/7">I would like to spend a few moments talking about the relationship between the national dementia strategy and last year's carers strategy, which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1454" name="David Lepper">the Member for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper)</phrase> mentioned in an intervention, before turning to how we can combine them with better training and support for professional carers to ensure that we continue to cherish our cognitive gift, even once dementia has begun its remorseless ravages.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/8">Ultimately, the aim of a national strategy for the treatment and care of dementia patients should be the balanced provision of services, with home care and family support wherever possible, and professional care from suitably trained and qualified carers based on need. Two thirds of dementia patients live at home, with the remaining third in the residential care system. The carers strategy is therefore clearly central to supporting family carers in delivering improvements, and the seventh objective of the national dementia strategy, in which the Government acknowledge the necessity of joint working between the officials responsible for delivering the respective strategies for carers and dementia, is welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/9">Although it is worth noting that carers' benefits remain untouched by the carers strategy, I welcome carers' access to more and longer breaks from their duties, the provision of more support by the NHS locally, the extension of the new deal for carers and the recognition of young carers' needs. Such things have clear benefits for all carers, and especially those caring for relatives, spouses or friends who are touched by dementia.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/10">However, we must listen rather more closely to carers if we are successfully and effectively to implement the Government's proposals in the carers strategy. Page 13 of the strategy says that by, by 2018, the Govt envisage that</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/11" class="indent">&quot;carers will be universally recognised and valued...Support will be tailored to meet individuals' needs, enabling carers to maintain a balance between their caring responsibilities and a life outside caring, whilst enabling the person they support to be a full and equal citizen.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/12">Certain people with dementia are not full and equal citizens now.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-01a.246.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="246"  time="009:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090401/halltext/90401h0002.htm#09040159000548">
	<p pid="a.246.1/1">I am grateful for that intervention. Having seen the effect of dementia on constituents' families and, years ago, on a member of my own family, I think that I would support a limited pilot of something along those lines to check its weaknesses. Superficially, it has some attractions, and I can understand that.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/2">We must listen to carers because, by the Government's own admission, and as the Alzheimer's Society has consistently asserted, the present standard of care for dementia patients is distinctly uneven across our land. I repeat that in pursuing the much-needed reform and improvement of dementia services, we are starting from a much lower base than is the case for diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/3">Let me give a snapshot of present provision in Leicestershire. A number of weaknesses have been identified by constituents caring for spouses or relatives with dementia who have contacted me. Issues include late diagnosis and a lack of information on support and advice for newly diagnosed dementia patients and their carers. I am also concerned that the direct payments scheme for carers may not be as helpful as it could be to those responsible for loved ones with dementia. To take one example, my constituent Derek Barham cares for his wife Maureen, who has advanced dementia, and I know them well because they are friends of mine. He and his wife qualify for direct payments, but they are unable to use cash from this source to pay for a nurse who is qualified to care for dementia patients. Nor can carers who attend under the scheme help the patient with toilet visits or other physical support. The main carer is therefore relieved from their duties only in the sense that they do not have to be in the same room at all times. People in Leicestershire qualifying for direct payments and who care for under-65s with dementia also have problems accessing day centre services, where staff are more likely to have appropriate training in dementia care.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/4">I have written to the Minister about the problems with direct payments that my constituent has identified and I recognise that they may be peculiar to Leicestershire, but I am not sure. However, it is useful to register this example of the experience of the first round of reform for carers, particularly those caring for people with dementia.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/5">It is equally important to register good local examples of dementia and carer support work. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the excellent Side by Side project for carers of younger dementia patients. The Alzheimer's Society, which is doing fantastic work in this area, is undertaking the project in Leicester and Leicestershire. The project explicitly consults and includes the person with dementia in designing a care and support package that they and their carer can access from Side by Side, so that they can continue to lead as normal a life as possible post-diagnosis. I believe that the project could well be rolled out across the country by the Alzheimer's Society and the aims of the carers strategy and the national dementia strategy will be greatly supported by it.</p>

	<p pid="a.247.1/1">It is ironic in some ways, but those carers themselves need tender loving care from their wider family and the professionals who exist to give such support. I should like some respite care to be available on a rather greater scale than at present, which would be helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/2">The carers strategy maps out improvements that will support and enhance the role of almost 600,000 family carers in this country who are responsible for the care of spouses or relatives with dementia, but the national dementia strategy commits only to making guidance available to care home staff on best practice in dementia care. I acknowledge that the NDS proposes that care homes nominate a lead member of staff for dementia and that local authorities and PCTs provide in-reach services for residents with dementia. Yet it seems that we have missed an opportunity to bring the level of dementia awareness and treatment in care homes to a decent minimum standard. That should not impede other NDS proposals for care homes, provided that the Care Quality Commission comes into operation with an independent and robust inspection regime for care homes, including scrutiny of the treatment of residents with dementia. The CQC is born today; this is its first day of operation, and I do not know who the parents are but we should congratulate them, given the track record of CSCI in this context, and the fact that its response to questions in the all-party group's last inquiry about why the use of antipsychotics was not monitored for effectiveness and appropriateness was, to paraphrase, &quot;Not me, guv.&quot; It seems obvious to many that training residential staff in dementia care would help to ease the difficult transition from home to residential care that thousands of individuals and their families and carers face every year.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/3">The idea that we must raise standards of care in residential homes for dementia patients is borne out by last month's Laing and Buisson survey of the UK private care home market. It found that a third of care homes allegedly specialising in dementia&mdash;according to their notepaper and the notice boards outside&mdash;do not provide their staff with dementia care training. That is illogical and unacceptable. That lack of specialist training in dementia is extraordinarily lax and a further illustration of the dangers of dogmatically introducing the free market into long-term care, rather than providing a minimum standard of care for all whether in public or private residential accommodation. Two thirds of care home residents have dementia. That figure needs to be repeated time after time. The dementia population is likely to double over the next 20 years and the majority of long-term care placements are due to dementia. Yet still care homes advertise themselves as specialists and are not required or inclined to train their staff in how to treat residents suffering from that terrible disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/4">We must also remove the threat to dementia sufferers in residential care of the inappropriate prescribing of anti-psychotic drugs, which the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth mentioned in his opening remarks, and which unnecessarily blights the lives of more than 100,000 people. That number of people would fill the new Wembley stadium; that is how many care home residents are receiving inappropriate medication to quieten down symptoms that could be tackled in non-pharmacological ways. That is a disgrace. In my ten-minute Bill of <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-14">14 May</phrase> last year, I highlighted the key factors in ending that medically crude and socially unjust practice; those factors must be the regulation of the use of those powerful drugs in residential settings, and mandatory training in dementia for all care home staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/5">Like the hon. Gentleman, whom I will call my hon. Friend in the present context, and, I am sure, our fellow members of the all-party group on dementia, I am disappointed that our inquiry and subsequent report into the widespread use of anti-psychotic drugs in treating dementia sufferers living in care homes, entitled &quot;Always a last resort&quot;, has not yet helped to persuade the Government to make specific provision within the NDS for an end to inappropriate prescribing. The Alzheimer's Society and the Royal College of Nursing, among others, state that the use of anti-psychotic drugs for residents whose behaviour is defined as challenging, or who are suspected of being capable of challenging behaviour, accelerates the cognitive decline of the patient and increases the risk of cardio-vascular disorders. That is the dreadful factor in this. It may make things easier for staff and less distressing for other residents, but that is the fact. The practice can only accelerate the decline of dementia patients and, as such, should be addressed in prohibitive terms by the NDS.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/6">We await with interest the publication of the review of anti-psychotic drugs this spring, although I am not sure when spring is; it technically starts on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-20">20 March</phrase>, does it not? Might it run until late September? Who knows? We must look in the Government's lexicon of terms. It is a source of concern that that work is separate from and later than the NDS itself. Perhaps the Minister will include this matter in his reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/7">The population of dementia sufferers will be close to l million by 2025 and the Government acknowledge that the pace of implementation of the NDS will vary across the United Kingdom. In five years' time, after the demonstrator sites and evaluation work, decisions on further funding for the NDS will be taken. Whoever is in government in 2014&mdash;it may be the Labour party, in our fifth term, I guess&mdash;will have to contend with a rapidly growing population of dementia patients. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Let the record show the murmur of assent across the Chamber at my mention of a fifth term. It is crucial that over the next five years, the development of clear and flexible care pathways for the treatment of dementia patients must be a priority for all those in local government, the NHS, the voluntary sector and the private sector who are involved in the care and support of individuals, carers and families affected by dementia.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/8">The development of the understanding, treatment and perception of dementia that we all hope the NDS will achieve must start at the beginning with early diagnosis. I note that my hon. Friend referred to that early in his remarks. Unfortunately, as the Government's quality outcomes framework has identified, dementia is being identified at a rate of only 40 per cent., which leaves the majority of people suffering from dementia at any one time going undiagnosed for an indefinite period. We are making progress, it is true, and I know that the Minister is concerned about the issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.250.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1791" name="Jeremy Wright">the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright)</phrase> on his success in the ballot. He spoke of the broad sweep of the strategy, which is of concern to many. I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, who continued in that vein. However, I am about to break the trend, as my speech, which I hope will be brief, is very much rooted in the borough of Bromley, of which my constituency is part.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/2">Bromley has the highest proportion of elderly people in any London borough. Although it is generally regarded as being a wealthy area, dealing with those who suffer with dementia represents a fairly big challenge&mdash;and, as many have said, this is an increasing number. We have an excellent voluntary sector: I am thinking of Mind, the Alzheimer's Society and the many other charities, which do superbly well in providing wonderful care, and so far as is possible, so do our health and social services. I suspect that, in common with many other areas, we have an increasingly large cohort of GPs approaching retirement age, but what makes Bromley slightly different is that we still have far too large a proportion of single-handed GPs.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/3">Those who have spoken mentioned early diagnosis, and I absolutely agree. I understand that the strategy was that memory clinics should be provided in each area. There is controversy, a road down which I shall not go, about whether it is to be delivered by polyclinics&mdash;the polyclinics are the controversy. The view seems to be emerging that it is the GPs' surgeries that should provide the memory clinics. With a high proportion of single-handed GPs coming up to retirement, I wonder precisely where the services for diagnosis and continuing general practice care will be based, and how they will be funded. How are the primary care trust, the local authority and the voluntary and charitable sectors to be involved in providing the services that flow from those diagnoses?</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/4">Although I am focused on my constituency, I do not want to generalise from the particular. We have one large health facility in Beckenham, but that does not solve the problem of a potential lack of GP services for diagnosing Alzheimer's. I hope that the Minister can give us much more detail on how the memory clinics are to work, where the Government envisage them being based, who is to run them and how they are to be funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/5">Unlike other Members, I am not entirely wedded to the idea of ring-fencing, as it could work against my constituents. As I said, my constituency has a higher proportion of older people than many others. I would therefore prefer to rely on quality appointments to the PCT to achieve properly managed health services. We already have properly qualified councillors&mdash;they are elected&mdash;but we need a PCT with a clear view of how it should be spending its money and we must be aware of the potential lack of diagnosis resulting from the structure of the GP service.</p>

	<p pid="a.251.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Bercow, and I echo the words of the hon. Members for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) and for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright). I congratulate the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth on securing the debate, and on his work on the matter in recent times as chairman of the all-party group, of which I am a vice-chair.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/2">I endorse what has been said. I shall not repeat the arguments already made on the broader dementia strategy, but focus on a particular element of dementia. It relates particularly to the care of people with dementia in the national health service. I shall centre my brief comments on my experience of the problem in south lakeland and the Morecambe bay health area.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/3">The reality, as we have heard, is that the majority of people who live with dementia are cared for and supported in their own homes. Many others are supported within an institutional context only so far as they live in residential or nursing homes. Hospitals are not the right places to care for people with dementia. In recent times, health trusts across the country have been closing down dementia wards and moving that care into the community. That is laudable, up to a point.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/4">I am worried that the baby has been thrown out with the bath water. Hospital wards have closed, but, in my area at least, commensurate care in the community has not replaced it. Ward 2 at Westmorland general hospital was closed about 18 months ago on the promise that the Cumbria mental health partnership trust would provide significantly increased support in the community for people living with dementia. That care was to be provided in collaboration with, in particular, the Alzheimer's Society in south lakeland and the local branch of Age Concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/5">A good year after the closure of ward 2, I, and the chief executives of the local branches of the Alzheimer's Society and Age Concern, met with the chief executive of the mental health partnership, and extracted the admission that the trust had not kept its promise to provide that care in the community. Essentially, it had dumped people out there without the support that they desperately needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/6">It has taken so long to put this strategy in place, and to deal with mental health issues in general, partly because mental health is such a taboo. It is not talked about because it is unglamorous, and we allow those who make decisions about our health service and the care of people with dementia to relegate these issues down the list of priorities. That is not acceptable. However, when ward 2 was threatened with closure, and when another ward for adult mental health non-dementia sufferers was temporarily closed, 4,000 people took to the streets of Kendal to protest, so I am extremely proud of my communities, because the majority of people will not personally have been touched by mental health conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/7">There is growing awareness that mental health is not a taboo and should not be written off. We need to prioritise the care of people with such conditions, especially dementia. We must not see care in family homes as a cheap option, nor simply pass responsibility to the care home sector. As we have heard, the caring profession is held in low esteem and suffers from massive staff turnover. Care homes are run by dedicated people, supported by wonderful staff, but often they lack the necessary qualifications. The experience, therefore, of people with dementia cared for in homes can be shockingly poor&mdash;let us be perfectly honest.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/8">We cannot overlook the reality that people with dementia will enter hospital for reasons other than their dementia. At Westmorland general hospital, one third of patients in the Langdale unit, and other medical wards, have dementia, but are there for other reasons, whether strokes or other cardiovascular and medical conditions. They therefore need not only treatment for their medical condition, but specialist care. That is a great problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/9">Nurses on the Langdale unit&mdash;they are wonderful, but are experts in other fields&mdash;have to spend all their time caring for people with dementia, so they cannot give their time to those who do not have that condition. At the same time, however, those with dementia are not receiving the necessary expert care. Next door are two mothballed wards, one of which could, and should, be opened to provide medical care for people with dementia&mdash;not to allow them to bed-block, or to allow it to become a new, institutionalised provision, but to ensure that those who have dementia but are in hospital for other reasons are properly supported.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/10">In enacting the national dementia strategy, I call on my NHS trusts to provide that necessary support locally, and more broadly on the Government to put the care of people with dementia at the top of the agenda. They must make training and the provision of expertise paramount, and ensure that the overriding focus is on the quality of the experience of people living with dementia and their families and carers.</p>

	<p pid="a.253.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Bercow. I echo hon. Members in congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1791" name="Jeremy Wright">the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright)</phrase> on securing this debate and pay tribute to him for his work and the leadership he shows in the House through his chairmanship of the very successful all-party group on dementia. It is an example of how we can work together across all parties and have an impact in pushing an important issue further up the agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/2">I am proud to be a member of the all-party group, but I pay tribute to those who have been members for longer, including my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1923" name="Tim Farron">the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>. They play a full part in the work being done.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/3">The debate is important, particularly given the attempts already described to secure a debate in Government time on the Floor of the House. I echo the disappointment expressed that we did not get that debate, but it is perhaps fortuitous that we have secured this one now&mdash;the Leader of the House first said that we might have a topical debate, then that we might have a Westminster Hall debate, so goodness knows what the answer would have been if we had asked again. It is a relief, therefore, to have the debate today.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/4">Our debate is timely because, I think, the first board meeting of the national dementia strategy programme took place yesterday. If so, I would be interested to hear from the Minister how it went. All of us here today, and other colleagues who would have liked to join us, are committed to, interested in and passionate about this area of health care&mdash;I include <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" name="Anne Milton">the hon. Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase> and the Minister in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/5">I, and my party, warmly welcome the national dementia strategy, which is clearly a huge step forward, as I have made clear before, and its importance to people and their families has been well put by hon. Members. However, we&mdash;this includes the Treasury and the taxpayer&mdash;also have to take seriously the cost of dementia care, which is estimated to rise to more than &pound;23 billion by 2018. One in three over-65s, whom we classify as &quot;older people&quot;, dies with dementia, and I am sure we all agree that this set of distressing conditions has not been the focus of attention that it should have been.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/6">Of real concern&mdash;this echoes comments about the need for early diagnosis&mdash;are estimates that two thirds of people with dementia are undiagnosed, so the problem is far greater than the figures suggest.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/7">I shall pick up on a few points that were made so well by the hon. Members for Rugby and Kenilworth and for North-West Leicestershire. It is great that we have this strategy, but the crucial questions now are about how it is implemented and its effect. Although it is right to incentivise the Department of Health, and the NHS more broadly, particularly through primary care trusts, it is important to push for local area agreements, so we can see what the national dementia strategy means for localities.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/8">The hon. Members for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) and for Rugby and Kenilworth made welcome contributions on how the strategy will affect their local areas. It is important for every area to take ownership of the strategy, and I would welcome hearing the Minister's views on the matter. Moreover, I urge him to say when we will finally get a review on anti-psychotic drugs. Concern has been expressed on that enormously important subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/9">Today, the new inspection regime begins, and we all hope it will lead to a better inspection framework with a focus on care wherever it happens. At times, we have been let down by failures in the inspection regime. Such failures were highlighted last week in a debate on the situation in our care homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/10">Improving awareness of the condition is, quite rightly, an important part of the strategy, but it does not yet have enough flesh on the bones. None the less, the &pound;4.5 million investment is welcome. Will the Minister tell us how, as the strategy unfolds, such money will be used and targeted to raise awareness?</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/11">Let me turn to the important area of training for care home staff and GPs. It is worrying that GPs still say that they are not sufficiently trained to diagnose dementia or suggest pathways of care. Clearly, that must be tackled. Again, I echo the comments of other hon. Members that although we must allow local areas to show initiative and take ownership of the strategy, we need a national framework and a truly national strategy for training so that we can be confident that all staff who deal with dementia sufferers are properly trained.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/12">The other issue that has been eloquently covered in the debate is funding and the &pound;150 million that the Government have found for the strategy. Again, I echo the concern that this money, welcomed as it is by all the relevant organisations and all the parties, will not be enough to deliver the strategy for the full five years. Going back to an earlier contribution, I believe that we must ring-fence the money. I echo the comments made by the hon. Member for Beckenham that we do not want to dictate how money is spent, but that money must be spent on dementia care and services in each area. That is fundamental.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/13">As for accountability, what will be in place to ensure that the Minister and his colleagues can come back here and tell us that the PCTs are spending the money on services? We will not tell them how to spend the money, but we need to know that they are spending it on dementia care and services. We must have that accountability, and know that the money is going through to local areas and being spent on exactly what we have been promised.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/14">My final point is negative and an issue that I raised recently with the Minister on the Floor of the House. What is in the strategy is generally excellent and a positive step forward, but the issue is what is not there, by which I mean research funding. The Government invest eight times less in dementia research than in cancer research. I am not for one minute saying that less money should be spent on cancer, but such figures mean that we spend &pound;289 on every cancer patient in the country and only &pound;11 on every Alzheimer sufferer. We must face up to the reality of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/15">Professor Simon Lovestone, from the Institute of Psychiatry at King's college London, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/16" class="indent">&quot;In the next five or 10 years there is a good chance of having treatments that slow down the rate of progression of Alzheimer's disease.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/17">That is excellent news, but he goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/18" class="indent">&quot;If it fails, we are heading for the most unmitigated disaster. We need these drugs to work&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/19">Rebecca Wood, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Research Trust, has warned that if we do not have more funding now, the economic consequences will be dire. The simple reality is that the lack of funding for research means that the impact of this excellent strategy will be limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/20">I hope that the summit on research funding happens soon and that the Minister can tell us when that will be. We must have a commitment to more funding now for this complex set of conditions if the strategy is to have the impact that we all want it to have. I ask him to give us some good news today. Then we will be able to feel that the strategy will have a huge impact over the next few years.</p>

	<p pid="a.255.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1791" name="Jeremy Wright">the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright)</phrase> on not only securing this important debate but the fantastic work that he has done with the all-party parliamentary group. Many of us come here to make a difference, and there is no doubt that he will have made a difference for dementia sufferers and their families, friends and carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/2">I share my hon. Friend's disappointment that the Government have not allowed time for such an important and significant issue. None the less, I, too, welcome the strategy. I want to pay tribute to high-profile people such as Terry Pratchett, who have a much greater impact, possibly than they ever imagined, on highlighting some of the issues related to dementia. I also pay tribute to all the families and carers around the country who save the Government, as I am sure the Minister is aware, literally millions of pounds in delivering care to people with dementia. They are unsung heroes. As has already been pointed out, they are often older themselves and have to care for sufferers in very difficult circumstances, often without support.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> made a very moving speech about care and caring. I pay tribute to my own branch of the Alzheimer's Society in Guildford and all the other voluntary bodies which give support, care and money. There are more than 100 different forms of dementia, with Alzheimer's being the most common, accounting for just over a half of all cases. A significant minority of people suffer from vascular dementia.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/4">One person every three minutes is diagnosed with dementia. It is a life-shortening illness with an unpredictable life expectancy. The disease can progress for up to 10 years, with an average of around six years, which places a burden on families who often have no idea of the course that the disease will take. Although one in three people over 65 will die with dementia, the UK is in the bottom third of Europe for dementia care. A third will need institutional care; yet if we consider it the other way around, two-thirds of people in care homes have, or will have, some form of dementia. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1770" name="Paul Truswell">The hon. Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell)</phrase> raised the issue of younger people with dementia. Although we tend to concentrate on the over-65s, it is important to note that 18,000 people under the age of 65 have dementia in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/5">My hon. Friend mentioned anti-psychotic drugs. As the Minister is aware, that issue has been rumbling on for some time. The all-party parliamentary group produced an important report on the matter and highlighted some of the issues. Research shows that such drugs double the risk of mortality and treble the risk of stroke. It is disappointing that the Government have dropped their investigation into the use of anti-psychotics, which it promised to publish alongside the national dementia strategy. I would be grateful if he could clarify the situation and tell us exactly when it will be published. Spring is here&mdash;we are in British summer time&mdash;and my daffodils are out, so if he says &quot;spring&quot; again, I shall get very angry. What does he mean by &quot;spring&quot;? Are we actually talking about summer?</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/6">Up to 400 care homes for the elderly and mentally infirm have closed in the past four years, as was mentioned. There is therefore a concern not only about the provision of places for those who need them, but for the provision of places in locations where people can be visited by family and friends. The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire mentioned the crucial issue of carers. Carers themselves need care and, often, temporary respite care can be a vital lifeline to ensure that they can continue to care.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/7">We have not talked much about drugs, in particular for the early stages of dementia. I pay tribute to the many people who have campaigned on the issue. My party and I believe that it is only right that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence reflects wider societal costs when it makes judgments about new drugs. Again, that could transform outcomes for people in those early stages.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/8">The swan-song of the Healthcare Commission was a report into older people and mental health. Although it welcomed much of the practice in the country, the report showed that older people were often unable to access the full range of services, including out-of-hours and crisis services and psychological therapies. Those crisis services can be crucial, especially given that those caring for dementia sufferers are often older people.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/9">The report showed that older people are often prevented from accessing care because of stretched services or a lack of age-appropriate care, and talked about the fact that the number of over-65s is set to increase by 15 per cent. by 2019 and that the number of people with dementia is set to rise by more than 1 million by 2025, as has been said. It also highlighted the importance of making services for those groups accessible and robust enough to cope with those statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/10">The report is lengthy, but it highlights other important issues. It says that the integration of health and social care is very patchy. In no other area is it more important for those to be integrated, yet we still see people working in silos and being protective of their budgets, unwilling to pool them and their resources. The report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/11" class="indent">&quot;Where health and social care services were integrated at both team level and management level, it was more likely that services offered a higher standard of care and a greater range of services...Carers in less integrated services said they could often spend a large amount of time and energy trying to find out who they needed to go to for what problem.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/12">We hear that common theme all the time from carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/13">Carers were also concerned about the closure of some services. It is slightly odd and ironic that we have the strategy, but still hear reports about the closure of services and support care for people who are at home. Some trusts did not provide day services. In my own patch, in Cranleigh, the day hospital has closed. It was an important lifeline for family and friends. The report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/14" class="indent">&quot;Carers said some staff in general wards at acute hospitals were not being trained or were not equipped to deal with patients with mental health problems, especially dementia&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/15">and training has been mentioned in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/16">I should like to pick up on a few of the other issues raised by my hon. Friend. He said that diagnosis is crucial and that the remainder of the strategy is utterly useless unless a diagnosis is made. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" name="Greg Mulholland">The hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> said that something like only 40 per cent. of people with dementia have been diagnosed, so 60 per cent. of people with the condition are without a diagnosis.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/17">As someone who has worked in the health service, I find it appalling that training needs are so great. A recent report and investigation into the care of people with learning disabilities said that staff needed training to make them more fully aware. Not only do I find it extraordinary that there is such a big gap in people's knowledge, but I am surprised that general practitioners cannot recognise or do not look for dementia when it is clearly such a common problem. We need to ensure that staff at all levels, not only GPs, access the right training and that they are aware of looking out for those sorts of problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/18">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1395" name="Jacqui Lait">the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait)</phrase> talked about services in Bromley and single-handed practices. Much of what she said was connected to training needs and ensuring that care can be delivered in the right settings. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1923" name="Tim Farron">The hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron)</phrase> talked specifically about care for people with mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/19">The Department of Health website states:</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/20" class="indent">&quot;The National Dementia Strategy is backed by &pound;150 million over the first two years. It will increase awareness of dementia, ensure early diagnosis and intervention and radically improve the quality of care that people with the condition receive.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/21">Of course, like everybody else, I hope that those aspirations will be fulfilled. However, not only does the quality of care need to be improved, but the quantity needs to be increased, not only for those with dementia, but for their carers and families. We need early diagnosis and intervention, and appropriate treatment, care and support for families and carers. I could apply all those things to a range of other mental health issues. However, we need some detail from the Government, which I hope the Minister will provide.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/22"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> was the first to mention research. He said that &pound;11 is spent on research for every Alzheimer's patient, and &pound;289 on research for every cancer patient. It is a difficult situation: one does not want cancer research to have less money, but we need reassurance that the Minister is aware of what I call disease and illness-related discrimination in the allocation of services and resources. Alzheimer's and related diseases have a difficult time levering in money. Will the Minister reassure us that there will be an even-handed and non-discriminatory approach to dementia research and care, and clarify the research money situation? I would not like him to miss the opportunity to make an announcement, should he wish to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/23">Will the Minister also clarify where the &pound;150 million will come from and whether that is new and additional money for primary care trusts? Does he intend to monitor PCTs so that the Government's headlines on the strategy are assessed by future performance? The Government are right to be proud of their strategy, and they have had quite a lot of good press coverage for it, but I do not want to ask a parliamentary question in a few months' time only for them to reply that the information I want is not held centrally. They need to publish performance statistics and say what PCTs are doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/24">Does the Minister anticipate any money to spend on specialist dementia nurses? They often play a very significant and, if I may say, cost-effective role in care. Do the Government have any plans for additional money? Is he going to increase the number of specialist nurses?</p>

	<p pid="a.260.1/1">If I give way, I will not be able to answer some of the hon. Gentleman's questions, so he will forgive me if I do not.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/2">The process of developing our strategy was not confined to professionals. The voices of people with dementia and their carers were critical to its development. I want to put on record my gratitude to the many people and organisations that contributed, not least Neil Hunt, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Society, who chaired the strategy's external reference group. His work was central to the delivery of the strategy. We had a board meeting yesterday, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" name="Greg Mulholland">the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> suggested, to begin the process, with people from the organisations helping us drive delivery forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/3">On the question of memory clinics and Bromley raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1395" name="Jacqui Lait">the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait)</phrase>, I cannot specifically say what the people and commissioners in Beckenham and Bromley should do, but I encourage her to draw their attention to the analysis in the strategy, which says:</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/4" class="indent">&quot;With a disorder as common as dementia it is tempting to assume that this should be completed by primary care. However, this is in effect the status quo which has delivered the low levels of activity that we have summarised above...the primary care role should be that of identifying those with worrisome symptoms that might mean that their patient has dementia, excluding any other explanatory disorder, and referring on to a specialist service for that individual to receive a definitive diagnosis, not only of dementia, but also of the sub-type of dementia.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/5">She might want to draw that guidance to the attention of her primary care trust if it is going down a route that does not appear to reflect the analysis that a GPs' role is to identify early symptoms and refer people on to specialist services.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-01a.260.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1512" speakername="Phil Hope" colnum="260"  time="010:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090401/halltext/90401h0004.htm#09040159000567">
	<p pid="a.260.3/1">I will not give way, because I need to cover one or two other points.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.3/2">To respond to the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1923" name="Tim Farron">the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron)</phrase>, I stress that one of the strategy's key objectives is for care homes and hospitals to identify a senior staff member to lead on dementia care and drive improvements in the quality of care in those institutions. We will issue guidance on best practice in dementia care to care homes in the coming year, but they need to start gearing up now for the challenges set out in the strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.3/3">We want those senior staff to develop their plans for the management and care of people with dementia in every care home and hospital. They need to be able to commission specialist in-reach services from older people's community mental health teams, and they should be responsible for ensuring that all staff caring for people with dementia receive appropriate training and guidance. I know that the all-party group is considering the issue. We look forward to seeing its findings in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.3/4">There are good examples of local training in dementia across the country, notably in some care homes, but we must ensure that everyone who works with people who have dementia has the right skills and knowledge. We will therefore work with the royal colleges and professional bodies, as well as with the sector skills councils, Skills for Health and Skills for Care and other training bodies, to address that need and ensure that appropriate changes are made to vocational, undergraduate and postgraduate curricula where needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.3/5">I understand the concerns expressed about research. We have a long history of significant investment in dementia research. In 2007-08, for example, the Department of Health and the Medical Research Council spent &pound;32 million on research into dementia and related neurological conditions. Within our current health research strategy, we have expanded the Department's research programme. Dementia research will benefit as a result.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.3/6">We plan to spend some &pound;20 million over the next five years on a dementia and neurodegenerative disease research network modelled on the highly successful cancer research network. Dementia was also a priority of the first round of the National Institute for Health Research scheme of programme grants for applied research. As a result, the NIHR has awarded grants worth almost &pound;6.5 million. Last October, the MRC and the Wellcome Trust announced a new &pound;30 million fund to boost research into neurodegenerative diseases. We will also be holding a research summit on dementia during the summer that will include a wide range of experts in dementia research covering prevention, cause, care and cure&mdash;I am having to hasten along, Mr. Bercow, as time is not on my side.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.3/7">The review of the prescribing of antipsychotic drugs for people with dementia remains a priority for the Department. Unfortunately, research into the issue could not be completed within the original time scale because of the work that we were putting into the strategy. However, we must get it right, and we want to get it right first time. I am pleased to be able to tell the House that the antipsychotics review will be completed shortly: that is, in May this year&mdash;I think that May counts as spring, by the way.. We have taken evidence from a wide range of stakeholders, and we are currently conducting a literature review. The chairman of the all-party group met Professor Sube Banerjee and officials from the Department a few weeks ago as part of our consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.3/8">I have not been able to answer all the questions in the time available, but in conclusion, we are driving matters forward at the national, regional and local levels. I want the strategy to be implemented at a local level. I hope that I have demonstrated that we are firmly committed to improving dementia services. We cannot afford to fail. I am fully confident that the objectives outlined in our strategy and our programme to support the implementation of that strategy over the next five years will deliver the high-quality dementia services that we all wish to see.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-01a.263.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1893" speakername="John Randall" colnum="263"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090401/halltext/90401h0004.htm#09040159000572">
	<p pid="a.263.3/1">That is exactly the point that I have been trying to make. I am not surprised that the hon. Gentleman, with his surname, has been involved in the all-party group on photography.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.3/2">I recognise that there is a serious terrorist threat, and that point leads me to Street View. The argument has been made that underground stations and other transport locations could be targets for terrorism, and that anyone taking photographs of such places might be doing so to find out where the entrance is and what is around it, and is therefore suspicious. However, I have been on Street View, and have been able to look at all the underground stations in my constituency and find where all the CCTV cameras are. I was even able to go to RAF Uxbridge, where there was a bomb incident many years ago, and along the A40 to RAF Northolt to look over the fence, all using Google Street View, because the cameras are on stalks. The argument that photographers might threaten our security, or that the police have to be so alert to the issue, has been diminished by the advent of Street View.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.3/3">I did not mean to discuss Street View so much, but many people, including colleagues, have contacted me about it since I secured the debate. I am not sure whether Members will yet have had time to purchase today's <i>Uxbridge </i><i>Gazette</i>, but there is an article on page 9 entitled, &quot;Mind my privacy&quot;, about Mrs. Rita Blake, aged 72, of Widmore road, Hillingdon. She says that there is an image of her wobbling up the road and she does not like it. There have been several other such incidents just in my constituency. It is fun to look at Street View, but from a security point of view&mdash;I am talking not about terrorism, but about burglary and all sorts of other incidents&mdash;what representations have the Government made to the provider to see what can be done? Frankly, I find the matter very concerning.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.3/4">When I hear the argument that people taking photographs are potential terrorists, I am reminded that all hon. Members have probably left though Carriage Gates and had to wait for the public to finish taking their photographs of what I suspect is one of the prime terrorist targets in the country. With the technological advances in digital photography, a camera that does not look complex can pick up incredible detail that can then be downloaded on to a computer. Carriage Gates is, of course, one of the more vulnerable entrances to the House. I do not see how the issue can be divided two ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.3/5">I would also like to mention a point raised by some good friends of mine who are journalists. They say that the police are increasingly using powers under section 76 of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 and section 58(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2000 against bona fide journalists. That is rather worrying. I think it is well known in the House that I am not a supporter of a third runway at Heathrow and that I attend many demonstrations against it held by the public. At such demonstrations, I have increasingly noticed the police taking photographs of ordinary residents and that our bread-and-butter constituents are having their photographs taken. I understand that there might be one or two anarchists who infiltrate such demonstrations, but it is worrying that huge swaths of our fellow citizens are photographed just because they are doing something that seems to involve demonstrating against the state.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.3/6">I have put my name to various amendments and a private Member's Bill on the control of paedophilia, but a further issue that has been raised with me is the fact that there seems to be an incredible hysteria about taking any photographs that might contain a child. My daughter is a keen rugby player&mdash;she is only 13 and her mother hopes that she will learn to do something a bit more sensible, but she is my daughter so, unfortunately, the chances of her growing up to do something sensible are limited. I feel that I cannot even take a camera to a game of girls' or boys' rugby without being looked at in a strange way. At best, I might end up in a diary column; at worst, I might end up appearing in front of the local magistrate having to explain why I am taking a photograph of young children. The situation is getting to the point of hysteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.3/7">There are various strands to the issue and I appreciate that the Minister might not have enough time to deal with all them. We should all be interested in the subject. The police force and, certainly, PCSOs should have some sort of code. I noticed that, in the last Session of Parliament, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> tabled early-day motion 1155 on photography in public areas. He asked for a photography code for the information of officers to be issued by the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers. That is right; officers should be told what is likely to cause a problem. I believe that that should be the case not only because I am a libertarian and I think that we should have those rights, but because the terrorism legislation introduced by the Government is brought slightly into disrepute if it is used for the wrong purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.3/8">We agreed to emergency legislation being pushed through the House because of the threat of terrorism and because we know that such legislation is important. However, when the legislation was being considered, we raised concerns and were told, &quot;No, it won't be used in that way. This is just for use in extremis.&quot; We then find that somebody has been stopped reading out the names of the war dead in front of the cenotaph in Whitehall, and that somebody has been cautioned under terrorism legislation for taking a photograph of a police car on double yellow lines. I am afraid that that will make people think that the laws we pass have not been scrutinised properly and that those laws might even be brought into disrepute.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.3/9">I understand that there is a fine balance to be struck between allowing people the right to take photographs and dealing with the other issues that we must consider. As MPs, we know full well that photographers might take pictures of us when we are carrying out our various activities in our constituencies&mdash;only when they find out that such pictures are mundane and boring do they delete them&mdash;but there is a right for people to take photographs and we must ensure that it is not subsumed by hysteria and a state that has become too keen on surveillance. At the same time, however, we should be worried about the advent of Street View and concerned that something even more intrusive might follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.3/10">I shall finish now and listen to the Minister's wise words.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-01a.267.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1542" speakername="Shahid Malik" colnum="267"  time="011:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090401/halltext/90401h0005.htm#09040159000585">
	<p pid="a.267.8/1">I am speaking about section 44 and designated areas. Let me continue with my response, which, I hope, will give Members satisfaction on other issues. If it does not, I may have just enough time left to respond to outstanding questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.8/2">The second issue concerns the new offence in section 58A of the Terrorism Act 2000, which was inserted by section 76 of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008. It makes it an offence to elicit, attempt to elicit, publish or communicate information about an individual who is or has been a constable, or a member of the armed forces or intelligences services. The information must be of a kind that is likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing acts of terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.8/3">It has been suggested that the new offence could criminalise people taking or publishing photographs of police officers. A photograph of a police officer may fall within the scope of the offence, but would do so in only limited circumstances. The offence is designed to capture terrorist activity directed at members of the protected groups, which, sadly, we know occurs. An offence might be committed, therefore, if someone provides a person with information about the names, addresses or details of car registration numbers of persons in the protected groups. The important thing is that the photographs would have to be of a kind likely to provide practical assistance to terrorists, and the person taking or providing the photograph would have to have no reasonable excuse, such as responsible journalism, for taking it.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.8/4">I can assure my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1953" name="Hugh Bayley">the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley)</phrase>&mdash;York is a great city&mdash;that had he taken a photograph of a billboard in an underground station, he would have been on safe ground. I hope that the incident did not cost him the prize for being the best MP photographer in that year.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.8/5">I want to be clear about this: the offence does not capture an innocent tourist taking a photograph of a police officer, or a journalist photographing police officers as part of his or her job. It does not criminalise the normal taking of photographs of the police. Police officers have the discretion to ask people not to take photographs for public safety or security reasons, but the taking of photographs in a public place is not subject to any rule or statute. There are no legal restrictions on photography in a public place, and there is no presumption of privacy for individuals in a public place.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.8/6">My hon. Friend the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing has said that we will issue all police officers and forces with a circular on the new offence. It will set out the policy intentions behind the offence and make it clear that it does not criminalise legitimate photographic or journalistic activity. The circular will be discussed with interested parties before it is issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.8/7">Designated areas may cover any area. They may, for example, cover a town or a borough. They must be approved by the Secretary of State, and, prior to that, by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.8/8">It is worth noting in this context the two important safeguards in the statute, which I just mentioned. It is also worth remembering why Parliament only recently agreed to create the new offence. The offence is aimed at protecting those who are on the front line of our efforts to tackle terrorism. Sadly, recent events in Northern Ireland have shown that members of the armed forces and the police continue to be targets for terrorists. We also judge that the police, the armed forces and the intelligence services are regarded as potential targets by extremists in the UK. The new offence is therefore important, and I would not want concerns about its potential application to photographers to overshadow that.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.8/9">Although the offence came into force only on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-16">16 February</phrase> this year, a similar offence applied in Northern Ireland between 2001 and 2007. There was no attempt to prosecute journalists under the old offence in Northern Ireland, and we are not aware of any suggestions that the new offence has been used against people taking photographs.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.8/10">On a separate issue, we have recently been made aware of the publication on the internet of detailed street images of the capital and other major UK cities. The hon. Member for Uxbridge raised the matter. It freely demonstrates that the ability to take photographs in a public place is not subject to any set of rules or to statute. There are no legal restrictions on photography in a public place except where the picture is taken with the intent of committing a crime or terrorist act.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.8/11">I hope that I have provided some reassurance that we take the issue seriously and that we are doing all we can to ensure that legislation is not misused against photographers, whether journalists, tourists or just enthusiasts. I make it absolutely clear that unless someone is engaged in criminal activity, they must be allowed to take photographs in public places and that the law should not be used to discourage or hamper that activity. I hope the hon. Gentleman accepts that the Government's intentions in this area are right and that we are working hard to ensure that the law does not have an unintended impact on photography.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.8/12"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2036" name="Andrew Pelling">The hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling)</phrase> spoke about a journalist in his constituency. Freedom of the press is a fundamental foundation of any democracy, and the idea that journalists are being blocked willy-nilly from engaging in their lawful activity is completely unacceptable. Anecdotally, there seems to be a disconnect between what the Government intended and what might be happening on the ground&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.272.1/1">Given the genuine and widespread concern about the way in which the authorities have handled the matter, despite so many attempts by so many people to get answers about what happened, it is also my view that a public inquiry is really important. My hon. Friend has the backing of a large number of people who want him, as the Member dealing with constituency issues on this matter, to make that case as strongly as possible to the Secretary of State for Health, and to the Minister who is here to respond to the debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.272.4/1">It is for other hon. Members to look at the situation in their local hospital. Perhaps, like me, they have looked at the independent performance ratings from the Healthcare Commission and felt reassured. As I have explained, twice in the history of my representation of Stafford, what looked like reassuring performance ratings over a period of time turned out to be worthless. Hon. Members should consider the situation in their locality.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.4/2">I welcome the Secretary of State's announcements two weeks ago in response to this damning report: the announcement about the independent review of case notes; the appointment of Professor George Alberti to conduct an immediate review; the further review by the National Quality Board about picking up on early warnings; and the report by Dr. David Colin-Thome, the national clinical director of primary care, about not only the performance of this primary care trust and this strategic health authority, but the position of those kinds of organisations throughout the country. Finally, I welcome the Secretary of State's announcement about disciplinary action against the chief executive of the hospital trust. I want to mention each of those things in a bit more detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.4/3">With regard to the independent review of case notes, for many people&mdash;the relatives of loved ones who died at Stafford hospital&mdash;deep wounds have been reopened. The Prime Minister was therefore right to be concerned, two weeks ago, about individuals in turmoil because of their bereavement who are now unsure, or more unsure than before, about whether the deaths could have been avoided. The Prime Minister assured me on that day, at Question Time, that anyone in this situation who asks for help will be entitled to an independent review of their loved one's case notes. What progress has been made in the last two weeks in setting up the arrangements for carrying out those reviews? Will the Minister accept the absolute urgency of starting them as soon as possible, involving relatives fully in them and completing them as quickly as can be? Does he know how many requests have been made so far? I am sure he can appreciate that this process will mean a lot to families, who want emotional closure after the devastating news of the last fortnight.</p>

	<p pid="a.273.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. As it happens, today is the day when a new regulator takes the place of the Healthcare Commission. We must all look to the Minister to explain what is different today from the situation yesterday. I will come back to that subject when making my arguments about an inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/2">When Professor Sir George Alberti's review was announced, the Health Secretary explained to the House that Professor Alberti is probably the country's leading authority on A and E and emergency care. There was some concern in my constituency, and in my mind, about whether that might be too narrow a focus in respect of this hospital's performance, given that the complaints and findings in the report went wider than A and E and emergency care. That is why I pressed for access to all areas at the hospital. I am pleased that everybody agreed to that. I saw Professor Alberti and he said that he was going to go anywhere that his investigation took him in the hospital. I asked the Health Secretary at Health questions last week to confirm that Professor Alberti would do that, and he said that he would. I also asked the NHS foundation trust regulator, Monitor, whether that would be so, and in a letter to me this week, Bill Moyes, the chairman of Monitor, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/3" class="indent">&quot;I have requested Professor Alberti to expand the remit of his review...I have specifically requested that his review also includes the care provided on the medical wards 10, 11 and 12&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/4">That is an important concession by Mr. Moyes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-01a.274.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" speakername="David Kidney" colnum="274"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090401/halltext/90401h0006.htm#09040159000598">
	<p pid="a.274.1/1">Some things need to be sorted out much more urgently than a public inquiry and one of those things is the way that the trust is managed. I should like to deal with that in some detail, although I know that other hon. Members are waiting to speak, but let me try to get on. I assure my hon. Friend that I will return to that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/2">Professor Alberti started work at Stafford last Wednesday and I understand that he will finish this month. The Health Secretary gave an assurance that Professor Alberti's findings would be reported to the House. Can I take it that if people in Stafford want to hear first hand from Professor Alberti about his findings, he will be willing to meet people in Stafford to explain them? That would be helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/3">The National Quality Board investigation will be about how best the system can pick up early warnings. That picks up on what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase> said about regulation. I understand that that is a slightly longer-term investigation that will take until the end of the year to complete, but I am sure that it would be helpful to the whole House if the Minister confirmed what personalities are involved and what kind of work will be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/4">I understand that the Dr. Colin-Thom&eacute; review about primary care trusts and the strategic health authority will be carried out as urgently as Professor Alberti's review and that it ought to lead to conclusions about why this PCT and this SHA carried on as normal when the situation at Stafford was clearly abnormal and that it will look at the lessons to be learned across the country from those findings.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/5">On the disciplinary action that has been announced, we have a full and thorough report that is damning about the management. The chief executive is responsible for the management of the hospital. Even two weeks before the report came out, the chief executive produced a statement saying that he was stepping down from the trust, which, locally, we all took to be the equivalent of resigning and getting no more pay. In fact, he sat at home and continued to receive his pay and there was no consequence for him until the day the report came out, when the interim chairman suspended him on full pay. That is one more example of something being said that was not meant. The hospital's good money should no longer be given to that chief executive. I hope that the Minister will express the urgency that everybody in Stafford feels is necessary to bring to an end the payment to that chief executive for work at that hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/6">The crucial question that arises because of those events, that report and the things that are in train at the moment is whether, today, the hospital is safe. That is a really important question for my constituents. The report says that whereas the Commission had concerns about A and E and emergency care, it had no such concerns about elective care. It says that complaints about outpatient care fell over the period of the investigation and that the coronary care unit and the critical care unit are highly regarded. It says that from the outset of its investigation it made the trust make changes to A and E and emergency care, and that in February 2009 it returned unannounced to inspect those changes and found them working satisfactorily. It says that the hospital is safe. The report also says that an unannounced inspection of infection control last autumn found complete compliance with the hygiene code for combating infections. All that is reassuring, but there are still complaints.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/7">A week last Monday, I spoke in the House and asked for an urgent debate. I said that when I returned to my constituency at the weekend I received continuing complaints about care at the hospital. Last weekend, I visited a constituent at home who had complaints about nursing care in February 2009. Whatever improvements have taken place in the past year, everyone must agree that there is still more work to be done to restore public confidence in Stafford hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/8">A good organisation will try to address complaints straight away, and to put matters right while it can. A good organisation will review all complaints to learn lessons for the continuous improvement of its future work. Stafford hospital was not a good organisation, because the report tells us that it did not act on complaints about its services and did not learn lessons from complaints. In my meetings with the trust throughout that period, it told me that it was doing those things when it was not. That was the case in respect of complaints upheld by the trust and by the Healthcare Commission that were passed to the trust to be put right.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/9">The actions that have now been taken and will be taken will turn Stafford hospital into a very good NHS hospital. With all the attention focused on it now, we are entitled to expect that, but beyond the immediate improvements we must face up to the challenges of sustaining the improvements, embedding the management, the culture, the clinical effectiveness and the public accountability so that they will still be in place when the nation's interest moves on from Stafford.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/10">I want to suggest three key requirements to ensure that our local hospital reaches the standard of the best and stays there. The first requirement is leadership, management and governance. We need a new leadership team, a new chief executive and a new chair of the trust. We need a completely restructured board of directors, and the full involvement of the foundation trust mass membership and its board of governors, the majority of whom are elected. When the boards of directors and of governors meet, they must meet in public, and the present interim chairman has given that assurance. We will seek the same assurance from whoever is appointed to the new leadership team. I was surprised to learn from a Library briefing that a foundation trust may decide to hold all its meetings in private, and that no one can stop that. Has the law not gone too far, and should it not be changed on that specific point? Whatever other hospitals do, I want my hospital to publish information on deaths, complaints and care standards. In the words of the commission's report, I want an open and learning culture.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/11">My second requirement is clinical excellence&mdash;the Darzi agenda writ large. We must have proper training, supervision and accountability of staff. Staff should feel free to speak out about bad practice and near misses. Clearly, the hospital cannot learn from such incidents unless they are known about. I want management that means it when they say that their staff are their greatest asset. I want staff to be involved in decision making, and to have the confidence to speak up knowing that they will be listened to.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/12">On targets, I have received briefings for this debate calling for more flexibility. The British Medical Association says that</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/13" class="indent">&quot;targets ought to be flexible&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/14">The Royal College of Nursing says:</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/15" class="indent">&quot;The RCN is calling for a more realistic target of 95 per cent. of patients to be seen within 4 hours rather than the current 98 per cent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/16">I am definitely in favour of flexibility but, equally, if we get the quality of service right in A and E, meeting a target of a four-hour maximum wait should follow in most cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/17">The third requirement is public and patient involvement. It cannot have helped the hospital that when there should have been good quality public and patient involvement the system for delivering that has been reorganised three times. We had a community health council, but it was abolished. A public and patient involvement forum was set up. It worked and it did things, but it was abolished. Now we have a LINk&mdash;a local involvement network. It has taken ages to set it up, but I am not sure what it has done to justify its name. The hospital cannot afford such drift. Like the trust management, we must now create a modern, effective body with real power, not just a talking shop. It must be a Rottweiler on behalf of patients and the public.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-01a.278.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" speakername="William Cash" colnum="278"  time="015:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090401/halltext/90401h0007.htm#09040159000601">
	<p pid="a.278.0/1">My constituents, too, are served by Stafford hospital and are devastated by what has happened and what has gone wrong, as am I. I place on the record my tribute to Julie Bailey and Debbie Hazeldine, who are here today on behalf of the patients' campaign group, Cure the NHS, to the Patients Association and to Ken Lownds for their sterling work on behalf of the patients and victims of this terrible tragedy.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/2">The Healthcare Commission report has fulfilled a useful preliminary purpose. Its investigation would undoubtedly shorten and reduce the cost of an independent inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005, which is the subject of an early-day motion tabled by the shadow Secretary of State&mdash;my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase>, who is present&mdash;and signed by about 150 Members of Parliament. The investigation has achieved a considerable objective, but I refer to an independent inquiry because it would be independent by virtue of statute.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/3">There will be various reviews, such as the review of case notes and the Alberti review, which deals primarily with accident and emergency. The review by the Care Quality Commission, which the Prime Minister mentioned, raises questions about conflict of interest, in that its inquiry will include an analysis of the role of the strategic health authority, in which the person now in charge of the Care Quality Commission was involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/4">There is also the primary care trust review. However, those reviews and any internal inquiries will not be independent in any real and effective sense, despite claims to the contrary&mdash;I expect some from the Minister today&mdash;because they will not take evidence on oath or compel witnesses, and there will not be compulsory production of papers or protection of evidence given by whistleblowers.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/5">The catalogue compiled by the Healthcare Commission is incomplete, because many people have come forward since that report was produced, including patients and victims, but surprisingly still no whistleblowers. The latest information that I have from the campaigners is that, since the report was produced, potential evidence has emerged of two fatal errors in accident and emergency; there are still shortages of nurses; there is a lack of understanding of an early warning system for patient deterioration; and a range of other matters are still going wrong. The Royal College of Nursing has already written to us with regard to a number of those matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/6">No doubt the new interim chairman and chief executive will continue their work, but I stress that the Healthcare Commission report is only preliminary, and to put things right and deal with the cultural problem, which clearly has existed for a very long time and, some argue, goes back earlier than the period covered by the Healthcare Commission investigation, we need to know why this tragedy occurred. All those are reasons for an independent inquiry of the type that I have called for, which is supported by many Members of Parliament and by every newspaper in the Stafford area, and indeed throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/7">Such a public inquiry was granted in 1984. I called for an inquiry as soon as I heard of the problems and deaths from legionnaires' disease at the very same Stafford hospital when I was Member of Parliament for the Stafford constituency. The Prime Minister of the day granted an inquiry as soon as I called for one.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/8">The scale of the problem outlined by the Healthcare Commission and the depth of the problems of governance and management in the history of this situation are reasons for an independent inquiry, which would sort out what happened and why. That would enable substantial lessons to be learned both nationally and locally, and the Healthcare Commission itself acknowledges in its report the need to draw national lessons from what has happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/9">There are many fundamental reasons why an independent inquiry is essential, and the Minister, in replying to the debate on behalf of the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister, should reflect carefully on the fact that if he refuses to hold such an inquiry, that will be a reflection on his judgment and integrity. For the reasons that I am about to explain, in addition to what I have already said as a matter of principle, I believe that failure to hold an inquiry would amount to a cover-up, and furthermore that only a public inquiry would satisfy the points that I am about to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/10">Those reviews are not independent in the sense in which I have explained independence. They are scattergun reviews, with different terms of reference and timelines for reporting, and they do not allow the compulsion of witnesses and papers. That is a vital ingredient to get to the bottom of this tragedy. If the Government refuse to have an independent inquiry under the 2005 Act, that will be a local and national disgrace.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/11">Failure to hold a public inquiry would suit the trust, the strategic health authority, the Care Quality Commission, the board, the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister, but it certainly would not suit the patients or victims and it would not be right for the future of the hospital. A public inquiry would not only be independent and get to the bottom of what went wrong at the hospital, but it is needed for the following reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/12">The Healthcare Commission itself agreed that Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust had &quot;fully met&quot; all existing national targets between 2006 and 2008. The obsession with targets was one reason for the failure of the trust board. Furthermore, in 2006-2007, the trust met its targets despite disturbingly abnormal mortality rates. The Healthcare Commission report dated those as far back as 2003-04, and the Commission for Health Improvement criticised the quality of care as early as 2002. Therefore, the Healthcare Commission report of itself does not go back far enough. That is a reason for having an inquiry into what happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/13">Dr. Foster Intelligence, which monitors mortality rates, put the trust as the eighth worst acute trust in 2008 and the second worst in 2007. The strategic health authority&mdash;whose chairman during much of that time is the new chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, established today&mdash;received mortality reports in 2007 and 2008. I called for an independent inquiry and raised my grave concern when I said to the Prime Minster and the Secretary of State that I believed that there was a conflict of interest&mdash;I said that on the Floor of the House; it is in <i>Hansard</i>&mdash;because Cynthia Bower was chairman of the strategic health authority, but is now chief executive of the Care Quality Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/14">On the &quot;Today&quot; programme this morning, Baroness Young of Old Scone&mdash;who has taken over the chairmanship of the Care Quality Commission, which the Prime Minister said on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-18">18 March</phrase> would take over the review of the Mid Staffordshire problem&mdash;said in reply to the question that Cynthia Bower appeared to have a conflict of interest that she had examined what Cynthia Bower did during the period in question and was satisfied. That is a travesty, given that in the minutes of a meeting of the strategic health authority board on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-18">Tuesday 18 March 2008</phrase>, which I have with me, Cynthia Bower said that</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/15" class="indent">&quot;there appeared to be nothing to indicate anything out of the ordinary was taking place on mortality.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/16">Baroness Young said that the tragedy at Mid Staffordshire had eluded everybody, whereas Mid Staffordshire had been ignoring what patients and victims were saying.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/17">On the programme, there were also exchanges with the representative of the Patients Association in relation to the question of self-assessment. That is dealt with in the Healthcare Commission report, which came through a few days ago. It is shown that it was Government policy to revert to local assessment, rather than external assessment, in the legislation setting up the commission. The very fact that that has been so disastrous and the strategic health authority has not done its job properly shows that the Care Quality Commission will not be able to deal with those questions, which is yet another reason for an independent inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/18">Indeed, I raised many of those matters with the Baroness a few days ago at a meeting in one of the dining rooms in the House of Commons. In the interview this morning, she said that what happened at the trust had eluded others and that she was satisfied with the outcome, but I do not see how that squares with what I have reported from the minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/19">Furthermore, there is the problem of self-assessment. The Care Quality Commission will not have the same function as the Healthcare Commission of reviewing complaints at a local level, and that is made clear from the report to which I have just referred. There is also much in the report about hearing the voices of patients, but the campaign group Cure the NHS has a catalogue of complaints that have not been resolved. Indeed, I am informed that there were no formal contacts between the hospital and the campaign group until it was far too late.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/20">The Healthcare Commission end-of-term report emphasises that effective regulation combines listening carefully to users and staff and engaging with local patients' groups, and that is included in the new Care Quality Commission's statutory objectives. Even with the statutory objectives in the new legislation, can there possibly be confidence in the Care Quality Commission, given the tragic circumstances that have arisen at the trust and the failure of the SHA, which did not even visit the trust, not to mention the conflict of interest that I described?</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/21">Stafford borough health scrutiny committee was given information relating to mortality rates at its meeting with the trust on <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-13">13 August 2008</phrase>, and I have that information with me. At the presentation, the trust claimed that those rates were &quot;consistently below national average&quot;, but that seriously differs from other evidence, including that from the Healthcare Commission. The presentation also referred to independent reviews of mortality rates by the SHA and the university of Birmingham, none of which appear to have been accurate or substantiated. There were also extremely unreliable statements about the control of infections and MRSA&mdash;methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus&mdash;and claims that there was a positive review by the Department of Health cleaner hospitals team. Finally, Monitor itself has clearly not performed its functions effectively in relation to the failings at the trust and the granting of trust status.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/22">All in all, there has been a systemic failure internally and externally at every point on the compass by a wide variety of bodies charged with investigating and providing analysis, statutorily or otherwise. For the reasons that I have given, no confidence can be placed in the arrangements that the Secretary of State has put in place in relation to the trust, because they lack the fundamental elements of real independence, compulsion on oath and in relation to papers, and the protection of whistleblowers, which only an independent inquiry of the kind that I have called for can provide. On receiving notice of the Healthcare Commission report, which had been leaked, I went straight out to the public and called for an independent public inquiry, and I call on the Secretary of State to accept such an inquiry in the light of my submissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/23">There is no answer to this question other than an independent inquiry&mdash;the people of my constituency insist on one, the people of neighbouring constituencies insist on one and every national, regional and local newspaper insists on one. I can think of no reason why the Secretary of State and the Minister should not agree to such an inquiry. If they do not, the Government's integrity will be at stake.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> on securing the debate. As others have done, I pay tribute to the way in which he has conducted himself and the way in which he has put his case. I agree with everything that he said.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/2">The scandalous litany of failure, which has been going on for so many years, demands an independent public inquiry. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">The hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase> and I called for an inquiry in response to the statement made a couple of weeks ago, and I maintain that view. It is always easy in such cases to find a scapegoat, blame the chief executive, and then move on. It is right that he should be held to account, but it is essential&mdash;it is the duty of Government&mdash;to ask whether wider questions need to be asked about the causes of such scandalous failures. I therefore have some key questions for the Minister; he can answer them either today or in writing, but they should be considered also by a public inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/3">First, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> said, what about the role of the clinicians? They were clearly understaffed and under a lot of pressure, but each of them had a duty to their patients. Did any of them speak out at any stage? What happened about the clinicians who were responsible for care in those hospital units? Has action been taken in respect of any of them, or have we quietly moved on? As the hon. Gentleman said, the comments of the British Medical Association are not adequate to address the concerns that have been raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/4">Secondly, what about justice for the families who were so badly affected? What consideration has been given, and needs to be given, to how justice can be secured for them? Thirdly, what about the role of the coroner? It is utterly scandalous that the coroner should have obstructed the inquiry. What lessons are to be learned? What will be done to ensure that it never happens again?</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/5">My fourth question is about the role of the primary care trust and the strategic health authority. I have a copy of a letter that Sir Ian Kennedy wrote to the Chairman of the Health Select Committee, which I received only yesterday. Sir Ian raises some important questions. First, he says:</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/6" class="indent">&quot;The responsibility for managing performance, including effecting necessary improvements, lay and lies with the trust and its performance manager, the Strategic Health Authority, the commissioning PCT and, after the award of Foundation Trust status, Monitor. These performance managers are able to visit any trust and call for whatever information that they believe is necessary from the Trust to carry out their duties.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/7">What did they do? What visits did they undertake, or was it simply a paper exercise, considering the death rates from afar? That is a central question.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/8">Sir Ian also says:</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/9" class="indent">&quot;Following normal practice, efforts were made&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/10">by the Healthcare Commission, as part of its investigation&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/11" class="indent">&quot;to liaise with the trust and the SHA to explore what was needed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/12">What co-operation did it receive? Was the response adequate, particularly that of the strategic health authority? Sir Ian then says:</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/13" class="indent">&quot;The investigation team at the Commission did not know that the Trust was being considered for this status&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/14">that is, foundation status; I find that utterly extraordinary&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/15" class="indent">&quot;and was not asked whether there were concerns about the performance of the Trust in terms of the safety and quality of care...We understand that Monitor asked the Strategic Health Authority for its views; the SHA was aware of our work on mortality outliers and 'alerts' by then.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/16">That is scandalous. Why did the strategic health authority remain silent? The allegation is that it was sleeping on the job. That leads us to the chief executive of the SHA, who today takes over the national Care Quality Commission. She must be a player in a fuller investigation of the scandal. As the hon. Member for Stone said, there would be a conflict of interest if the matter was considered in-house rather than independently. That is why independence is so important. Another factor is that her predecessor as chief executive of the then strategic health authority is now chief executive of the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.287.3/1">I am sorry, but I do not have time.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.3/2">Surely there is a duty on Government to look beyond what happened in that hospital and consider other factors, such as the four-hour target. Wherever I go in the country, I am told by hospital clinicians that, yes, the four-hour target has been beneficial, but I am also told about the bullying culture that surrounds its enforcement. If the Government refuse to consider that, they are failing utterly in their duty. Page 49 of the report shows a graph of when patients leave A and E. Sure enough, there is an enormous spike on the four-hour point, which suggests that people are being shunted out of A and E because the four-hour target has been reached. The Government need to consider that most carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.3/3">My final question is how on earth can the hospital have possibly cleared all the hurdles to securing foundation trust status, given that the failures had been going on for so long? It had to pass the scrutiny of the primary care trust, the strategic health authority, the Department of Health, the Secretary of State and Monitor to secure it. It shows a tick-box mentality of the same sort that gave Haringey council three stars for its children's service just as the baby P scandal was unfolding. As other hon. Members have said, it has to be the subject of a full independent inquiry. It is scandalous, shocking and horrifying that those failures occurred in a national health service hospital. The NHS is an institution of which we are all proud, but this NHS hospital has badly let down patients in Staffordshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.3/4">There must be a full independent inquiry. Lessons must be learned. Every time one of these awful incidents occurs&mdash;I remember the last one, when we were discussing Maidstone hospital&mdash;we always say that it must never happen again. Then another incident occurs in a hospital that has been found to have passed through the regulatory process. At some stage, this must come to an end. We must be able to have faith in our NHS hospitals. It is the Government's duty to ensure an independent investigation, to get to the full truth of what happened.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-01a.288.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" speakername="Andrew Lansley" colnum="288"  time="015:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090401/halltext/90401h0008.htm#09040159000612">
	<p pid="a.288.0/1">I join other Members in thanking <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> on securing this debate and on the manner in which he introduced it. We all appreciate the contributions made by him, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> and others with personal knowledge of the patients treated at Stafford general hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.0/2">Time permits me to make only a small number of points, so I shall focus on the issues as seen by patients themselves. In the immediate aftermath of the Healthcare Commission's report, it became glaringly and painfully obvious that the people who knew what was happening had no power, and that those who had power either did not know what was happening, or did not care sufficiently. That situation must change. My hon. Friend and others called for an independent inquiry on the day of the Secretary of State's statement, but I must confess that I was reluctant to support it, as he will know, because the Healthcare Commission, for the purposes of its investigation, was an independent body aiming to establish what happened. It has reported and done so capably, but it is perfectly clear from the report that it did not consider it part of its job to question policy or to make recommendations relating to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.0/3">One might say that it is our and Ministers' job to determine policy, but sometimes Ministers are in denial. As the hon. Members for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) and for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) said, the Healthcare Commission's report explained in detail how the target culture of downward pressure and tick-box target adherence contributed to the failures at Stafford general. Why then did a Minister, on the day that the report was published, say that it had nothing to do with targets? I think that Ministers are in denial about the conclusions set out clearly in the commission's report. They have commissioned further reviews. For instance, they have asked Professor Sir George Alberti to visit the hospital to examine compliance with the requirements for best practice and treatment in emergency care. However, he will not question the target culture, because, for years, he has been the national clinical director inside the Department of Health responsible for the implementation of the target culture. There is no independence in that sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.0/4">If the further reviews initiated by the Government are not independent, we cannot expect them to arrive at answers that command confidence. Patients and relatives so much affected, distressed and hurt by what has happened demand&mdash;and we should accept their demand&mdash;that they be given the opportunity to be heard; to see all the facts presented in public; to see behind the conclusions and evidence set out in the commission's report; to find out what the policy and regulation structures were that led to this situation, and why it happened; to secure closure; and, more than that, to contribute to the increased confidence that this will not happen again, either at their hospital or at somebody else's. Last week, I visited Stafford and spoke with Julie Bailey and others from Cure the NHS. From that conversation, I feel strongly that their underlying objective relates not just to what happened to them and their families, but to ensuring that quality of care for patients is, and remains, the absolute focus of NHS staff. We must put in place a mechanism, through an independent inquiry, to ensure that nothing gets in the way of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.0/5">The hon. Member for Cannock Chase rightly raised the point that, day by day, in Stafford general hospital, patients are treated well&mdash;excellently, in many cases. There is nothing paradoxical&mdash;certainly not to me and those who know the NHS well&mdash;in the proposition that some patients in the same hospital are treated well, but others not. One can literally go from one ward, where the standards of cleanliness, hygiene and care are very high, to another, where they are not. The Minister might say, &quot;Well, that is all about leadership&quot;&mdash;of course, it is&mdash;but at Stafford general hospital, precisely the opposite set of circumstances applied to those in some of the hospitals that have responded best to the downward pressure for improvements in emergency services. In the very best hospitals, including some that I have visited, the response to that pressure has been to re-engineer the whole of their emergency activities so as to maintain high-quality care, while delivering on the Government's targets. In others, however&mdash;unfortunately, Stafford general is one of them&mdash;there has been no effort to re-engineer those activities to deliver and sustain quality through the appointment of sufficiently well trained staff. They clearly did not see the need for that. The Healthcare Commission clearly identified the nature of the problems with Stafford general's emergency department and the subsequent emergency admissions to other wards.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.0/6">If every hospital was to succeed in delivering high-quality care, there would be no need for a regulatory system. If every hospital was to perform to the best of its potential, there would be no need for performance management. If every hospital could have any number of patients referred to it, without constraint or control, and still deliver high-quality care, without scrutiny and accountability, there would be no need for NHS health care commissioners. But we need all those things. None of them can be relied on to happen automatically. A worryingly large number of bodies are involved in the commissioning process. That primary care trusts, acting as commissioners, appeared to be concerned only with cost and volume, and not with quality, is a condemnation of the level and nature of the commissioning being undertaken by PCTs. When general practitioners referring patients were asked by the PCT whether there was a problem, they said, &quot;Yes, we have many concerns.&quot; Clearly, however, they had no influence, which tells us something important about the failures of the local commissioning process.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.0/7">The hon. Member for North Norfolk is right that there is far more to this story than is in the Healthcare Commission's report, which is entirely condemnatory of the role of the West Midlands strategic health authority. It was responsible for performance management, and was told regularly by the commission about its concerns and the lack of co-operation from the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, but the SHA did not act or intervene. When the opportunity arose, it did not tell Monitor about the concerns before foundation status was granted. That tells us that far greater examination is needed of the role and influence of SHAs in relation to NHS trusts and, in particular, in this case, the then chief executive, who is now the chief executive of the Care Quality Commission. That needs to be independently examined.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.0/8">Last Thursday, I visited the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. Despite the improvements made and the substantial recruitment of additional staff, there remains, inside the trust, a lack of acceptance of the failings that occurred and of an understanding of what is required to secure the confidence of the public that it serves. We have all learned, in many circumstances, that to learn from what has gone wrong is the starting point of getting things right in the future. On the day of the report, the interim chief executive, on behalf of the trust, wrote to hon. Members and members of the NHS foundation trust. In that letter, he neither accepted the report in full, acknowledged in detail the scale and severity of the failings, nor explained how the hospital's underlying cultural problems, the responsibilities of frontline clinicians or engagement with patients and the public would be altered. The letter literally just said, &quot;This is what we've done. Here are the additional staff we've recruited. In effect, it's time to move on.&quot; It is not good enough for the hospital to say that it is time to move on, and that it will improve things in the future. We need to understand what happened, and Ministers must accept that we can only do that through an independent inquiry.</p>

	<p pid="a.290.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> on securing this debate, and on giving hon. Members an opportunity to discuss in more detail the very serious findings of the recent Healthcare Commission report. I will endeavour to answer the questions that he and other hon. Members have raised in the short time that we have left. If that is not possible, I will write to him and to other hon. Members after the debate. The Secretary of State and I have made it clear that our doors are open to anyone who wants to raise issues with us over the forthcoming days and weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/2">I will not go over the details of this report again. It is well known to hon. Members, who have repeated many of its dreadful details today. Suffice to say, it represents a catalogue of catastrophic management and governance failure at Stafford hospital. My hon. Friend is right in his analysis of the chronology before 2007. One of the reviews announced by the Secretary of State&mdash;I will talk about it in more detail in a moment&mdash;will look at exactly what happened before 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/3">What is clear from the Healthcare Commission report is that it was only when it developed a more sophisticated approach to analysing mortality rates in hospitals in 2007 that it was alerted to the possibility of a serious potential problem at Stafford. My hon. Friend asked for an assurance that the hospital is now safe. The Healthcare Commission itself has given a public assurance that emergency care at the hospital is now safe. As an extra assurance, we and Monitor have asked Sir George Alberti, our national clinical director for urgent and emergency care, to conduct a review of the trust's procedures for emergency admissions and treatment. He will also examine its progress against the recommendations made by the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/4">My hon. Friend also asked whether Professor Alberti's review can be widened. It is understandable that the review should focus on the emergency care and related services that were the focus of the Healthcare Commission's report, but we have made it clear that there should be no no-go areas for his inquiry. He is free to go anywhere and ask any questions he likes. He would actively welcome input from hon. Members and members of the public. I can assure my hon. Friend that the findings of the report will be made public. Professor Alberti will be happy to discuss them with him, other hon. Members and members of the public.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-01a.291.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" colnum="291"  time="015:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090401/halltext/90401h0009.htm#09040159000615">
	<p pid="a.291.1/1">I ask the hon. Gentleman for his forgiveness, but I have seven minutes left to answer many questions. I will get to the questions that he raised, and I do not intend to give way.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/2">The second piece of work that has been launched by the Secretary of State is investigating what went on before the Healthcare Commission's investigation and why alarm bells were not ringing earlier. It will look specifically at the roles of the primary care trust and the regional strategic health authority. It will be conducted by Dr. David Colin-Thom&eacute;, the national clinical director for primary care, and, again, it will have no no-go areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/3">I come now to the third piece of work. Hon. Members asked for an assurance that no other accident and emergency departments in the country were running their operations in the same disastrous way as Stafford. The Healthcare Commission has already said that it has rechecked all of those hospitals with what are called outlier hospitalised standard mortality rates, and is satisfied that they do not give cause for concern. NHS chief executive David Nicholson has also written to every NHS organisation, drawing their attention to the Stafford report and requiring them to satisfy themselves that similar failures cannot occur within their own organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/4">The fourth piece of work, in response to the commission's report, is that the trust is offering an independent review of patients' records for anyone who would like it. My hon. Friend asked me how that work was progressing. I am informed by the new management of the hospital that they have established a helpline, that they have already had 40 inquiries and that they are setting up a group of independent clinical experts to look at and examine the records of anyone who wishes that to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/5">My hon. Friend asked what personnel changes were happening, had happened and would happen at the hospital. I think that he recognises that personnel decisions at a foundation trust are for the board of that trust and for Monitor. Most of the old board, including the chair, have gone without any severance payment. There is a new acting chair, chief executive and medical director.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/6">The previous chief executive, Martin Yates, has been suspended, while an independent investigator examines his role. The new acting chair is also examining the overall past governance and management of the trust. We have made it clear that the new management must make decisions that mean that the hospital can command the confidence of the public and that wrongdoing is dealt with. Moreover, there should be no rewards for failure. Personnel decisions must be swift, within the law and follow due process. Summary dismissal may provide people with some initial satisfaction, but that is likely to be short-lived if it is successfully challenged in court or at industrial tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/7">I agree with my hon. Friend that boards should be open and should meet in public. I understand from the new chair of the Stafford trust that the board will meet in public. Moreover, I point out to my hon. Friend that the code of governance for foundation trusts encourages directors to promote openness in decision making and in the processes at meetings.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/8">A number of hon. Members have made substantive calls for a public inquiry. The Secretary of State promised to give the matter further consideration after receiving representations from my hon. Friend and patients' groups during his visit to Stafford hospital last week. He accepts that public inquiries can be an important mechanism to establish independently the cause of a problem or disaster. However, in this case, the Healthcare Commission, the independent regulator expressly established by Parliament to scrutinise and investigate the NHS, has conducted a full investigation and produced a detailed report laying bare the failures at Stafford hospital. My right hon. Friend believes that a public inquiry would add little more to our understanding, be time-consuming and, crucially, distract the new management and staff at the hospital from focusing on further improving the quality of care for local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/9">In a letter to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase>, Sir Ian Kennedy spells out why he does not think that a public inquiry would be helpful. It was Sir Ian, after all, who chaired the Bristol public inquiry. Sir Ian says he would be happy for his letter to be circulated more widely. However, if my hon. Friend or anyone else believes that there are issues or lines of inquiry that have not been addressed by the Healthcare Commission report or the subsequent reviews, the Secretary of State would be only too happy to consider them.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/10">I urge anyone who has outstanding concerns or criticisms to make those known to the Alberti and Colin-Thom&eacute; reviews and to the new regulator, the Care Quality Commission, which begins its work today. The Care Quality Commission said that it will re-investigate Stafford hospital before September to ensure that improvements have been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/11">I fundamentally disagree with some of the points that were made by hon. Members on targets. To try to blame what happened in Stafford hospital on targets is to let the management and the board off the hook. Hospitals up and down the country ensure that people do not have to wait more than four hours in accident and emergency, which is a perfectly reasonable standard, while at the same time providing safe and high quality care. The vast majority of hospitals in England meet the accident and emergency waiting target, and there is a very strong correlation between hospitals that perform well on the A and E target and their overall quality of care.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/12">The new consultant at the A and E department in the Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust told the Secretary of State last week:</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/13" class="indent">&quot;When you get the quality right the targets look after themselves.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/14">I could not have put it better myself.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/15"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">The hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> raised the issue of the coroner. Concerns have been raised in the report by a number of the families. My right hon. Friend has spoken to the Secretary of State for Justice about that, and officials in my Department have spoken directly with the coroner. He has made it clear that he is happy to facilitate the exchange of information with all of the ongoing reviews. He has also said that he would be happy to receive any application from a bereaved relative to have individual case notes examined.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/16">I hope that I have managed to address most of the points. I know that I have not addressed them all, but I will write to hon. Members. I urge hon. Members to stay engaged with the new hospital leadership and the ongoing reviews that have been announced. I stress again that my door and that of the Secretary of State will be open to them over the coming days and weeks.</p>

	<p pid="a.294.1/1">I am delighted to have the opportunity to introduce the debate and to see the Minister in his place. He will, I hope, have some interesting things to say. I also welcome my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1842" name="Joan Walley">the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Joan Walley)</phrase>. She may have something to say, too, and I know the she has taken a long-term interest in these matters, especially through her involvement with the associate parliamentary group for environmental health.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/2">I make no apology for talking first about my local situation, because that is how the issue came to my notice. I have an interest to disclose: I have been a member of the board of Care and Repair Stroud for some 21 years. I retain an interest, although I am not quite as active as I was in previous days&mdash;since being elected, I have taken on many other responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/3">Jane Creed, the manager of Care and Repair Stroud, contacted me initially on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-16">16 March</phrase>. She was very worried about the financial situation faced by the agency and told me that its access to grant was about to be cut in half. Last year, it was &pound;960,000 and the agency was expecting that amount to be considerably reduced. The money has been allocated to Stroud district council. Some of it goes to other sources, but most will find its way&mdash;through the private sector housing renewal grants&mdash;to Care and Repair Stroud.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/4">Jane pointed out to me the fact that that will have a major impact on the agency because its fee income depends entirely on private sector grant renewal moneys. Indeed, the danger is that, as well as losing the fee income, we are unlikely to realise the opportunity to find alternatives, given the short time we have to respond. Rightly, she has asked me to ask the Minister this question: where has the money gone? I think we know where it has gone&mdash;to regional development agencies for new build&mdash;but this is somewhat disheartening, to put it mildly. The impact on the renewal and repair sector will be dramatic unless we can see this as a one-year event. I would welcome some assurance from the Minister that the money will find its way back into the sector.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-01a.297.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government"  colnum="297"  time="016:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090401/halltext/90401h0010.htm#09040159000621">
	<p pid="a.297.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Miss Begg. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I pay tribute to him in general terms for his firm yet charming tenacity in ensuring that housing issues are at the very top of the political agenda, especially community land trusts, on which he has been a leading champion in driving through the agenda. I also pay tribute to him specifically for his work with Care and Repair Stroud, with which I believe he has been involved for close on a quarter of a century.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/2">As my hon. Friend made clear, home improvement agencies help home owners and private sector tenants who are older, disabled or on low incomes to repair, maintain or adapt their homes. They are extremely valuable assets in the local community and play an increasingly important role in helping local authorities to ensure that people continue to live in their own homes in comfort, safety, security and independence.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/3">My hon. Friend made a balanced contribution in which he recognised that the Government have played an important role in developing the sector since 1997. Over the past decade, the sector has undergone substantial growth and restructuring. In 1999, only 54 per cent. of local authorities had a home improvement agency; by 2001, that number had risen to 69 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/4">As a means of building additional capacity and potential in the sector, my Department invested &pound;5.2 million over two years from 2003. Subsequently, there has been a huge growth in the use of home improvement agencies. Today, about 90 per cent. of local authorities have a home improvement agency, a huge leap from only a few years ago. As well as an increase in the number of agencies, we have also seen a general improvement in the quality of governance. Agencies are now, on average, larger, more robust and financially viable organisations that offer a greater, more diverse and, to use my hon. Friend's phrase, more responsive range of housing-related support services to older, disabled and vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/5">I have mentioned funding, which was the key theme of my hon. Friend's contribution. As I have made clear in answers to parliamentary questions that he has tabled, my Department does not fund home improvement agencies directly, but provides money via a number of funding streams that have been mentioned, such as the supporting people and disabled facilities grants, which are available to local authorities and can be used to fund and deliver home improvement agency services. I shall say a little about both of those important schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/6">The supporting people programme has provided unprecedented sums of money to allow local authorities to invest in local services for vulnerable people. As my hon. Friend has said, about 30 per cent. of revenue funding for home improvement agencies across the country is derived from the supporting people grant. The Government have provided about &pound;8.7 billion to local authorities through the supporting people programme since it began in 2003. That has helped about 800,000 people a year, particularly older people, through a range of services, including home improvement agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/7">In December 2007, my Department announced a three-year allocation of &pound;4.9 billion, for the period to 2011, for the supporting people programme. My hon. Friend mentioned short-term, annual funding allocations, and made the point that multi-year agreements, which are usually over three years in the local authority sector, are very important. They provide the stability and greater certainty that allows local authorities and related organisations, such as home improvement agencies, to build on previous successes, to plan improved service delivery and to consider greater efficiencies over the following three years. Departmental data show that supporting people funding for home improvement agencies has increased from about &pound;15.5 million in 2006-07 to more than &pound;17.5 million in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/8">My hon. Friend rightly touched on the removal of the supporting people ring fence, which is important in the wider context of the Government policy of allowing local authorities more freedom and flexibility to shape policies according to local circumstances and priorities. Such a policy provides local authorities with an opportunity to develop new and innovative ways of supporting vulnerable people in a range of situations, including, if they so wish, the delivery of more holistic and needs-based services for older people by home improvement agencies. That is important. There will always be tension between the requirements and objectives of Government and the priorities of local government, but the general thrust of Government policy is right. Local authorities should be allowed that freedom and flexibility to determine what is provided locally on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/9">The disabled facilities grant provides more than half of all capital funding for works carried out by home improvement agencies, and is a considerable source of fee income for those organisations. The grant has been hugely successful in funding the adaptation of people's homes according to their personal situation, and has funded the installation of ramps, wider doors, stair lifts and appropriate bathing facilities. Approximately 38,000 households receive a disabled facilities grant each year. The Government recognise the success and importance of the programme and have increased funding accordingly. Indeed, funding has more than doubled from &pound;57 million in 1997 to &pound;146 million in 2008, and the budget will rise again to &pound;166 million by 2010. Following a review, a package of changes that will modernise and improve the programme was announced in February last year. Those changes included raising the grant limit to &pound;30,000, and improving and streamlining the administration and fairness of the means test so that those in receipt of certain benefits are passported through to maximum assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/10">The grant programme is highly successful, as I have said, but its rules have been criticised for being too restrictive and because some people have waited far too long for adaptations. The Government are committed to maintaining the mandatory aspect of the grant, but we have now relaxed the rules on how grants are managed, giving local authorities the flexibility to develop smaller-scale, rapid-response adaptation services. The grant budget should not be seen as the sole source of funding, and local authorities are expected to contribute towards those costs, as they have always done.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/11">Home improvement agencies also oversee repair and renovation work that is carried out using private sector renewal funding. I know that my hon. Friend is particularly concerned about that issue. That support is provided though a mixture of loans, grants and equity release schemes, as he said, and is a cross-governmental initiative. For example, the Department for Energy and Climate Change has the Warm Front grant programme. In total, about &pound;1 billion is being made available to local authorities through the regional housing pot, in the period up to 2010-11, to help to improve housing conditions for the most vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/12">I should like to reassure my hon. Friend that my Department has provided about &pound;10.2 billion, for the three-year period up to 2011, for regional housing capital programmes, including those that address the condition of private sector housing stock. There will be an element of concentrating on increasing housing supply, to which I know he is particularly committed, but the points made today are important: during a recession, when house building has slowed and we want to retain the skills capacity within industry, it is vital to retrofit properties, to ensure that we have appropriate housing stock and to improve its energy efficiency. I hope that funding will be provided to allow that to happen on the ground, as the Government have provided funding, having committed about &pound;2 billion for direct improvements to and regeneration of existing housing stock.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/13">We have recently issued guidance to regional assemblies on this matter, which states that they should continue to prioritise those households that are most in need, with the expectation that packages of assistance, which may include grants, loans and equity release schemes, should be made available to them. My hon. Friend will have expected me to say this, and he has pre-empted my comments to some extent, but local authorities have wide powers to provide tailored packages of assistance to owners and tenants for home repairs and improvements through the regulatory reform order. In addition, my Department wrote to all local housing authorities, in November, to remind them of their statutory duties under the housing health and safety rating system and what more they could do to tackle excess cold and climate change issues through their enforcement powers. I remind my hon. Friend that funding is not limited to the regional housing pot, and should be drawn from Warm Front and other energy efficiency schemes to provide those tailored packages of support for vulnerable households.</p>

	<p pid="a.300.1/1">I have two things to say on that. My hon. Friend is absolutely right about the handy person scheme, for which we have provided &pound;33 million. It can make an enormous difference because someone can knock on the door of Mrs. Smith or Mr. Bloggs to see whether they are okay and to change a plug. That &pound;33 million will provide enormous savings and will allow people to stay in their homes. That is hugely important.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/2">We fully recognise that local authorities are finding it difficult, in the current economic climate, to balance improved service delivery with efficiencies and appropriate staffing levels, but local authorities can act as a catalyst for economic development and regeneration, and can help to stimulate local economic conditions. The approach of making sure that home improvement agencies have appropriate funding is a good example of how local authorities can stimulate economic activity and ensure that homes are retrofitted to provide the services that vulnerable people in particular need and desire.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/3">I thank my hon. Friend for securing the debate. I believe that home improvement agencies have a pivotal role to play in helping to adapt our housing stock to the needs of an older society and a society that is retrofitting measures to mitigate climate change. How home improvement agencies are used should be, and is, a matter for local people. However, as I hope I have demonstrated, the Government have provided substantial resources for this, and have given local government the freedom and flexibility to help home improvement agencies to achieve their objectives for older and more vulnerable people locally.</p>

	<p pid="a.302.1/1">This is an opportune debate, which I sought last week before the news broke at the weekend about the future of the Dunfermline building society. Mainly, it has been a black week for Dunfermline. After 140 years of trusted service to the community, the Dunfermline is no longer an independent Scottish mutual. It has been a friend to many, and has been safe and sure. This week, there have been tears, confusion and, most of all, anger that such a fine institution has come to this.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.1/2">For the record, I wish to declare that I am a member of the Dunfermline building society; it is an organisation that my family and I have trusted for a number of years. The break up of the Dunfermline is another clear example of the failure of the regulatory system. We need some clear answers to why the so-called reckless behaviour was allowed to go unchallenged by the regulator for so long. Why was the Dunfermline allowed to ramp up its commercial loan book from approximately &pound;270 million at the end of 2007 to more than &pound;650 million in early 2008 when the property implosion was plain for all to see?</p>
	<p pid="a.302.1/3">We should remember that, in early 2008, several months had passed since the problems of Northern Rock, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Lehman Brothers and others. How could this have been allowed to happen? I understand that the Financial Services Authority was well aware that building societies&mdash;not just the Dunfermline&mdash;had adopted a change of strategy to a more risky business model. That change of strategy was openly discussed, yet effective permission was given for the Dunfermline to proceed. The FSA knew about the loan books that had been bought from GMAC-RFC and that they had been sold as a full status when, in fact, they were risky self-certification loans. What was the FSA's response? No action was taken against GMAC-RFC and there was no direct intervention at the Dunfermline. The only action taken was a round-robin letter sent to all the building society chief executives about their due diligence responsibilities. That is a completely inadequate response, which allowed the society to continue its road to ruin.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.1/4">At the Dunfermline, it is my understanding that the due diligence stress tests and professional assessments of the proposals to buy a range of loan books from GMAC-RFC and others were overruled. Why was that not also identified by the FSA? Before the old building society regulator was subsumed into the FSA, it had a special focus on building societies. If that structure had remained, we might not be facing the situation that we have today. Bringing two different cultures together under one organisation led to a common set of values and standards that do not reflect the different priorities and culture of the banks on the one hand and building societies on the other. Will the Minister tell me what lessons have been learned in the Treasury, the Bank of England and the FSA about this episode?</p>

	<p pid="a.303.0/1">The issue is covered in fog. Jim Foulds was very emotional on Sunday, and he obviously felt strongly about the society. I had an initial fear that a barrier to getting the necessary deal would be the fact that the Prime Minister lives in Fife and has a seeming attraction and closeness to the society. I also feared that setting a precedent of that nature might be a disadvantage to the Government if there are difficulties with other building societies. I have since had discussions with the Government and many others, and although I think that an awful lot was done to try to save the society, it was not sufficient. However, we will leave the issue of whether the society was sacrificed to the academic and historians.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.0/2">Will the Minister say whether there has been an investigation into this episode within the FSA? In addition, have all the mistakes that were clearly made with the Dunfermline building society been highlighted and lessons learned so that the culture changes? I am sure that this is not the only episode from which the FSA has had to learn, but it is essential that the lessons are learned. I also want to know what changes will be introduced and if any changes have been agreed so far?</p>
	<p pid="a.303.0/3">I was grateful to the Chancellor for giving a statement on Monday. I was pleased because it allowed the House to express its views and concerns about the decision. The Chancellor's tone and approach on Monday was much appreciated; it was sensitive to the staff, Fife and Scotland as a whole. I was appreciative of that, but there are still a number of outstanding questions. On Sunday, the Secretary of State for Scotland said:</p>
	<p pid="a.303.0/4" class="indent">&quot;But also by some reckless decisions by previous management because of over-exposure to commercial loans, involvement in the subprime mortgage market in the US and really bad decisions on their technology.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.303.0/5">However, it is my understanding that the mortgage book was not from the United States. I would appreciate clarification on that because it has upset many in the society who believe that that is a complete misrepresentation of the facts. The Chancellor did not refer to that matter clearly in his statement on Monday, so I would like the Minister to state clearly that there was no involvement in the American markets at all.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-01a.303.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" speakername="Willie Rennie" colnum="303"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090401/halltext/90401h0011.htm#09040159000628">
	<p pid="a.303.2/1">There are different definitions. I understand that they use sub-prime in the States but that there are subordinate, unsecured mortgages in the UK. I do not know if that statement is necessarily new, but perhaps the Minister can clarify that.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.2/2">In the Chamber on Monday, the Scottish National party spokesman compared the &pound;1.6 billion of net financing provided to the Nationwide with the suggested &pound;60 million for capitalising the Dunfermline. I understand that that is not comparing like with like and that they are different sums so it is not appropriate to compare them, but does the Minister believe that the Nationwide deal will be more or less expensive than the proposed deal for the Dunfermline? Alternatively, have other factors come into play, such as issues about stability and other matters. We were led to believe that it would have been more expensive to do the Dunfermline deal, but I am not absolutely sure that that is the case. Will the Minister clarify whether it is?</p>
	<p pid="a.303.2/3">The break up of the Dunfermline will result in some call on the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Will the Minister say what the estimated cost of that will be because building societies and banks will find such a burden difficult to bear at this difficult time? If the Minister can come up with a figure at this stage, exactly how much does he think it will be?</p>
	<p pid="a.303.2/4">Finally, the Chancellor said that it was clear that the Dunfermline could not have survived. However, if it was clear, why did it take six months to reach that conclusion? I do not think that the decision was that clear and if it was, it should have been identified six months ago. Was there a resource issue? Was the FSA finding it difficult to cope with the multitude of problems that it had in the autumn of last year when problems were first raised by the Dunfermline? If the resources were available at that time, could we have reached a resolution that would have meant that the Dunfermline remained an independent Scottish mutual, which I believe was the ultimate goal in relation to all the issues that were going around?</p>
	<p pid="a.303.2/5">I also wish to raise a couple of issues that I mentioned in the debate on the decision. First, Dunfermline had to pay around &pound;7.2 million towards the Financial Services Compensation Scheme as a result of Bradford &amp; Bradford, the Icelandic banks and the London Scottish Bank. That put extra pressure on the society at a time when it did not need it. Two weeks ago, I raised that issue in this Chamber&mdash;in fact, I was in this very chair&mdash;when the Economic Secretary to the Treasury responded.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.2/6">There needs to be a review of the scheme, because it puts a huge burden on societies that are supposedly relatively safe. There is not an appropriate balance between risk and value. Contributions are based on the deposit book rather than the risk that an organisation poses. I would like the Minister to commit to having a review. I know that the Government are looking at issues around that, but I would like a proper review with a proper deadline so that we can draw a line under the matter and have a system that is fairer to building societies.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.2/7">The second issue is excessive capital requirements, which I understand put an extra burden of an estimated &pound;30 million on the society at a time when it needed ultimate flexibility. Lord Turner of the FSA recently recommended that we should have a more flexible approach, and that the capital requirement should be reduced from 7 per cent. to 4 per cent. during times of economic difficulty, but he did not practise what he preached. It was 8 per cent., which put an unnecessary straitjacket on the Dunfermline building society at a time of difficulty. I would like to know whether the Minister will adopt Lord Turner's suggestion.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.2/8">For all those reasons, I believe that it was incumbent on the Government to save the society, which they failed to do. I have heard all the explanations, but the reality is that the Government presided over the demise of Scotland's largest building society on their watch. They will have to live with that, and they will have to explain it to the people in Fife, Dunfermline and, more widely, Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.2/9">Until now, my focus has been on the Government. I have tried to squeeze every last penny and concession out of them to get a good deal for the society and to keep it an independent Scottish mutual, but, ultimately, that failed. I could stand here and berate the Government all afternoon, but that would not move us any further forward or change the facts. However, I do want the Government to learn the lessons from this episode, because they are important.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.2/10">If it had to be anybody, I am pleased that it is the Nationwide that is taking over. It has a proud, strong reputation for recognising value and quality brands. I am heartened to know that it has kept the Derbyshire and Cheshire brands, and their separate headquarters and branches, which is good. I was also pleased to hear <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" name="Nicholas Winterton">the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)</phrase> say in the Chamber on Monday that, increasingly, the Nationwide is seen as a lifesaver. He has had a positive experience, and I hope that we do as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.2/11">I have had positive discussions with the Nationwide this week and have agreed to assist as much as possible in its transition into Dunfermline. Dunfermline and Rosyth are mini-centres of finance. They have an expertise that I am sure the Nationwide will find extremely valuable. HBOS, Lloyds TSB and Intelligent Finance are in Dunfermline, with about 2,800 jobs. The Nationwide will find it a good place to do business, and I will work with it as much as I can to ensure that it is able to grow and prosper.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.2/12">However, I have several questions about the immediate future. The first is about the pension scheme, which was transferred to the Treasury when the society went into administration. There is concern among the approximately 150 employees of the Dunfermline, now the Nationwide, about the final salary scheme. They want to know whether the payments will be honoured. I understand that the Bradford &amp; Bingley used the Pension Protection Fund to guarantee payments. Will it be the same for the Dunfermline? An early decision and announcement on that would be good for the confidence of the employees, who have been through a difficult time.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.2/13">Secondly, the society recently announced that it was committed to another &pound;30 million in social housing schemes across Scotland in places such as Fort William, Glasgow, Stirlingshire and beyond. It has a great tradition and a reputation for social housing in Scotland, which I would like to see continue, but the social housing fund has been put into DBS Bridge Bank Ltd, which is under the control of the Bank of England.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.2/14">I would like to know what will happen to the fund. Will it be put back into the Nationwide-Dunfermline fold? That is where it should be. Others have suggested that perhaps we could create a separate Scottish social housing bank, but I am not sure whether that would be viable. I would like the Minister to consider having a meeting with me and representatives of the social housing sector in Scotland so that we can explore the issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.2/15">I wish to thank Jim Willens, the chief executive of the Dunfermline building society since December, for his sterling efforts to try to save the Dunfermline as an independent mutual. His valiant effort ultimately failed, but I thank him none the less. He did a tremendous job.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.2/16">I also wish to praise the hundreds of members of staff at the Dunfermline for their service to the society. Some have served for many years. They are not to blame for this episode&mdash;they have been let down. People are angry, confused and depressed about the Dunfermline. They know that some serious errors of judgment were committed in the society. Yes, the Government contributed to the difficulties, but the employees know that mistakes were made at the top of their society by people who must bear responsibility along with the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.2/17">People want answers, but I have absolutely no desire to have a crude witch hunt. That is not our style in Dunfermline; it is not how we do things. However, members, staff and the community want to understand what happened. They want to know how such a fine institution for 140 years could be wrecked in a few months. They want to understand why reckless decision making caused that to happen. I urge those who were responsible&mdash;those who were in charge&mdash;to step forward, explain and apologise. We will treat them with respect and we will listen but we ask them please to accept that request. The society of 140 years deserves it.</p>

	<p pid="a.306.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" name="Willie Rennie">the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie)</phrase> on securing this important debate and on the work that he has done on behalf of his constituents in pursuing the matter over recent months.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/2">I agree with the hon. Gentleman: it is sad that an institution such as the Dunfermline building society, with a distinguished history and a record of good service to its local community over such a long period, came to an untimely end in a way that no one would have wished&mdash;although, as he said, the identity of the society will continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/3">My right hon. Friend the Chancellor made it clear when he spoke in the House on Monday that the Government are well aware of the high regard that local people have had for the institution. It is a substantial business, as the hon. Gentleman said. It has 34 branches, some 500 employees and around 300,000 members, making it the 12th largest building society in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/4">The decision to transfer the main business of the society to the Nationwide was made to protect depositors and to safeguard financial stability more widely, as well as to protect the interests of the taxpayer. The decision was necessary because of a deterioration in the society's financial position in the past few months. On Saturday, the Financial Services Authority had to take the decision that the Dunfermline building society was likely to fail to meet the conditions laid down in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 which would permit it to remain open for business, and that it was not reasonably likely that action could be taken by the society to enable it to satisfy those conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/5">The situation arose for several reasons, but there were three particularly significant ones. First, the management of the society decided to go into large-scale commercial lending&mdash;more than &pound;650 million at the top of the market in 2005 and 2006. Many of those loans are now not being repaid.</p>

	<p pid="a.307.1/1">I am coming to that point. The second factor was that the management decided to acquire more than &pound;150 million-worth of high-risk UK mortgages from subsidiaries of two American companies, GMAC and Lehman Brothers, just before the global market for such loans collapsed. There is a significant US dimension, but the mortgages themselves were with UK borrowers.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.1/2">Thirdly, last year, the society needed to write off &pound;10 million from the purchase of an IT system for which it was charged &pound;31 million. All those issues contributed to the society making an expected loss of more than &pound;24 million last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.1/3">Many people, the hon. Gentleman among them, have quite properly asked why it was not possible to rescue the society&mdash;why the Government could not inject more capital, perhaps with contributions from other building societies through the Building Societies Association. I assure him, the House and others that the idea was seriously considered, but the Financial Services Authority advised that a minimum of &pound;60 million would be required just to allow the society to carry on trading, and that that would not have provided a long-term solution. The judgment of the tripartite authorities was that, even with a &pound;60 million injection, the society would have been very unlikely to have an independent long-term future; instead, we would have been back in this position, dealing with exactly the same problem, before too long.</p>

	<p pid="a.308.0/1">I was just mentioning the DBS Bridge Bank, which is owned by the Bank of England, which will continue to provide support for the Dunfermline's social housing commitments while we talk to a number of other parties, including the Scottish Government, about securing a long-term future. The remainder of the Dunfermline's business, including commercial loans, high-risk mortgages and subordinated debt, has been put into administration under a new procedure that the Banking Act 2009 provides.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/2">In line with previous resolutions of this kind where the retail deposits have been transferred in full, the assets to back them have been provided in the short term by the Treasury. An amount broadly equivalent to the capital reserves belonging to the Dunfermline's members is also being transferred, along with the rest of the business, and will support prime residential mortgage lending.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/3">The Treasury will reclaim that from the proceeds realised from the assets placed in the administration and, if necessary, from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, by requiring the scheme to make a contribution to the costs of resolution at the end of that process. Any contribution from the FSCS will be capped, under the requirements of the new provisions made by the Banking Act, at the compensation that the FSCS would otherwise have had to pay if the society had gone into default, less the recoveries that would then have been made from winding-up the society.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/4">Although the final cost to the taxpayer will be significantly less than &pound;1.6 billion, we obviously cannot be precise about the amount at this stage, but we are clear that this option represented better value for money for the taxpayer than the other options on the table.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/5">The hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife made the point forcefully that he feels more should have been done. Other hon. Members made similar points. Let me attempt to reassure him that a great deal was done. There has been a lot of contact with the society, as I have said, much of which was behind the scenes and most of the content of which was in discussions between the FSA and the Dunfermline.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/6">The FSA is the society's regulator and the sole body that must decide whether the society met the threshold conditions laid down in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and whether it could continue to be allowed to accept deposits. Among other things, the FSA commissioned an independent audit of the society's commercial book and subsequently of its strategic plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/7">In discussions over recent months, the FSA has recognised that improvements need to be made in how things operate. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that we have asked the chairman of the FSA, Lord Turner, for a report on the Dunfermline. The FSA's chairman and chief executive have made it clear that a significant shift in regulatory approach is now required. The FSA will complete its supervisory enhancement programme to deliver that major shift and, as part of that, it is devoting more resources to supervising high-impact firms, particularly large, complex banks; taking a more intrusive, systematic approach to supervision; intensifying its role in bank balance sheet analysis and the oversight of accounting judgments; and increasing its willingness to challenge banks' judgments.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/8">The hon. Gentleman pressed me about whether lessons would be learned. He may take some encouragement from the fact that the National Audit Office report published about a fortnight ago that covered some of our previous problems, starting with Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, made the point that lessons learned from the experience with Northern Rock were applied in the case of Bradford &amp; Bingley. I hope he will take encouragement from that that lessons for the future are being learned from these incidents.</p>
