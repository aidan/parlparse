<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09a.1.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" speakername="Nicholas Winterton" colnum="1"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h01.htm#60509h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1.3/1">I am delighted to have obtained this debate on maternity services. Perhaps I should first declare a non-pecuniary interest, in that I am an honorary vice-president of the Royal College of Midwives. It awarded me that position, which I am honoured to hold, after the Select Committee on Health, which I chaired in the early 1990s, produced what I would describe as a groundbreaking report on maternity services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/2">My purpose in calling for this debate is fourfold. First, I want to mention the &quot;Making it Better, Making it Real&quot; consultation on health care services for children, young people, parents and babies in Greater Manchester, east Cheshire, High Peak and Rossendale. However, I want to make particular reference to in-patient services at East Cheshire NHS Trust's Macclesfield district general hospital. Secondly, I want to draw attention to the continuing staff shortages affecting maternity units, of which I know the Minister is aware. Those shortages are exacerbated by the current funding deficits in the health service. Thirdly, I want to question this Government's commitment to making good their manifesto pledges on maternity services. Finally, I want to propose the implementation of measures designed to arrest the current shortage of midwives and deliver high-quality maternity services for all women.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/3">However, I begin by focusing at constituency level and on the consultation on the reconfiguration of service provision. Some may consider the recruitment of staff to small units a problem that affects the quality of and generates risks to continued service provision. In addition, questions have been raised about the financial viability of smaller units. I say to the Minister that those issues do not exist at the East Cheshire NHS Trust, where a vibrant facility is continually providing high-quality care within the income calculated under payment by results&mdash;a policy introduced by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/4">The services provided by the East Cheshire NHS Trust are needed by the population of eastern Cheshire, which, by the way, includes the constituency represented by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" name="Ann Winterton">the Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton)</phrase>. The trust also serves the population of High Peak, the Buxton area, and north-west Staffordshire, represented by the towns of Leek and Biddulph.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/5">The maternity and children's services at the Macclesfield district general hospital are sustainable, affordable, efficient, safe, highly regarded and recommended, and those facts are known to the strategic health authority. Those facilities are integral to the delivery of district general hospital services on the Macclesfield hospital site. They are responding to increased demand, and are providing a local service to a geographically large and isolated part of Cheshire, Derbyshire and north Staffordshire. I remind the Minister that the Government believe that services should be provided to people as locally as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/6">Both children's and maternity services have sustainable models for the delivery of the European working time directive. The proposed model for paediatric services is innovative and approved by national and local training organisations. I emphasise to the Minister that services such as paediatrics, obstetrics and maternity have no vacancies at Macclesfield district general hospital and are rarely closed to admissions. If they are closed, it is never due to lack of staffing, but due to excess demand. Does that mean that there is a danger that such in-patient services will be removed to a hospital much further from the community that they serve? I hope not.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/7">The service is sustainable under the new financial rules. Financial analysis across all specialties shows that income for obstetrics and paediatrics under payment by results covers expenditure. The payment by results rules expect the non-activity-driven paediatric services&mdash;that is, the community-based services&mdash;to be paid for at cost by the commissioners. The service does not require any capital development to provide future services. The hospital and community service is provided by the integrated paediatric consultant team, reducing the infrastructure costs involved with separate teams.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/8">All services have undergone a Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection review. Regular visits from the training organisations have resulted in praise for the service and an increased demand to manage more junior doctors&mdash;not fewer&mdash;at Macclesfield district general hospital. The most recent quote from the Mersey deanery, following the annual assessment visit last October, stated: &quot;Best hospital so far&quot;. That recommendation came from a teaching hospital. The demand on services has increased against a background of a changing age profile, about which we all know. Women are choosing to deliver their babies at the East Cheshire NHS Trust. Parents and, yes, general practitioners are choosing to bring ill children to that trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/9">Only last week, a mother of three from the Buxton area, whose family are patients at Macclesfield district general hospital, spoke at a public meeting of her fear that her son, who has asthma, would lose open access to the children's ward. When she was 38 weeks pregnant, she transferred from Stepping Hill hospital, Stockport, to Macclesfield district general hospital because, &quot;Bigger hospitals forget about people; we need smaller units.&quot; Stepping Hill is the hospital to which people would be directed if the in-patient services were transferred from Macclesfield district general hospital. That is an example of the people who use the service speaking, and that is what is critical about the consultation, which ends in a day or two's time and which I hope will be noted by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/10">Some 96 per cent. of those questioned in the 2004 national young people's patient survey rated the overall care at Macclesfield district general hospital as excellent, very good or good. Of that 96 per cent., 33 per cent. said that it was excellent. That is a high degree of approval.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.0/1">Will my hon. Friend further confirm that mothers who live in the large rural area that surrounds Macclesfield&mdash;in west Derbyshire, north Staffordshire and particularly in my constituency of Congleton&mdash;do not wish to lose facilities at Macclesfield district general hospital, which is a mere 10 miles from where they live, to Stepping Hill hospital, Leighton hospital or University Hospital of North Staffordshire?</p>
	<p pid="a.3.0/2">Visiting those three hospitals would involve long journeys for those mothers. The arrangements for parking are difficult&mdash;and anyway, many such parents have no transport of their own. Should people in rural areas have a worse service than those in urban areas?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09a.3.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" speakername="Nicholas Winterton" colnum="3"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h01.htm#60509h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.3.1/1">My hon. Friend raises important issues, some of which I shall touch on in a moment. She refers particularly to transport. Transport from the Congleton area&mdash;and from Macclesfield, for that matter&mdash;to Leighton hospital is not only fairly limited in its frequency, but expensive and inconvenient. How would the House like to see a mother perhaps with two other young children going from Macclesfield, Congleton or many of the rural villages that surround those towns all the way to Stepping Hill in Stockport, or to Leighton hospital near Crewe? My hon. Friend raises important issues, and I intend to come on to one or two of them later.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/2">Eastern Cheshire primary care trust's demographic assumptions indicate a reduction in the number of children between the ages of nought to five of about 10 to 15 per cent. Over the past four years there has been a reduction in the number of children born but an increased demand on the services of Macclesfield district general hospital. The influences on the level of demand are, of course, wider than the total number and relate to morbidity, expectation of the users and the services available. East Cheshire NHS trust is working with the Eastern Cheshire primary care trust to develop appropriate in-patient and community services.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/3">To pick up on what my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton said, the impact of the removal of in-patient children's services and consultant-led births would be disproportionate in a hospital the size of Macclesfield district general hospital. The immediate impact would be to remove all children's planned and emergency surgery, which would result in the removal of all adult ear, nose and throat provision, because 44 per cent. of ENT provision at the hospital is for children. Another department would therefore be made vulnerable and would inevitably close.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/4">Gynaecology emergencies would be redirected to surrounding hospitals. It has been estimated that midwife-led births are appropriate for approximately 350 women, representing only 18 per cent. of deliveries. The loss of activity would have a significant adverse impact on the financial viability of the remaining services provided by the Macclesfield district general hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/5">The loss of income is assessed at about &pound;8 million. I know that money is important to the Minister, but although the loss of income is assessed at &pound;8 million, expenditure reductions are anticipated to be only about &pound;5 million. That creates a 4 per cent. additional recurrent financial pressure on the East Cheshire NHS trust if paediatric, maternity and obstetric in-patient services are removed. The risk to recruitment and retention of all other specialties would be high indeed. That has been highlighted to me by one of the consultants at the hospital, Dr. Mark Nicol, who is an accident and emergency consultant and lead clinician in strategy at the district general hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/6">Services are provided to the whole of eastern Cheshire; the High Peak, in particular Buxton; and the north Staffordshire area&mdash;the townships of Leek and Biddulph. Some women from Stockport choose to give birth at Macclesfield district general hospital because it is a delightful hospital with a super reputation.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/7">I now come again to a matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton. Public transport in a rural area, such as Macclesfield, Buxton and north Staffordshire, is in short supply. I refer in particular to my hon. Friend's constituency. There are no direct bus routes from Congleton, or Knutsford for that matter, to Stepping Hill in Stockport. The last bus from Stockport to Macclesfield is at 5.10 pm. I remind the Minister that one in six people in rural areas do not possess a car; how are they going to get to the hospital? The Minister might say that the ambulance service will take them, but it is already inadequate and does not meet any of its attendance targets now, let alone with the huge additional burden that would be imposed on it if in-patient facilities were removed from Macclesfield to other hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/8">The paediatrics and maternity service is staffed by seven full-time equivalent consultants, and the team covers acute and community paediatrics. There are close links with the Eastern Cheshire primary care trust, which provides services such as school nursing, child health surveillance, immunisation and vaccination.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/9">Sadly, in the consultation, Macclesfield district general hospital appears in option D, which is not the preferred option. So far, however, option D has been supported by 70,000 people who have signed a petition and 25,000 people who have completed and sent in cards to the authorities. It is supported by people in east Derbyshire and north Staffordshire, by all the consultants and clinicians at the district general hospital and by all the general practitioners. It is supported by Macclesfield borough council, Congleton borough council, Cheshire county council and the Macclesfield branch of the Royal College of Midwives. That shows the support for Macclesfield district general hospital and the in-patient services that it provides, and if the consultation is to be meaningful, to be taken seriously and to be trusted, the overwhelming evidence in support of option D will, I hope, carry weight with the authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/10">I now move on to maternity services more generally. Sadly, the maternity care that women and their families receive continues to be adversely affected by a long-standing shortage of midwives in large parts of the country. I pay tribute to the Royal College of Midwives, which, from time to time, provides information to Members and to me, as one of its honorary vice-presidents. In 2005, the number of NHS midwives fell for the first time in five years. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase>, the head count stood at 24,808 midwives, down by 36 on the previous year&mdash;yes, that is only a small number, but it is down. Although there is better news on full-time equivalents&mdash;the Government's preferred work force measure&mdash;the figure edged up by only 95 in the same period. Between 1997 and 2005, the number of full-time equivalent midwives in the NHS in England rose by 896, from 18,053 to 18,949&mdash;a rise of just 5 per cent. over eight years. As the Minister will be aware, that compares somewhat poorly with full-time equivalent figures for the overall nursing, midwifery and health visitor work force, which increased by 23 per cent. over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/11">Sadly, the midwifery work force is ageing. Analysis conducted by the Health and Social Care Information Centre reveals that the average age of a midwife increased from 33 in 1997 to 40 in 2004, that the age profile for midwives is much older than that for all NHS staff and that nearly half the midwifery work force in some strategic health authorities is in the 46&ndash;69 age group. In addition to the NHS work force statistics, the Royal College of Midwives produces an annual staffing survey. The most recent figures&mdash;as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-01">1 July 2005</phrase>&mdash;show that 78 per cent. of maternity units had vacant midwifery posts. That is the situation nationally, although not, I am pleased to say, in Macclesfield. Some 59 per cent. of vacancies were unfilled for more than three months. Vacancies represented 5 per cent. of the establishment, rising to 9 per cent. in south-east England and 12 per cent. in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/12">Although Government vacancy statistics for midwifery are lower than the RCM's figures, there is good reason to suggest that the Government have understated the extent of the shortage of midwives. In an answer to a parliamentary question asked by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase>, the then Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne)</phrase>, stated that the Government counted only vacancies</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/13" class="indent">&quot;that trusts are actively trying to fill that have lasted three months or more&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-04-18.242"><i>Official Report</i>, 18 April 2006; Vol. 445, c. 242W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/14">Even so, if a midwife leaves her job, the vacancy is not a vacancy unless it has lasted for three months and the trust is genuinely trying to replace her. A declining number of midwives could be left to staff a unit, but according to the Government there would not officially be any vacancies in that unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/15">I move to the issue of work force pressures. Midwives are the primary carers for women experiencing normal pregnancies and births. That essential role has been a constant since legislation for the regulation of midwifery was introduced in 1902. The pivotal role of midwives was highlighted by the Health Committee in its report in the early 1990s in which we emphasised the importance of the continuity of care; of an identified midwife dealing with a pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy and delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/16">Over the years, midwives have adapted to the changing NHS environment. As the Minister knows, every midwife is responsible for maintaining her existing skills and ensuring that she becomes competent in any new skills required for practice. In short, midwives have been required to adapt and extend their role, and increase their work load in response to a series of policy and socio-economic drivers. The national service framework for children, young people and maternity services compels every NHS trust to meet certain commitments regarding minimum levels and standards of care in maternity services. I repeat, from personal knowledge, that the district general hospital in Macclesfield well meets all those standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/17">The Government's manifesto promises:</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/18" class="indent">&quot;By 2009 all women will have choice over where and how they have their baby and what pain relief to use.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/19">It goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/20" class="indent">&quot;We want every woman to be supported by the same midwife throughout her pregnancy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/21">That was one of the major recommendations of the Health Committee report on maternity services.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/22">Childbirth has become an increasingly interventionist and medicalised practice. Increased intervention in childbirth increases the demands placed on the midwifery work force. The length of post-natal stays has increased in line with rising intervention rates, and that places an additional call on midwifery time. Moreover, the additional requirements resulting from increased intervention rates come at a time when the overall number of births is also on the rise. There was a 5 per cent. increase in the number of births in England in 2003&ndash;04 compared to the previous year. That places yet more demands on midwives, as does the increase in the number of women experiencing childbirth both later and earlier in their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/23">The proportion of pregnant women who are teenagers or women aged 40 years and over is growing. Between 1991 and 2003, the number of women in England aged 40 or over conceiving almost doubled from 11,497 to 20,128. In the same period, conceptions in women under 20 also rose. Older and younger women who are pregnant tend to be at greater medical and social risk than pregnant women aged 20&ndash;39. Consequently, their care needs tend to be more complex and intensive.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/24">I return to an issue that I mentioned at the beginning&mdash;NHS funding deficits. The current funding difficulties in the NHS in England have exacerbated midwifery shortages and the various pressures on the midwifery work force. The Royal College of Midwives has undertaken what it would describe as a snapshot survey of heads of midwifery in England, in order to assess the impact of funding deficits on midwifery services. According to the RCM survey, more than one in three managers reported that their maternity services budget had been cut&mdash;that is serious&mdash;and more than one in four that their training services budget had been cut.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/25">More than one in four respondents reported that their midwifery staffing establishment had been reduced. Half of all trusts had been operating a recruitment freeze. One in four managers reported that their trust had been replacing senior midwives with more junior colleagues, and a similar number said that support staff had been substituting for midwives. I am sure that the Minister will take that information very seriously. One in four respondents report that they have reduced the number of home visits by midwives. At a time of urgent need for more midwives, not fewer, the RCM has received reports that a number of strategic health authorities are set to cut the number of midwifery training places. Again, that bodes badly for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/26">Of particular concern is mounting evidence that post-registration midwifery training will no longer be financially supported and that, for example, the 18-month conversion programme in Oxford for nurses wishing to train as midwives will be stopped &quot;for this year only&quot;. The arguments for cutting 18-month training places are clearly financial and the move is a short-term knee-jerk reaction that will have long-term ramifications for the midwifery profession.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/27">It is also a matter of grave concern that a number of birth centres throughout the country have closed or are under the threat of closure. Birth centres can play a significant part in increasing choice for women during pregnancy and childbirth and in ensuring that maternity services are delivered in what we would all describe as a more home-like setting. Closing birth centres will therefore make it harder to implement the Government's own policies on maternity services.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/28">Although midwives have embraced changes in accordance with Government policy, such as shifting services closer to where people live and providing more diverse services, the funding deficits, allied to continuing staff shortages, are making it harder for midwives to implement those policies in practice. That much has already been acknowledged by the Government, and I give them credit for that. In recent oral evidence on NHS charges given to the Health Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase>, who sadly resigned recently as a Minister, had to concede that staffing shortages affected delivery of quality maternity care, saying that</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/29" class="indent">&quot;one-to-one midwifery support is part of the National Service Framework, it is a commitment we made in our manifesto. The brake on us delivering that is the lack of midwives and we are working hard, as in other areas, to increase the numbers of people in that area. I think it has increased by 2,200. Progress is being made on that score but it is slow.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/30">She went on to say that the only reason why women did not receive one-to-one care was because there were not</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/31" class="indent">&quot;enough midwives to be able to provide it&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/32">The Government are aware of some of the problems facing maternity and midwifery, but inertia on their part has also contributed to a lack of progress in implementing the manifesto and other policies affecting maternity care. The national service framework was published more than 18 months ago, yet there is still no sign of an action plan for the implementation of its maternity standard element, nor is there any evidence that the Government have properly and fully costed it. While the Government could have taken forward the implementation of their own manifesto commitment, they have instead&mdash;I regret to say&mdash;indulged their obsession with tinkering with structures, while services are being cut. That is proving to be a very expensive distraction.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/33">It is as yet unclear whether payment by results will ensure a fair and consistent basis for funding maternity care. When the crunch point comes for maternity services, will the result be a fair, accurate and fully funded tariff, or will commissioners conclude that there are insufficient funds for maternity care, and so opt to pay for a reduced quality service? I hope that that will not be the case. The wider question is: how can anyone be sure that payment by results will result in</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/34" class="indent">&quot;payment being linked to activity and adjusted for casemix&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/35">rather than in perpetuating existing inadequacies in the system for funding maternity care? When asked by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" name="Anne Milton">the Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase> what assessment had been made of the likely impact of payment by results on the number of home births and caesarean sections, the then Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill, replied that no such assessment had been made and gave no date or time frame for when this work was likely to take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/36">It is not clear whether the tariff used for applying payment by results will reflect social as well as medical costs. Coming from Macclesfield, I am well aware that there are not only medical costs but in some areas also social costs. Pregnant women and new mothers from socially disadvantaged groups tend to require greater support in respect of advocacy. In some areas, translation and interpreting services are required, as well as closer liaison between midwives and other health and social care professionals. Will the Government guarantee that the tariff will reflect the different costs incurred by women with different medical and social needs?</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/37">When will the Government be able to say how maternity services will be commissioned in the future? While practice-based commissioning is central to the Government's reforms, it does not follow that this will be the most appropriate level at which maternity services will be commissioned. Clearly, different commissioning functions will need to be delivered at different levels, according to factors such as population size, purpose and strategic significance, and the interrelationship between these factors will vary between services in the same locality. Thus, the integrated nature of maternity services implies that commissioning will need to take place at a different level than, for example, the commissioning of elective hospital services. Furthermore, midwifery services have increasingly engaged with the wider public health agenda and have played a significant role in working collaboratively with commissioners&mdash;a bigger-picture role that must not be lost as a result of the new commissioning proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/38">Finally, let me explain the way ahead as I see it. The Government have a major job to do in order to get maternity services back on track and to rebuild trust with women who use maternity services and all those clinicians and others who work in the services, particularly the midwives who care for women. Current NHS deficits should not be addressed by cutting maternity services budgets or cutting the number of training places for student midwives; they should be increased because there is a proven need for them. Increasing the number of student midwives would also help to address the growing age profile imbalance in the midwifery service work force. The NHS cannot afford to lose any midwifery posts through redundancy. To help stabilise the situation facing maternity units in England, the Government should give trusts a more realistic time scale in which to address their deficits. They must address them, but they must be given time to do so. In addition, the Government must fully fund pay modernisation, as there is evidence that trusts are using the funding crisis to try to avoid their obligations under the &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; agreement. Moreover, three Secretaries of State are on record as stating that &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; is fully costed. Is it fully costed? To reduce the excessive demands on an already overstretched work force, the Department of Health must urgently address continuing midwife staff shortages. If the Government do not attract and retain significantly greater numbers of midwives, they will sadly fail to meet their manifesto commitments.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/39">The Department of Health should publish without delay the plan of how it will implement not only the maternity standard of the national service framework for children, young people and maternity services, but all other relevant commitments made in this important area, including the manifesto commitments. It is unacceptable that 18 months after the publication of the national service framework so little has been achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/40">The national tariffs relating to maternity services must be developed in a way that reflects all the costs associated in providing care to women and babies with diverse clinical and social needs. Commissioners should explore the potential for contracting midwifery group practices to provide antenatal and post-natal care services in deprived areas. I am not just concerned about my own area, where the need is great; there are many more deprived areas of the country where such services are important. The midwifery group practices must provide antenatal and post-natal care services in deprived areas in the event of a GP opting out of providing such services. The midwifery group practices are important.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/41">I pay tribute to those who played such a major role in the Health Committee when I chaired it and when it produced the report on maternity services to which I have referred. That was during the period 1990 to 1992, which is a long time ago. I still greatly respect the help given to me by the late Mrs. Audrey Wise, who was as emotionally involved and committed to the report as I was, Mrs. Alice Mahon, who stepped down from Parliament recently, David Hinchliffe, the Labour Member who chaired the Health Committee with such distinction until the end of the previous Parliament, Rev. Martin Smyth from Northern Ireland and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>. This House remains concerned about these important services.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/42">I have tackled both the national and local aspects of the issue. I hope that the Minister will appreciate that I am committed to saving the in-patient paediatric, maternity and obstetric services at Macclesfield district general hospital, and that I am strongly supported by Dr. Ian Spillman, the leading paediatric clinician, Dr. Val Lether, the lead obstetrician in Macclesfield, and all the other clinicians and consultants, who unanimously believe that it would be wrong to remove the in-patient services. The situation facing maternity services and the midwifery profession nationally also requires Government attention.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09a.9.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" speakername="Paul Rowen" colnum="9"  time="010:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h01.htm#60509h01_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.9.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" name="Nicholas Winterton">the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)</phrase> on securing the debate and on his excellent tour de force. One of my predecessors, Sir Cyril Smith, speaks highly of his work, which has taken place over 35 years, and I am privileged to follow his remarks. The hon. Gentleman spoke about maternity services in general and how NHS policy can impact on those services in his local hospital in Macclesfield. I echo and support his general remarks. He is far more knowledgeable than I am on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/2">I wish to concentrate on the &quot;Making it Better, Making it Real&quot; consultation, which, as the hon. Gentleman said, covers not only the Cheshire PCTs, but much of Greater Manchester, and which has an effect on my constituency. The proposals are currently out for consultation, and the consultation period ends this Friday. The recommendation in the report is to cut the number of maternity units and child care services from 13 to eight or nine.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/3">I am not opposed to change&mdash;indeed, I accept that some reconfiguration is needed&mdash;but like the hon. Gentleman I am very concerned about the proposals. Not one of the options given includes providing maternity, child care or obstetric services at Rochdale infirmary. With Bury excluded and Burnley general hospital also set to lose its maternity services, a large part of Greater Manchester and Lancashire will be left without easy access to child care and maternity services. Not only that, but for many reasons&mdash;whether lack of transport, poor public transport or high levels of deprivation&mdash;those areas need such services.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/4">The proposals do not make economic sense. The unit at Rochdale infirmary is purpose-built and was opened in January 2001. By contrast to at least one of the strategic health authority's preferred options, no new investment will be needed to keep the unit open. It is very popular. The number of deliveries at the unit has risen since it opened from 1,776 to 2,270 last year. It is the only one of the four hospitals in the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust to have admissions rising year on year. The background against which that is happening is one in which the population of Rochdale is set to rise by 6.7 per cent. by 2028, whereas that of the other towns in the area, such as Oldham and Bury, is set to fall.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/5">There are some specific facilities and practices at Rochdale infirmary that are worthy of special mention and should be retained. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the importance of antenatal services in deprived areas, and the antenatal ward is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Referrals are made by professionals, but also by the women themselves, and since opening the number who attend for antenatal services has risen from just over 3,000 in 2002 to nearly 6,000 last year. If the strategic health authority proposes to close Rochdale's maternity and antenatal services, which are unique in the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust in that they are the only ones to be open 24 hours a day, thought needs to be given to how that facility will be provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/6">There are many examples in the post-natal ward at Rochdale infirmary of care being given to babies that is only provided in other areas by special care baby units. That includes the care of pre-term babies as young as 34 weeks gestation, and low-weight babies, weighing as little as 1.8 kg. The staff have real expertise that is not recognised in the title they are given. It is incorrect and controversial to say that staff become deskilled in small units because they do not care often enough for the more unusual cases. The example of Rochdale infirmary shows that that is not so.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/7">As I said, the Rochdale infirmary unit is the only one in the trust with a rising admission rate, and it has a large number of admissions from outside the Rochdale area. Last year's figures, for example, included 45 babies from Bacup, nine from Rossendale, 61 from Whitworth, 26 from Todmorden and 87 from Oldham. More than half of the 87 women from Oldham made a definite choice of Rochdale rather than Oldham. The other half went there because the unit at Oldham was closed. In fact, the unit at Rochdale was closed 16 times last year, not because of lack of staff&mdash;the hon. Gentleman referred to that&mdash;but because it was full and could take no more people. As he said, the national service framework states clearly that it should be a priority</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/8" class="indent">&quot;to deliver easy access to supportive, high quality maternity services designed around the needs of women and their babies&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/9">Given the popularity of the Rochdale infirmary unit, I believe that it could and should be maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/10">The consultation document gives four criteria for choosing the options, none of which includes Rochdale. The main criterion is safety. The document states:</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/11" class="indent">&quot;there needs to be sufficiently large critical mass of patients in order to maintain the skills of the staff.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/12">No figure is given, but it has been stated that 4,000 deliveries could be a safe figure. I dispute that.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/13">A report by Reform, an independent, non-party organisation, gives evidence that larger units do not automatically provide better quality care or a safer environment for maternity and neonatal care. The report states that larger units are less likely to be able to provide high-quality care because they are more difficult to manage efficiently. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/14" class="indent">&quot;there must be an end to the drive towards larger, more centralised delivery units across the UK. The current trend to merge medium size 2,000&ndash;3,000 delivery maternity units into giant 5,000&ndash;6,000 plus delivery units is not evidence based. Competition between such medium sized units should be the driver for higher standards.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/15">I believe that the report describes what is happening in Rochdale, and it would be a travesty if the unit were to close.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/16">The second criterion is equity. The consultation document states that disadvantaged and vulnerable groups will be able to access health services easily. It adds that the services will need to reflect the geographical spread of the population, reasonable travelling times, choice and type of service, and choice of location for service users. However, that is not addressed in the current options. If we look at a map of the review area and include Rossendale and Todmorden, we see that a huge geographical area will be left without maternity and paediatric in-patient services if the proposals are accepted.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/17">Rochdale experiences a higher level of ill health than the national average. In September 2004, it had more than 400 families living in accommodation supported by the National Asylum Support Service. The teenage pregnancy rate in Rochdale is greater than the national average. It is one of the areas worst affected by deprivation. All those factors point to the need to retain a locally based service.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/18">The hon. Gentleman referred to recruitment and retention of midwives&mdash;a key point. I said that the closures in Rochdale were because the unit was full, not because of a lack of staff. The number of midwives leaving Rochdale has remained low for many years, and the usual reason for leaving is retirement. There are no problems with recruiting staff to Rochdale infirmary's maternity suite, in contrast with the situation in both Bury and Oldham, where there have been problems with recruiting and retaining staff. In my view, if something works well, we should not change it.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/19">On patient satisfaction, there has been a huge campaign in Rochdale, similar to the one described by the hon. Gentleman, by people supporting the efforts to keep the maternity and paediatric unit open. More than 37,000 signatures were collected for a petition saying that the unit should be maintained, and during the Easter recess more than 80 people travelled from Rochdale to Westminster to present the petition to the Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/20">I shall quote some of the comments from the customer satisfaction questionnaire that were given to me by the midwives. They include:</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/21" class="indent">&quot;the maternity unit can't close, it would be a waste of a very good unit . . . the service I received from everyone was first class and very professional . . . this department is a credit to the hospital . . . this hospital has a maternity unit to be really proud of.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/22">Those are examples of people's satisfaction with the unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/23">Before the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust was created, Rochdale infirmary had a three-star rating. It was the first hospital in the country to be awarded magnet accreditation. It is already a centre of excellence in the fields of midwifery, obstetrics and paediatrics. The care given is exemplary and second to none, and the population of Rochdale are speaking out strongly against closure. When the consultation finishes on Friday, I hope that there will be another look at the proposals, that some sense will be applied and that there will be a move to ensure that a maternity service is retained in that part of the conurbation of Greater Manchester.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.4/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" name="Nicholas Winterton">the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)</phrase> on securing this important debate, and I apologise for missing some of his opening remarks. It is a shame that we are discussing this subject in the context of such a dire financial crisis in the NHS. By way of background, I should tell hon. Members that the financial crisis in the Cheltenham and Tewkesbury primary care trust has produced a deficit of precisely zero. In fact, that PCT has never been in deficit. What is more, the Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS foundation trust has been an efficient and relatively low-cost provider of health care services, and our mental health care trust is a three-star trust and about to be in the first wave of foundation trust status applicants among mental health service trusts. Our local managers have done absolutely everything right in financial terms, yet we are suffering.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.4/2">A review of the maternity strategy in Gloucestershire was already under way. In the words of the consultation document, the strategy</p>
	<p pid="a.12.4/3" class="indent">&quot;encompasses all elements of care that a woman and baby need from pre-conception, through antenatal care and birth to post-natal care; reflects the needs of the population; takes into account the views of users, professionals and other stakeholders.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.13.1/1">I agree entirely. The hon. Gentleman, who represents a neighbouring constituency, faces a direct threat to the maternity services in his constituency, as I do in mine, where the context is a financial crisis caused not by financial deficits in Cheltenham and Tewkesbury but by deficits elsewhere in Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire, particularly in the neighbouring Cotswold and Vale PCT. Those deficits are leading to a huge range of closures and cuts in services, from health visitors to adult mental health services, from community nursing to overnight care for children in Cheltenham, from cuts in access to acute care to the closure of the Delancy rehabilitation hospital in Cheltenham.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/2">Of course, added to that list is the euphemistically named &quot;rationalisation&quot;, which, over time, will put obstetrics and gynaecology services on one site. My neighbour in Stroud and I are under no illusions as to what that means. The inevitable site for the rationalisation is Gloucestershire Royal hospital in Gloucester, which means that there is a direct threat to the Stroud maternity services and to St. Paul's maternity unit in Cheltenham, despite the fact that it is an excellent purpose-built facility like the one in the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase>. My children were born at St. Paul's, and my family can bear personal witness to the excellent care and first-class facilities that it offers.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/3">The closure of the maternity unit would strike at the heart of our town. Without it, there will be no more Cheltonians, in the old-fashioned sense of the word, because almost no one will be born in the town. Only about 1 per cent. of Cheltenham people are born at home so almost no one will be a Cheltonian ever again if this unit closes. Instead, people will have to face a dangerous extension in drive time, during a very stressful period, through an unfamiliar urban landscape in Gloucester city, which could add dangerous minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/4">I put the example of my son, Sami, who was born within minutes of getting through the door of St. Paul's maternity unit, to the chief executive of the foundation trust and asked what would have happened if we had had to add another 20 minutes to our journey. Would he have been born on the Golden Valley bypass between Cheltenham and Gloucester? The chief executive's reassuring reply was, &quot;Nature would have taken its course.&quot; That will not be of much reassurance to my constituents. Inevitably, they will suffer the injustice of losing a service that is much valued and supported, despite the fact that there has been no financial crisis in our primary care trust area.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/5">We are promised a consultation period, but we had a consultation period on children's services last year, which revealed overwhelming public opposition to the closure of overnight care at Battledown children's ward in Cheltenham, and 27,000 people signed a petition against that closure. All three primary care trusts and the local NHS foundation trust categorically agreed that a nurse-led unit, at least, would survive and that 350 children a year would not be transferred to Gloucester from Cheltenham under a pilot scheme. Despite all of that however, those proposals were discarded at a few weeks' notice due to the pressure of the current financial crisis. Little wonder, then, that 13 local NHS trust governors described the process of public consultation on significant change as having been reduced to &quot;absolute farce&quot;. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale mentioned, the fact that there is only one local service left reduces to nonsense the concept of patient choice between different local services. Sadly, I fear that maternity services will go down the same path.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.0/1">Thank you for your forbearance, Mr. Caton. I was sorry to miss the remarks of, in this case, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" name="Nicholas Winterton">the Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/2">I would like to make two points, one of which follows on from my intervention on my near neighbour, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" name="Martin Horwood">the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase>, dealing with the continual review of these services. No one can quite understand the psychological damage that that does to members of staff who are for ever looking over their shoulder, wondering whether they will have a job or a service to deliver. The sad thing is that Stroud maternity hospital was set a whole series of measures that it had to meet to survive. It has more than met those. In fact, it does not want too many more births because that will put it under significant pressure.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/3">The danger in the current review is that the hospital faces the centralisation of services and staff feel somewhat forlorn and thrown aside because of the threat to the work that they did to meet those requirements. The threat comes from the acute trust, in its various forms in Gloucestershire, which is a matter that I have already taken up with the chief executive because I think that it is wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/4">The second issue is that Stroud hospital, while not being unique, is somewhat unusual in that it provides cradle-to-grave care. If we take the cradle away from an important community hospital, we shall immediately create a chink in the armour that is the health service in Stroud. Our area does not have an acute hospital&mdash;we lost that in its previous incarnation, which I could say a lot about&mdash;but we have maintained very effective community services.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/5">If women choose to have their babies in a community setting, but the community facility is then taken away, many will then choose to have home births. We know that there would be no saving: the figures have already been done. In fact, it is likely that the cost will increase as the number of home births goes up. That may be a good thing, and it may be the choice of those mothers, but it is not very satisfactory when the arguments on financial grounds are driven by the idea that centralising can save money. I know that there are medical considerations, but we seem to have overcome those. We are now faced with the brutal reality that it is a question of cost, not choice. I hope that the Minister listens, and that she already understands the view in my area. I hope that we can kill stone dead the idea of closing Stroud maternity hospital.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.0/1">I start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" name="Nicholas Winterton">the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)</phrase> on initiating this debate. It is an important subject, and I pay tribute to the Select Committee report of years ago, which was followed by the Cumberlege report &quot;Changing Childbirth&quot;. The hon. Gentleman did not mention that in 2002 the Health Committee decided to set up a sub-committee to review what progress had been made since those days. The work goes on, and he got us off to a good start.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/2">I was interested to hear what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" name="Martin Horwood">the Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase> said. I got quite nostalgic, because my two babies were born in St. Paul's, which was an excellent and popular unit. I did not live in Cheltenham, I lived in Tewkesbury, but Tewkesbury mothers chose to go there, and it would be a real loss to the local community were it to close. I do not understand the reasons for it, and I wish him success in keeping it open.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/3">The hon. Member for Macclesfield raised many points that I would have raised myself had I had full rein. I agree wholeheartedly with everything that he said, and he provided a comprehensive analysis of the subject. The underlying factor in maternity services is the shortage of midwives and the inability to increase their numbers. The Select Committee report in 2002 raised concerns about retention rates, high drop-out rates, and the high drop-out rates on some midwifery courses. The Government's response was to commission Professor Mavis Kirkham and team at a cost of &pound;70,000 to carry out a study called, &quot;Why do Midwives Stay and Why do Midwives Return?&quot;, stating that the results would inform future midwifery recruitment and retention policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/4">It will be helpful if the Minister tells us whether the report has been produced, what assessment has been made of it, and what future plans there are to increase the number of midwives. As the hon. Member for Macclesfield pointed out, there has been an abject failure in the Department. One can in no way say that there has been success, when in 2005 the head count fell by 36. We all know that the head count is the Government's preferred way of accounting, and the Minister please should not insult us by returning to whole-time equivalents just because it happens to suit the occasion.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/5">It is easy to bandy figures about, but the availability of midwives underpins so much more. Some services have suffered, and poorly staffed units are leading in some cases to closures. The 2002 report received considerable evidence to show that poorly staffed units often have an increased rate of caesarean sections. That procedure is more expensive and places a greater demand on national health service resources. It has not been mentioned much today, but we should try to tackle it. The rate of caesarean sections in this country is about 24 per cent, and the World Health Organisation says that it should be about 14 per cent., so there seems to be a problem with the way in which we are managing things.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/6">Hon. Members have illustrated today that if units close, choice decreases. Often, the midwife-led units suffer. Other impacts include a lack of time to devote to the detection of domestic violence, which often starts during pregnancy. Our report highlighted that midwives are ideally placed to identify domestic violence and link up with other health workers. However, many midwives simply do not have time for that, nor do they have any extra time to give to ethnic minority women and to public health matters such as encouraging pregnant women to give up smoking, which I am sure the Minister is keen to encourage. A recent local development that has worried me greatly is that antenatal classes have been axed. I shall cover some of those matters in more detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/7">The cuts in antenatal classes are particularly worrying because that is where many women obtain information about where to give birth and what will happen when they do, and about post-natal support such as for breast feeding. That service has been cut ostensibly because of lack of numbers, but it is clear that no attempt has been made to commission services from elsewhere and organisations such as the National Childbirth Trust and even independent midwives would be keen to step into the breach.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/8">What is even more worrying is that many women decide at antenatal classes where to give birth. Until that point, they may not have been aware of a local birthing or midwifery unit and it is insidious to reduce demand for a birthing unit so that in future years, or even months, NHS managers will be able to turn round and say that there is no demand for such services.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/9">It is extremely worrying that women will not receive information about giving birth because if they know what is going on they are more likely to have a pleasant experience. Some people would say that childbirth is never a pleasant experience, but there are differences in how people feel about giving birth and how they cope with it. Antenatal education can help with that. Women are left to obtain information from a variety of sources, which is okay if they are educated and can afford to buy books and magazines, but more difficult for those who are struggling on a budget and do not know where to go for help.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/10">It is more common for a woman to arrive at hospital feeling frightened and vulnerable, which can lead to her not having a good birth experience. That brings me to one-to-one midwifery care. Much is made of that and most midwives would say that one-to-one midwifery care enables a midwife to stay with a woman and to provide support from the onset of labour and probably even before that, during pregnancy, and to be present during the birth, but one-to-one care is shown in the figures if the midwife is simply present at the end to deliver the baby. The reality is that in busy obstetrics units many midwives look after more than one woman during labour. That is a disaster waiting to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/11">I tabled some parliamentary questions to try to obtain a definition of one-to-one midwifery care and had a spectacular lack of success. A certain Mrs. Blair opened the new Royal College of Nursing building and happened to mention that she had had two midwives. She was lucky, but she did not seem to think that it was unusual. It might help if someone made it clear that Members of Parliament and their wives should have the same treatment as other people.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/12">One-to-one care is more likely to be achieved in a birthing centre. Other advantages of midwife-led units are that care is provided by midwives who can specialise in supporting women through normal births with a minimum of intervention and an explicit philosophy to provide a friendly, individualised, women-centred and family-focused service which can deliver high-quality care. The problem seems to be that on paper the costs are a bit higher. What often happens is that the wider picture is not taken into account and there is evidence to show that women delivering in birthing units have a lower rate of intervention and less need for aftercare. That is not factored into the equation, but it should be.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/13">I have talked a little about the rates for caesarean births. The Government have decided to publish success rates for certain cardiac surgeons, but when the Health Committee suggested that they should publish obstetricians' success rates for caesarean sections, we were told that there were no plans to do so. Now that we have more openness in other areas, it would be useful to develop that idea.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/14">I am rapidly running out of time. I end by saying that the lack of midwives means that there is little time to devote to breastfeeding. Next week is national breastfeeding awareness week. It would be useful if the Minister could tell us when the breastfeeding co-ordinator will be replaced&mdash;the post has been unfilled since February. Perhaps we shall hear some good news next week.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09a.17.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1409" speakername="John Baron" colnum="17"  time="010:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h01.htm#60509h01_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.17.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" name="Nicholas Winterton">the Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)</phrase> on securing this debate and on the eloquent way in which he raised the issues. I wish him well in his campaign to keep mother and child in Macclesfield hospital, and also in promoting option D.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/2">I welcome the Minister to her new responsibility for maternity services. May I say how sad we were to hear that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase> had resigned? Despite her obvious defence of Government policy, one felt that one could hold a constructive debate with her. I hope that that will continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/3">To say that midwives and those who work with them make an invaluable contribution to the NHS and to our national life is to state the obvious. We have all been touched by a midwife. However, contrary to what has been said by the Health Secretary, it has not been a good year for maternity services. Unfortunately, as we have heard, they are rapidly becoming the latest victims of NHS deficits.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/4">According to a survey by the Royal College of Midwives carried out last September, 78 per cent. of maternity units in England have been experiencing staffing shortages. Vacancy rates in England stood at almost 5 per cent. of establishment, the figure rising to more than 10 per cent. in London. Of those vacancies, almost two thirds represent long-term vacancies of more than three months. My hon. Friend went into some detail about why the Government may be understating the extent of those midwifery shortages, so I shall not go over that ground again.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/5">Meanwhile, according to last month's work force census, the number of full-time equivalent midwives&mdash;the best way of measuring their availability&mdash;has risen by only 5 per cent. since 1997, during which time spending on the NHS has almost doubled. That suggests that midwifery is one of the poor relations within the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/6">The big question on many people's lips is, &quot;Where has all the money gone?&quot; Even on the Government's head-count measure, the number of midwives working in the NHS fell between 2004 and 2005. It is generally accepted that the Government have bombarded the health service with targets. That has spawned a massive growth in bureaucracy, because the targets have to be monitored and measured; and that bureaucracy has soaked up a lot of the new NHS money and prevented it from reaching front-line services. Maternity services certainly seem to be suffering as a result.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/7">The challenges facing maternity services are growing, not diminishing. The number of births in England in 2003&ndash;04 was 5 per cent. higher than in the previous year. Women are experiencing childbirth both earlier and later in their lives, and younger and older women tend to be at greater medical and social risk. That is one of the factors that has contributed to the need for more medical intervention in childbirth, which has resulted in longer post-natal stays and greater pressure on hard-working midwives.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/8">Now is the time to have more midwives&mdash;that is generally accepted&mdash;yet we believe that staffing shortages under this Government are now compromising patient care. In July 2005, the Healthcare Commission report on maternity services highlighted the problems of overcrowding, the shortage of midwives and the fact that staff are too busy to give advice on the feeding and bathing of new babies. The RCM and others pointed out this week that the current financial crisis in the NHS is adding to the woes of the profession. Indeed, in a snapshot survey of heads of midwifery carried out by the college, one in three managers reported that maternity service budgets had been cut and one in four respondents reported that midwifery staffing numbers had been reduced; and almost half of all trusts have a freeze on recruitment. If the Minister believes for one moment that NHS deficits are not affecting front-line services, I strongly recommend that she examine the RCM data.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/9">The shortages have a knock-on effect for the midwives who remain in the NHS, as their work load increases so that the system can cope, they become more stressed and morale suffers. Such dedicated professionals deserve better support. The impact of deficits on front-line services can be seen in the scaling back of antenatal classes and neonatal home visits in some areas, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1640" name="James Brokenshire">the Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire)</phrase> has highlighted in the House on a number of occasions.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/10">Elsewhere, specialist neonatal care units are suffering; there is no shortage of evidence of that. We have heard about a case in which a Coventry woman who went into premature labour was driven more than 100 miles in an ambulance because there were no available facilities anywhere in the midlands. The woman, who was expecting twins, ended up in Manchester, in pain and feeling very isolated. That story made the local press.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/11">The Government recognise, to a certain extent, that there are problems. In their last manifesto, they made a clear commitment&mdash;referred to by one or two speakers today:</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/12" class="indent">&quot;By 2009 all women will have choice over where and how they have their baby and what pain relief to use.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/13">The manifesto went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/14" class="indent">&quot;We want every woman to be supported by the same midwife throughout her pregnancy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/15">However, I ask the Minister how the Government can hope to implement their manifesto promises, or meet the standards already drawn up, when there is a shortage of midwives. As the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree admitted recently in evidence to the Health Committee, although one-to-one midwifery support</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/16" class="indent">&quot;is a commitment we made in our manifesto . . . The brake on us delivering that is the lack of midwives . . . we do not have enough midwives to be able to provide it&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/17">Perhaps the Minister can tell us how many women are currently being offered one-to-one maternity services. Or perhaps she would care to comment on the Jentle midwifery programme run at the Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea hospital, which invites couples to part with &pound;4,000 in return for 24-hour one-to-one care. I do not for one moment criticise women for seeking the best possible maternity care in the NHS, and I understand that the aim of the scheme is to reinvest profits in front-line services, but it would be absolutely outrageous if some mothers were being charged for a service that Labour says ought to be theirs by right, while those who cannot afford to pay are being left behind by the Government. Having offered a policy at the last election, Ministers should be implementing that policy for all mothers, irrespective of their ability to pay, but staff shortages stand in the way.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/18">How can the Government offer women greater choice in where they give birth when the National Childbirth Trust has drawn our attention to closures of community-based birth centres? At least 10 of approximately 100 centres across the UK are either closed or facing closure. As we all know, those centres allow maternity services to be delivered in a less medicalised, more home-like setting and therefore promote choice, but choice is now being curtailed as cash-strapped primary care trusts withdraw midwives to cover shortages in acute hospitals. An alternative to giving birth in hospital is home birth, but one in four respondents to the RCM's survey of maternity managers reported a reduction in the number of home visits by midwives.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/19">There can be little doubt that we need to tackle the current financial crisis and develop longer-term strategies for recruiting more midwives into the profession and for retaining the ones that we have. I would like to ask the Minister a few questions, and if she cannot answer them in the time available to her, I hope that she will do so in writing. First, what plans does she have to raise the status of the profession, for example by enabling more midwives to prescribe from the nurse practitioners' extended formulary? Giving midwives greater responsibility and status would promote the profession and give encouragement to those working in midwife-led units, which are already very popular with women.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/20">I refer the Minister to the reports produced by the Nursing and Midwifery Council and the RCM that point to the ageing profile of the work force, and the problems that that will create in a few years' time.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/21">We also need to tackle the high attrition rates in midwifery training courses, which can be 20 per cent. or higher. At the last election, the Conservatives were pledged to enhance access to bursaries, which would have more closely reflected the cost of living. Will the Minister comment on the need for greater financial support to be given to trainee midwives? I also ask her to make a short statement on her policy in respect of the NHS community midwifery model proposed by the Independent Midwives Association and supported by other childbirth charities.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/22">In conclusion, I simply say that maternity services are vital for our future and deserve our support, and I ask the Minister to clarify what action the Government will take to address urgently the shortage of midwives in the NHS.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09a.20.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health"  colnum="20"  time="010:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h01.htm#60509h01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.20.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" name="Nicholas Winterton">the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)</phrase> on securing the debate, and on his role as an honorary vice-president of the Royal College of Midwives. My namesake Caroline Flint was once president of the RCM, and during my political activities since I was a student we have sometimes been mixed up with each other. Being approached as an expert in this area is something that I have experienced on a couple of occasions, and I have had to correct people by pointing out that I am not that Caroline Flint. However, I have met her, and she has done a fantastic job in representing midwives, as well as in her professional work.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/2">I should also say that I am covering this Adjournment debate for the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" name="Ivan Lewis">the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis)</phrase>, who will take on his new ministerial responsibilities for maternity services and children's services from the former Health Minister who is now the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety. However, obviously I am interested in this area, and I am happy to listen to the discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/3">I am pleased to be able to say that, although there is room for improvement&mdash;that is why the national service framework was initiated&mdash;80 per cent. of women in a survey last summer said that they were happy with maternity services. We have invested &pound;1.4 billion per year in maternity services, and in 2001 we made a capital investment of &pound;100 million to modernise facilities and improve the environment in which maternity care is delivered. I understand that East Cheshire NHS Trust's share of that investment was approximately &pound;1.3 million, which was used to build a state-of-the-art antenatal centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/4">We are committed to trying to improve choice for women&mdash;and for fathers and families&mdash;and to meet the needs of future generations. Several hon. Members have raised the fact that more women are having babies later in their lives, but there is also the fact that younger women are having babies. I have a particular concern about that, because as public health Minister I am responsible for health inequalities, and about 60 per cent. of infant mortalities are linked to young women&mdash;I would describe some of them as young girls&mdash;who have babies perhaps too early in their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/5">However, there are also issues to do with other women who, because of technology and other changes, are able to have babies when they might not have been able to have had them in the past; in vitro fertilisation treatment is one example. Also, because of new technologies and better services some women with different types of disabilities are now able to give birth to their own children, which 10 or 20 years ago might not have been possible. We are dealing with a changing landscape. Ten or 20 years ago, some services in relation to children required longer stays in hospital. My youngest child was 18 yesterday; 18 years ago new mothers might have been expected to stay in hospital for three or four days. These days, mothers can be out of hospital within hours of having had their child, if everything has gone well. The diseases and conditions that children faced 30 years or more ago are also, thank goodness, no longer as prevalent. We have to address this changing landscape.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/6">The number of midwives has increased over the past few years. The number of training students is up 44 per cent. since 1997, and there is good news in other areas such as obstetrics and gynaecology. However, the Department is aware that there are concerns in this area, and I will take back to it some of the points made about shortages and other worries. That is one reason for our considering what better support we can give midwives. Through the 57 trusts, we have piloted midwife support workers as possible members of the team, to carry out some of the activities for which a qualified midwife is not needed but which are important aspects of the experience for women, thus freeing midwives for the aspects of supporting women in childbirth for which only they are qualified.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/7">I take on board the concerns raised by the hon. Member for Macclesfield about changes concerning payment by results; such concerns are one reason why we are proceeding with it only for some of the key acute services and why we are still considering, and discussing with many organisations, how payment by results would link to maternity services. I am pleased to tell him that the working group on developing models of payment by results is attending to issues of social complexity, and I assume that some of the issues that he raised will be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/8">We have established the maternity standard implementation advisory group, which represents stakeholders that include the royal colleges, service providers and the voluntary sector. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">The hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> mentioned a role for the voluntary sector in antenatal classes. I am somewhat surprised to hear about the cutting of antenatal classes and will be happy to pursue that and write to her further, because they are important in the process of ensuring that all women have as healthy a delivery as is practicable. Importantly, as she said, the opportunity to explore issues such as smoking and weight and how to look after the baby once it is born has a huge public health impact. Those services are very important to some women. That is a reason for my being keen that health, and questions of how such services are provided, should be a part of the development of children's centres.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.1/1">I am delighted to have secured this debate. Debates on cycling policy are certainly not regular occurrences in the House, although I hope that will change, and the main purpose of my introducing the debate is to ask why cycle use has not in general increased in this country, despite the steps that have been taken to encourage it, and to make some suggestions of what we need to do to change that position and to bring UK cycling levels up to those enjoyed in some other European countries, for example.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/2">Before I discuss the general policy, I want to spend a couple of minutes on an issue that is causing great concern to cyclists and cycling organisations, which is the proposal for changes to the highway code. Consultation on the proposals closes tomorrow, so the debate is timely. The Minister is, I am sure, aware of those concerns, as I imagine many other hon. Members will be, as about 11,000 e-mails and letters on the issue have been sent out by cyclists.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/3">I will not set out the concerns at any great length, but will describe them briefly for the benefit of those watching or listening to the debate, or who read it in the future. It is proposed to change the wording of the recommendations on cycle facilities under the highway code. The Cyclists Touring Club, or CTC, which has provided a briefing note to many Members, for which I am grateful, believes that the new wording means that</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/4" class="indent">&quot;the use of cycle facilities will no longer be discretionary for any cyclist who wants to protect him/herself from the threat of adverse legal action.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/5">It is suggested:</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/6" class="indent">&quot;If a cyclist was injured and there was a cycle facility nearby . . . the driver's insurer would have all the pretext they needed to argue that any compensation due to the cyclist should be reduced on the basis of 'contributory negligence'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/7">That threat is not just an academic nicety. Existing highway code rules have been used against cyclists in such a way, and cyclists have lost thousands of pounds as a result of not wanting to challenge such claims of contributory negligence when they are made against them in legal action following an accident.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.3/1">That is a very good suggestion, and I hope that the Minister will consider it. There is also, perhaps, a role for those who employ drivers, including large public sector bodies. They could do a lot to train their drivers to recognise the importance of observing not only road traffic regulations in general, but cycle stop lines in particular. As my hon. Friend rightly points out, those are frequently ignored.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/2">I turn to the wider issue of the steps that we need to take to achieve a real and significant increase in cycling in the UK. As the excellent background note from the CTC points out, cycle use has not increased in spite of ambitious targets. Although 68 per cent. of all trips and 58 per cent. of all car trips cover less than 5 miles, cycling accounts for less than 2 per cent. of trips made in Britain. That compares with a modal share of between 10 and 20 per cent. in many other European countries, and of up to 50 per cent. in some cities in the Netherlands.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/3">I am aware that the figure for Britain may be a little misleading, as it does not take into account some of the increase in cycling on off-road routes. That is not included in the overall statistics. In some towns and cities, there has been notable success in increasing cycling's share of overall transport use. However, that must mean that it has gone down in other cities, towns and communities. The overall picture is still pretty clear.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.2/1">Is not one of the problems&mdash;and perhaps one of the reasons for that trend&mdash;the fact that not everyone has the joined-up thinking of organisations such as Sustrans? As the same time that Sustrans is planning its safe routes to schools and safe routes to work campaigns, there are proposals for out-of-town railway stations, for example, which would encourage everybody to travel to the station by car, unlike in Cheltenham Spa, where I have regularly cycled to the railway station. Such counter-trends might be responsible for the figures to which the hon. Gentleman referred.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09a.26.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" speakername="Mark Lazarowicz" colnum="26"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h02.htm#60509h02_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.26.3/1">I do not feel able to comment on the position in Cheltenham, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will understand, but the general point about ensuring joined-up thinking on the issue at all levels of Government is essential. Those local authorities that exhibit joined-up thinking are the ones that have achieved increases in cycle use, while others have not.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.3/2">How do we increase cycle use in the UK? I agree with those who say that above all we must tackle the perception&mdash;in some cases, the reality&mdash;that cycling can be dangerous. The danger is often exaggerated but nevertheless is, I am sure, the most significant factor in deterring, in particular, new cyclists, younger cyclists and children from cycling, and parents from encouraging their children to cycle. Part of the solution to tackling that perception must be a much more extensive network of cycle paths, routes and facilities in urban and rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.3/3">A lot has been done, but we all know from personal experience of existing cycle networks with major gaps in them that, having travelled along a route that one wants to take, one has to join the normal street network at a particularly busy and apparently dangerous point. Experienced cyclists can perhaps cope, but those who are not experienced are deterred by those gaps in the network. They are also deterred by the localised gaps to which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> referred, which require cyclists to dismount or stop every few yards. To be blunt, that can make the cycle path quite useless and can occasionally increase the danger to cyclists as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.3/4">We need to change that, and we need a significant extension of cycle facilities, crossing paths and cycle lanes. Depending on what is appropriate to a location, that is the approach we need to encourage a change in perception and to make cycling much more widely taken up in this country. If we do not provide cycle facilities that are of use to cyclists, they might not use them and motorists might get uptight because they think money is being wasted on those facilities. Unnecessary hostility could arise between cyclists and motorists&mdash;and sometimes pedestrians&mdash;because of facilities not being properly planned and thought through.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.3/5">We need a comprehensive process that ensures the right approach for each road and location, and there are opportunities to achieve that. The Department for Transport is finalising guidance notes on pedestrian and cycle planning and shared-use facilities, and a promising first draft has been produced. However, the issue is not just about routes, lanes and cycle facilities. Cyclists, like pedestrians and the wider population, also benefit from traffic reduction measures, speed reduction measures, 20 mph zones and home zones. By reducing speed, those measures make the roads safer for cyclists and pedestrians&mdash;and indeed motorists&mdash;and could also help to improve the vibrancy of local streets and shopping centres, strengthening community life in our towns and cities.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09a.28.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" speakername="Mark Lazarowicz" colnum="28"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h02.htm#60509h02_spnew14">
	<p pid="a.28.0/1">As always, my hon. Friend makes a good point, which I am sure the Minister will take up.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/2">How can we achieve a comprehensive approach throughout the UK? It would be appropriate to require every local authority to carry out an audit of an existing network to see how they could create a comprehensive cycle network fit for cyclists in the area. Some authorities have done this and some have a good record, but others do not. That is why we need to do something to improve those authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/3">There is great variation between different UK towns and cities in the facilities provided for cycling, and as a result great variation between cycling's shares of overall transport usage. In my city of Edinburgh, the percentage of journeys to work by bike has doubled and continues to increase. It is still only a small percentage, but that is a move in the right direction. It is partly due to the fact that, for 20 years or more, there has been a consistent policy of promoting cycling and facilities have been provided to encourage it, accompanied by the very effective Lothian cycle campaign, Spokes, of which I am proud to be a member.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/4">That campaign ensured that the council was put under the microscope when cycle facilities were not as good as they should have been. There is always a need to do more and a need for more spending locally and nationally. Edinburgh and other cities&mdash;Cambridge is a good example&mdash;have shown where a difference can be made, and there are a number of such examples in London as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/5">Local leadership is important as it can ensure that in all developments&mdash;for example, those in transport, roads and housing&mdash;cycle facilities are built in from the start when it is cheaper to do so, rather than added later. Too often, cycling is not incorporated when developments start, when it could be quite easily, and planning authorities must be encouraged by appropriate guidance from central Government to ensure that that happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/6">The process must occur at a more local level as well. We need many more examples of people &quot;thinking bike&quot; in relation to new developments, buildings or whatever. Bluntly, we need only look at Parliament for examples of how that has not happened. During the past year, some, doubtless necessary, security improvements have been made around the perimeter of Parliament. Those could have been used as an opportunity to improve cycle access into and out of the Houses of Parliament and to improve conditions for cyclists travelling past, but we have created a situation that is even more dangerous for cyclists. We could start by putting our own House in order.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/7">I have spoken for longer than I intended, but I have taken quite a few interventions. We have to do something about the biggest single factor that influences the trend in cycle use in the UK, which is the provision of resources. I acknowledge the substantial capital funding that has been put into cycling by the Government. The funding programme for the development of a comprehensive strategy in six cities in England is particularly welcome, but I regret that my constituents will not be able to share that success: in Scotland, there has been a cut of more than a third in cycling spending from &pound;12 million to &pound;8 million a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/8">In the same period, transport spending has increased from &pound;800 million to &pound;1,200 million a year. For the most part, that increase lies with new motorways and similar roads, which are being promoted enthusiastically by the Lib Dem Minister for Transport and Telecommunications in the Scottish Parliament. I hope that our Lib Dem colleagues will say something to encourage a change of approach in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/9">Whatever is happening in different parts of the UK, we must try ensure that, instead of pilots, studies and local projects, there is a comprehensive approach to cycling policy at all levels of central Government and local government so that there is an increase in cycling and in the resources needed to encourage and support it locally. We need capital funding, of course&mdash;there have been increases there&mdash;as well as a steady and secure revenue funding stream. That could be particularly important in providing more training for cyclists.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/10">Training is important not only in schools, but for people at work, and it could be organised through and encouraged by employers. Training could be given in universities, colleges and other organisations with a large number of people who could be encouraged to cycle. More training would also, I hope, go some way toward discouraging those cyclists who break the rules of the road, ignore traffic lights, and endanger pedestrians and other cyclists who comply with the law. I condemn such behaviour. As one who cycles and also drives a car, I know that such irresponsible behaviour gives all cyclists a bad name. We should try to discourage it.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/11">Cycling has countless benefits and should be encouraged. It is one of the most environmentally friendly forms of transport and it could contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Motor vehicles are one of the most important contributors to those emissions, and are likely to be for many years to come. A shift to cycling in our towns and cities would also reduce congestion. Cycling is a healthy activity and it could help us to tackle the problem of obesity, particularly in children, about which we are all concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/12">I congratulate the Government on what they have done so far and urge them to take account of cyclists' concerns about the changes in the highway code. I also urge them to build on what they have done and to adopt a joined-up approach involving civil servants, central Government and local government to achieve a shift in resources and a change in attitudes. They should work together to help to make cycling as popular as it is in many of our European neighbours.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09a.29.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" speakername="Charlotte Atkins" colnum="29"  time="011:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h02.htm#60509h02_spnew15">
	<p pid="a.29.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase> on securing this timely debate. As he said, it is timely because tomorrow is the deadline for comments on the changes to the highway code.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/2">I also congratulate the Cyclists Touring Club on raising the profile of cyclists. Far from being annoyed, as its briefing note suggests, by the e-mails and letters that I have received from CTC supporters, I am delighted to receive them. For too long, cyclists have moaned about facilities, but have not punched their weight in terms of political pressure by lobbying MPs, Ministers and their local authorities. The CTC says that more than 11,000 cyclists have e-mailed their MPs in response to its campaign about the highway code. That is absolutely brilliant, but I have a complaint: I do not think that I got my fair share.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/3">Cyclists should now mobilise locally to put pressure on local authorities to produce local transport plans that provide for a cycle-friendly infrastructure. With cycling at an all-time low, it is unacceptable for local authorities to look at their local transport plans simply in terms of ensuring that there is no reduction in cycle use or achieving satisfactory minimum targets. The current state of affairs will not change unless there is pressure from local communities and the Department for Transport to make cycling a higher priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/4">With political activism at such a low ebb, well-organised local cycling groups could achieve a great deal on issues such as increased congestion and tackling the obesity epidemic. In that context, I want to mention Leek Cyclists Club, which is running some excellent events in August to celebrate its 130 years of existence&mdash;it was established in 1876. I hope to be supporting those events. I like the fact that the club is putting on a range of activities, including sportive rides, time trials and family rides. Continental cyclists will be involved as well. The proceeds will go to the local air ambulance service and to the first responder service. I hope that the club will not confine its activities to such events, but enthuse others and get much more involved with local schools to promote cycling, and with the local authority to ensure that more is done locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/5">I agree that under-resourcing is an issue. I must accept some responsibility for securing an allocation of only &pound;5 million a year to Cycling England when I was in the relevant Department. The hoped-for &pound;70 million was never on the cards; it was not going to happen. However, the creation of Cycling England has been a huge step forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/6">It is also important that we now have the new, accredited, national standard for cycling training, which is extremely welcome, as is the three-tier level. It will equip not just children but adults with training for on-road cycling and dealing with real traffic conditions, rather than involve just going round bollards and so on. Such things are great fun, but they do not always equip people for cycling on the road.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/7">It is hugely important to improve cycling skills and safety, as well as to give people much-needed confidence, because it can make a huge difference on the road. When I was in the Department, I was amazed to discover that the cycling proficiency scheme that I knew as a child no longer existed; it stopped 10 years ago. It is no wonder that fewer and fewer children cycle to school. Parents have to be convinced that their children will be safe cycling to school. Training is a vital part of that equation, although it will not necessarily overcome the overwhelming perception that cycling is dangerous.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/8">The &quot;Bike It&quot; scheme, which is particularly geared towards schools, will help to create a greater perception of safety, because it is working on personalised safety routes from home to school and on ensuring proper secure storage for bikes at school. It is important that when people embark on cycling they try to work out a safe route where they can deal with the hazards along the way much more securely.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/9">I met a group of enthusiastic child cyclists in one school who happily cycled in rain, snow or in any other conditions. Some were young and others were slightly older, but they all found the process incredibly empowering. They told me that they did not have to wait for their mum or dad to get the car out of the garage, because they could cycle to school at any time, and that gave them huge independence, as well as increased physical fitness, which is a welcome side effect. That independence is important, because nowadays children are often shepherded to school and to shops, dance classes and so on. The fact that children could go out on their own in safety&mdash;along a safety route&mdash;meant that they felt independent, and they enjoyed that feeling of freedom.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/10">I am sure that the proposed changes to the highway code are intended to improve the safety of cyclists. However, many cycle lanes are poorly designed or badly maintained. John Grimshaw of Sustrans demonstrated that to me when he took me to Bristol along such routes. Given that cyclists are just about the most vulnerable road users, it is important that they can make their own choices about whether to ride along a cycle route or along the road without fear of adverse legal consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/11">Of course, a minority of cyclists behave badly and illegally, flouting traffic laws, and I find them as annoying as anyone else does, but let us be realistic. Many motorists also flout traffic laws, not least by using mobile phones. Unbelievably, some people also use mobile phones when cycling. I cannot understand why they do that; it is appalling. However, the highway code should not be drafted as though all cyclists are irresponsible. Most are not. They want to cycle safely and survive in what are often difficult traffic conditions. No one wants the risks to cyclists to increase, or cyclists to be penalised for deciding not to use a cycle lane. I think we all know examples of cycle lanes that go just a few yards or that come to an abrupt end at a junction or, worse still, at a roundabout.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09a.32.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" speakername="David Kidney" colnum="32"  time="011:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h02.htm#60509h02_spnew22">
	<p pid="a.32.4/1">I can give that confirmation. Looking along the rows of seats, the score in the category of Daves who support cycling is Labour 3, Tories 1.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/2">There is good support for cycling in Stafford, thanks in large part to the LA21 team at Stafford borough council, particularly the outstanding Karen Davies who leads it so well. We enjoy family cycling days that are organised by her team. Under the Back 2 Bikes recycling scheme, people give up their damaged or old cycles, which are repaired and made available to new users. They are rented out, hired out or even loaned to people who cannot afford to buy a bike. We do what we can in my constituency to support cycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/3">My reasons for cycling are mainly to keep my weight down&mdash;we attend far too many dinners in this place&mdash;and to keep my carbon dioxide emissions from transport to a minimum. If people cycle often, they enjoy health benefits and multiply the benefits to the health of our nation and our environment. There are, of course, additional social, economic and environmental benefits. For example, if people were to cycle rather than drive their vehicles in city and town centres, we would have cleaner air. That would mean less incidence of asthma and more pleasant surroundings for people who want to shop, window shop or simply stroll. It would make areas more attractive to people who want to shop and visit as tourists. Cycling provides all those wider benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/4">Cycling can help with rising obesity by increasing regular physical exercise, and it addresses the growing concern about climate change by contributing to reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. It can boost the retail sector, promote tourism and open up the countryside to more visitors. It can reduce the pressure on an over-congested road network, and, most important, it can be fun.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/5">It is necessary to stress the downside. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith spoke about the perception of danger, but in fact there is danger on roads from congestion, big vehicles and drivers who are less than attentive to their duties as drivers on busy roads. However, it is clear that the positives far outweigh the negatives, and the debate rightly aims at pushing the Government to do more to promote cycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/6">Like my hon. Friend, I believe that we ought to direct this debate to local authorities as well. They now have good levels of funding, thanks to the Government's generosity. They have local transport plans for strategic planning in their areas of roads, cycling and transport generally, and we want them to give the same priority to cycling as we are urging on my hon. Friend the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/7">My hon. Friend gave some examples of local authorities that have been successful in promoting cycling in their area. There has been a marked increase in recreational cycling, and cycling remains an important transport mode for many people, but, according to the Government's walking and cycling action plan for 2004,</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/8" class="indent">&quot;across England as a whole, we have not succeeded in raising cycling levels significantly above the 1996 baseline.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/9">There is one bright, sparkling spot of success that contradicts that conclusion: the national cycle network, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>. The figures that I have are for 2004, when there were more than 201 million trips on the national cycle network, an increase of some 11 per cent. in just one year. The Sustrans report for that year states:</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/10" class="indent">&quot;Traffic-free urban routes are crucial to the increased usage of the Network. Whilst the Network grew by 9.3 per cent. in urban areas between 2003 and 2004, cycling . . . trips on these routes grew by 16.0 per cent.&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/11">No doubt that is why the Department for Transport describes the national cycling network as</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/12" class="indent">&quot;the strongest success story in walking and cycling&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/13">in that very walking and cycling action plan of 2004. That is one good example of action to improve safety and security, and to reassure cyclists that their activity is safe as well as healthy. We must consider other ways of giving the same reassurance and support to cycling. Part of that strategy will mean more dedicated cycle lanes.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/14">My hon. Friends the Members for Edinburgh, North and Leith and for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) touched on the revisions to the highway code. In any collision between a car and a cyclist, it is inevitable that the cyclist will come off worse than the driver of the car. The onus is much more on the driver of the vehicle to take care, and cyclists' worry about revising the highway code is based on unscrupulous drivers and insurance companies using the highway code to try to make spurious counter-claims against cyclists who get hurt in collisions. They are right to possess that fear. The law on driver insurance needs to be changed so that non-motorised road users can claim injury damages from drivers who hit them, unless it can be shown that they were reckless in causing the collision that led to their injury.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/15">When I was a solicitor, which is an increasingly long time ago, I experienced making claims in countries other than Britain for people who were injured in road collisions. Countries such as France already have rules that put the onus on drivers and their insurance companies to compensate other people who are injured by the actions of vehicles. Their pedestrians and cyclists have stronger protection by law, and I urge that approach on our Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/16">Another important consideration for the protection of cyclists is the education of motorists. We heard about the bad habit of driving while using a mobile phone, and about drivers who do not see cyclists even though they are in front of their eyes. In my constituency, I have seen drivers driving too close to cyclists as they try to pass them, and opening their car doors as cyclists go past, because they forgot their duty to look over their shoulder. We must draw motorists' attention to their responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/17">Recently, I saw some Government-sponsored advertisements on the television that were successful in drawing attention to the presence of motorcyclists on our roads. We need much more of the same for cyclists as part of the Government's publicity campaign. I should also like more use of 20 mph zones, where all traffic slows down. They give cyclists a fairer chance of a safe journey.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/18">The Commission for Integrated Transport looked throughout Europe at transport best practice in 2001, and as part of its report it found that area-wide 20 mph limits are</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/19" class="indent">&quot;the one critical success factor underpinning best practice in promoting walking, cycling and public transport as alternatives to the private car&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/20">Living Streets, a charity that promotes safer streets, is part of the Safer Streets Coalition, which comprises organisations including CTC. It wants safer roads for all road users. When I met Living Streets, it argued that there are three big reasons for making 20 mph the default speed in most streets. It said:</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/21" class="indent">&quot;It is the one thing that will do most to cut casualties, make streets vibrant and people centred, boost sustainable transport.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/22">I agree with those arguments, adopt them myself and urge them on the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/23">I also received the great sheaf of letters that my hon. Friends mentioned, objecting to the highway code changes. I have had letters about another campaign&mdash;CTC-inspired, I think&mdash;to integrate cycle and rail transport. It is a policy, as one of my constituents called it, of doorstep to destination. It was urged on me that the Government should have a national policy framework that puts cycling and rail use together, covering things such as station access and parking, and storing cycles safely at stations. In the nine years that I have been going to platform 1 of Stafford station to catch my train to Parliament, I have seen the growth of a safe parking area for cycles on the platform. As it has grown, so has its use, and there is a large number of bicycles there every Monday morning when I am waiting for the train to Euston.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/24">The letters that I have received also urge that the national policy framework should cover on-board cycle carriage facilities, information about cycle use and carriage, the possibility of cyclists reserving places on trains for their cycles, and the wider use of consultation and monitoring. Again, I ask the Minister to consider those options.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/25">We already have policies on safe routes to schools, and those should clearly include cycling. It is particularly important that we reassure parents that it is safe for their children to cycle to school. That is why 20 mph limits are important, particularly around schools, and why safe parking and storage for children's cycles is vital in schools. In my constituency, I speak to students in schools and listen to representatives of schools councils, and there is tremendous interest in safe parking and storage facilities for cycles. However, there is not always enough money for every school that wants such facilities to have them, and I hope that we can put that right. It is also important, as my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands said, that pupils have proper, structured instruction on safe cycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.4/26">My hon. Friend also mentioned employers, and I have seen examples of good practice in my constituency in terms of green travel plans. A small number of employers have taken the issue on board enthusiastically and developed plans to reduce demand among staff for coming to work in their own cars. Staffordshire county council gives good support and advice on that and has a small amount of money to assist employers in making changes, such as giving priority to parking for cycles, providing showers for people who cycle to work and so on. However, a bit more money to get such schemes up and running would be useful.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.1/1">I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase> on giving us the time and space to debate this important issue. I speak as a cyclist and chair of the all-party cycling group.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/2">I shall speak on behalf of an oppressed minority who spend much of their time in the gutter, who always seems to be in the wrong, and who are told that they are a danger to themselves, and possibly to pedestrians, and that they are definitely an annoyance to taxis and should get out of the bus lanes. However, we are clean, green and healthy, and cycling is the future of transport. The number of cyclists has doubled in London since 2000. Indeed, we have reached a critical mass in the capital, and motorists know that we are there.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/3">The more cycling there is on the roads, the safer they become, because the real danger is the metal boxes&mdash;the cars. We must encourage cycling and change attitudes to it. Cycling presses so many policy buttons. It helps with the environment, helps to make our lives easier, helps to ensure that our roads are no longer full and helps with the obesity epidemic. Cycling is the answer to so many of our problems, and I urge the Government to give greater priority to this important policy issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.0/1">I am pleased that my hon. Friend is now chair of the all-party cycling group. Cyclists have always been ahead of their time and the Clarion cycling clubs&mdash;people forget that they were the early socialists&mdash;formed the wedge that allowed us to have freedom of access. Going back 100 years, which would help socialism in this country, would give predetermination to the vital role of the bike in our society. Does she agree that that is a jolly good thing?</p>

	<p pid="a.37.1/1">It is a jolly good thing, as well as a timely reminder of our history and the close links between the socialist movement and cyclists. We hope to continue to push that forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/2">I was talking about London, and particularly how things have changed there and how in so many respects it shows the way. The speed of transport in central London is 9 mph, which is the same as it was at the turn of the last century when transport consisted of horses and carts. The statistics from Transport for London show that the time it takes to travel 4 miles is 22 minutes on a bicycle, 30 minutes on the tube, 40 minutes in a car and 62 minutes on a bus. It is much faster to make a 4-mile journey in London by bicycle, and cycling in London has already doubled.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/3">Another problem is that we are victims of some of the wackier suggestions and criticisms that are levelled against us. Unfortunately, some of those come from another place. A recent suggestion was to ask the Government whether they would be willing to consider carefully whether</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/4" class="indent">&quot;a new requirement that cyclists display on their clothing a clearly readable personal registration number and carry a registration card containing relevant information would confer benefits that outweighed the bureaucracy and costs that such a system would entail?&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2006-04-27.256"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 27 April 2006; Vol. 681, c. 256</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/5">May I urge the Government to ignore that advice? It is crazy to suggest that cyclists should carry numbers on their clothing so that they could be identified, and it would be equally insulting and crazy to expect pedestrians to do that. Cyclists are a special class and we need support. We do not need that eccentric criticism.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/6">There was also a suggestion in another place that 1,000 pedestrians in London were injured by cyclists last year. May I put an accurate defence of cyclists on the record? Last year, more pedestrians were hit and injured by mopeds than by bicycles. In 2004, one pedestrian was killed in a collision with a cyclist, but that is the only recent known death. Motor cyclists, of whom there are a similar number on the road as cyclists, killed 20 people and seriously injured another 200 last year. The number of direct pedestrian deaths caused by cars in the same year was 388, with another 5,000 people seriously injured and 20,000 moderately injured. On top of that, there were another 2,000 deaths on the road, all caused by motorised transport. It is a simple fact that the more cycling there is on the roads, the safer our roads become.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/7">May I take this opportunity to put in my ha'penny-worth on the highway code campaign? More than 11,000 cyclists contacted their MP about the matter. Several thousand sent in responses to the highway code consultation last weekend and succeeded in jamming the Driving Standards Authority's e-mail server, so several hundred cyclists have been unable to submit their views. However, I presume that I know what they are saying. They are asking the Government, &quot;Please do not make it our responsibility if we are injured or hurt by cars on the roads,&quot; because without the cars there would not be those injuries.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/8">In fact, if there were to be a policy initiative to help and protect cyclists, I would still strongly recommend that the Government continue to put money into cycle training, which is important, and not only for children. I had cycling training a few months ago&mdash;I have been cycling on the roads in London for nearly 30 years&mdash;and I was amazed at how helpful it was. I was told that it would simply be assertive cycling training, and those who know me were surprised that I needed that, but assertive cycling made me think about cycling in a different way.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/9">For example, I was taught not to cycle in the gutter; we are entitled to cycle on the road like anyone else. I was told not to cycle right by parked cars, but to move away from them, so that when a parked car's door opens, the cyclist does not get hit. When cyclists stop at traffic lights, they should stop in the middle of the road. They should make eye contact with drivers behind them, because once eye contact is made, drivers begin to think of the cyclist as a person, rather than an annoying blob. That is what is taught through cycle training, and anyone and everyone can benefit from it. It is a way for us to convince people that cycling can be safe, clean, green, healthy and good for us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/10">Finally, I would like to plug a couple of events. This afternoon in Room 8, at 4 o'clock, John Grimshaw is talking about his vision for enabling access to cycle paths by bike and for leaving permanent routes available after the Olympic games to cyclists who want to cycle round east London. Everyone is welcome at that meeting. I must also plug bike week, Bike2Work and the parliamentary bike ride on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-21">21 June</phrase>, which starts at 9 o'clock outside St. Pancras station. We chose St. Pancras to highlight the importance of integrating transport, including rail and bike transport, and to highlight the unfortunate lack of facilities for bicycles at Europe's largest rail hub. Everyone is welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/11">We cycle to Parliament, but, unfortunately, visitors to Parliament will have difficulties parking their bicycles, although the all-party cycling group is working on that, too. It has had meetings with Westminster city council and the parliamentary authorities, and we keep our fingers crossed that we can make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/12">Once again, I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith for giving us the space to debate this issue, and I look forward to the Minister's response. I hope that cycling continues to go up the agenda.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09a.38.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" speakername="John Leech" colnum="38"  time="011:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h02.htm#60509h02_spnew28">
	<p pid="a.38.0/1">I add my congratulations to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase> on securing what has turned out to be a very interesting debate on cycling. I confess that I had hoped that my first transport debate would be on something very specific, so I was alarmed when I saw the title &quot;Cycling&quot;, and I thank him for giving me some idea of the issues he wanted to raise.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/2">I would like to comment on a few issues. The hon. Gentleman and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> raised concerns about proposed changes to the highway code. I add my support to the campaign to avoid those changes, which could discourage people from cycling. The hon. Members for Stafford and for Stroud (Mr. Drew) raised important points about the compulsory wearing of cycle helmets. In the short term, making helmets compulsory would probably reduce the number of people cycling, although a debate is needed on whether such a move would improve the safety of cyclists in the long term. That is an important question.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/3">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith made a good suggestion about forcing local authorities to audit their cycle facilities, but if there are no additional resources, we might find that although local authorities recognise that cycling facilities seriously need to be installed, they might not be able to install them.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/4">On the point about resources, the hon. Gentleman raised concerns over funding cuts for cycling in Scotland and made special mention of the Liberal Democrat Minister for Transport and Telecommunications. However, I should point out that, thanks to the Liberal Democrat manifesto commitment of 2003, the new ScotRail franchise has been negotiated so that bikes can be carried on trains, which will encourage the use of bikes.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/5">Similarly, under that Liberal Democrat Minister, spending on public transport as a proportion of overall transport spending will rise by 70 per cent. between 2003 and 2007, compared with an increase of less than 50 per cent. under Labour's stewardship. Perhaps the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith ought to speak to his colleagues in Scotland as well as preaching to the Liberal Democrats about their commitment to cycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/6">No one will dispute that we should encourage more people to cycle. The benefits are clear: cycling keeps people fit and healthy&mdash;it is nice to see so many fit and healthy Members here today, who are all committed to cycling&mdash;cuts congestion, reduces pollution and makes our streets safer because there are fewer cars out there. Unfortunately, cycling has been in decline since Labour came to power. During the first two terms of the Labour Government, bicycle trips fell by 22 per cent. Equally worryingly, the length of the trips that people make has gone down. According to figures produced by the CTC, which were mentioned by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith, only 2 per cent. of road trips in Britain are made by bicycle. We all agree that that must change.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/7">To be fair to the Government&mdash;no one has mentioned this&mdash;one of the main reasons for cycling rates not being as good as they are elsewhere is our pretty poor weather. According to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase>, the sun is always shining in Stafford.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.2/1">I am not going to dispute the hon. Gentleman's description of the British weather, but it is important to do away with the myth that one must have a perfect climate to encourage cycling. The Netherlands does not have a climate drastically different from that in much of the UK for much of the year, but it has a much higher cycling level. Before anyone says that that is because the Netherlands is flat, plenty of places in urban areas in the UK are pretty flat too. Let us not get caught up with the idea that bad weather is the reason for people not cycling more in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.1/1">I am most grateful to the hon. Lady, because she takes the words out of my mouth. The National Forum for Coronary Heart Disease Prevention says that regular cyclists enjoy a fitness level equal to that of a person 10 years younger. If one third of all short car journeys were made by bike, national heart disease would fall by between 5 and 10 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">The hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> mentioned space and commuting. Cyclists require far less space to get about than car-borne travellers. For example, a 4 m wide cycle path can carry five times the number of people catered for in cars on a road that is twice as wide, according to Friends of the Earth.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/3">The Conservatives have a strong record of supporting cycling. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1629" name="Boris Johnson">the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson)</phrase> have given spectacular publicity to the activity. The former said:</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/4" class="indent">&quot;We must give people, particularly those living in our towns and cities, serious travel options that don't involve the car. Around a quarter of all car trips are under 2 miles in length. If we're serious about tackling climate change&mdash;and incidentally about improving public health too&mdash;we need to help make it possible for people to walk or cycle on these shorter journeys.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/5">He was going right back to our strategy of 10 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/6">In 1996, the Conservative Government produced a national cycling strategy that set the ambitious target of doubling the number of cycle trips by 2002 and quadrupling it by 2012. The strategy listed a series of actions to be taken by the Government and by local authorities to enhance the activity of cycling. Sadly, I do not have the time to mention them, but they were effectively endorsed by the new Labour Government in the 1998 transport White Paper. However, everything fizzled into the sand.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/7">We did not achieve the results that were promised. Targets became aspirations. The most damning document was the Government's review, published in March 2005. In many ways it is a symbol of what happened to the huge ambitions that the Government had when they came in, which were scaled back and changed when they hit reality. They set off with a national cycling strategy, and we were to have a national cycling forum, but that was reduced in number, as were the targets. Indeed, we did not meet the targets; according to the Government's review, the number of cyclists in England fell by a fifth in the past decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/8">Considering how much depended on local government input, it is extraordinary that none of the best value indicators took account of cycling, as one of the main delivery agents was bound to be local government. Nor was it in the Audit Commission's comprehensive performance assessment, because cycling did not have a category of its own; it was lumped in with transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/9">There appears to be a conflict on funding. Although cycling is covered by a number of Departments, they seem to be muddling around with the funding. There is Department for Transport funding; there is Department for Education and Skills funding; and there is the travelling to schools initiative. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is involved. Indeed, Hull's local initiative on cycling is one of the success stories, although it does not appear to have changed the outward profile of the Deputy Prime Minister. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is involved through the Countryside Agency, with its quiet lanes and rural transport partnership initiatives; the Forestry Commission is involved; and so is the Environment Agency. The Department of Health mentions cycling in its action plan on diet, physical activity and obesity; and then there is Sport England.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/10">What measures have been taken since the review to co-ordinate better that kaleidoscopic group of Departments? They all have the best intentions, but they do not seem to be well co-ordinated.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/11">There are some interesting examples. I mentioned Hull, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase> mentioned Milton Keynes, but perhaps the most interesting is Bristol, where a 14 km bus priority lane increased cycling more than any initiative targeted on cycling itself. What is the Government's current policy? Three options were mentioned at the end of the review&mdash;working exclusively through non-governmental organisations, reforming and refocusing the national cycling strategy board, or working more closely with local authorities. I would be interested to know the current state of play, because in a somewhat Irish manner the conclusion appeared to be in the introduction to the review, which said that the intention was to create a clear steering board of funding Departments to co-ordinate the Government's cycling strategy and to direct the work of Cycling England. I will be grateful if the Minister can tell us how that was brought together.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/12">I want to touch on the vexed question of cycle helmets. Like many hon. Members, I have received numerous letters from constituents. For instance, Mr. Adrian Hanson-Abbott of Wollerton said that he is worried about having compulsory cycle helmets. He thinks that they are poorly designed and that some are positively dangerous. He also raised the conundrum of the insurers of a driver who had been negligent and injured a nine-year-old boy wriggling out of liability on the ground that the parents had not made the child wear a helmet. This is a vexed area that the hon. Member for Stafford was right to raise.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/13">Cycle helmets are compulsory in Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Iceland, the Czech Republic, Canada and 20 states in the United States, and there is clear evidence that a good, properly designed helmet will reduce brain, head and facial injuries. My worry is enforcement. Several hon. Members have mentioned mobile phones. We have enough trouble enforcing existing traffic laws without putting a huge extra burden on police. There is also a valid problem of deterrence, and it would be unfortunate if compulsion deterred people from wearing helmets.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/14">I would also like the Minister to comment on research on helmets that work. The CTC briefing, which was most helpful, said that helmets are currently designed for impact speeds of about 13 mph, whereas 93 per cent. of serious and fatal accidents for cyclists occur on roads in collisions with vehicles, and 22 per cent. with HGVs, where the speeds will obviously be far more than 13 mph. The work should be on better technology and cycle helmets that really work. I wonder whether there has been any discussion of that with the equestrian industry, which has done an enormous amount of work on riding helmets. Finally, has the Minister also examined the merits of reflective clothing?</p>

Friends the Members for Stafford (Mr. Kidney), for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) and for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry) on their contributions. My hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands did a lot of work when she was a Minister in the Department and I should like to recognise that. I also recognise the tremendous work that the all-party cycling group does to promote cycling and address the issues that relate to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.0/2">Many people have an interest in cycling, whether they cycle or not&mdash;although I suspect that we have all been cyclists at some stage. The Government want to encourage more people to cycle; the basic advantages of cycling are convenience, health, cost, environment and enjoyment, as hon. Members have mentioned. To put it simply, cycling contributes to a better quality of health. As some hon. Members pointed out, there has been a decline in cycling, and people continue to use their cars even for short journeys. Between 1999 and 2001, one quarter of all car trips covered less than two miles. In many cases, those journeys could have been made by cycle and we want to promote that.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.0/3">The Government are committed to reversing the decline in the number of cycling trips. If we are to attract people out of their cars and on to two wheels, we have to make cycling safe, easy and as convenient as possible. That means seeing cycling as a solution to problems of accessibility, health, affordability and the environment. That is why Cycling England, our advisory body on cycling, reports not only to my Department but to others with an interest in cycling, such as the Department of Health, the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for Education and Skills. That is also why I will host a meeting of Ministers next week to discuss how cycling can help to deliver a range of Government targets across Whitehall.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.0/4">Encouraging cycling means having the right facilities at schools and places of work, and training youngsters to enjoy riding a bike. There are many good examples of improvements and good practice in cycling. For example, as one of my hon. Friends made clear, there has been a considerable increase in cycling to work in London thanks to investment and commitment from Transport for London and the development of the London cycle network. I cannot recall seeing as many cyclists on the roads in recent months as I saw this morning on the way in. Perhaps that has something to do with the good weather, but there are tremendous numbers of cyclists on the road.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.0/5">The Mayor announced last year that the number of recorded cycle journeys on London's key roads had doubled in the previous five years, from 59,000 in 2000 to 119,000 in 2005. Even more impressively, London has experienced a reduction in casualties among cyclists, as other road users have become more aware of their presence. Transport for London reports that since 1990 there has been a 35 per cent. reduction in cycling casualties. That shows that, with the right support and infrastructure, casualties will not necessarily rise if cycling increases.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.0/6">As has been mentioned, there are also good examples of increases in cycling in rest of the country, such as in Hull and York, where the national trends have been bucked and a successful cycling programme has been implemented. We undertook a review of the national cycling strategy in 2004, which led to the appointment of Cycling England, the new advisory body made up of experts from the main cycling organisations. Cycling England has been given an annual budget of &pound;5 million, which is in addition to nearly &pound;55 million that has been provided for cycling through local transport plans and Transport for London. Outside London, there has been an increase from &pound;29.5 million in 2001&ndash;02 to &pound;36 million in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.0/7">One of the key elements of Cycling England's work plan is six cycle demonstration towns. Cycling England is investing in some &pound;8.4 million in Aylesbury, Brighton, Darlington, Derby, Exeter and Lancaster over the next three years. I return to an earlier point about incorporating cycling into the design of new housing developments and towns. One reason why we picked Aylesbury was the expansion in housing that will take place there soon and the opportunity to incorporate cycling into the design of the new housing development and expansion there.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.0/8">Work has already begun to showcase best practice in design and planning in relation to the promotion of cycling. The aim is to test the hypothesis that if we spend levels per head of the population equal to the levels spent in European cities where there has been a significant increase in cycling, we can achieve similar increases here. I assure hon. Members that I take a personal interest in those developments, and I will visit each of the cycling demonstration towns. We have already had a meeting in London to discuss their progress, which will be regularly monitored.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.0/9">Journeys to school were mentioned. Only 2 per cent. of children cycle to school. Increasing that figure is important not only to increase cycling but to reduce obesity levels and generally invest in healthier future generations. Some &pound;2 million was invested in 2005&ndash;06 to extend the links to schools programme, which several hon. Members mentioned, on top of &pound;10 million of Government investment in the previous year. That money has drawn in additional funds, so that &pound;31 million has been spent on the project. So far, more than 300 schools have been linked to the national cycle network by more than 230 km of new routes, of which about 70 per cent. are traffic-free.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.0/10">Cycling England has a number of other initiatives under way, and is developing and promoting a new national cycle training standard to replace the old cycle proficiency test&mdash;I took that test in a previous life, as other hon. Members might have done&mdash;so as to better equip children with the skills they need to ride safely on today's roads. Cycling England is also working with health authorities, improving the skills of local authority practitioners through a free advisory service backed up by training programmes and improving the marketing of cycling schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.0/11">Tomorrow I shall attend Cycling England's first annual forum. I am looking forward to discussing its achievements to date and meeting many of the partners who are helping to deliver new initiatives on cycling.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09a.49.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" speakername="Mark Lancaster" colnum="49"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h03.htm#60509h03_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.49.1/1">I welcome the Minister to her new appointment. I congratulate her and promise not to be too harsh on her today. If I am remembered for one thing during my time as Member of Parliament for North-East Milton Keynes, I hope it is my campaign for &quot;i before e&quot;&mdash;infrastructure before expansion. That is the key to the future expansion of Milton Keynes.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/2">The phrase &quot;i before e&quot; tells people two things. The first is obvious: that the infrastructure must be in place before the city expands. It also says that I am not opposed to the expansion per se of Milton Keynes. It is vital that our young people have somewhere to live and that they have houses that they can afford. As an aside, while I am on affordable housing, the &pound;60,000 house, which has been much publicised by the Minister, is misleading. People think that they can buy a house for that sum; they do not realise that it represents the building cost and not the purchase cost. In Milton Keynes, a &pound;60,000 house is more likely to cost &pound;130,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/3">While I assume that the Minister will not disagree with my &quot;i before e&quot; campaign, I sense that we differ. She wants Milton Keynes to expand on her terms, with or without the consent of local people, while I am determined that local residents should have the final say on how, and at what rate, it should grow. With that in mind, she may be interested to know that last week I presented a petition to the House signed by more than 4,000 residents. It is relevant, and it declared</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/4" class="indent">&quot;that for any community to be 'sustainable' the plans for its expansion must be supported by existing residents and that Milton Keynes Partnerships' 'Public Consultation' process was not long enough to fully involve the Citizens of Milton Keynes in the decision making process regarding the 2031 Milton Keynes expansion plans. The Petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urge the Government to set up a local referendum to decide:</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/5" class="indent">If the expansion planning and delivery should be returned to those who are democratically elected to represent and service the people of Milton Keynes and the surrounding area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/6">The petition sums up my view exactly. Without genuine local support, the Government's sustainable communities plan is destined to fail in Milton Keynes. I am not calling for a referendum on every decision, but the local authority, which is democratically elected by local people, should be allowed a genuine say on how the city will grow. According to a recent survey, that is a view shared by 88 per cent. of local residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/7">In simple terms, I believe in a bottom-up approach, but the Government prefer the top-down approach. If the Minister does not want to take my word for it, she need only consider last week's local elections in Milton Keynes. Just over a year ago, my constituency was represented by a Labour Member of Parliament, yet last week Labour polled less than 15 per cent. of the vote there. I am convinced that one of the reasons for the Conservative revival in my constituency is that we are the only major party promoting the active involvement of local people in deciding how the city will expand.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/8">The Government's approach is rather different. I sense that the Minister and her colleagues are rather nervous about what might happen if, God forbid, local residents have some form of control over their future. The Government prefer the autocratic approach via unelected and unaccountable quangos. In Milton Keynes, we are talking about English Partnerships and its local delivery vehicle, Milton Keynes Partnership.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/9">The Government occasionally, via the Milton Keynes Partnership, like to give the impression of local involvement. After all, there are three elected members of the local authority on its board, complete with a generous salary, but they have no authority. While I accept that such a situation is becoming the norm for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, it is not the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/10">The Milton Keynes Partnership recently consulted the local population about its six options for growth for the city. Even though, according to the survey that I mentioned, 78 per cent. of people in the city had no idea that the consultation had taken place&mdash;either because it was so poorly advertised or so short&mdash;the residents who did respond flatly rejected all six options. Presumably, it is a case of going back to the drawing board. Of course, the advantage of being an unelected, unaccountable quango is that one can press on regardless of local views.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/11">Milton Keynes cannot just do its own thing, and there must be co-ordination with other regional organisations. To be fair, I should say to the Minister that Jane Hamilton and her staff at English Partnerships are very professional, but often their hands are tied as they cannot serve two masters and, however sympathetic they are to the needs of Milton Keynes, they know that their principal loyalty is to central Government, not the city. Let me give the Minister just one example of what I mean. Between 2004 and 2008, via English Partnerships the Government will rob Milton Keynes of &pound;494 million by selling off the city's land bank, and put back just &pound;201 million. Therefore, there will be a net outflow of nearly &pound;300 million, stolen from the city by Government via an unelected, unaccountable quango.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/12">Assuming that the Minister supports my &quot;i before e&quot; campaign, I am sure she will share my concern at the detrimental effect that this drive to squeeze every penny out of the city is having on the local community. For example, numerous green reserved sites across the city are now being considered for sale for residential development. Walton high school in my constituency&mdash;an excellent school that both the Prime Minister and the Chancellor visited in the run-up to the general election, presumably to bask in its reflected glory&mdash;recently wanted to expand its sixth form on to a reserved site next to the school owned by English Partnerships. The site was originally valued at &pound;12,000, but the school found that English Partnerships had revalued the site at its residential value of &pound;234,000, thus making it unobtainable by the school. I am pleased that, having raised the matter in the House, that decision has been reversed. However, it is a classic example of &quot;e before i&quot;&mdash;of expansion before infrastructure&mdash;rather than of &quot;i before e&quot;, which is what I am calling for.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/13">I shall address the financing of the expansion shortly. I acknowledge that some infrastructure improvements have been promised&mdash;for example, the upgrading of central Milton Keynes railway station and the improvements to junction 14 of the M1, both of which are due for completion in the next few years.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way, and I echo his call for infrastructure before expansion in Milton Keynes, as I issue a similar call in respect of neighbouring Aylesbury vale.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/2">Does my hon. Friend agree that it is particularly perverse and objectionable that a quango in the form of Milton Keynes Partnership should propose a whole series of options upon which it fails to consult and among which there is not numbered an option which would allow for expansion east of the M1? Does my hon. Friend agree that that is a lacuna which ought to be put right?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09a.51.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" speakername="Mark Lancaster" colnum="51"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h03.htm#60509h03_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.51.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a powerful point, which I agree with. All options should be considered. Indeed, when the six options were published, it was notable that there was a caveat to the effect that it might well be decided not to proceed with any of the six options, and that an entirely different option could be chosen. Such is the way that quangos seem to operate in the city.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/2">Let me return to the infrastructure improvements. I mentioned those to junction 14 of the M1 and central Milton Keynes station. Although they are welcome, they are a mere drop in the ocean in relation to what the city requires. I sense that they may be mere titbits thrown to the city to keep it quiet. It will come as no surprise to you, Mr. Hancock, that normally such announcements are made just before a general or local election.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/3">One of the biggest problems that the city faces, however, is uncertainty. Although the current expansion plans run to 2031, the Government refuse to commit to infrastructure projects beyond the short term, making it very hard for the city to plan with any certainty. It was announced just before the local elections that the Government now support the east-west rail link through the city, but when pushed after the local elections Baroness Andrews admitted that that would take place only if private funding could be found. The Government need to take a longer-term view on growth and sustainability, and to support the local communities in planning their future by providing long-term certainty in infrastructure funding. Such an approach will strengthen community commitment to the growth project and help make the Government's sustainable communities project genuinely sustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/4">Mr. Hancock, time is marching on and I would like briefly to look at the financing of the expansion of Milton Keynes. Under current arrangements, section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 allows a local planning authority to enter into a legally binding agreement or planning obligation with a land developer over a related issue. The Milton Keynes tariff is using that legislation to develop an agreement with landowners and developers in the expansion areas and contribute a flat rate per dwelling of &pound;18,500, or &pound;33.4 million per employment space. The total will fund the strategic and local infrastructure that arises from the developments. So far, so good.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/5">Unfortunately, that system raises key concerns for the local authority. First, the total budget will not fund the total cost of all pieces of infrastructure. There is a 25 per cent. gap in the funds required, and it increases each time Government standards increase, because increased standards for schools, for example, are invariably more expensive. Secondly, to fulfil the tariff agreement, all Departments must be prepared to guarantee that the requisite additional funds will be forthcoming. If the council is unable to secure the additional funds that it requires, the delivery of the tariff and associated items of infrastructure will be at risk. Thirdly, Departments must be able to guarantee that the overall revenue costs will be available to public authorities to support service delivery once the infrastructure is operational. Fourthly, there are genuine concerns that the tariff is designed to operate in greenfield areas and that it is far from straightforward to operate a similar vehicle in relation to infill and brownfield developments. Those are some of the problems associated with the current system.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/6">As the Minister is aware, the planning gain supplement is the Government's proposal for capturing the land value uplift through the centralised collection of a proportion of that uplift. Once again, however, there are key concerns for the local authority. First, there is the issue of the net loss of revenues to the local area. Naturally, I believe that the uplift created in Milton Keynes should be retained there, not distributed across the region and the country. I have explained how the Government are robbing Milton Keynes, and the planning gain supplement is set to see that continue. Secondly, the planning gain supplement proposal will mean a loss of local autonomy over the revenue received from planning contributions, because the central and regional collection of funds will dislocate the decision-making process. The funds should be determined and distributed locally, using local criteria. Thirdly, the local authority and I believe that the planning gain supplement will not improve the transparency of the planning system, but will weaken community engagement in the growth agenda because funding decisions will be taken remotely, not in the locality.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/7">All those factors simply add to the feeling that decisions will be made more remotely from Milton Keynes. If I am right that the Government's sustainable communities project must enjoy the support of local people to be successful, none of the factors that I have highlighted will be a step in the right direction, because they all appear to move decision making from Milton Keynes to central Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/8">I have highlighted the fact that there is a massive outflow of cash from Milton Keynes via English Partnerships, and it appears that the planning gain supplement will add to that. The local authority believes that capital receipts should be used to supplement the tariff and fill the gap between the total project costs of infrastructure and the tariff available. If the Minister can answer only one question today&mdash;I have given notice that I would like it answered&mdash;I hope that it is this. Exactly what percentage of the planning gain supplement will be returned to Milton Keynes so that it can spend that money? Without that figure, there is no way that the local authority can plan for the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/9">I could touch on many other financial issues, not least the lack of fairness in revenue funding for Milton Keynes, the lack of recognition given to the population expansion in the city and the fact that funds are given with one hand and taken away with the other through the floors policy. However, if the Minister takes only one thought away from this debate, I hope that it will be that if the Government continue to alienate local people from the decision-making process in the sustainable communities plan, last week's poll in Milton Keynes will probably be the high point of Labour popularity there.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09a.54.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1388" speakername="Angela Smith" colnum="54"  time="012:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h03.htm#60509h03_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.54.3/1">I understand the hon. Gentleman's impatience, and as I develop my comments, I shall address his questions, but it is also important to set the matter in context in terms of where the demand for new homes is coming from and how that demand should be managed. It is a shame that he has taken up more time with his intervention, but I give him an assurance that I will address all his points.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/2">It is worth making the point that Milton Keynes's economy and learning partnership, which includes all leading economic and learning partners, has been supportive of the growth agenda. Continued economic success relies on new homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/3">The hon. Gentleman referred to his petition, which I read and noted. It complains about the lack of public consultation and suggests that consultation was not long enough to involve the citizens of Milton Keynes fully in the planned expansion. That reflects a misunderstanding of the process. There was a consultation period, and my information is that he is incorrect to suggest that there was no support whatever for the plan. My understanding is that there were those who opposed it and those who supported it. But that is not the plan that goes forward; that is part of the evidence&mdash;the examination&mdash;that will be given, along with that of other organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/4">Other organisations have not consulted on the evidence that they are putting forward. For example, the local council is also putting forward information for examination, but that has not been subject to public consultation. There was no statutory right or duty to undertake public consultation; it was an additional consultation, although it was helpful that it was undertaken. It was not the case that no one supported the plan; my understanding is that there was both support for it and opposition to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/5">The hon. Gentleman may be aware that the South East England regional assembly recently submitted to the Government its draft south-east plan, covering the 20 years to 2026, and that that is also now out for public consultation. I encourage everyone who wants to move Milton Keynes forward and wants it to be successful, regardless of their point of view, to use the available opportunities to add to the debate in the current south-east plan consultation. When the council starts preparing its new planning policy for the area&mdash;it is important to recognise that the council prepares planning policy&mdash;it will be its responsibility to translate the strategic guidance in the south-east plan into specific proposals at the local level, so there will be strong involvement for the local council.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/6">The hon. Gentleman was critical of the Milton Keynes Partnership in that regard, but the partnership involves the council, and it has representatives from the local authority and the council. My understanding is that after the local elections there will be representatives from all three political parties. That is a democratic route by which local people can make their views known.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/7">I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is so dismissive of the role of local councillors in the Milton Keynes Partnership. My understanding&mdash;I have been in post for only two days&mdash;is that the committee strives to be open and to involve the local community in its activities. Since its launch, the committee has played a key role in expansion and prosperity for Milton Keynes, and it will continue to do so. Key figures from local life, who understand the major issues facing the area, are involved. Of course, we are talking about a delivery vehicle; it is in the legislation that we should review all local delivery vehicles over a five-year period.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/8">The hon. Gentleman also said, using rather emotive language, that English Partnerships was robbing Milton Keynes of money. It is correct that, in the time frame that he mentioned, receipts from EP land sales exceeded the none the less substantial expenditure in Milton Keynes. It is worth noting that English Partnerships operates on a national canvas, so the money that comes in goes to English Partnerships generally; it does not necessarily belong to Milton Keynes. Nevertheless, the hon. Gentleman chose a particular time frame. The land being sold now was acquired for Milton Keynes by the Commission for the New Towns, which was the previous body. It is not that Milton Keynes is being robbed; it is just a natural progression. If he uses a different time frame and goes back to when the land was acquired, he might find completely different figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/9">The hon. Gentleman also referred to funding. I am glad to have the opportunity to address that issue, because communities are more than just housing; they must be sustainable. Mistakes were often made when new towns were built. Some people who grew up in new towns feel very strongly that mistakes were made and that the necessary infrastructure was not always provided. However, in government, we have consistently said that our approach is to ensure that we have the necessary infrastructure investment in place to support housing growth. We use a mixture of funding from mainstream programmes, investment by the private sector and top-up funding from the growth areas programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/10">The hon. Gentleman acknowledged that money was being made available. I am sorry that he was rather dismissive of some of the investment available, but I shall give him some examples: almost &pound;37 million from the growth areas fund, including &pound;7 million for Milton Keynes hospital to consolidate its present site; &pound;32 million from the community infrastructure fund, including &pound;24 million for Milton Keynes and Wolverton stations; and &pound;8 million for upgrading junction 14 of the M1. There is ongoing investment from a range of mainstream programmes, including an extra &pound;20 million revenue and &pound;20 million capital for health programmes in Milton Keynes. In addition, the Milton Keynes &quot;Prospectus&quot;, known locally as the tariff, will attract private sector funding estimated at &pound;315 million, alongside the Government's funding for infrastructure.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.1/1">I am delighted to have the opportunity to introduce this short debate on composting as part of our waste strategy. It is timely, as this is composting awareness week, which is organised in the UK by the Composting Association, as it has been since 2001. That international event involves Canada, the United States, Australia and the European Compost Network. Its aims are, first, to encourage the public to think about composting and learn more about the subject and ongoing efforts to recycle more, and to try to persuade them to compost, as I do. Secondly, there is a need for the industry to encourage site operators to build links with the community and explain the benefit of composting to educate people about its value and to answer any questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/2">This year's event operates with the theme, &quot;Add power to your flowers . . . Compost!&quot; The Composting Association is running a series of events across the country, and distributing leaflets. Last year, it ran some 300 events. It is important to raise the profile of composting, which is part of a natural cycle that has much to contribute to our waste strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/3">Composting is already an important part of that strategy. It is driven in part by the European Union landfill directive, which recognises that emissions of methane from landfill sites are an important contributor to climate change. Methane is 20 times more dangerous than carbon dioxide, and the more we can reduce emissions, the more we can combat climate change, which is a key priority for the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/4">I want to congratulate local authorities, which are often scapegoats in the House of Commons. They have worked extremely hard on recycling and have reduced the amount of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill. They have big targets, but I am confident that they can achieve them. As an example, I commend my county council, Nottinghamshire. Last year, it composted some 40,000 tonnes of green waste, which represents 25 per cent. of the domestic waste stream.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/5">The authority hopes to sign a big new private finance initiative contract later this month. It works closely with the Government and acknowledges the advice and support it has received from Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs officials. It has written to the Minister to ask him to join the celebration of that new contract, which will be an important step change for Nottinghamshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/6">Composting has been increasing: in the early 1990s, there were only a handful of sites producing just 150,000 tonnes of compost, but there are now more than 200 producing more than 2 million tonnes per annum. There is also a big and real issue over the composting of domestic waste. To compost domestic waste effectively and safely, we must introduce in-vessel composting. There are about 20 such units, but the Environment Agency suggests that we might need 200.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/7">As I said at the outset, this is a timely debate. Yesterday, the Waste and Resources Action Programme released its third business plan, which includes organics and composting as key focuses. Interestingly, WRAP recognises the retail sector as an area where important gains in recycling could be made. Far too much food is wasted. The amount could be reduced at source, but it could also be dealt with through recycling.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-09a.61.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"  colnum="61"  time="013:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/halltext/60509h04.htm#60509h04_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.61.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" name="Paddy Tipping">the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase> on securing the debate. He rightly pointed out the timeliness of it, and had he not suggested in his closing remarks that we should consider the debate as the final contribution to the Government's consultation on the review of their waste strategy, I would have made the same suggestion. He got that in just in time. I have a great deal of sympathy with the five points that he went through and assure him that we will consider them carefully and respond to them as part of the review process.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/2">Like my hon. Friend, I am an enthusiastic home composter. I am fortunate enough to have a garden, which helps. There are some challenges, as I am sure that he will realise, in some parts of the country where that is not always so easy, but compost makes a great contribution to the paucity of London clay when it comes to growing flowers. The debate is an appropriate title for national composting week.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/3">As my hon. Friend also rightly pointed out, we will have to up our game significantly in the next few years if we are to meet the demanding landfill targets, although he was also correct to point out that local authorities and individuals&mdash;this is about partnership&mdash;have done extremely well in recent years in increasing the amount that we recycle and compost.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/4">We have trebled recycling in this country since Labour came to power in 1997. My hon. Friend's local authority in Nottinghamshire has done extremely well. I had the figures to hand&mdash;I seem to have mislaid them&mdash;but I think that it was up by 30 percentage points for recycling and composting. In doing so, it has easily exceeded its targets, so many congratulations to those involved. Just before the debate, my hon. Friend handed me an invitation, hot off the press, from Nottinghamshire county council to celebrate the signing of its new contract. I would be delighted to do so if I am still in post, and my diary commitments allow.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/5">As my hon. Friend rightly pointed out, one of the big challenges that we face in getting our response to the consultation on the waste review right is the financial framework. He talked about planning and funding, which are major obstacles to providing the infrastructure that we will need, as the Government realise. As I am sure he is aware, we changed the planning guidance about a year ago and are still considering how successful that has been in creating a better climate on the ground for the provision of major infrastructure. I hear from the industry that that has not made as much difference as they would have liked, but clearly we will want to revisit the subject of planning. I will take his point about the parallel processes that have to be gone through to get a biodigester up and running. That seems odd to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/6">My hon. Friend also kindly reminded hon. Members that concerns were raised with me by the community composting organisations in the voluntary sector about the proposed level of new fees under the licensing system. I intervened and we are currently reviewing that, and I hope that we will have something to say about it later in the summer that will make it easier for them to enter the market. I am determined that there should be an enhanced role for the community and voluntary sector&mdash;we say that explicitly in the review of our waste strategy&mdash;not just because it is doing good work on the ground and we think that it has the potential to do more but because it has a special educative function. It involves local communities in an important practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/7">The point that my hon. Friend made about education and following best practice is extremely important. My own local authority in Devon had a successful campaign over recent years to encourage people to home compost. As a result, composting rates have risen considerably. As has been said, performance across the country is patchy. Some local authorities, such as my hon. Friend's, are doing extremely well, whereas others have not done so well, and there are historic reasons for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/8">One of the most important things that we need to achieve in our response to the review of our waste policy is getting the framework right. There is no doubt that there are some perverse incentives in how the current targets are set. The weight-based targets have, to a certain extent, boosted composting, because, like the rush for gas, in many local authorities there has been a rush for green waste collection. While green waste collection is a good thing to do, it has also, in some cases, been favoured by local authorities because it is an easy, quick and cheap way of getting their weight, recycling and composting figures up.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/9">There are also challenges in respect of markets. My hon. Friend rightly pointed to the excellent work that WRAP has done in recent years, and will continue to do, to improve and grow markets. I am heartened by the general level of consensus that there has been during the review of waste policy about what needs to happen. It has involved a range of people, from the industry and political parties to green groups. If there are no markets for the stuff, things will not happen and will not be sustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/10">My hon. Friend raised an issue about the Olympics. If he thinks it a good idea, I shall write to the Minister responsible for the Olympics pointing out the importance of the sort of infrastructure that he described. His comments about the Olympics touched on another important point&mdash;the importance of procurement generally, not just in Government but across industry. He will be aware that we set up the sustainable procurement taskforce under Sir Neville Simms shortly after the previous election. It is about to report, and I think that it will have some important things to say about the importance of procurement policy in driving up the demand for recycled products. I know that that is not strictly to do with compost, but it is in the broader sense of the term; if we could drive up the demand for recycled products, that would give a boost to recycling and composting.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/11">I have described the framework. I abandoned my notes, because I felt that my hon. Friend's speech warranted that. I accept the points that both he and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1653" name="Chris Mole">the Member for Ipswich (Chris Mole)</phrase> made about the highly precautionary nature of the animal by-products regulation. I am acutely aware of that matter. I remember a ridiculous case&mdash;I think it was in south Wales&mdash;a year or so ago in which local authorities said that they could not accept teabags as part of composting because of the animal by-products regulation. There is always a danger of overreacting.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/12">As was kindly acknowledged, one can understand the adoption of a highly precautionary approach in the aftermath of foot and mouth. Such an approach is right. Not simply because of the composting issue but because I have a desire to be proportionate generally in Government and as a Minister, I am always asking my officials to push the case in Europe for the issue to be reviewed. As we understand more about the level of danger and so on, there might be an opportunity for scaling back, which would be helpful in terms of the current restrictions on composting.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/13">I shall give the ball park figures for what has been invested through WRAP and the waste minimisation and recycling fund. We invested &pound;294 million over the three years to 2005&ndash;06. WRAP has done much important work trying to develop markets for compost, which includes the development of a recognised standard for good quality, green waste compost. Another advantage of creating more markets for that sort of compost is that it will take the pressure off peat; it is a win-win situation if we can preserve the peat bogs and encourage the reuse of valuable material.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/14">As my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood said, we are considering waste as a resource. If he has read the consultation document on our waste policy, he will I am sure have digested the fact that we want to move away from waste being treated as waste; we want to manage it as a resource. As a result, our waste policy will fit more closely with our general policy on sustainable production and consumption.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.1/1">It is good to see you in the Chair, Mr. Hancock, and I am grateful for the opportunity to start the debate three or four minutes early&mdash;and I thank the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" name="Ben Bradshaw">the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw)</phrase>, as well for his help in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/2">Of course, this subject is very important to my constituents. The Minister&mdash;I am glad to see that she is still with us after the reshuffle&mdash;will know that when opinion polls are taken, people say that the quality of the health service is at the top of their list of priorities. To be fair, the Government have put money into the health service over the years, and they have also managed to cut waiting lists; I want to recognise the good before turning to what may be a problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/3">This is a time of uncertainty. We are seeing reorganisation in the health service in East Sussex that may be necessary to some extent&mdash;for instance, there is tremendous pressure on accident and emergency departments&mdash;but I hope that the Minister recognises that it can create uncertainty and divert people's efforts away from delivering front-line services to considering bureaucratic structures. For example, she will know of moves to change the structure of the strategic health authority to make it a south-east authority, and of the proposal to merge primary care trusts in my patch. The mental health trust is coming together, and the ambulance service looks as if it will be larger than Sussex. All those trusts&mdash;only the acute trust will be left untouched&mdash;will be going through yet another cycle of reorganisation. I wonder how many more there will be. I have been an MP for only nine years, but the health service seems to have been in permanent revolution during that time. That is not sensible for the people involved in the health service or for my constituents or patients generally. We will also have payment by results, which will have interesting consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/4">Let me refer in parenthesis to the economic position of Lewes. The town is at the centre of my constituency; it is a relatively small town, but it benefits from a large degree of white-collar work, which allows it to continue to prosper. Much of that work is based on the health service. The town houses the headquarters of the local PCT and the ambulance trust, other health bodies have links with it and the county council is based there. It would be most unfortunate if, as a consequence of reorganisation, health service jobs were lost to the town. I hope that when the Minister is considering such reorganisations and possible changes to the location of headquarters, she will bear in mind the importance of maintaining a white-collar base in Lewes.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/5">In particular, I want to talk about the impact of the job cuts in Sussex that are fast coming down the track. I said at the start of my speech that I recognise that the Government have put more money into the health service&mdash;they have&mdash;and the Chancellor has put in more money than ever before. It is therefore difficult to understand the reason for the headlines in my local papers. One headline in <i>The Argus</i> says &quot;200 jobs cut to save the NHS &pound;8 million&quot;, and another says, &quot;NHS in jobs crisis&quot;. One in the <i>Mid Sussex Times</i> says, &quot;325 jobs to go at hospitals&quot;. Across the acute trusts in particular, we are seeing large-scale redundancies. For instance, the 325 redundancies at the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals trust comprise 7 per cent. of the work force. The 250 jobs that are to go in Eastbourne at the East Sussex Hospitals trust form 5 per cent. of the work force.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/6">By any standard, those are huge cuts. More than that, they will be random cuts, because the trusts are sensibly working on the basis of trying to avoid redundancies and allowing for natural wastage. Of course, that means that the cuts will come in haphazard fashion according to when people happen to leave&mdash;they may, in fact, be in the wrong places. There is no guarantee of a straightforward, sensible and clinical&mdash;in both senses of the word&mdash;approach to what happens. Instead, the job cuts will fall rather randomly. That will have an effect on front-line services.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/7">It is not difficult to gainsay the suggestion that with 7 per cent. of the work force going within a year, there will be no impact on front-line services. Clearly there will be an impact. Will the Minister explain how&mdash;I genuinely do not understand&mdash;when the health service has more money than ever, job cuts of such a magnitude are being made in our trusts? It is not a matter of one trust that has been badly managed. Trusts across Sussex, as referred to in my local paper, are affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/8">The cuts are having other unwelcome consequences. I spoke last night to Dr. Andrews, the chairman of the East Sussex Hospitals trust local negotiating committee. He told me that things are moving to a stage at which even the most basic drugs are running out in hospitals, including antibiotics. Those are not expensive drugs, but basic drugs. He tells me that hospital doctors scout around for alternatives that can be used to treat patients, but which are often not the most desirable in clinical terms, and are often more expensive; they are just what happens to be there. The cash-flow problems of the hospital are now leading to wastage, with secondary clinical decisions sometimes being made which, although I am not saying that they are wrong, are not necessarily the doctors' first choice. More money is spent in an attempt to save money, which is counterproductive.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/9">Experienced staff are being replaced with less experienced staff&mdash;we have of course seen that happen in schools&mdash;because they come cheaper, being further down the grading scale. However, by definition they do not have the knowledge and detailed experience that is necessary for our hospitals. The consequence is that we have less experienced staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/10">All those developments are very worrying to people in my constituency. With respect to the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals trust&mdash;the one with the biggest deficit and the biggest problem&mdash;I am happy to concede that a part of the process may have been limitations in previous management decision making. I am happy to accept that that has been a part of the process if the Minister wants to argue the point. However, now that a turnaround team has been sent in by the Department, the trust's historic debt, which is significant at &pound;10 million, should be wiped off, provided that the trust can agree with the Department of Health and the turnaround team a process for going forward that will prevent further debt from mounting up.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/11">That seems to me to be a compromise. If the trust is expected to deal with the historic debt as well as with the accumulating debt, the consequences for patients will be severe. Wiping out the old debt seems a way to bring some intellectual and financial rigour into the process while recognising that there will be a significant downside for patients if things are allowed to continue as they are.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/12">That is not to say that money is not wasted in the health service. I particularly object to large pay-offs being made to individuals for reasons that are not entirely clear. I draw to the Minister's attention the case of the former chief executive of the East Sussex Hospitals trust, Annette Sergeant, who was given special leave on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-21">21 June 2005</phrase>. She left the trust on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-16">16 October 2005</phrase>, officially</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/13" class="indent">&quot;to pursue new career opportunities&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/14">in the health service. I do not know the ins and outs of that decision, but if Annette Sergeant was doing a good job why was she elbowed out of the trust? If she was not doing a good job, why was she given a big pay-off and found another job in the NHS? Neither outcome seems to make sense. She was either up to the job or she was not. Will the Minister confirm that Annette Sergeant received a pay-off in excess of &pound;250,000 to leave the trust before taking up another job in the health service? How can that decision be justified in relation to public expenditure?</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/15">I mentioned that there is no reconfiguration of the acute trusts in the sense of changes to boundaries, but the Minister will know about the document produced by the Surrey and Sussex strategic health authority, &quot;Creating an NHS fit for the future&quot;. That document sets out some sensible analysis; by the way, Candy Morris is a very competent person to lead that organisation; I am impressed by her. However, the consequences of some decisions may well be very unwelcome for local communities. The decisions cannot simply be rushed through. In particular, there is a suggestion, as the Minister will be aware, that the hospitals in Sussex and Surrey, which by and large are all equal acute trusts with equal A and E facilities, will in effect become part of a two-tier system, with some hospitals having more A and E facilities than others.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/16">There is particular concern in the eastern part of my constituency that Eastbourne district general hospital will be downgraded, may lose some of its A and E facilities and will probably lose its maternity unit. There is concern that because the East Sussex Hospitals trust runs both Eastbourne and Hastings, some procedures will be delivered in Eastbourne and some in Hastings. That is not satisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/17">As local GPs have said, the key issue about core services is that they want key emergency cover, both medical and surgical, at both hospitals, not at one site. I do not believe that surgical emergencies should go to Hastings if they arise in Seaford or Polegate in my constituency. There is also a question about whether that saves any money. I am not sure that it does and it certainly creates problems of its own. The transport implications are significant. I understand that the ambulance trust has written to express concern about the idea that people from, say, Seaford, Polegate or Eastbourne will have to travel to the hospital in Hastings for a particular sort of care. The distance between Eastbourne and Hastings is significant and the road system will not impress the ambulance service trying to get there. It is a single-carriageway road with many bottlenecks along it. The idea that because a trust happens to cover a particular geographical area, its services can be spread out so that only one centre deals with a particular function, seems to me to be inherently flawed, but it appears central to the logic of the strategic health authority paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/18">We have already had some indication that services will be reduced at Eastbourne. My colleague in Eastbourne, Stephen Lloyd, who stood as a candidate at the last general election, fought to prevent cuts in children's services when they were first mooted. The instinct of the trust throughout has been to deny that services are about to be cut or removed, only for that to be confirmed subsequently. It now seems likely that the maternity department at Eastbourne will be removed and that mothers will be expected to go to Hastings. Almost 4,000 children were born in the trust area last year, so assuming that it is a case of half each, 2,000 people will be expected to go from Eastbourne or, even worse, from Seaford or Polegate&mdash;even further away&mdash;to Hastings to give birth. That is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/19"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1564" name="Nigel Waterson">The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson)</phrase>, who cannot be here today, is also concerned about the matter. Indeed, I think it is fair to say that the concern is shared by all East Sussex MPs, including&mdash;I do not want to misrepresent him&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1622" name="Michael Jabez Foster">the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Michael Jabez Foster)</phrase>, who is one of the Minister's colleagues. I think that he, too, is concerned about some of the proposals. It would therefore be helpful if the Minister gave precise details of the timetable for any proposed changes, where they are in the system at the moment and what form of consultation will take place on them, with specific reference to the East Sussex Hospitals trust and how those issues dovetail with the strategic health authority document.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/20">May I remind the Minister that there is an issue about patient transport, particularly from rural areas such as Seaford in my constituency, if people are to be expected to get to Hastings? In a written answer from one of her colleagues on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-08">8 November 2004</phrase> to a question that I asked, the Government stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/21" class="indent">&quot;The principle which should apply is that each patient should be able to reach hospital in a reasonable time and in reasonable comfort, without detriment to their medical condition&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/22">However, the answer also stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/23" class="indent">&quot;A clinical need for treatment does not imply a medical need for transport.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-11-08.543"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 November 2004; Vol. 426, c. 543W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/24">I accept that as a statement of fact. However, I am concerned&mdash;I hope that the Minister will recognise this point&mdash;that as facilities move further and further away from patients in particular cases, the distance, time taken to travel, need for transport and cost all become greater. All those are downsides in terms of patient care that I am sure the Minister does not want.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/25">There is concern that despite the Government's stated policy&mdash;and perhaps even intentions&mdash;the NHS is becoming more centralised. I have given examples of how trusts are reconfiguring services within their boundaries, and I have suggested that the reorganisations in place will create bigger units rather than smaller units, but the situation is even worse than that. In my patch, there are two primary care trusts&mdash;they will probably shortly become one&mdash;both of which have financial problems. The Eastbourne Downs PCT anticipates an overspend of &pound;7 million this year. What is the consequence of that &pound;7 million overspend? The consequence is that it is delaying references to the acute trust for work to be done in hospital. It is keeping within the Government's maximum times for operations, but delaying them for as long as possible within the Government's framework. That is not sensible for patients. The other consequence is pulling services out of communities, rather than diversifying them out to communities, which is what the Government say they want, and I share that view. Instead, services are being pulled in. The consequence in Seaford, for example, which is a town of almost 25,000 people, is that there are virtually no services in the town, all the immediate care beds have long gone and people who want intermediate care are now referred to Firwood house, north of Eastbourne. That is a long way away, and quite impossible to get to by public transport. Put simply, the NHS service in Seaford is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/26">As I said, there are 25,000 people in Seaford; it is the largest town in my constituency. All we have in terms of NHS delivery is a GP centre with few facilities and a so-called day hospital which seems to me to provide peculiarly few facilities. In September 2005, I wrote to East Sussex County Healthcare NHS trust, as it then was, about this matter and pointed out that in my view the hospital was underused. In response, the chief executive Lisa Rodrigues pointed out how it was used, which was as a base for a community mental health team, and said that there were a number of out-patient clinics&mdash;that number is reducing, by the way&mdash;and some use of the building by older people's mental health services. That is not a great deal for a town of 25,000 people, is it? I have long believed that building to be horrendously underused, and in need of reconfiguration. It could be the basis of a good community use that would take the pressure off the NHS and the acute trusts in Eastbourne&mdash;and indeed Brighton.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/27">I wrote to Candy Morris of the strategic health authority about the matter, and she quite properly took it up with Lisa Rodrigues. I am afraid that Lisa Rodrigues said in her reply that she did not know what the building was, which does not exactly give confidence that the trust knows what it is doing with its buildings. I have asked Candy Morris to look further into the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/28">What Seaford needs is a new hospital. We need a hospital to deal with minor injuries, as Lewes has; Lewes Victoria hospital has a well-respected unit. We need a hospital in Seaford that can carry out minor operations. We need a focus for the community teams, such as chiropodists, to operate from. The Minister may say that that would involve a spending commitment and that the money would need to be found from somewhere. Of course that is the case, but my argument is that, with A and E admissions going up by 11 per cent. a year and services being withdrawn from communities, that would be a good investment, and it would take pressure off the health service. The Minister's own policy is to have more localised delivery of services, more community facilities and more walk-in centres. I agree with all those things. Seaford is a case in point, as there is a huge gap. A hospital dealing with minor injuries and minor operations would be an important facility for the town and a good use of NHS public money. The PCT has done some work on the matter, but it has a &pound;7 million overspend and is now up to its neck in reorganisation, so unfortunately that work has all gone on hold and nothing much is happening. We are not making as much progress as we should with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/29">There is also a problem with boundary disputes between the county council and the acute trust in terms of bed blocking. I have raised that issue in previous debates, as have other Members, including the hon. Member for Eastbourne. There are still 74 people on average in hospitals held by the East Sussex Hospitals trust&mdash;that is 9 per cent. of beds or two wards&mdash;who no longer require acute care and who are there largely because the county council has not taken responsibility for them and found residential care home places for them. The Minister and her predecessors have looked at that issue, but nothing much seems to be happening. For that situation to continue would be a terrible waste of NHS money, so it would be useful if it were sorted out.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/30">The other boundary dispute is between different PCTs. Newhaven Downs, which is the rehabilitation centre in my constituency, has been mothballed since last November. It is an upgraded facility that cannot be used, so people are expected to go much further away for intermediate care. The move is simply a cost-cutting measure. The Minister's boss, the Secretary of State for Health, said recently that community hospitals should not be closed for financial reasons. She is absolutely right, but that is, in effect, what has happened at Newhaven Downs. Will the Minister look into the position there and put pressure on the PCT to reopen that facility? Seaford people have lost facilities at the All Saints centre in Eastbourne. They have also lost Homefield cottages and are expected to go to Firwood house, having also lost Newhaven Downs. That is simply not good enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/31">I have raised a number of issues to which I hope the Minister can respond. The picture is not all doom and gloom, but there are a number of serious problems that need to be addressed.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.1/1">I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman says, but the funding formula takes into account geographical issues and age of population. In many respects, the age of the population in his area, and that part of the south of England, is taken into account. That is reflected in the funding. We consider other health needs as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/2">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not disagree that the average life expectancy of someone in Doncaster&mdash;without being too partisan in referring to my own area&mdash;is considerably less than that of someone in parts of Sussex. We have to address those health inequalities. He makes a very good point, which shows why we have to consider what other services we need in his area to meet people's needs. As we are all living longer, there will be more 75-year-olds in the future. How can we help them stay fit and healthy as long as possible? If I were in that position, my desired option would be to look after myself in my home.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/3">I want to touch on the issues relating to jobs. The hon. Gentleman highlighted stories from his local newspapers in relation to this subject. It is true that the hospital and the trusts in question are considering cutting some posts. The Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Trust has said that it is looking to reduce the 5,000 jobs at the trust by 325. I understand that it thinks that it can make up a huge number of posts by introducing a vacancy freeze and through the reduction of agency and bank spend and the better use of technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/4">The East Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust, which also employs about 5,000 staff, is looking to restrict filling around 250 vacancies. I am told that in an average year, 500 posts fall vacant through natural staff movement and retirements, so we hope that the situation can be managed as fairly as possible and without compulsory redundancies.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/5">This issue raises questions about how those hospitals are going to provide services, given that they may not fill posts or use agency staff as much as they have in the past. There are good examples of other trusts reducing their reliance on agency staff and better managing their permanent staff teams to achieve good results for patients. Seeing a different face every day because the trust overuses agency and temporary staff is not good for patients, particularly older patients, or for their sense of continuity of care. Of course, there is also an important safety issue there.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/6">The changes to the structure of the SHA and PCTs are meant to help to create a stronger framework for the area and improve commissioning. We are looking at making savings by reducing the number of organisations, and putting the money back into front-line services so that funds can be better spent on the services that people most want. Alongside that, we must discuss what services people want in their local communities. That will be addressed in the consultation later this year&mdash;I understand that there will be discussions on contributions to the document for the end of May, to be published in the autumn&mdash;which should take into account many of the issues that the hon. Gentleman raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/7">The hon. Gentleman talked about Seaford day hospital; I am sorry that the person whom he mentioned did not recognise the name of the hospital. It provides mental health services and older people's mental health services, providing three&mdash;sometimes four&mdash;clinics a week. It also provides working age adult services, providing five&mdash;sometimes six&mdash;clinics a week. I understand that the hospital is also used as a base by staff who come into the town to treat Seaford residents. That demonstrates another way in which services can be provided without a permanent base. Those staff use the hospital to support people, but most of the treatment takes place in people's homes, which is a good idea. It is also used by the Eastbourne Downs PCT physiotherapy service, which runs clinics every weekday.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/8">So, I understand that the building is used by three services, involving two NHS organisations, to deal with a wide range of mental and physical health needs. That is a good idea and is to be welcomed. I understand, from the Sussex Partnership NHS Trust that it will continue to use the building in that way and that there are no plans to reduce capacity there. The trust believes that the building is well utilised. I will ensure that the hon. Gentleman's view that it could be used more is fed back; he should contribute to discussions about planning local services.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/9">The work being led by the SHA in partnership with the four local health communities, including the one for east Sussex, is about trying to ensure that local people and stakeholders have the opportunity to get involved in developing the plan. As I said, that will be supported by a discussion document to be published by the SHA towards the end of May. I understand that it is also working on settings for care options, and will consider access and travel issues as well as clinical and economic viability. The SHA expects to begin the full public consultation on the developed options in the autumn. I hope that that gives some clarification regarding the timetable.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/10">The hon. Gentleman made some important and constructive points. Part of the debate that we must have is about raising people's expectations of their health service in the future, as well as what they are used to. Sometimes people defend what they are used to partly out of affection for a service that they have used and partly because it is the only thing that they see in town and they are fearful of what will happen if it goes. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be a constructive and critical friend to his local health services, and a leader in developing discussions about the sort of health services that we could have.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/11" class="indent">It being Two o'clock, the motion for the Adjournment of the sitting lapsed, without Question put.</p>
