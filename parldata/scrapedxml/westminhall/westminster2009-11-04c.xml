	<p pid="c.241.1/1" class="italic">Motion made, and Question proposed, That the sitting be now adjourned.-<i>(</i><i>Mike O'Brien.</i>)</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-11-04c.241.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" speakername="Charlotte Atkins" colnum="241"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091104/halltext/91104h0001.htm#09110485000226">
	<p pid="c.241.2/1">As a child, I used to visit the local Dr. Barnardo's home with my parents. That is where I first came across thalidomide: the home was looking after a baby with no arms or legs. That image has stayed with me for more than 40 years. I am proud to follow in the footsteps of the fantastic disability campaigner, Jack Ashley-his old constituency of Stoke-on-Trent, South, adjoins mine-by initiating an Adjournment debate on the support provided for persons disabled by thalidomide.</p>
	<p pid="c.241.2/2">The thalidomide survivors are a unique group. I am pleased that many of them are here today. They were disabled by the national health service. They are the survivors of a catastrophe that claimed the lives of many not so fortunate. However, the fortune of the thalidomiders is a bitter pill; they are now in their 40s and 50s, their deformities are causing increasing pain and they are having difficulties with advancing age. Many thalidomiders have never been able to work. Those who have been able to work have, over the last few years, started to retire early. That is because they have had to use their limbs in ways for which they were not designed. Many victims have needed hip replacements and even shoulder replacements.</p>
	<p pid="c.241.2/3">A medical survey by the Thalidomide Trust revealed that, on average, each thalidomider had more than six complex and chronic health conditions-for example, ear, nose and throat problems, poor vision and palsy; they also had internal problems with the kidneys and the heart, and gastro-intestinal troubles. They also have arthritis, osteoporosis, sciatica and problems such as epilepsy and obesity. The result is that thalidomiders are living in bodies 25 years older than their age.</p>
	<p pid="c.241.2/4">Why is this a problem for the Government? It is simply because the Department of Health is implicated in the tragedy. The World Health Organisation warned the Government in 1957 that unless safety measures were tightened before new drugs received permission to be sold in the United Kingdom, disaster was increasingly likely. Before a drug could enter the UK, the Cohen committee, a Government agency, had to scrutinise the medicine's effectiveness. In 1962, in an oral answer to a parliamentary question asked by Maurice Edelman, the then Minister of Health, Enoch Powell, said that the remit of the Cohen committee was to decide whether a drug had been tested satisfactorily.</p>
	<p pid="c.241.2/5">Thalidomide was described by the Cohen committee as a drug of proven value, and it was granted purchase tax exemption in December 1958. That was a highly sought prize, as it encouraged the NHS to use the drug as a prescription medicine, widely used for morning sickness. Distillers made the remarkable claim that thalidomide was completely safe for pregnant women. The Cohen committee never asked the company to prove that statement, despite the fact that all major pharmaceutical companies regularly tested new drugs on pregnant rats and rabbits.</p>
	<p pid="c.241.2/6">In America, Frances Kelsey, an official in the US Food and Drug Administration, picked up warning signs of the dangers that thalidomide posed to the foetus from the August 1960 edition of the <i>British Medical Journal</i>. It warned of the damage that the drug caused to nerve endings. As a result, thalidomide did not receive a licence in the USA. Members of the Cohen committee should have been aware that thalidomide could pose a risk to the foetus.</p>
	<p pid="c.241.2/7">Rather than engage in the blame game, I believe that it is important to look to the future. The Thalidomide Trust is grateful for the constructive engagement that it has had with the Minister of State, Department of Health, my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1910" name="Mike O'Brien">the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase>. The trust is also grateful that the Department of Health has sought to work with it. However, the 463 thalidomide survivors have complex needs, which are constantly evolving and unpredictable. Their case is unique and unprecedented in medical history. The Government's response therefore needs to be innovative. They must recognise the pioneering work done by the trust, which, against all the odds, has found life-enhancing solutions for its members.</p>
	<p pid="c.241.2/8">As children, thalidomiders were experimented on, and were strapped into cumbersome prosthetic arms and legs, in order to &quot;normalise&quot; them. Hopefully, we now live in more enlightened times. When we engage with thalidomiders, we should look at ways to meet their real and changing needs, rather than fit them into an established care framework that is ill-equipped to respond quickly and flexibly to everyday challenges.</p>
	<p pid="c.241.2/9">The Thalidomide Trust has developed a health support service for thalidomiders. It was made necessary by the NHS's failure to provide relevant and adequate health care. The trust has developed peer-to-peer volunteer support networks. It has experience in dealing with the full range of health and social problems, and it is better equipped than statutory bodies to meet the complex needs of its beneficiaries. It also has its own mechanism for reclassifying an individual's degree of disability. It is called the individual beneficiary review. It is highly complex, and was developed in conjunction with the Leeds university school of medicine. However, the trust has the capacity to conduct only 10 to 20 such reviews a year.</p>
	<p pid="c.241.2/10">I am pleased that the Department of Health has taken on board the real challenges presented by the thalidomide survivors, and the requirement to base support on the needs of each individual in a way that puts people in control of their own care. However, there are concerns about the Department's proposal to develop personal budgets for thalidomide survivors and to set up a pilot study. It would help if the Minister clarified a number of points.</p>
	<p pid="c.241.2/11">How will the personal health budgets be calculated? Many thalidomiders receive no health-care support, so it is not possible to base such budgets on existing spending. How can the personal health budget team make commitments about the level of funding available from local authorities for thalidomide survivors? Given the dispersed location of thalidomiders, how can one primary care trust and one partner local authority lead a pilot study with 20 survivors? In reality, more PCTs and local authorities will need to be involved, increasing the liaison and management costs for the Thalidomide Trust. Who will ensure that there are appropriate health services locally for thalidomide personal health budget holders to spend their money on?</p>

	<p pid="c.243.0/1">I did not catch the previous question, and I want to be sure that I can respond. Will my hon. Friend repeat it? I heard her question about the care costs of the trust; I mean the one after that.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-11-04c.243.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" speakername="Charlotte Atkins" colnum="243"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091104/halltext/91104h0001.htm#09110485000228">
	<p pid="c.243.1/1">The issue was the dispersed location of thalidomiders. The Department suggested that the trust should deal with one primary care trust and one local authority. However, the trust and thalidomiders say that because they are so dispersed, they would need more than one PCT and more than one local authority, which would put quite a burden on the Thalidomide Trust. How can we ensure that appropriate health services are available locally for thalidomide personal budget holders? Given that the Thalidomide Trust set up its own health link because of the difficulties in obtaining appropriate local health services, how can we ensure that thalidomide survivors are not short-changed?</p>

	<p pid="c.243.2/1">My hon. Friend makes a cogent case. Does she intend to look particularly at the issues affecting thalidomiders as they move into their 40s and 50s, which she has mentioned? Their movements become more restricted; mobility therefore becomes more of an issue, and the costs of mobility mount. How will that be catered for within the personal budgets? I am not sure that it is, so that is something that we need to address.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-11-04c.243.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" speakername="Charlotte Atkins" colnum="243"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091104/halltext/91104h0001.htm#09110485000230">
	<p pid="c.243.3/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. A powered wheelchair can cost something like &#163;18,000, and adapting a car can cost a staggering &#163;60,000. Obviously the car has to be new. The whole cost is something like &#163;60,000, and that is just for a fairly basic car that is large enough to accommodate everything that a thalidomider might need. What will happen if the pilot programme is terminated in 2012, and how will the Department of Health ensure that the pilot programme does not create inequalities within the thalidomide population?</p>
	<p pid="c.243.3/2">Thalidomiders have had to fight every step of the way for justice. In 1973, after a decade of legal wrangling and with the help of <i>The </i><i>Sunday Times </i>editor Sir Harold Evans, they secured from Distillers-the company that distributed the drug in the UK-&#163;20 million, which was paid into a trust for the future care of survivors. In the mid-90s, that sum was topped up, as the fund was predicted to run out in 2009. In 2005, an improved deal was signed with Diageo. However, even after all those rises, the average pay-out to thalidomiders is just &#163;18,000 a year. That is barely enough to pay for an electric wheelchair, which will last just two years. It will go nowhere near paying for adapting a car, or for comprehensive adaptations at home to allow some dignity and independence, such as a walk-in shower, a stair lift or a computer with voice activation. Poor investment returns, inflation and the medical and social care burdens of survivors have sharply eroded the value of the original settlement.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.3/3">Other Governments, such as those in Germany, Italy and Ireland, have agreed payments to thalidomiders. I urge the UK Government to do the same, as many survivors are now in dire need. Justice is not time-limited. These totally innocent victims must have Government help now. The most cost-effective way of ensuring that is for the Department of Health to make an annual ex-gratia payment to the Thalidomide Trust, which has a proven record of acting on behalf of all its beneficiaries. That should be overseen by a steering group, involving the Department of Health, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Treasury, survivors, staff and the Thalidomide Trust's trustees. Please help the thalidomide survivors to live out the last third of their lives with dignity, independence and security.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-11-04c.244.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" speakername="Tony Baldry" colnum="244"  time="009:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091104/halltext/91104h0001.htm#09110485000231">
	<p pid="c.244.0/1">The Minister today could take the line that these matters were resolved in the 1970s when a settlement was agreed between Distillers and those who had suffered as a consequence of thalidomide. In the 1970s, it was much more difficult to bring proceedings against a Government Department because of the complexities of Crown immunity. However, the law relating to Crown immunity has dramatically changed in the intervening years.</p>
	<p pid="c.244.0/2">None of us was present during the negotiations between the representatives of those who had suffered as a consequence of thalidomide and Distillers, and none of us was present with their lawyers. As the Minister is a lawyer he will know that in considering what should be an appropriate quantum of damages, some considerable thought must have been given at the time to the likely life expectancy of those who had suffered from thalidomide. If one looks back at the legal textbooks, one can see that at that time, life expectancy for people suffering from similar conditions was comparatively short. People may have lived into their teens. However, those who were disabled by thalidomide have confounded everyone by living full and often dynamic lives in unbelievably difficult circumstances. I suspect that their life expectancy-and how long they have lived-has substantially confounded the estimates of the lawyers in the 1970s. That has had a double hit. First, even when topped up, the &#163;20 million put into the original trust fund has been wholly inadequate for the needs. Secondly, as those who are disabled by thalidomide grow older, so their needs get greater and the costs of caring for them grow incrementally.</p>
	<p pid="c.244.0/3">I can think of no other group like this one. So, if Ministers do something, they will not be accused of creating a precedent. They will not have people knocking on their door, saying, &quot;You created a precedent with those disabled by thalidomide so you should be doing similar for us.&quot; This is a group of some 463 people. It is a finite group of people, all of whom are growing elderly with clear and increasing medical needs. I see no reason why the Government should not respond to those needs in the way in which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> suggested. They could make a pragmatic ex gratia payment year on year to the Thalidomide Trust. The trust has demonstrated its ability to well manage the funds that it receives from Distillers, and subsequently Diageo. It recognises that those who are disabled by thalidomide have different needs that require different levels of support. Therefore, it is much more responsive than perhaps statutory structures that might exist elsewhere. That is a solution that meets the justice of the cause. The test of all of this is that as a society, it would be very unjust to leave those who, through no fault of their own find themselves in their older years struggling with their increasingly difficult life-particularly as they are a group of people who have shown unbelievable courage in taking on life and living life to the full notwithstanding their disabilities from the day that they were born.</p>
	<p pid="c.244.0/4">I hope that the Minister and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" name="Michael Penning">the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning)</phrase> will take the opportunity of this debate to not just give the rather inflexible line of, &quot;These are all matters that were resolved in the 1970s, and we have no intention of revisiting them again&quot;-that would be tragic and wholly unjust-but go away to review the case and work out what sort of sum would be reasonable to pay, year on year, ex gratia, to this group of people, who are experiencing very real medical needs. That seems to be a perfectly proper use of part of the Department of Health's budget. There is a proven mechanism through the Thalidomide Trust that could meet the equity and justice needs of that particular group of people. It is not a group that will expand; it is by definition a finite group of people clearly identifiable as potential beneficiaries of the trust. Justice must be met, and the House collectively has a duty to ensure that it is.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-11-04c.245.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1597" speakername="Martin Caton" colnum="245"  time="009:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091104/halltext/91104h0001.htm#09110485000232">
	<p pid="c.245.0/1">It is a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase>, who has made some telling points. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on securing this vital debate and on making an excellent case in support of the campaign by thalidomide survivors to secure financial assistance from Government. I am the chair of the all-party group on thalidomide, which is working with the national advisory council of the Thalidomide Trust to achieve those objectives.</p>
	<p pid="c.245.0/2">Thalidomide was developed by the German firm Chemie Gr&#252;nenthal as an anticonvulsant. It did not work for that purpose, but trials showed that it had sedative properties, with the apparent added benefit that overdoses resulted not in death but simply in prolonged sleep. It was first marketed in Germany in 1957 and in the UK in 1958. It was sometimes combined with other drugs to treat a variety of conditions.</p>
	<p pid="c.245.0/3">The promotion of all those products laid great stress on the safety of thalidomide. Gr&#252;nenthal also claimed that thalidomide was completely safe for pregnant women and could therefore be used to treat morning sickness and some other negative aspects of early pregnancy. Astonishingly, the company made that claim without testing the drug on pregnant animals or testing the science behind the claim that an overdose would not normally kill. The latter claim resulted from the fact that thalidomide, although highly toxic, had a low absorption rate. That, however, could be affected by other illnesses, the taking of other medicines and, crucially, pregnancy.</p>
	<p pid="c.245.0/4">Distillers, which manufactured thalidomide in the UK under licence, had to conduct its own tests, albeit limited ones, on the drug, and it commissioned researchers at Glasgow university to consider the effect of thalidomide on the body's hormone balance. The results, published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, showed a marked reduction in activity of the thyroid gland, which should have set alarm bells ringing. It was known at the time that any drug that affected the thyroid was likely to be able to pass through the placenta, yet Distillers, like Gr&#252;nenthal, did not test the drug on pregnant animals.</p>
	<p pid="c.245.0/5">Even more disturbing is the fact that the Cohen committee, the body appointed by the Government to establish whether new drugs had been properly tested, failed to ask whether tests had been made on pregnant animals. Instead, as my hon. Friend said, it described thalidomide as a drug of proven value. As a result, thalidomide was exempted from purchase tax and put on the NHS prescription list.</p>
	<p pid="c.245.0/6">I will return to UK regulation in a little while, but my hon. Friend was right to point out the contrast with how the Food and Drug Administration in America dealt with Richardson Merrell's application to market the drug there. As she said, Dr. Frances Kelsey recognised that a variety of factors could affect absorption rate and required tests to be made on pregnant animals. Tests were carried out on pregnant rabbits, and deformed foetuses were born. If the Cohen committee, acting on behalf of the Government, had required similar tests to be done here, it would have seen in baby rabbits similar deformities of the sort that were later to be seen in human babies. It did not. Some 3,800 babies died, and 508 were born with disabilities to mothers who had taken thalidomide, having been assured that it was perfectly safe to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.245.0/7">When we think of people affected by thalidomide, most of us think of people with rudimentary arms or legs, but the drug caused a far greater range of debilitating conditions. Many suffered damaged ears and hearing. In others, eyesight was affected. A few suffered brain damage, with associated sensory limitations. Some with legs have no arms, and a large number have arms ranging from half or two thirds of normal length to two or three inches. Many with hands have fingers missing and no thumbs. Leg damage often resulted in one or both legs being short and feet absent or significantly damaged. In addition, there could be extensive damage to the internal organs and the skeletal structure.</p>
	<p pid="c.245.0/8">Before the establishment of the Thalidomide Trust, which was later to protect the interests of those children, they were subject to well-meaning but extremely questionable and certainly unwelcome professional attention, as my hon. Friend mentioned. Some endured a series of operations intended to make them look &quot;more normal&quot;, such as constructing ears where they had none or removing vestigial digits. There was a drive to find functional artificial arms, but childhood experience of such prosthetics put the majority of thalidomiders off them in adult life.</p>
	<p pid="c.245.0/9">What is truly remarkable is how the individuals affected by thalidomide have responded to the disadvantages dealt to them. In their teens, many refused to accept the limited lifestyle that some thought appropriate for people so badly disabled and determined to live as fulfilling a life as possible. Sadly, 46 of the original 508 have died, but a large proportion of the survivors have taken life by the horns. A majority are married, and between them they have more than 500 children. Many have become highly qualified and have successful professional careers; others run their own businesses. A large number have regular full-time jobs, and half are in some form of paid employment. Many of those not in paid jobs are bringing up families.</p>
	<p pid="c.245.0/10">However, their very determination to get on with things has taken its toll. By the late 1990s, it was becoming clear that thalidomiders were facing a new set of health problems brought about by their wholly admirable commitment to activity. They are entering their 40s and 50s, but have always had to use their limbs and other parts of their bodies in ways for which they were not designed. Many have needed hip or even shoulder replacements at the age of about 40. Others have reluctantly been forced to give up work or are considering doing so, which creates personal financial difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="c.245.0/11">The main reason why I believe that we should call for Government assistance to help thalidomiders at this time is that they badly need it and no one else can or will provide it. Some things for which they need additional resources have been mentioned, as well as the basics-additional care hours, help with cleaning and gardening and so on-but there are also technical changes, which my hon. Friend mentioned.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-11-04c.247.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" speakername="Roger Williams" colnum="247"  time="009:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091104/halltext/91104h0001.htm#09110485000233">
	<p pid="c.247.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is making a powerful case, as have other hon. Members. It seems to me that if a similar incident occurred today, the sums of money awarded would be far in excess of those awarded by Distillers and Diageo, because we have greater expectations of what kind of life people with disabilities can and should lead and of the cost of achieving that. What was awarded is completely inadequate for today's realistic expectations.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-11-04c.247.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1597" speakername="Martin Caton" colnum="247"  time="009:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091104/halltext/91104h0001.htm#09110485000234">
	<p pid="c.247.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I do not want to go into the history of the case against Distillers, but the parents were worn down at the time by Distillers' resistance to paying anything like decent compensation. If they had not been and the case had gone through properly, they probably would have received a much more substantial payout than they did, even with the <i>Sunday Times </i>campaign. He is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="c.247.1/2">Thalidomiders need technical adaptations. Due to the various conditions from which they suffer, they need control adaptations for their homes and cars. As my hon. Friend said, that is very expensive in some cases. They need specialised wheelchairs, and we have been told how expensive those can be. The good news is that there are answers to many thalidomiders' needs, largely as a result of technological developments. The bad news is that they are often expensive and beyond the reach of most survivors.</p>
	<p pid="c.247.1/3">The second reason why Government should step in to provide the necessary financial assistances comes from the history of the period in the 1950s just before and when thalidomide was put on the market. As my hon. Friend emphasised, it was the failings of the Governments of the day, here and elsewhere, that contributed to people being born with disabilities. That must be acknowledged.</p>
	<p pid="c.247.1/4">I commend to hon. Members a recent article by Bruce Page, one of the <i>Sunday Times </i>insight team that helped expose the thalidomide scandal. The article, &quot;Thalidomide: Opening the Last Chinese Box&quot;, condemns the Government of the day, and Health Minister Enoch Powell in particular, for refusing to set up a public inquiry. I agree with Mr. Page that if an inquiry had been given the go-ahead and the whole truth had been revealed, we would not be calling for action at this late date. The Government's role would have been exposed and their obligations acknowledged and honoured.</p>
	<p pid="c.247.1/5">The article also shines light on what happened all those years ago. It blows out of the water claims made at the time by thalidomide manufacturers and the Ministry of Health that the drug had been thoroughly tested-by the standards of the time-against every foreseeable dysfunction and that nobody had ever tested drugs for risks to human reproduction. Those claims are simply not true. Tests for reproductive risk were commonplace in the 1950s, notably for tranquilisers. There was a failure of regulation in the UK that the Government failed to address. There was no excuse for that failure, as my hon. Friend said.</p>
	<p pid="c.247.1/6">Thalidomide was marketed in April 1958 and was approved by the Cohen committee in December 1958. That absurdly short time frame is evidence of the inadequacy of the assessment. In 1957, the World Health Organisation technical report series, No. 137, had warned that there were no regulations in Britain to ensure that drug manufacturers applied the best available technology when developing new products. That report was referred to the Health Standing Advisory Committee, but no action was taken. Bruce Page demonstrates that Distillers and Gr&#252;nenthal did not apply the same level of scientific research as many of their competitors. The Government failed to make them do so, even after the WHO warning. The WHO paper drew attention to the failure of regulation in this country:</p>
	<p pid="c.247.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Many countries required detailed data from the manufacturers of drugs before they were introduced to the market, one notable exception being Great Britain.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.247.1/8">It was not the inadequacy of the science at the time that allowed thalidomide on to the market and into pregnant women's bodies, but the inadequacy of the Government's regulatory regime.</p>

	<p pid="c.248.0/1">My hon. Friend is describing the catastrophic regulatory failure of the Government of the day. Does he agree that a further problem has been a culture at the heart of subsequent Governments not to acknowledge regulatory failure? Governments put up barriers to addressing the consequences of regulatory failure, such as setting precedent and incurring costs. Those arguments have been dragged out over the years, not just with regard to thalidomide, but in the Equitable Life case. Justice, fairness and responsibility get pushed to one side. Does he agree that although matters of precedent and cost must be considered, what is fair, right and just is more important?</p>

	<p pid="c.248.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. I agree with the hon. Member for Banbury that precedent is not a great problem in this case. It is true that Governments do not like to admit culpability. Frankly, I do not care whether the Government admit culpability, but I care whether they accept their responsibility to do the right thing. Thalidomiders need the right thing to be done. There is the strongest possible case for the provision of Government financial assistance for thalidomide survivors.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.1/2">I commend the Minister and the Department for engaging in dialogue with the national advisory council of the Thalidomide Trust about the best way forward over recent weeks. I understand that the thalidomiders' proposal for a financial plan, which involves an ex gratia payment administered by the Thalidomide Trust, has been met with a counter-proposal from the Department of Health for the inclusion of a group of thalidomiders in a pilot project for the roll-out of the personal health budget scheme. The Thalidomide Trust is not attracted to that approach for a number of reasons, some of which were listed by my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands. I will not repeat the arguments against the personal health budget approach, but I agree that it will not meet the challenges faced by thalidomiders. The Minister has seen the arguments from the Thalidomide Trust, so I will not repeat them, but I think that it is a strong case.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.1/3">I hope that the Minister has read the comments of Professor Caroline Glendinning, who is a trustee of the Thalidomide Trust and a professor of social policy at York university. She has experience of evaluating social care and personal budgets, and will evaluate the pilot personal health budgets. One of her concerns is that the pilot of about 20 people proposed by the Department could create inequalities among the thalidomide population in England and between thalidomiders in England and those in the rest of the UK or overseas.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.1/4">I believe that the financial plan put forward by the Thalidomide Trust advisory group offers the best way forward for a number of reasons. First, it is simple and straightforward as it just requires the Department of Health to pay an annual lump sum to the Thalidomide Trust, which would be calculated by costing the unmet needs of surviving thalidomiders. Those moneys would be distributed to the beneficiaries by the trust, according to its established points system that determines the degree of impairment. Secondly, the approach does not require pilot projects or a phasing-in over a number of years. It could be introduced quickly and would provide immediate assistance to all thalidomiders who need it. There needs to be a sense of urgency. Thalidomiders are experiencing extreme difficulties now-not next year or the year after.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.1/5">Thirdly, there is no need to invent a new vehicle to deliver help to thalidomide survivors because one already exists. The Thalidomide Trust does a first-class job and has developed many ways to help thalidomiders in all aspects of their lives, as my hon. Friend said. That is done on the basis of the right to personal choice, which is the basis of the personal health budget approach. However, the trust looks for the best answer for the individual not just from one local health area, but from throughout the UK and sometimes beyond. The trust has a record of using the moneys from the manufacturers of thalidomide and the inheritor company responsibly and beneficially. It has the respect and trust of the surviving thalidomiders.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.1/6">The best way forward is clear. We are not talking about a huge amount of public money, but we could make a big difference to the quality of life of a group of people who deserve it. We did the right thing by the people who received contaminated blood through no fault of their own. Let us now do the right thing by the people who were disabled by thalidomide through no fault of their own.</p>

	<p pid="c.250.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on securing this debate and on her excellent introduction. I will come at this issue from a different angle. Enough has been said about regulatory failure. I will discuss what we as a nation owe the thalidomiders.</p>
	<p pid="c.250.0/2">My qualification is unique in this place because I qualified as a doctor in 1959. I worked as a houseman not far from here, and I remember thalidomide coming out under the name Distaval. Thalidomide was promoted to us as a sleeping pill. I was working in a medical ward and remember prescribing it as the first effective non-barbiturate sleeping pill. I do not think I would ever have given it to a pregnant lady, thank goodness, because I did not come across such patients in that job.</p>
	<p pid="c.250.0/3">As a student, I received no teaching on the teratogenecity of drugs. We understood the effects of external agents such as irradiation from diagnostic X-rays, but not internal mechanisms. The Wikipedia entry on teratogenesis states:</p>
	<p pid="c.250.0/4" class="indent">&quot;It was previously believed that the mammalian embryo developed in the impervious uterus of the mother, protected from all extrinsic factors. However, after the thalidomide disaster of the 1960s, it became apparent and more accepted that the developing embryo could be highly vulnerable to certain environmental agents that have negligible or non-toxic effects to adult individuals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.250.0/5">As students, we were not taught about such matters, and the general awareness was extremely low.</p>
	<p pid="c.250.0/6">In order to demonstrate how much we owe to thalidomiders, I will go through a little medical history. The Medical Safety Act came into effect in 1968. However, until we got the &quot;British National Formulary&quot; in 1980, active help for practising doctors was found in an archaic little volume. I was still writing prescriptions in Latin in the 1960s and 1970s. I shall never forget marvellous drugs such as &quot;Mistura ammonium et ipecacuanha compound&quot;, which was abbreviated to, &quot;Mist. ammon. et ipecac. co.&quot;, and was an expectorant. We were expected to prescribe that until the 1980s, when the &quot;British National Formulary&quot; produced a new guide that told us which drugs were useful and which were not. At the back were lists of interactions, and drugs that should not be used in cases of liver disease, kidney disease and in pregnancy. That was in 1980, and was the first time that practising doctors had been given that sort of information.</p>
	<p pid="c.250.0/7">I have compared the &quot;British National Formulary&quot; of 2004 with that of 2009. In 2004, there were 15 pages of advice on prescribing drugs during pregnancy. This year, there are 20 pages. The introduction to the section on pregnancy states:</p>
	<p pid="c.250.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Drugs should be prescribed in pregnancy only if the expected benefit to the mother is thought to be greater than the risk to the fetus, and all drugs should be avoided if possible during the first trimester.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.250.0/9">It is during the first trimester that the foetus is so vulnerable.</p>

	<p pid="c.250.1/1">We are establishing a reasonable case to suggest that doctors in the 1950s were fairly ignorant of drugs such as those that we are talking about. There might be an excuse for doctors, but was there an excuse for the Department of Health and those advising it being equally ignorant?</p>

	<p pid="c.251.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, but that point has already been made. I want to labour my point about the gratitude that we owe to thalidomiders. However, I agree about the failures of regulation.</p>
	<p pid="c.251.0/2">Amazingly, thalidomide is coming back into use for some uncommon and rare conditions. Under thalidomide, the &quot;British National Formulary&quot; states:</p>
	<p pid="c.251.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Teratogenic risk; effective contraception must be used for at least 1 month before, during and for at least 1 month after treatment...men should use condoms during treatment and for at least 1 week after stopping.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.251.0/4">My point seeks to demonstrate that we have learned a vast amount since the thalidomide disaster, because of what happened to those people. We have heard the arguments about the failure of regulatory reform, and I am not sure that we will get much further on that.</p>
	<p pid="c.251.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">The hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> drew attention to the lack of precedent. In fact, there is a precedent. People who received contaminated blood were given that blood before it was recognised as a problem. This is the same sort of issue: thalidomide was prescribed before it was recognised as a problem. Therefore, I argue strongly that thalidomiders deserve an ex gratia payment-whatever it is called. Ex gratia means something given as a favour or not compelled by legal right. To me, however, remembering my dog Latin, ex gratia means that a payment should be given &quot;out of gratitude&quot; to those people. If affected blood recipients received such a payment, thalidomiders should also get one. The mechanism must be worked out, but those people have played an amazing part in teaching the nation, and the world, about the dangers of thalidomide, and they should be recompensed in some way.</p>
	<p pid="c.251.0/6">Earlier this year, the Minister of State, Department of Health (Gillian Merron) stated in a written answer:</p>
	<p pid="c.251.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Prior to the thalidomide tragedy, there was no formal drug regulation system in place to monitor the safety of medicines in the UK. As a result of the tragedy, a complete review of the machinery for marketing, testing and regulating drugs was initiated, including enactment of the Medicines Act 1968, which introduced stricter testing for medicines prior to licensing to ensure that they meet acceptable standards of safety and efficacy.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-06-29.93"><i>Official Report</i>, 29 June 2009; Vol. 495, c. 93-94W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.251.0/8">We owe that to the thalidomiders.</p>

	<p pid="c.251.1/1">I will be brief, as I know that people are anxious to hear the Minister. I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on raising the issue, and on the thorough and lucid way in which she introduced the debate. Together with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1597" name="Martin Caton">the Member for Gower (Mr. Caton)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase>, who has spoken with an expertise that probably does not exist anywhere else in the Chamber, she has argued forcibly, and any remaining doubts about the justice of the case have been removed.</p>
	<p pid="c.251.1/2">Mikey Argy is the parliamentary campaign co-ordinator of the thalidomide campaign, and I will quote from an e-mail that she sent me, as it sums up the position well:</p>
	<p pid="c.251.1/3" class="indent">&quot;It is our belief that the UK government shares responsibility for the thalidomide disaster...Had the thalidomide children not been born half a century ago, they would have benefitted from modern government compensation schemes along the lines of those to assist people affected by contaminated blood products (HIV and CjD) and the Coal Health Compensation Scheme. In order to give thalidomiders the resources they will need to live out the rest of their lives independently...we intend to build up a groundswell of support among British MPs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.251.1/4">They can certainly count on me as part of that groundswell.</p>
	<p pid="c.251.1/5">My second point is about whether there should be a pilot scheme. I understand the reasons for pilot schemes, and in most circumstances they are a good way of testing a new system before it is rolled out. However, this is a different kind of problem. The Thalidomide Trust has huge experience in dealing with the diversity of problems that have been described by my hon. Friends. It knows how to do it; no piloting is required for the trust to run a scheme that will benefit all those people and deal with the diversity of problems experienced.</p>
	<p pid="c.251.1/6">If I could proffer some advice to the Minister-something I rarely do-it would be that it is important to recognise that expertise already exists, and that perhaps it would not be appropriate to conduct a pilot project. With good will on the part of the Government and those involved in the campaign, a system could be devised to meet everybody's needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.251.1/7">Although a great deal of progress has already been made on this matter, in every generation, a handful of injustices have to be resolved. This case is one such injustice that has not been satisfactorily resolved. I know that my right hon. and learned Friend is decent and, along with hon. Members from all parties, I stand ready to assist him in any way possible to bring the matter to a fair and just conclusion, and I am sure that is his intention-I just want him to recognise that there is a great deal of support for his doing so from Labour Members.</p>

	<p pid="c.252.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> for precipitating the debate and introducing it in such an informed and balanced way. I shall begin with a resum&#233; of what I believe has been established and what I think we all agree on.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.0/2">There is little doubt that thalidomide is a profoundly disabling condition. It is diverse in its outcome and extent-a point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1664" name="George Howarth">the right hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth)</phrase>-and in the level of handicap. The condition affects not only individuals, but their families. In saying that, I pay tribute to the thalidomiders I have known, who have not only lived with that diversity, but striven to conquer their disabilities. In many cases, those thalidomiders have, with immense cheerfulness and optimism, become major contributors to our world, our lives and their communities. They may be disabled citizens, but they are by no means despairing citizens.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.0/3">The point has been well made that as thalidomiders age, there is little doubt that the handicaps they endure and have to work around create special problems-serious organic and muscular problems, a severely impaired personal and social life and problems we probably have not yet heard about because we simply do not know what will happen. All those problems demand appreciable resources to fend them off. It is widely acknowledged that there is little doubt that thalidomiders' disabilities and disadvantages were entirely avoidable. There was a massive failure of the duty to care by Gr&#252;nenthal and Distillers, and a failure of the regulatory system. That is not a matter of debate-it was wrong of the producer to market such a drug and negligent of the state to allow its distribution.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.0/4">When we consider the sad history of the matter, there is little doubt that the parties to this disaster have usually had to be dragged kicking and screaming to acknowledge their responsibilities. Trailblazing investigative journalism has clearly played its part, but so has smart legal footwork, which was needed to unmask the cause, genesis and liabilities of the tragedy. At one stage, Distillers-not unassisted by the Department of Health-sought to deny the possibility of any foreknowledge or likelihood of thalidomide's injurious effects. In addition-this is a sad point to make-Distillers sought to take advantage of the legal inexperience of thalidomide sufferers by pressuring them for an early and derisory settlement. More culpably, in the early days, through contempt of court rules, Distillers sought to suppress publication of the facts.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.0/5">There is also little doubt about the embarrassment and complicity of the British state-I mean that in the widest sense and not in reference to any particular Government-and that it has often had too cosy a relationship with the pharmaceutical industry. Although I accept-<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> made this point-that doctors had reason in those days not to be particularly knowledgeable about thalidomide, the Department of Health knew the limitations of the drug trials that had taken place-that they had used small animals and had ignored things such as the effect of the drug through the placenta. The Department of Health knew what the characteristic biochemistry and behaviour of thalidomide's ingredients were and what the World Health Organisation was advising. Tellingly, because of the facts, it also knew that the drug was prevented from sale in the USA on safety grounds under legislation passed in 1938-as with Equitable Life there was a producer and a regulatory failure.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.0/6">There is little doubt that that general analysis is accepted worldwide. In every other nation where compensation is given-even if that compensation is less than that given in the UK, and in some cases it is-the state contributes. The UK Government have, in reality, done very little in a financial sense to resolve the problem and, until recently, they have collected far more in tax than they have given out in lump-sum benefits.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.0/7">However, there is absolutely no doubt whatever that the Government want to solve the problem, and I genuinely believe that that is not just because of the force of Back-Bench opinion or the campaigning quality of the thalidomiders themselves. I understand that Nick Dobrik considered getting elected to this place for South Cambridge, in order to take the matter further, which is a rather desperate remedy in the current circumstances, and I would not necessarily advise him to follow it through. I would like to believe that ultimately the Government will accept that there is genuine force in the arguments that are being presented.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.0/8">There are two solutions still on the table: one is the Government's preferred solution, which is to pilot personal accounts and direct payment initiatives; the other, which is from the Thalidomide Trust, is to accept the costed financial plan that it presents and use ex-gratia payments. In judging the two options, we must remember that we are not just gauging the needs of those who happen to be disabled by circumstance; we are considering people who could have lived totally different lives had commerce been more feeling or the Government more vigilant. Yes, it is a matter of meeting needs, but to some extent it is also a matter of restorative justice.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.0/9">The Government's favoured solution is to use an embryonic mechanism of direct payments-a pilot-for an uncharacteristic, small, diverse and widely spread group, to be administered by local bodies with limited funds and, it has to be said, limited knowledge, expertise and skill. In any case, such a scheme would be time limited and means-tested.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.0/10">The alternative suggested by the trust is to use a tried and tested organisation of unquestionably the highest probity that is intimately linked to the recipients of the benefit and is aware of the task it faces. When confronted with that analysis, the next step seems fairly obvious. The Government's duty and the road ahead are clear. The Government might not necessarily want to take a step down that road today, but they need to take the matter away from the Floor of the House, sit down with Nick Dobrik and the trust, look at the plan, look again at the problem and produce what everyone in this room wants: a permanent, just and workable solution.</p>

	<p pid="c.254.0/1">It is a pleasure to participate in a debate on a subject that I am surprised took so long to be discussed. I am not surprised that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> has brought the matter to Westminster Hall, considering the campaigner she is. It was a pleasure to serve with her on the Select Committee on Health.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/2">The campaign that has, frankly, been run so brilliantly by the Thalidomide Trust and the advisory board has been strong, sensible and very active. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">The hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> alluded to the fact that, a few months ago, one or some of the thalidomiders considered standing for election-perhaps Cambridgeshire is not quite the place, but certainly having that sort of campaigner in the House would be a credit to the House and not a hindrance.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/3">I have met representatives of the Thalidomide Trust many times. We have had robust, but open and honest discussions. My door will always be open to them now and in the future. Their ability to fight for their rights, friends and fellow sufferers is a tribute to them. As we have heard today, the experts assumed that they would all be gone by now and the problem would be over because perhaps they would not have lived this long. As someone who was born in 1957, I am conscious of how close my parents were to the taking of this drug. My mother tells me that she suffered enormously with morning sickness so, but for the will of God, I could be sitting in the Public Gallery listening to the debate now. I pay tribute to the ferocious tenacity of the thalidomiders. As we heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1597" name="Martin Caton">the hon. Member for Gower (Mr. Caton)</phrase>, the chair of the all-party group on thalidomide, their parents were worn down. This group of people are not going to be worn down, and that is obvious to all of us.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/4">I have listened intently to the debate and heard the responses of hon. Members, some of which I am sure the Minister will reiterate. It is enormously difficult when such a diverse group of people have had their lives blighted by one cause, but they have needs that are completely individual. I do not think that one single thalidomide victim is identical to another. Their problems might be similar, but they are not identical. I find it difficult to understand how a pilot group of 20, 30 or 40 people could replicate the needs of all 363 people who need help. I shall be interested to hear from the Minister how he expects a pilot project that is based around the primary care trust structure to work, given that some PCT areas have no people who suffer from the effects of thalidomide, and others have numerous sufferers, each one of whom will be different.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/5">The expertise that the trust has acquired over the years, not least through help from universities such as the university of Leeds, is the sort of knowledge that we need to take this matter forward. We need to draw a line under this issue. The thalidomide campaigners need to stop having to campaign; they need a rest.

	<p pid="c.255.0/1">In outlining his thesis, the hon. Gentleman has clearly established the diversity of the victims' needs. Given the diverse nature of PCTs and the different ways of administering health care across the UK, does not that make it all the more important that the issue should be taken beyond any pilot and resolved immediately? No one doubts the Government's intent, but we need a resolution.</p>

	<p pid="c.255.1/1">I completely agree. I do not think anyone doubts that the Minister and the Government want to help, but the debate is about how to do that and how we can be fair to all the individuals who suffer from the effects of the thalidomide drug. I do not suggest that this matter can be dealt with once and for all, because people's circumstances will change as they get older, but we certainly need to get past the current situation in which many of those people are suffering in ways that none of us can comprehend.</p>
	<p pid="c.255.1/2">The very nature of this issue means that people have different needs. Health needs have been discussed, and the hon. Lady mentioned that some victims have already had joint replacements, but for many sufferers that would not be possible because their joints are not replicable. Some people's joints cannot just be replaced tomorrow because they are unique as a result of their condition. It is very difficult to see how all those needs will be met by PCTs around the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.255.1/3">As well as health needs, those people have other needs relating to their quality of life, especially as they move into their 50s and, we hope, into their 60s and 70s. I am sceptical about how personal health budgets will work, because many thalidomide victims do not have health needs today, but have other needs that are not part of the health budget. They think it important that the Minister addresses this issue, and I am sure that he is toying with that idea and fighting with his own Department about how it can be addressed. I repeat that thalidomide victims are exceptional cases, and that there are no replicated cases. I am pleased that the Government have already addressed the tainted blood problem. I had the honour of being the chair of the all-party group on haemophilia before I came to the Front Bench.</p>
	<p pid="c.255.1/4">Thalidomide victims need help today. How are we going to cross the Rubicon between what the trust, the advisory board, the all-party group and the campaigners feel needs to be addressed today, and the Government's position? The Opposition's view is that there should be an independent review of all the medical needs of thalidomide victims. That review has to be independent; it has to be carried out away from the Government, the Department of Health and the trust, because although the expertise is there, there will always be a scepticism within the Department. I call on the Government to announce an independent review to assess the individual needs of all thalidomide victims. If they do not do that, and if the Conservative party forms a Government, it will announce a review immediately after the election. Our review would look at the capacity of the Thalidomide Trust to assist its members, at how the NHS is addressing the needs of thalidomide victims, and at how local authorities and the Government in general are assessing their needs. That is the least that we could do. The review should report within three months, and the Government should then come forward with proposals on how the long-term needs of thalidomide victims will be addressed.</p>

	<p pid="c.256.0/1">Let me begin by joining in the general congratulations to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on securing the debate on this enormously important issue. We have heard several passionate contributions to the debate-from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1597" name="Martin Caton">the Member for Gower (Mr. Caton)</phrase>, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1664" name="George Howarth">the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1396" name="Patrick Hall">the Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall)</phrase>, as well as from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase>, with his historical knowledge of the situation. We have also heard from the hon. Members for Banbury (Tony Baldry) and for Southport (Dr. Pugh). The contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" name="Michael Penning">the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning)</phrase> was slightly disappointing, in that he simply proposed another review.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.0/2">We need to clear the decks a little regarding what the issues are. The hon. Member for Banbury is right about my having been given the traditional Minister's brief. Let me dispense with it and talk more broadly about the key issues. We can argue about the money, but that is not the issue, frankly. The issue is whether people have health and care needs that must be addressed. The national advisory council of the Thalidomide Trust has put to me its views about thalidomiders' concerns about their health. I accept that many of their health needs are changing and increasing. For some of the people who have survived thalidomide and received compensation in the past, through Diageo, Distillers and the Thalidomide Trust, and who are receiving some payments, their life expectations have changed substantially since those agreements were reached. I accept that entirely, and we must now look at the implications of the situation. We must look at their health and care needs and consider how they can best be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.0/3">We can argue about history and about money, but the main issue is working out the main health-care needs of thalidomiders. The issue is one of liability. The Government could set out their position at some length, but I do not propose to do that today, because I want to concentrate on the future, rather than the past. Let me make it clear that I accept that there are increased health needs that now need to be addressed. Some of my proposals would probably cost more than what the NAC is asking for in its discussions with me, so I repeat that the issue is not money.</p>

	<p pid="c.257.1/1">Let me just explain what the issue is about. It is about how we can best address people's needs. I do not have a fixed view on that. I have had a couple of meetings with the NAC and I am grateful to it for coming along and putting its case for ex-gratia payments to me clearly. I am considering its case, but the issue is difficult-I shall not go into all the arguments-and I have put an alternative proposal to the NAC. My proposal would involve similar amounts of money to those that are likely to be paid, but they would be paid somewhat differently. I have asked the NAC to work with us on my proposal-to work through the iterative process of identifying the detail and how we could help. It might be that my proposal would not work, or there might be more to consider regarding the NAC's proposal. We need to find some way of dealing with the matter together. I want to go through that process of looking at the detail; I want to examine the health-care needs of thalidomiders, consider how those needs can best be addressed, and look at the best way of doing that.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.1/2">I will come on to the various concerns that my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands, expressed and deal with them in detail; I think that I have enough time to do that. First, however, I want to be clear that we are not proposing that only 20 people should be involved in the pilot. I want to find a way of using the considerable skills and knowledge of the Thalidomide Trust to ensure that the health needs and care needs-I will outline in a moment why I use those terms separately-will be addressed financially and with regard to provision. I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East that there is a great deal of skill in the trust that we need to access. We can use its historical knowledge, the knowledge of the individuals in its database, and the trust that it has won from thalidomiders to ensure that needs are properly addressed.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.1/3">I propose that we work with the Thalidomide Trust to consider individuals who have particular needs, to assess those needs, and to identify a project that will enable those health and care needs to be met. I accept that those needs will, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gower said, include a need for care hours, help with cleaning and gardening, adaptions to homes and cars, and a range of other things. We must find out how we can best address all those needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.258.0/1">The Minister acknowledges that those health and care needs will involve funding, but will he clarify whether that funding will be allocated specifically to primary care trusts and ring-fenced, or whether it will go directly to the Thalidomide Trust? I hope that he will not take it amiss if hon. Members would like to understand exactly where the money will come from and where it will go to.</p>

	<p pid="c.258.1/1">I will happily set that out in a moment, because hon. Members will want to know how that money could be channelled if we reach agreement.</p>

	<p pid="c.258.2/1">Earlier, the Minister referred to changing health needs. One limitation of an independent review is that we will only capture the needs at a particular time. I sense that many people are looking for a mechanism that would give them security for the future, whatever their needs. Some of those needs are imponderable, and we cannot work them out at the moment because we have never had thalidomide in the world before, and hopefully will never have it again.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-11-04c.258.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1910" speakername="Mike O'Brien" colnum="258"  time="010:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091104/halltext/91104h0003.htm#09110485000251">
	<p pid="c.258.3/1">We need to ensure that needs are properly assessed. The Thalidomide Trust has a mechanism, and I want to assess the sort of help that its beneficiaries need. I want to work with the trust to see whether that is a good way, for our purposes and those of public funding, of assessing the needs of individuals. It may well be that it is, but we need to look in detail at how the trust assesses needs and distributes funding, because we might learn something from that; there might be a mechanism that, with some work from my officials, we can use.</p>
	<p pid="c.258.3/2">With regard to the proposal, we are looking at whether we can use the current legislation for social care, and the legislation that is going through the House for individual budgets for social and health care. We are looking at joining them together and then identifying about 20 individuals across a range of disabilities, whose needs would be assessed for a pilot. We could then put funding in place. The detail is still to be worked out, but the idea is to work with the trust and direct funding through it to ensure that individuals' needs are met in an agreed way.</p>
	<p pid="c.258.3/3">Those needs can be various; they can range from adaptions to vehicles and help with musculoskeletal problems to assistance with particular health-care needs. Long-term conditions often entail particular kinds of health-care needs. All those requirements could then be identified within a budget. That would not include admissions to hospital; they would continue to be covered separately, but health-care needs that do not involve admission to hospital can still be considerable.</p>
	<p pid="c.258.3/4">I have identified the figure of 20 because that might enable the university of York and the other institutions that are assessing the pilot to determine whether it is a success and adequately delivers what we want it to deliver. I am clear that the figure of 20 is not a maximum; it could increase to 400 or beyond, if necessary. The figure of 20 is used only for the purpose of the assessment. We would want to work with the trust to determine whether the project shows the best way to help people with their conditions. I agree with the hon. Member for Banbury that those conditions are often varied and multiple, so we need to be able to assess the corresponding needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.258.3/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands asked how the level will be calculated for individuals. We hope that it will be calculated by an agreed assessment, and we want to work with the trust to see what it identifies as the individuals' needs, how they can best be helped, and how much that will cost. We will then identify a sum.</p>
	<p pid="c.258.3/6">The hon. Member for Banbury rightly asked where that sum will come from. It will come from the place where individual budgets will come from: from the money that will be identified for social care, and the money that will be identified for the health needs of individuals. The cost of meeting health-care needs will come out of primary care trust budgets, and the cost of meeting care needs will come out of social services budgets.</p>
	<p pid="c.258.3/7">We want to identify individual budgets as a national project on which we will engage with the Thalidomide Trust, if that is the right way to proceed. With regard to health, the funding will be led by one primary care trust, which will work with the others to bring the funding together and ensure that it is directed into the appropriate channel. We would work with the various local authorities to identify the social services budgets and bring them into a central pot that would be directed through the Thalidomide Trust, if that is what is agreed-I say that because there is still much negotiation to be done.</p>
	<p pid="c.258.3/8">My hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands asked whether we will help with the costs for the trust, and the answer is yes. I have already identified a particular sum that would be available, and that would be a matter for negotiation. I do not want to have negotiations in public. I have had several useful meetings with the national advisory council of the Thalidomide Trust, and I want some confidentiality in respect of the details of those negotiations, so hon. Members will forgive me if I do not identify a particular figure.</p>

	<p pid="c.259.0/1">The Minister has helpfully described how he intends to work with the Thalidomide Trust to try to find a way of taking the issue forward. If during those discussions the trust can demonstrate that a scheme could be brought in without the need for piloting, would he be open to that?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-11-04c.259.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1910" speakername="Mike O'Brien" colnum="259"  time="010:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091104/halltext/91104h0003.htm#09110485000253">
	<p pid="c.259.1/1">That would not pose an insurmountable difficulty, but let me pause there a little. The legislation being taken through the House in respect of the health budget-not the social care budget-deals with pilots and enables us to run a pilot to identify the issues. Although the circumstances of thalidomiders are, in many ways, unique, the project-if it works-need not be unique. Other groups that work with organisations might benefit from an extension of it in the long term. I give no guarantees about that; we will have to see how it works.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.1/2">I shall go through some of the questions that I have been asked. How would things be organised, given that thalidomiders are so spread out geographically? It is certainly true that we would involve various PCTs and social services, but the Thalidomide Trust currently provides help to many thalidomiders directly, so we would use the trust to deliver many of the services to individuals. Services could be purchased from various sources. They could be purchased privately, from the voluntary sector, or from local authorities, using available funding. It will be possible to provide services on a diverse geographical basis, just as it is possible now, for many thalidomiders.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.1/3">I was asked what happens in 2012 when the pilot ends. If the pilot works, I hope that the project will continue. If it does not work, we will have to identify the problems and try to address them. We will have to try to ensure that a project is put in place that does address the health-care needs of thalidomiders.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.1/4">Let me be clear about this: I am talking about a pilot. I want to see how it works and whether it could help other groups, too. I do not yet know all the answers. However, I am not arguing about money. The figures that are generally used range from &#163;8 million to &#163;12 million-I have seen various figures-and the scheme that I am suggesting could be in that realm, if it applied to all thalidomiders.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.1/5">I will not get into a historical argument about liability. I want to address health-care needs. When the thalidomiders came to me, they said, &quot;We have increased health-care needs. We want the Government to address them.&quot; That is a perfectly straightforward and completely legitimate point of view for them to take, and it is one that I accept. The issue is how that can be done, and how quickly we can put a scheme in place. We do not need long reviews of three months or whatever. We could put the scheme in place from next year and start to identify the way-</p>

	<p pid="c.261.5/1">Which is why we need to access the Thalidomide Trust's knowledge. I hope that my officials can have constructive discussions with the NAC. I met its representatives on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-16">16 July</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-22">22 October</phrase>, and I hope to meet them again soon for further discussions. My officials plan to visit the trust later this week, and I hope to have a further meeting with the NAC a week or so after that.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.5/2">The NAC has been clear with me: it wants ex-gratia payments. It has set out its case with force and eloquence. I had the pleasure of meeting a range of thalidomiders just before this debate, and, as I said, I have met with the NAC; they make their points forcefully and persuasively. That is why I am anxious not to get into the traditional arguments. I could have set out the Government's traditional position, but I want to see whether there are ways to resolve the issue. We need to talk to each other in an honest and straightforward way. I have a view about how we might be able to deal with the matter, and am happy to say that it might work. I hope that it will, but it might not, in which case, if the trust has clear arguments against the proposal, we may have to go back to the drawing board and look at the matter again.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.5/3">The trust has put forward proposals, but I have concerns about them. For example, if funding is to be directed through the trust, how will we get verification of how it is spent? By and large, we are happy that the trust is a good organisation, and we want to work with it. There is constructive dialogue between it and the Government, but I do not want to drag it out, which is why I said a few weeks ago that I wanted a meeting fairly quickly. I do not know whether we will get a deal before Christmas, but the NAC said that it would like to reach an agreement by then. I do not know whether that is possible, but I would like to do that, if we can.</p>

	<p pid="c.262.0/1">On a similar point, under the Minister's scheme, if a PCT in the pilot has thalidomide victims who need to be funded via direct payments, the funding presumably will come from additional resources given by the Government for running the pilot, not from existing PCT resources which, as we all know, are stretched right across the country. Presumably the funding will not come from the existing overall PCT budget.</p>

	<p pid="c.262.1/1">Yes. Individual budgets will come from PCT budgets, but additional assistance for the Thalidomide Trust to administer the system will not. It is clear that direct payments come from existing budgets in any event.</p>
	<p pid="c.262.1/2">The question for me is how we ensure that the increased health-care needs of thalidomiders are met. I accept that they need to be met. How are we to do it, and how do we ensure that power remains with individual thalidomiders? If the funding goes to them, they should have some choice about how it is directed, and if they want to direct it through the Thalidomide Trust, we should discuss with the trust how that can best be done.</p>

	<p pid="c.263.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cummings, and a pleasure to talk about the issues to do with Marton Moss and sustainable strategies in Blackpool.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.1/2">When I was a child growing up in Manchester and Stockport, one of the highlights of our annual visits to Blackpool, after we had done the golden mile and, hopefully, won something on the grab machines and gone on the beach was to go out of the back of the town, which in those days did not have the excellent motorway connection that it has today, and pick up Blackpool home-grown tomatoes from one of the nurseries on Marton Moss. There are not as many nurseries there now as there were when I was a child, but Marton Moss still retains that essential semi-rural character: Blackpool's oldest cottage is nearby-&quot;Blowing Sands&quot;. It is criss-crossed with dykes and there are still market gardens, there are horses in paddocks, seven or eight species of birds in many residents' gardens and an 18th century cattle shelter. That is perhaps not what people would expect to find in Blackpool.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.1/3">This debate is designed to underline a major planning controversy that has blown up about proposals to build hundreds and, in the long run, thousands, of homes in this area and to highlight big challenges about the sustainability and affordability of housing and the regeneration in central areas of Blackpool. The controversy has led to a sustained 12-month campaign to save the Moss, supported across Blackpool by me, as the local Member of Parliament, and by thousands of local residents. It has been further heightened by revelations that the developers wishing to build on the Moss made two &#163;5,000 donations to the Blackpool, South Conservative association-the council is Conservative controlled.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.1/4">The controversy over the Moss was a central issue in a by-election in the ward in August, not least because of some of the key figures involved in the campaign and allegations that some of the councillors involved would have to decide on the Kensington Developments planning applications. The controversy also throws up big, general questions about the need to have a coherent strategy to link the siting of new homes with coherent skills, employment and environmental policies and the Government's desire to give preference to brownfield over greenfield developments.</p>

	<p pid="c.263.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that one key reason for looking at brownfield sites is that Blackpool has a high water table? If we build on Greenfield sites, we create a danger of flooding not just in Marton Moss, but in parts of Blackpool, North, which I represent, where we have seen exactly that happen.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-11-04c.263.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" speakername="Gordon Marsden" colnum="263"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091104/halltext/91104h0004.htm#09110485000268">
	<p pid="c.263.3/1">My hon. Friend is right. I will illustrate some severe concerns about the sustainability of such a major development on Marton Moss, as is currently proposed.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/2">There are two separate developments at issue. First, the council's core strategy presently envisages nearly 3,000 houses being built in the Marton Moss area. Secondly, there are two specific planning applications from Kensington Developments to build between 500 and 700 houses, with double that amount of car parking space, on a 17 hectare site. Kensington proposes building on land that already floods frequently and has inadequate sewerage services and roads to cope with such a major expansion. The Kensington applications contain no significant low-carbon or sustainability proposals, no targets for affordable housing and no comments on the threat to local wildlife that is prevalent in the area that would be produced by such a development.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/3">Another issue that is not unimportant is that many other houses that have been built in and around the Marton Moss area in recent years remain unsold. At a time of economic downturn and a certain degree of stagnation in the housing market, there must be grave questions about whether a development of this size would be sold off rapidly.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/4">A key issue is that the council has never had a major consultation with people in the area, either on the core strategy or the Kensington applications, although, as I shall argue, local residents have, in responding to my survey on the issue and via petitions, certainly not been silent on that.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/5">Kensington has been a major developer in the area of Fylde and Blackpool. In late 2008, having sniffed around for about 12 months, trying to acquire parcels of land in and around the Marton Moss area, it formally put in its first planning application for up to 640 houses. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-11">11 November 2008</phrase>, I wrote to the team leader for development control in Blackpool borough council, underlining the objections that had already flooded in to me from large numbers of residents in the area about the development, including</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/6" class="indent">&quot;Little consideration for the implications of such a large scale development on congestion and road conditions&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/7">where there are already</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/8" class="indent">&quot;a number of narrow roads never designed for such a large scale expansion of housing...The potential for deep and significant problems from a major building project...on land where past experience and local knowledge suggests that it could be unstable and unsatisfactory long term for such a development. There are&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/9">this touches on what my hon. Friend said-</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/10" class="indent">&quot;existing drainage problems in and around Midgeland Road&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/11">on the Moss</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/12" class="indent">&quot;and the impact on the water table could be severe...Concerns that the character of the area and the richness of its wildlife...could be irreparably damaged by a development which would involve the loss of hedgerows&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/13">destruction of trees, encroachment</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/14" class="indent">&quot;on breeding and foraging habitats as well as...the ability of people to exercise their animals freely-together with small businesses who are sustained by the rural character of the Moss.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/15">Finally, I mentioned</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/16" class="indent">&quot;An unacceptable pressure put on existing services-whether schools, doctors or other public provision-in the area as a result of expansion which,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/17">I underlined,</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/18" class="indent">&quot;did not take into account such increased need.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/19">Subsequently, when Kensington appealed initially, in June 2009 I added some comments in a letter underlining the concerns about development, saying:</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/20" class="indent">&quot;I believe in this respect that the Kensington proposals are antipathetic to the Government's and&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/21">in particular,</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/22" class="indent">&quot;DCLG's objectives of creating high quality, sustainable mixed and inclusive communities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/23">That was the situation then. But at the same time as the development application had been submitted, the council was producing its own core housing strategy, which produced the large numbers projected over a 15 to 20-year period that I have mentioned. In its defence, the council talked about the need to address the growth point strategy that it had signed up for in 2007 with four other councils. I should like to go back to what the council was obliged or not obliged to do as a result of that. I quote from the general criteria the council was given by the Government in the growth points document on the Department for Communities and Local Government website, which talks about the growth point strategy:</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/24" class="indent">&quot;The Government invited local authorities to submit strategic growth proposals which were sustainable, acceptable environmentally and realistic in terms of infrastructure...proposals will need to set out their local and strategic impacts on the environment (for example regarding water supply, flooding and sewerage)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/25">There are grave doubts about all those areas in respect of major developments on Marton Moss. The council, in its 2008 document on the central Lancashire and Blackpool growth point, which it signed up to, said that in that area sustainability was its most important consideration.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/26">When the initial core strategy was produced in March 2009, there was an enormous amount of protest. I received 400 plus responses from constituents that were almost unanimously against both the core strategy as it then was and the Kensington application. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-06">Friday 6 March</phrase> there was a protest meeting at Highfield school in my constituency, near the Moss area, at which I spoke. The leader of the &quot;Save Our Moss&quot; campaign, Angelia Hinds, spoke as well. I pay tribute to Angelia Hinds and all her colleagues on that committee for their sustained and detailed questioning of the council and the developers throughout the whole process. At a council meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-15">15 March</phrase>, Councillor Fred Jackson, a colleague, moved an amendment to the core strategy to prevent a decision being made on it without proper consultation and detailed examples of its impact. The council gave neither, but moved the goalposts rapidly.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/27">What are the opposition and the arguments? Of course people who live on the Moss, both old and new residents, are concerned and passionate about their circumstances. They have a quality of life that they want to preserve. The practical objections are to the council's core strategy for the whole of Blackpool, as well as what may or may not happen on Marton Moss with Kensington's large development. There is opposition from ecologists at Lancashire county council, and the protesters have a strong understanding about the choices to be made between peripheral and central development in Blackpool.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/28">Many hon. Members know about Blackpool's history. Its drive for regeneration and its bid for the casino and so on were posited on our need for growth, development and stimulus in the town's central areas, where some wards are among the most deprived in the country. I have said repeatedly, and said at the protest meeting, that money is available from the Government and other sources for a properly costed regeneration strategy for housing in that area.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/29">The Moss is called that for a reason. Blackpool is riddled with examples of over-optimistic building producing sunken driveways and constant flooding. I could take you to parts of my constituency, Mr. Cummings, where expensive houses that were built on the periphery several years ago have driveways that are not level, but are v-shaped, because they are in areas where the sand meets the moss. That is why people who live in south Blackpool are known as sandgrown'uns, and those who live at Marton Moss are known as mossheads. There is a lot of history behind the reasons for being cautious about building in the area.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/30">In the wake of all that criticism, the council delayed, and Kensington became impatient and appealed to the Department for Communities and Local Government, when the Government's planning inspectorate stepped in and said that the matter would have to be referred. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-04">4 June</phrase>, the front page of my local newspaper, the<i> Blackpool Gazette</i>, quoted the Government's inspector:</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/31" class="indent">&quot;The size of the proposals would significantly impact on the Government's objective to secure a better balance between housing demand and supply, and create high quality sustainable mixed and inclusive communities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/32">Kensington then made a second application with very few changes-for 570 houses, down from 640-and withdrew its appeal on the back of the second application. To many of us at the time, that seemed a curious, smoke-and-mirrors exercise, which was one reason why I wrote to the chief planning officer on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-09">9 July</phrase> making exactly those points. At the same time, the council said that it had made major changes in its core strategy, which turned out not to be the case. In my letter, I said that the new proposal was</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/33" class="indent">&quot;essentially a cosmetic exercise and...will have...very little effect in lessening the negative congestion, service use and environmental and other impacts&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/34">I said that nowhere did the application address alternative scenarios for the Moss, to provide substantial employment for the area, such as developing a nature reserve, eco-tourism, and other green business initiatives. I pointed out that it would do nothing to support the housing market restructuring and renewal that Blackpool council, under the regional spatial strategy, had signed up to, nor to renew, refurbish or bring housing space in the town back into use. The regional spatial strategy plan says that local authorities should maximise reuse of vacant and unused buildings.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/35">It seemed that the council wanted to move the goalposts, and a detailed executive report of <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-15">15 July</phrase> to the cabinet executive left the overall direction of travel unchanged. There was no broad consultation with people in the area, and no comprehensive rethink, which Councillor Jackson and other opposition councillors had asked for in the March 2009 debate. A proposal by the opposition for further consultation on the core strategy was blocked by the ruling group. On the back of that, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-15">15 July</phrase> I wrote to the leader of the council again querying what the strategy was designed to do. I talked about the lack of a proper in-area bid, and said that the report had not taken any account of the new environmental and local carbon requirements that the Government would demand in housing strategies, let alone new proposals. I also said that any genuinely thoughtful review, which this was asked to be, would have addressed issues such as the revival of allotments, eco-tourism and a nature reserve that might bring new employment to the Moss and to Blackpool's outskirts.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/36">The only response I received to my letter to the leader of the council, after waiting months for a detailed reply, arrived only two or three weeks ago but, curiously, was dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-04">4 August</phrase>, and dealt only peripherally with my letter. It included the words:</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/37" class="indent">&quot;It is true that a Hub development would meet wider housing needs and relieve pressures in other parts of Fylde Borough&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/38">In other words, the strategy was focused more on the needs of Fylde borough than those of people in Blackpool.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/39">At that point, fate took a hand. The sudden and sad death of the councillor for Stanley ward, which includes Marton Moss, precipitated a by-election in August. Inevitably, the council's position on Kensington and the future of Marton Moss became a key issue. However, few were prepared for the spectacular stream of revelations during the last five days of the campaign. My local newspaper, the <i>Blackpool Gazette, </i>broke the story that Kensington Developments had given two donations of &#163;5,000 to Blackpool, South conservative association, one in July 2008 and the other in May 2009, just before its second application went in and the council revised its core strategy. The headlines that followed in the <i>Blackpool Gazette</i>, speak for themselves: &quot;The Tories and the Tainted Cash,&quot; &quot;Tories defend cash gift,&quot; &quot;Now it is another &#163;5,000&quot; and &quot;Tories agree to repay &#163;10,000 to developers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/40">The planning chair stepped down from considering the future of the Moss because he was also its councillor. There were allegations that the Conservative candidate at the by-election had known about the donations and done nothing, and the north-west Conservative agent, who carried out an internal investigation, said that the money had been earmarked for the prospective Conservative parliamentary candidate's election fund. The leader of the council, who said he was furious about the matter and demanded the return of the money, then demanded a letter from his councillors saying that they knew nothing about the donations. It was signed by 21 councillors, but six have not signed it. Since then, the deputy leader and other councillors have been referred to the Standards Board, and the latest headline in the <i>Blackpool Gazette</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-31">Saturday 31 October</phrase> stated, &quot;Deputy leader in cash gift probe.&quot; It is perhaps not surprising that on the back of that controversy and the continued objections, the Government office for the north-west wrote to the council on <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-16">16 September</phrase> saying that the Secretary of State was directing the council not to grant permission for Kensington's application without special authorisation and reference.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/41">I want us to remain focused on the real issues of policy, and to emphasise the key issues. Blackpool's regeneration is a key issue for everyone in the town, and we should be looking positively for ways to take it forward. That is why I have repeatedly urged the council to engage positively with an alternative agenda to their obsession with building on the periphery, why I raised the issues with the then Minister with responsibility for housing, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1533" name="Margaret Beckett">the Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett)</phrase>, in the spring, and why I wrote to the chair of the Homes and Communities Agency, Bob Kerslake.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/42">The Moss campaigners recognise that a strategy for the area must be linked to employment and skills overall. In a note on the council's core strategy, Angelia Hinds and her colleagues say: &quot;Absolutely nothing has been done about attracting employment opportunities. Have any proposals been put forward to suggest how this will be done or will the whole area become a dormitory town? The proximity to the M55 will encourage residents of the new village to travel to Preston and Manchester, rather than go to the centre of Blackpool. The prospects then for the inner town are not good.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/43">Blackpool and Marton Moss need a coherent strategy that works with the grain of Government policy, the regional spatial strategy and the growth point. I ask again why Blackpool council has not turned to its partners, especially Fylde, to consider what they can do to take up some of the slack.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/44">Kensington is still stonewalling on these issues. In its latest letter to Blackpool council, its property consultants brushed aside residents' complaints, stating that</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/45" class="indent">&quot;with regard to comments of local residents, generally I do not consider it is the role of applicants to respond...we stand by the contents of our Environmental Statement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/46">Ultimately, this is about sustainability and coherence. It is about not narrow nimbyism, but coherent strategy planning that recognises that Blackpool's needs can be met only with a sustainable programme for the centre. We need the dynamic twin-track approach of major, practical, cost-efficient brownfield development that can attract more HCA and private sector funding, and an imaginative new deal for Marton Moss.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/47">The people of Blackpool and the Moss know that. Let me give the last word to some of my constituents who have contacted me. One said:</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/48" class="indent">&quot;I don't think the infrastructure is sufficient to cope...I am worried about the wildlife and who is going to buy all the houses.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/49">Another said:</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/50" class="indent">&quot;There's enough derelict and empty housing within Blackpool that could be redeveloped rather than use this beautiful nature environment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/51">Another said:</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/52" class="indent">&quot;I agree...with the points...raised on the state of the land-it is one big bog.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/53">Another said:</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/54" class="indent">&quot;The key to regenerating Blackpool is to redevelop eyesores and dilapidated buildings...once greenfield land is developed it is lost forever.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/55">Finally, Shirley Earnshaw of Midgeland road said:</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/56" class="indent">&quot;As a resident of Marton Moss for over 30 years I am appalled at the idea of the proposed development-we have a moral duty to protect the environment for future generations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.263.3/57">That is what the people of Blackpool and Marton Moss are saying. I can only hope that Kensington Developments and Blackpool council will listen to them.</p>

	<p pid="c.268.0/1">It is a pleasure, as always, to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cummings. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" name="Gordon Marsden">the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden)</phrase> on securing the debate and raising this important issue, which I know is of great interest to many of his constituents. It was fascinating to listen to what he had to say. I must confess that when I was taken to Blackpool as a child, we drove in and out and did not get to stop in Marton Moss and see all the great things in the area that he told us about, so I feel that my childhood was lacking in comparison to his.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.0/2">I also congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase>, who takes a very keen interest in this issue and has contributed to the debate. Both my hon. Friends work tirelessly and effectively for their constituencies and are great champions of and for Blackpool, speaking up for the people whom they represent. I am sure that the work that they are doing on this issue will be noticed by those people. I would be very pleased if the local council could work as closely as possible with both my hon. Friends on these and other matters.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.0/3">However, I must say at the outset-I am sure that my hon. Friends will understand this-that I can make no direct comment on the current planning application, because there is a possibility of that being called in for decision by the Secretary of State, and pronouncement on it now would prejudice the Secretary of State's decision.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.0/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South read out the results of the local paper's investigations. It should be congratulated on the work that it is doing in the area. However, it is pretty clear that there are other investigations and issues affecting this case that make it an even more sensitive issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.0/5">I would like to clarify the Government's position on housing. Clearly, the long-term demand for housing is rising. The 2008 regional spatial strategy for the north-west increased the average annual requirement for new houses in the region from 12,790 a year to 23,111. That was based on independent research commissioned by the North West regional assembly. It attracted remarkably little controversy at the public examination. Blackpool's share of that housing allocation amounts on average to 444 homes a year. The overall housing estimates and allocations to individual local authorities were accepted by the vast majority of authorities without disagreement.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.0/6">However, it is important to remember that RSSs do not go into site-specific detail and it is up to local planning authorities to decide where to locate the housing development allocated to them in the RSS. Authorities should do that through their local development frameworks. That will not only ensure plan-led development as intended by the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, but that local communities are fully consulted on both the need for and the siting of development in the area. Blackpool is working on a new LDF core strategy that will provide a framework for identifying sites for new housing development.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.0/7">The increase in housing requirements in the north-west reflects an increased need for housing in the country as a whole. For decades, there has been a mismatch between supply and demand for new homes, leading to significant problems of affordability, particularly on parts of the Fylde coast, where housing is out of reach for those on low incomes. The downturn has significantly impacted on house prices and the delivery of housing, but falling house prices have not solved the affordability problem. On the contrary, mortgage rationing and larger deposit requirements have made it harder to buy a home. At the same time, demographic pressures continue to build, with the latest projections showing that the number of households in England is likely to grow by about 250,000 a year. That underlines the urgent need to achieve a step change in housing supply.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.0/8">It also needs to be borne in mind that Blackpool council decided, as we heard, to be part of the central Lancashire and Blackpool growth point. The purpose of growth points is to provide additional housing over and above the requirements in the RSS. The 2008 programme of development proposed a 32 per cent. uplift above RSS housing levels across the growth point as a whole and a 16 per cent. uplift in Blackpool. The programme of development proposes new housing on a number of urban sites, including the North and South Beach regeneration areas, Talbot Gateway, Squires Gate and Blackpool and The Fylde college, as well as parts of Marton Moss and Whyndyke Farm. However, the Government have always made it clear that any housing proposals in a growth point must be tested through the planning system in the normal way and that the growth point mechanism is not a short cut.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.0/9">The Government have taken quick and decisive action in responding to the challenges facing the house building industry, to keep the industry moving and protect jobs. More than &#163;7.5 billion is being invested over this year and the next to deliver 112,000 affordable homes. That includes the funding announced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-29">29 June</phrase> as part of Building Britain's Future, whereby over this year and the next, another &#163;1.5 billion will be invested to provide an extra 20,000 new affordable homes, of which 13,000 will be for social rent. That is good news for families in housing need, and it is estimated that 45,000 additional jobs will be created in the construction industry and related industries over the three-year construction period. It will enable local authorities to build 3,000 additional homes over the next two years-a fourfold expansion of the scheme announced in the Budget. Like my hon. Friends, I urge the council, registered social landlords and developers in Blackpool to take advantage of the extra money that the Government have made available to give the local development industry a shot in the arm.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.0/10">Once development is back on track, it is the job of Blackpool council to decide where the requirement for additional housing should be met. In working on its new LDF core strategy, the council must decide on the appropriate balance between urban brownfield sites and new greenfield sites. The Government have made it clear to local planning authorities that they should normally use previously developed land first. Neither the council nor the Government should give up on regenerating Blackpool's inner area as an alternative to additional greenfield development.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.0/11">The council is discussing with the Homes and Communities Agency a proposed &#163;35 million package for new housing in the Tyldesley road area of Blackpool. It is also discussing another scheme for the conversion of houses in multiple occupation into apartments. Blackpool faces its own unique housing challenges in its inner area, arising in particular from the high numbers of HMOs and the numbers of vulnerable people whom they attract. The council is working on improving the quality of private landlord management practices and the quality of housing on offer. The Government are working on improving the town's economic base through the regional development agency and the development corporation.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.0/12">While Blackpool council is considering the pattern of long-term development, I am aware that Kensington has submitted an outline planning application to build 584 houses, with associated parking, village green and so on, on part of Marton Moss. My hon. Friend will understand that, as I said, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the planning application. The council has already been directed to refer the application to the Secretary of State, should it be minded to approve it, as it could raise issues of more than local importance. It will then be for the Secretary of State to decide whether to call in the application or to allow the council to proceed to determine it. It is important, therefore, that the Secretary of State be seen to be carrying out his planning responsibilities impartially, and I cannot prejudge the case.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.0/13">My hon. Friend has raised an important issue about the future of Marton Moss. He and my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood are doing a superb job as first-class MPs in speaking up for their constituents and the communities that they serve.</p>

	<p pid="c.272.2/1">I am pleased to have secured this important debate and to know that it will be chaired by your good self, Mr. Cummings, in your usual able manner.</p>
	<p pid="c.272.2/2">I pay sincere tribute to all the men and women who work as probation officers. I say that with some experience. In my former calling as a criminal lawyer, I often found that their intervention could be crucial in turning people round and redirecting them away from an inexorable life as professional criminals. It is not an exaggeration to say that many thousands of young people owe a lot to the probation services for the advice and guidance that they have received. I saw at first hand young people who were heading the wrong way and going down the slippery slope to a life of crime. They were expertly diverted by probation officers, who often went the extra mile and put in huge effort for that purpose. Those people who were going the wrong way are now holding down good jobs, are responsible parents-grandparents even-and have a valuable input into various communities in my constituency. In other words, probation works.</p>
	<p pid="c.272.2/3">We know that the rate of reoffending post a community penalty is considerably less than post release from prison. Probation not only works, but is cost-effective for obvious reasons. It saves the cost both of prosecuting individuals and recommitting them to prison and of the actual offence to society. So, the good sense of committing extra resources to community penalties that are properly supervised by qualified probation officers is clear for all to see.</p>

	<p pid="c.272.3/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman. For the &#163;900 million it costs the UK taxpayer, probation is exceedingly good value. When I put the question about budgets to the Secretary of State on the day before the summer recess, he told me that budgets had grown by 70 per cent. since 1997 but that there were still some cuts pending. Does the hon. Gentleman welcome the fact that only last Thursday there was an announcement that those cuts have been scaled back, and does he expect the Minister to give us a bit more detail as to where the cuts will fall, because that is really important?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-11-04c.272.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" speakername="Elfyn Llwyd" colnum="272"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091104/halltext/91104h0005.htm#09110487000257">
	<p pid="c.272.4/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, and I know that he, like me, takes a great interest in this field. We welcome the partial reversal of the cuts, but I believe that the cuts will still amount to about &#163;24 million. No doubt the Minister will explain further in due course, but I hear what the hon. Gentleman says and he is quite right to raise it at this point.</p>
	<p pid="c.272.4/2">As a last resort before imprisonment, community penalties work. However, what we have found is that the probation service has seen its work load soar over the past few years. For example, in the South Wales Probation Trust area, the number of community service orders rose from 2,760 in 2006-07 to 3,163 in 2008-09, which is an increase of 14 per cent. However, breaches of community penalties in the same period rose by an incredible 73 per cent., from 2,002 individuals to 3,816. In the case of breaches-where a person fails to carry out court-ordered work-the individuals will be warned, and if they are unable to provide a cogent reason or excuse, they may find themselves summoned before a magistrate or judge who will often resentence them for the original or specimen offence and send them to prison.</p>
	<p pid="c.272.4/3">Mike Dunne, secretary of the Gwent and Glamorgan branch of the National Association of Probation Officers said:</p>
	<p pid="c.272.4/4" class="indent">&quot;The planned cuts by the Ministry of Justice will have a significant impact on the ability of the probation service in Wales to work effectively. Napo has been campaigning vigorously to fight these cuts and we have clearly made an impact, as the Minister of Justice announced a reduction in the cut to the overall budget for the Probation Service to &#163;24 m down from a cut of &#163;50 m. We welcome this change, but the proposed cut is still a significant reduction on an already overstretched and overworked workforce.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.272.4/5">The consequences of a reliance on an over-stretched work force are plain for all to see. Monday's report by the chief inspector of probation found very serious failings in the supervision of potentially dangerous criminals. In almost half of the cases that he saw, probation staff fell short of the standard required, which, according to his report, was to ensure that the public in London were protected from criminals with the potential to harm them. The chief inspector found that only 54 per cent. of public protection work reached the required level, which is nine points lower than the score awarded 12 months ago.</p>

	<p pid="c.273.0/1">The inspector's report was in respect of London probation, which is just one of the 42 areas. Obviously, I can deal with that point in my own remarks, but I just wanted to emphasise that that was not a report on the entire probation service.</p>

	<p pid="c.273.1/1">The Minister is right, and I did say that it was London; I was not pretending otherwise. It was in London that the Dano Sonnex matter happened because of lack of supervision. Probation officers did not have the time to devote to that very important work of public protection. Clearly, there have been shortcomings, and I argue that it is to do with work load more than anything else.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-11-04c.273.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1687" speakername="Maria Eagle" colnum="273"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091104/halltext/91104h0005.htm#09110487000260">
	<p pid="c.273.2/1">I just want to clarify the findings of the inquiries following the terrible case of Sonnex. Management failings and an inappropriate allocation of resources in the London probation area led to that case, which is well documented in the reviews that took place and were published after the case came to light.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-11-04c.273.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" speakername="Elfyn Llwyd" colnum="273"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091104/halltext/91104h0005.htm#09110487000261">
	<p pid="c.273.3/1">The Minister is absolutely right, but I, too, am correct in saying that the individual concerned was overworked and could not possibly do the work that she was assigned to do. Therefore, I was right from the beginning. With regard to the findings, I agree with the Minister that they provide a snapshot of London, but I will come to other parts of the United Kingdom later in my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="c.273.3/2">NAPO has discovered that it is not uncommon for staff who are supervising low-risk offenders to have case loads in excess of 100. Those involved in supervising medium and high-risk offenders have case loads in excess of 60. A rough figure for a norm should be 25 to 30. Therefore, it is not rocket science to deduce that staff are under huge strain, and that affects their health, the service and so on. The problem is not about their ability or commitment; it is simply that there are insufficient people on the ground to do the work.</p>
	<p pid="c.273.3/3">The gloomy and rather dangerous situation is likely to worsen as a result of the proposed cuts in budget announced for 2010-11. The probation service faces a cut of 4 per cent. in real terms in 2010-11. Further cuts of at least a similar amount will occur in 2011-12. Such cuts are bound to lead to the loss of posts and curtailment and reduction in the number of offender programmes that the probation service provides. The probation budget will be cut by &#163;24 million in the financial year 2010-11 from an out-turn in the previous financial year of &#163;894 million. However, that is an improvement on the indicative budget, which we heard about in October 2008, with an anticipated cut of &#163;50 million. Therefore, we are grateful for the reduction in the cut, but it is still very serious. NAPO calculates that at least 1,000 people will lose their jobs over the next two years, half of whom will be front-line staff. Currently, there are just over 6,200 qualified probation officers in England and Wales. It is highly likely that the staff lost through natural wastage or voluntary redundancy will be the most experienced. When it happens, that scenario will place untold strain on the service, with potentially serious consequences. It is obvious that we are on the brink of a precipice.</p>
	<p pid="c.273.3/4">Some time ago, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-12">12 October 2009</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" name="Edward Garnier">the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)</phrase> tabled a question to the Minister that read:</p>
	<p pid="c.273.3/5" class="indent">&quot;To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what estimate he has made of the proportion of probation officer time spent on front line work with offenders in each year since 1997.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.273.3/6">The Minister responded:</p>
	<p pid="c.273.3/7" class="indent">&quot;This information is not held centrally by the National Offender Management Service, nor is it held at probation area or trust level.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-10-12.153"><i>Official Report</i>, 12 October 2009; Vol. 121, c. 153W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.273.3/8">Imagine our surprise, then, to find the information in a document that was to hand in December 2008. I understand how such things work; I understand that the Minister signs off parliamentary questions. However, I am afraid that it is an untruth. We can dress it up however we like, but a question was posed in October 2009 about whether the information was available, and the answer-a belt-and-braces answer-was &quot;No, it's not.&quot; But here it is, available from nine months before, in December the previous year. It is all there to be read.</p>

	<p pid="c.274.0/1">I do not like the use of the word &quot;untruth&quot;, and I refute it. The document to which the hon. Gentleman refers was a one-off exercise. It was basically a ring-round to some probation areas to get a snapshot-not statistics that would stand up to any rigorous process of the kind that we expect in our parliamentary answers. Although I accept that there was some information, it was a snapshot. It was certainly not a statistical estimate. On that basis, I refute the idea that I have been telling untruths to Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="c.274.2/1">Well, maybe the Minister unintentionally misled Parliament, if I can put it that way-I think that that is acceptable. But whether or not it is a snapshot, it is quite a bulky document, at 30 pages in length. She could at least have said, &quot;Yes, some work is being done,&quot; and referred the hon. and learned Member for Harborough to the work of this particular delivery plan. Unfortunately, it has come out purely by accident. The existence of the document has only recently been made public. I leave it there. I certainly do not impute any unfair motives to the Minister, but somebody somewhere needs to explain what is going on. I do not lay any blame on her; I appreciate how such things work.</p>
	<p pid="c.274.2/2">The document to which I refer has just been handed down. It shows that the information, albeit a snapshot, is available. The document, entitled &quot;Offender Management Direct Contact Survey of Probation Boards and Probation Trusts&quot;, shows that 24 per cent. of time is spent engaged in direct contact with offenders, either face to face or by telephone, 41 per cent. of time is spent engaged in computer activity, whatever that means-</p>

	<p pid="c.275.0/1">To illuminate slightly for the hon. Gentleman, some of the computer activity referred to includes completing OASys risk assessments of particular individuals. I would call that front-line work.</p>

	<p pid="c.275.1/1">I am sure that is right, and I am glad that the Minister intervened. Some 35 per cent. of time was spent on non-computer activity, such as drafting correspondence and reports, administration and travel. The percentage of time spent with offenders falls to 18 per cent. in north Wales and an incredibly low 13 per cent. in west Mercia. A probation officer who was interviewed said:</p>
	<p pid="c.275.1/2" class="indent">&quot;We should spend more time with offenders. I have been told to spend about 15 minutes with tier 2 and no more than 30 minutes with tier 3/4. The impression I have is for every 15 minutes I spend engaged in face to face contact with offenders, I spend another 15 to 30 minutes recording it&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.275.1/3">It is the old problem of &quot;statistics, statistics&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.275.1/4">NAPO, not surprisingly, believes that it is an extraordinary state of affairs. Information from its members over the past 12 months shows that no more than 15 minutes a week is spent on low-risk offenders, rising to at most 30 minutes with high-risk offenders. In NAPO's view, that is woefully insufficient for the amount of supervision required.</p>
	<p pid="c.275.1/5">The situation is even more serious. Over the past few years, the number of sex offenders housed in hostels has risen sharply. The hostels hold 2,500 offenders, predominantly on parole, and half are now sex offenders. The premises are now taking significant numbers of released terrorists, yet staff ratios have been reduced at night and those working in hostels are less well trained, increasing the risk of public protection compromises.</p>
	<p pid="c.275.1/6">The Prison Governors Association has called for the abolition of sentences of one year or less. Last year, 75,000 people received such sentences. If such a measure were passed, it would ease prison overcrowding by reducing the daily prison population by at least 5,000. However, the probation service could not take them, as it is over capacity, and the vast majority of such offenders are unemployed and would be unable to pay fines. Indeed, early evidence suggests that the amount of fines collected has fallen. It is no doubt linked to offenders' ability to pay and a reduction in the number of enforcement officials. That analysis illustrates that the criminal justice system is beyond capacity.</p>
	<p pid="c.275.1/7">The Government say that the probation service received an uplift of more than 70 per cent. between 1997 and 2006. However, there is no evidence of any increase in the number of trained probation officers. Indeed, since 2007, numbers have been in decline. What happened over that period was a two-thirds increase in the number of middle and senior managers. The truth is that we require more and more from an already overworked probation service for less.</p>
	<p pid="c.275.1/8">The story on recruitment is also depressing. According to NAPO, it costs about &#163;93,000 to train a probation officer for three years. The Government may argue that it costs &#163;74,000, but both figures are high. It is therefore a waste of public funds to train someone without viable employment at the end of that training period. According to the most recent figures, announced last week, 459 trainees are expected to qualify this year. Of those, 59 have already left, 44 will be made redundant, 129 will be given temporary jobs until March and 27 do not yet know their future.</p>

	<p pid="c.276.0/1">That is certainly reflected in the Dyfed-Powys probation service, where seven or eight trainees were trained at great expense and only one was given full-time employment at the end of it. Several were given temporary employment until next March. That is surely a waste of resources that could have been put back into employing trained probation officers who could have coped with the case load a lot better.</p>

	<p pid="c.276.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. He has hit the nail on the head. More to the point, as he knows, courts are being encouraged to consider properly structured and supervised community penalties, but there are fewer people to supervise them.</p>

	<p pid="c.276.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is being very generous in giving way. The figures he quoted are from before the budget allocations. One would hope that they will improve significantly. The money in the budget additional to what the probation service expected is enough to employ 625 probation officers.</p>

	<p pid="c.276.3/1">I hope that the Minister is right, but I have no confidence that the money will end up in the right place. The National Offender Management Service is a huge monstrosity and every right-thinking person thought that it was a waste of time. That huge empire is billowing out and spreading its tentacles all over the place. It was a waste of money from day one and is bound to fail. I suspect it will be reviewed yet again before long.</p>

	<p pid="c.276.4/1">I secured an early debate on the Carter proposals that led to the creation of NOMS. As the hon. Gentleman said, the cost is one of the worst aspects of this issue. The training costs and two years' salary aggregate to a cost of about &#163;100,000 for each trainee probation officer who is lost. That is serious money that could be better deployed to drive down crime in this country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-11-04c.277.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" speakername="Elfyn Llwyd" colnum="277"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091104/halltext/91104h0006.htm#09110487000272">
	<p pid="c.277.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. I am not often accused of understating a case, but perhaps I understated the financial case by saying that training costs &#163;74,000 or &#163;93,000. Perhaps the cost is more than &#163;100,000. That is undoubtedly a significant figure.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.0/2">More than half of this year's trainees will be redundant and have no secure future beyond 2010. That is the pre-budget situation and we will see what happens. According to a parliamentary question in May 2009, seven trainee probation officers in Dyfed-Powys are expected to qualify this year, nine in Gwent, seven in North Wales and 21 in South Wales. Earlier this year, estimates suggested that the seven officers in Dyfed-Powys had been told that there were no vacancies and that any that appeared would be subject to competition. Eight were in the same situation in North Wales, eight in Gwent and 18 in South Wales. We must hope that the partial reversal in the cuts will assist that situation. Even if it does, we are in deep trouble. If the aim is to ensure that we have properly supervised community penalties, we should not be maintaining the status quo, but increasing resources.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.0/3">After I raised concerns over this issue in Parliament earlier this year, I was contacted by several trainees who were bitterly disappointed that, having gone through rigorous training, they would not be offered employment. When Gwenno Jones wrote to me, I wrote to the Justice Secretary to raise the complaint. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-05">5 September 2009</phrase>, I received a response from Lord Bach, the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, on behalf of the Justice Secretary. He thanked me for the letter and wrote:</p>
	<p pid="c.277.0/4" class="indent">&quot;I understand your concerns about the employment prospects for Trainee Probation Officers. Those due to graduate in October 2009 were selected on the basis of workforce planning estimates made by local probation employers in early 2007. This has proved to be too long an interval for an accurate prediction of the current employment situation. This issue will be addressed when the new, more flexible, modular Probation Qualification Framework replaces the Diploma in Probation Studies programme next year.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.0/5" class="indent">The current Trainee Probation Officers were recruited on the basis of a fixed term two year training contract without any guarantee of permanent contracts. In previous years the vast majority of graduates were offered jobs and it is unfortunate that, in common with graduates of all disciplines this year, the TPOs face a challenging employment market.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.0/6" class="indent">The employment situation is being monitored closely and the monthly returns show a steady increase in the number of jobs being offered as a clearing house system takes effect.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.277.0/7">The letter closed with the usual infamous local democracy clause:</p>
	<p pid="c.277.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Decisions about probation staffing levels rests ultimately with the 42 areas and trusts who employ probation staff&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="c.277.0/9">as if they could employ staff with insufficient resources.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.0/10">The Minister said that I had confined myself to the situation in London so I will move on to other areas. In Avon and Somerset, 16 trainee probation officers will not be offered jobs, eight will not be offered jobs in Dorset, nine in Lancashire, nine in Lincolnshire, nine in North Yorkshire, 18 in South Wales and 28 in the West Midlands. In Cumbria, 10 trainees will compete for two posts. In Durham, 10 trainees will not be offered posts after March 2010. In Gloucestershire, 10 trainee probation officers who are qualifying in the autumn have been offered temporary 12-month contracts only.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.0/11">For the sake of the probation service and society, I hope that the Minister was right that things will change because of the change in the budgetary scenario. Whether it costs &#163;93,000 or &#163;100,000, training probation officers and not offering them employment when their services are desperately needed is the economics of the madhouse. In total, it is estimated that &#163;20 million is wasted. At the same time, there have been huge overspends on large centralised projects. The National Offender Management Service headquarters has cost more than &#163;1 billion.</p>

	<p pid="c.278.3/1">The Minister is very tetchy today. I have never been intervened on so many times by a Minister. Perhaps it is a compliment. She is obviously on the back foot, otherwise she would not be jumping up and down. She must be very fit because she has been jumping up and down at an alarming speed.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.3/2">Perhaps I can put it like this: NOMS contains departments that might not be part of the probation service. The NOMS bureaucracy spend increased by &#163;140 million between 2006 and 2009. It is interesting to compare that with the probation budget, which rose by only &#163;29 million in that time. The Public Accounts Committee is taking an interest in the infamous C-NOMIS project, which is three years late and has reached twice its original budget. Had it been in use, it would probably have prevented the Sonnex murders.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.3/3">Sadly, the overall picture being painted of the Ministry of Justice includes the wasting of resources and an unrealistic expectation of the work load that a probation officer can complete. I hope that the Minister will show some good faith and at the least ensure that the 450 recently qualified trainees will be offered posts. It is typical of this Government to try to run everything on the cheap and to squeeze more out of an orange than is possible. The criminal justice system is not far from collapse. I know that as a barrister who appears in court and am not just making it up. The price of failure is complete anarchy. I urge the Government to reconsider the settlement and to ensure that the highly-trained and motivated youngsters we are discussing can go into the work for which they are well qualified. Society would benefit as a result.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-11-04c.278.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" speakername="Neil Gerrard" colnum="278"  time="014:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091104/halltext/91104h0006.htm#09110487000277">
	<p pid="c.278.4/1">This is a useful debate, given the concerns that have been expressed about probation over the past few weeks. No doubt the Minister will refer to the big increases in the probation budget in the past 10 years, and rightly so. There was a 70 per cent. increase in the budget from 1997 to 2007. That is not something that happens by chance. Budget increases of that size happen because Governments decide to put the money in. It is important that we give credit for what has been done on the budget. In addition, there is no doubt that the service's performance, in relation to meeting targets, has been improving, and that it is now doing extremely well. In 2008-09, only one of its service targets was not met, and that was one of a long list of targets.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.4/2">However, as I am sure the Minister knows, and as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" name="Elfyn Llwyd">the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)</phrase> has just described, there are concerns, particularly within the probation service, about what has been happening with budgets and what is going to happen in the next year or two. The Minister went to the National Association of Probation Officers conference in Torquay-I was there the following day-and she will have heard, as I did, some of the concerns expressed by serving probation officers.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.4/3">As I say, the service is doing a good job, and it is important to recognise that, because it gets a bad press. It is inevitable that the press will report cases where something has gone wrong, and that there will not be many press reports describing a case that the probation service has handled well-a case where somebody has been supervised and kept out of trouble. We will inevitably get reports of the cases that go wrong or, to take the example of the Sonnex case, very badly wrong.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.4/4">Of course, we do not want cases to go wrong, but the probation service sometimes deals with some extremely difficult and dangerous people. I would not like to be in the position of some probation officers, who have to make decisions about how dangerous people should be supervised, the risk that they pose and what should be done with them. Some hon. Members might have seen an article in <i>The Guardian</i> last month-I think it was dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-06">6 October</phrase>-where a reporter was given access to a number of meetings, involving probation and prison staff, at which they discussed how to handle people who were about to be released from custody. There are some very difficult and dangerous people to be dealt with and, as I say, I am not sure that I would like to have that responsibility, with the tabloid press breathing down my neck and waiting to see whether I make a mistake.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.4/5">If we consider the core tasks of the probation service and what has happened in the past few years, it is obvious that there has been a big increase in work load. From 2005 to 2007, court reports increased by more than 20,000. Between 1997 and 2007 there was a 36 per cent. increase in the number of cases of supervision in the community. Now, there are well over 200,000 community orders and parole cases being dealt with-there are 240,000-and significant numbers of those people have to be taken back to court or returned to prison because of breaches.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.4/6">There has been a significant increase in the number of recalls to prison, which, again, indicates the work being done by the probation service to track what is happening to the people they are supervising. There are 2,500 people in hostels, half of whom are sex offenders. Practically all the people in hostels who are supervised by the probation service pose some real risk, and need experienced supervision.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.4/7">Probation is not an easy service to work in, or an easy job to do. Over the past 10 years, there has been a big increase in resources, but there has also been a big increase in work load-I do not think that there is any question about that. It depends on exactly which figures we look at, but I get the impression from some of the available statistics that the increase in work load has outstripped the increase in resources.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.4/8">A report produced last year, which I know some hon. Members will have seen, by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies at King's college examined what has happened to probation staffing and work load over the past few years. It found that between the creation of the national probation service in 2001 and 2006-07, the budget had increased in real terms by 21 per cent., which is a significant increase, and that the number of staff had increased by 37 per cent. However, in that same period, the number of fully professionally qualified probation officers had fallen. So although there have been big increases in the number of less qualified staff-probation service officers-and in managerial staff, the overall increase in staff numbers actually masks a significant change in the composition of the work force.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.4/9">During that period, the ratio of offenders to fully qualified probation officers therefore rose from 31:1 to 40:1. We would not see the shift in that ratio if we simply considered total staff numbers, but as far as fully qualified professional staff are concerned, there has been a significant increase in that ratio. I notice that a parliamentary question on the ratio of probation officers to offenders was answered just last month. It was interesting to note the variation from one area to another that was revealed by the answer. For example, in Rutland, Leicestershire, the ratio of offenders to probation officers is 10.5:1, which is the lowest in the country. By the way, that figure relates to all probation staff, not just the fully qualified. The ratio is 10.6:1 in Norfolk, 22:1 in London, 20.4:1 in Greater Manchester and 21.4:1 in Devon and Cornwall, so the issue does not just affect big city areas. There is significant regional variation in those ratios, and that must impact on the work loads in those different areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.4/10">In conversations that I have had in the past few months, particularly with probation officers, it has come through regularly that people feel that their work load is too heavy, and that there are too many relatively inexperienced staff who have to deal with complex and difficult cases. As has been mentioned, from what I know of the Sonnex case, the person who was given the responsibility of dealing with Sonnex was relatively inexperienced and was not given sufficient support and supervision. As the Minister said, there were clearly management failings, but that was the situation in which that probation officer had been left, and it was an extremely difficult position to be in. Probation officers keep telling me that such a scenario is not uncommon, and that too many people are in that situation.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.4/11">There are also concerns about the IT systems; for example, the offender assessment system has been mentioned. Of course, an important part of the work is ensuring that there are appropriate reports and records, but probation officers say that it takes a long time to do a report for a single individual using OASys. They would like it to be streamlined, so that for each case, they can spend less time filling in the necessary data to produce a report through OASys.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.4/12">For many probation staff, the worst thing is the worry about budget cuts. Last week, the Secretary of State announced that the budget for next year will show a smaller reduction than the indicative budget did, so I hope that some of the cuts that we were told about will not happen. In the summer, staff from all over the country came to see us in Westminster, and the Minister came along to one of our sessions. From one region after another, we had reports of cuts, staff going and trainees not being offered jobs, and I hope that some of that will be dealt with by the change to the budget. People have been left feeling very uncertain about their futures-about whether there will be redundancies and about whether trainees will have a job at the end of their training-and it is demoralising for people in any job to feel that degree of uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.4/13">The relationship between the work load and the budget is quite difficult, because although funding for the probation service comes via NOMS, and there are service-level agreements with the different probation areas, the size and nature of the work load is determined not by NOMS, but by the courts and the sentences that they give. It is difficult to strike a balance, which perhaps accounts for some of the regional variations that I mentioned. I appreciate that that causes difficulties, but if we look at where the service is now-at how it performs and at how the people who work in it feel-it is clear that it has been delivering, although it obviously needs adequate funding. More than anything, however, it needs stability, and the people who work in it need to have some confidence about their future. That is partly a matter of budgets, but it is not just about budgets.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.4/14">Another issue is the introduction of the best-value framework. Some people are worried that best value will actually mean privatisation of some of the core work. We discussed that during the passage of the Offender Management Act 2007, and the Opposition Front Benchers' view was that it would be perfectly all right to privatise anything going. The Opposition argued that that should be done at local level, rather than regional or national level, but they had no problems with wholesale privatisation. In our discussions with the Secretary of State, we reached consensus on the point that we should not privatise core probation work. However, the announcements that have been made about best value in the past few months have made staff quite worried that there will be some backtracking, and that &quot;best value&quot; might turn out to mean privatisation by the back door.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.4/15">We know that there are people around who would be quite happy to jump in, and I have real concerns about some of those who are starting to say that they want to be involved in running prisons. Some charities say that they want to do so, but that should not be part of their business. Charities do really good work in the criminal justice system by providing specialised services, such as treatment for drug and alcohol problems, and that is a perfectly reasonable function for them, but I do not want to see them delivering core services. That is a concern, and I hope that the Minister can give us some reassurance, when she replies, on how best value will operate. People are worried about their jobs and scared about what is happening to budgets, and adding the fear that privatisation is high on the agenda will make things worse.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.4/16">I know of people who worked as probation officers, but who left the service because they were unhappy about the direction in which they perceived it to be going and were worried about what their future would be if they stayed in the service. We really cannot afford to lose experienced and skilled people from the service, and some stability and certainty on budgets and job prospects would go a long way towards starting to persuade people that there really is a future for the service in which they have been working.</p>

	<p pid="c.282.0/1">I want briefly to take up where my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase> left off. I am secretary of the justice unions parliamentary group, to which most Members present belong.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/2">The issues before us have been raised constantly in debates over the past decade or so, but I want to start by reassuring the Minister of the commitment of those working in the service to the implementation of the original principles of NOMS, which were welcomed. The objective was a seamless service, in which fully resourced professionals with sufficient IT back-up could deal with an offender through every stage-pre-sentence, sentencing, imprisonment or community service, probation and rehabilitation back into society. That was the model to which everyone right across the service signed up.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/3">From the beginning, however, we expressed concerns about a number of issues. The first was the lack of consultation about the involvement of the probation service in the development of NOMS. At the time, people thought that we were crying wolf, but the Select Committee on Justice report on the role of the prison officer, which has been published in the past week, makes an interesting point relating to NOMS. It quotes a probation officer, Cordell Pillay of NAPO, who reiterated a point that we have made in previous debates-that many people endorsed the idea of creating NOMS, but were critical of the practice. In one of his key criticisms, he said:</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/4" class="indent">&quot;From the outset there was not a clear structure or framework for NOMS, so there is no clarity from the probation perspective and no clarity from the prison perspective...There was no serious planning in relation to it. There was no real consultation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/5">That was one of the issues that we raised from the beginning. Interestingly, the Justice Committee concluded:</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/6" class="indent">&quot;We have seen no evidence that the creation of the National Offender Management Service has achieved the seamless end-to-end management of prisoners that was intended.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/7">That reflects the views of those serving on the front line in the probation service, and we need to address that.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/8">Another issue that we raised early on related to information technology and computer systems, which colleagues have mentioned. In the past week, the Public Accounts Committee has published its report on C-NOMIS-the national offender management information service-which completely endorses the criticisms that we have been raising since the early stages. The fact that the costs escalated from &#163;234 million to &#163;513 million under NOMIS, with delivery planned for 2011, confirms some of the early criticisms that we made. We heard from the unions about their concerns about the lack of involvement and consultation, the lack of proper management of the project and the lack of practical engagement with the staff who would eventually have to implement the system. It is not just a matter of &quot;I told you so&quot;; I mention all the critiques levelled by front-line staff because they have proved remarkably accurate.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/9">Another issue that was raised-it has been raised again today-is the disparity between the Government's figures for the amount that has been invested in the service-the 70 per cent. increase-which we all welcome, and the amount that seems to have been translated into implementation by front-line staff. My hon. Friend mentioned the figures for staff recruitment. Although the argument is that there was a 53 per cent. increase in work load between 1997 and 2007 and a 70 per cent. increase in the budget, the information we have received from the front line, as my hon. Friend said, is that the investment has not produced the fully qualified and experienced staff that the service needs at the very front edge. Again, we need a detailed examination of where the resources have gone.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/10">My colleague, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" name="Elfyn Llwyd">the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)</phrase>, argued that elements of levels and tiers of bureaucracy have been introduced in the service. We have raised such issues before, and sometimes they have been addressed. In the last round of budget reductions or re-examinations in the London service, certainly, a large number in the middle-management tier was taken out, and more money was applied to the front line.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/11">That raises another issue. Apart from the fact that money did not seem to reach the front line in a form that effectively met casework needs, there has been turbulence in budget planning. Speaking as a London Member of Parliament, there was a period when we were having annual meetings with the Minister to resolve the London budget. We were seeing the prospect of trainees not being employed-before other areas, I believe. Only as a result of ministerial intervention on a number of occasions were we able to retreat from the inadequate proposed budget; we then arrived at a situation in which we were not involved with cuts on a scale that we felt would directly impact on service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/12">The same happened nationally this year. We had discussions about the prospect of a &#163;50 million cut-the Minister attended-and then consulted our NAPO members from the probation service. As my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow said, we received representations from area after area about the implications, which demoralised staff, who faced the prospect of trainees not being recruited and the potential that their jobs would be cut. Then, a week ago, it was no longer a &#163;50 million reduction but a &#163;24 million reduction. We are grateful that it is not &#163;50 million, but that demonstrates a lack of consistent planning in budgets and introduces a turbulence in the system that undermines the effectiveness of the staff, and certainly their morale, in a number of areas of delivery.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/13">What is needed now is a short, sharp exercise of standing back to see where we are in relation to the probation service and its budgets and their implementation vis-&#224;-vis investment in front-line staff, and where we are going in terms of support services, in particular information technology. The Government need to get across to staff working in the field that a clear and consistent vision is being introduced in the coming period, that there will be stability and that they will have an important role not just in providing the service but in designing it as well-that they will be listened to. A consistent theme of the representations we received earlier this year, and of more recent statements from NAPO, supported by the other justice unions, is that they do not feel fully listened to in the development of policy and its implementation.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/14">I make this offer on behalf of the justice unions cross-party group: we are happy to organise for the Minister another one of our seminars, in which we stand back and look at where we are. We could invite more front-line representatives to discuss how our budget is translated into real investment in front-line delivery, not just in the coming year but over the forthcoming years as well, how we look at the tiers of management or bureaucracy and whether there is a need for rebalancing from those tiers towards the front line. We could also look at the long-term future in terms of investment in the IT systems that are needed. That might give us an opportunity of restoring confidence, among probation officers in particular, that the Government have a sense of direction, are listening and want to involve the staff we expect to deliver on the front line.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/15">My hon. Friend mentioned some of the hard cases that have been dealt with. We put a burden on such staff, not setting them up to fail, but placing on them some of the hardest burdens of the justice system. At the same time they are vulnerable to criticism in a way that many other professionals may not be, because they are at the sharp end. It behoves us therefore to engage them in a process where we listen to them, so that we can implement the policies at least in the full knowledge of what they are experiencing at the front line.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-11-04c.284.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1497" speakername="Paul Holmes" colnum="284"  time="015:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091104/halltext/91104h0007.htm#09110487000279">
	<p pid="c.284.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" name="Elfyn Llwyd">the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)</phrase>-my apologies if I have mangled the Welsh language-on securing the debate and on having outlined, as did the other speakers, the values of the probation service and the problems that it faces. Those problems are twofold: the cuts in funding of 2.68 per cent. and the increase in case load at the same time. In Derbyshire, for example, the two-year trainees who are approaching the end of their training are effectively being told that there are no jobs for them to move on to. Out of the existing 400 staff, Derbyshire has to lose 30 by March, as well as not being able to take on the trainees who have completed their work.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/2">As we have already heard, the Minister will say that there has been a 70 per cent. real-terms increase in probation funding between 1997 and 2007. That is true enough, but there are two points, which we have already heard discussed. First, we are talking about cuts now, not increases in spending in years gone by. Secondly, when the increases took place after 1997, at the same time there were real increases in case load; the bare case load went up from 159,200 in 1997 to 243,400 in 2007-08. Yes, there were real-terms increases in funding, but there were also real increases in case load, partly because the prison population is up by more than 60 per cent. since 1997-we now lock up more people per head of population than any other country in Europe. That has a concomitant effect on the work of the probation service, with people coming out of prison as well as others being given non-custodial sentences in an attempt to keep them out of our already chock-a-block and overcrowded prisons.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/3">We are, therefore, demanding more of the probation service, not just in basic case load but in terms of the quality of what we now expect it to do with people-the work on monitoring, rehabilitation and community punishment orders that we expect it to deliver. As we have heard a number of people say, probation actually works. We are not defending the existing system just because it exists, but because it works. There are hard statistics to prove that it works.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-19">19 August</phrase> this summer when, according to the press, all MPs were lazing around on a warm beach at exotic locations around the world, I spent the day with the probation service in Derbyshire. I hope that I will be forgiven if a number of my examples are parochial to Derbyshire, but they illustrate the national picture and fit in with the examples that we heard from previous speakers. During that day, which was very full and intense, I spent time with managers, front-line probation officers, victim support staff, community payback staff, education and training and employment staff, the drug and alcohol team, and the accredited programme staff, who deliver behavioural management courses and so forth. It was the works-an incredibly intense day.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/5">One overwhelming message came out of meeting all those people that day. Not once in the entire day did any of the members of staff that I met complain about pay or the usual things that we tend to hear about, rather they emphasised-it shone through in what they were doing-their immense pride in what they were doing. They believed implicitly in the value of their work in benefiting the community and turning people's lives around. They were imbued with a public service ethos, which some journalists and politicians find hard to understand when they see the world only in the light of people being incentivised to do anything if they are in a bonus culture and receive bonus payments.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/6">When I was a teacher, the Government of the day tried to introduce bonuses into teaching-the only way that teaching could be improved was to start offering teachers bonuses and incentives, totally ignoring why so many people had entered a public service profession in the first place. Those probation staff whom I met, across the board reminded me of that over and over again. They were so full of passion for and pride in what they were doing, but frustrated with what they saw was stopping them from doing the job as effectively as they might.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/7">What specific examples did they raise? One that we looked at was the intensive alternatives to custody programme that has been run in Derbyshire. Derbyshire was the first of six pilots to introduce the programme as an experiment. It involves 100 hours of intervention with an offender each week, which is a lot of time to spend with one person; it covers curfew, supervision, education, mentoring, unpaid work and a range of other things appropriate to that individual. It is intensive and involves a lot of staff work, but it is very effective in reducing reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/8">The pilot seems to reduce reoffending, but what is the cost of such staff-intensive work? I asked that question of the Derbyshire probation service, but it did not know the answer at the time. It did some calculations later, and sent me a letter showing the detailed costings. On a like-for-like basis, a 12-month programme for one offender on the intensive alternatives to custody programme would work out at &#163;4,575 a year. The programme is more effective in rehabilitating offenders and stopping reoffending than a prison sentence.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/9">What is the alternative? Derbyshire probation service worked out that a full year's custodial sentence would be equivalent to &#163;28,000 a year, yet a prison sentence would be less effective in preventing reoffending and delivering rehabilitation. Those figures were produced by the probation service. The Prison Reform Trust estimates that a year's custodial sentence can typically cost as much as &#163;39,000, which would be an even starker contrast. However, even the Derbyshire figures show a huge difference in the ratio between the cost of prison and that of intensive intervention; and it can prevent a person from reoffending, get them back into work or education, into housing and whatever else is appropriate, including behaviour management, so that they do not reoffend and cause yet more misery in the community.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/10">On cost grounds alone, it seems madness to endanger such an experiment in favour of the more expensive and less effective custodial sentence. That was the view of the front-line staff at Derbyshire probation service. It has long been the Liberal Democrats' view that prison policy should be based on evidence of what works effectively. That is also the view of that well-known left-winger, the former leader of the Conservative party, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase>, who on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-02">2 November</phrase> published a report saying that prison sentences of less than two years should be scrapped entirely. He went on to explain that if the money was made available, the alternatives would be far more cost-effective and more effective in preventing reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/11">Other examples considered on our day with Derbyshire probation service included the multi-agency public protection arrangements to which Members from other parts of the country have referred. Derbyshire is currently working with 700 sex offenders who were released from prison once their sentences had been completed and with more than 200 violent offenders. The programme started in 2001, and its record of nearly eight years shows that a low percentage of offenders absconds and a low percentage reoffends. They are dangerous people and a threat to the community. They may have come out of prison but they are still a danger; nevertheless, the programme has a high success rate with them. Not only is it cost-effective, but it prevents misery for the community by reducing later reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/12">Community payback, which is now called community punishment, is another non-custodial sentence. I have visited three schemes in and around Chesterfield and seen offenders working in the community. On my latest visit, I spent time in the office talking to the staff who run the scheme. They deal mainly with young people, the unemployed and drug users, although when visiting them on site I have seen people in their 50s and people in employment.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/13">One virtue of community punishment is that it is a step before custody. An offender in work who is given a short jail sentence, which is ineffective in any case, would lose their job and therefore be more likely to reoffend when released. By going through that scheme, such people can keep their jobs and still pay their debt to the community. It is done in a most constructive way, and many in the community really value the work that they do in and around north Derbyshire. It is useful as a way of paying back society, it is useful for justice, and it works for the individual. We should not say that it is perfect; no scheme is. One of the staff told me that he had been working there for 20 years and had seen one man come back eight times, so it clearly does not work for some. What we should do with those constant petty reoffenders is another matter.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/14">I have spent time with all sorts of other groups-the drug interventions programme, the prolific and other priority offender programme, the behaviour management programme, Victim Support, the domestic abuse programme and the offenders into employment programme. The latter was proud of the fact that it had got 378 offenders into employment during the last year. People who have employment on coming out of jail on completion of their sentence are far less likely to reoffend; all the statistics show that. Those programmes work. They all make vital interventions; they all improve quality of life for the community; they all cut reoffending rates; and they do it far more effectively and at a better cost than prison does.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/15">The Derbyshire probation staff know that what they do is effective, a fact that is echoed in other national examples. However, they complain about the self-defeating cuts that they face in funding and staffing, as they will inevitably lead to more reoffending and more problems for the community. This is most certainly one area of public spending that it would be self-defeating and foolish to cut in the years to come.</p>

	<p pid="c.287.2/1">Many, many more, perhaps from the other side of the House in due course.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/2">For the last 102 years, the probation service has worked tirelessly to protect the public and rehabilitate offenders through its effective supervision of those offenders out in the community. It is and always has been a vital part of the criminal justice system. Great credit must go to all those who work so hard in what is often a difficult job, especially as so many of their efforts and achievements are left unsung.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/3">There is no doubt that a service that supervises more than 175,000 new offenders every year, that supervises approximately 200,000 offenders on community sentences each year, that supervises a further 50,000 offenders on licence each year, that provides over 246,000 pre-sentence reports and 20,000 bail information reports, and that supervises more than 8 million hours of unpaid work in local communities is indispensable, worthy of respect, and requires careful management, motivation and intelligent, strategic leadership.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/4">This is a seriously important service, but it is fair to say that it is seriously overstretched. I shall consider what it is achieving. Most crucially, we must look first at reoffending rates. Above all else, the protection of the public and the reduction of reoffending must be the goal of the probation service. There is no doubt that it faces new and more difficult challenges than it did 10 years ago. For instance, violent crime has doubled and drug offences have increased dramatically; those are but two of the serious ones. The probation service cannot supervise offenders minute by minute, every day and night, or guarantee that offenders under their supervision will not reoffend.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/5">With the current reoffending rate at 36 per cent. within one year for community sentences, and at 47 per cent. within one year of release from prison, we are clearly not doing well enough. The latest annual MAPPA figures published this month show an increase in the number of serious further offences committed by the most dangerous offenders-admittedly from a low percentage; but only one is still a serious problem. There has been an increase also in the number of level 2 offenders returned to prison for breach of their licence.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/6">The Government continue to say nothing about level 1 offenders, who make up over two thirds of those covered by MAPPA. They may be the least dangerous, but we are told nothing about them and have reason to believe that they are responsible for more reoffences than other levels of offender.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/7">In taking probation performance as a whole and considering where we might improve it, the hon. Gentleman focused to some extent on funding. Given the current economic climate, that is no small issue. At a time of economic recession, we need to ensure value for money. No public service will be immune from economies, and funding problems will inevitably raise difficult questions. However, value for money and savings in the long-term cannot be bought at the expense of public safety or by putting justice or the running of an effective probation service at risk.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/8">Ministers have claimed that there has been a 70 per cent. increase in probation funding in the past seven or eight years, but the vast majority of that increase has not reached the front line. That seems to have been a common theme in a number of speeches this afternoon, and no doubt the Minister will want to reply to that point. Despite what might have been overall increases in spending, front-line probation services have been struggling for the past 10 years. We would like some clarification from the Minister about this matter. Last week, the Government announced that they would cut the probation budget in 2010-11 by &#163;26 million less than was originally intended. Still, however, savings of &#163;20 million had to be found in 2009-10, and, as has been mentioned, another &#163;24 million will have to be found in 2010-11, equating to &#163;54 million over those two years. To make matters worse, the National Association of Probation Officers estimates that by 2011-so, over the same period-there will be a 6 per cent. rise on the 2008-09 probation numbers of 150,000 people being under supervision. The Minister is looking at me rather incredulously, so we look forward to hearing her reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/9">No one doubts that savings will be necessary in coming years, but it is essential that they are made in the right places and that we understand that the service cannot function without front-line services that are adequately supported. The total case load of offenders being supervised by the probation service rose by 53 per cent. between the end of December 1997 and the end of December 2008, from 159,200 to 243,400, but the number of qualified probation officers increased by only 15 per cent. to 7,120. However, research published by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies in April 2008 showed that between 2002 and 2005 the number of managerial staff increased by 70 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/10">The savings could begin with a slimming of what might be called Government waste. Can the Minister explain where the &#163;54 million that was spent on consultants went and what they were employed for? Until their comments on funding last week in 2008-09, the Government spent &#163;90,000 on training each new trainee probation officer, only to have to tell more than half the group that they will be redundant or will have no secure future beyond March 2010. Of course, we know the sad, sorry tale of the Government's IT project, C-NOMIS-the custody-national offender management information system.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/11">In the past 10 years, the probation service has fallen victim to too many unintelligent reorganisations. The structure, organisation and management of probation services have changed substantially at least three times, but change is not necessarily the same as progress, and the wrong changes benefit no one. Following the latest reorganisation and the creation of the National Offender Management Service, we are left with a NOMS headquarters with only 113, or 3 per cent., of the 4,270 NOMS headquarters staff hailing from a probation, as opposed to a prison, background. I am advised that 98 of those 113 are on secondment rather than being in permanent positions. All that suggests that there is a virtual absence of probation personnel in senior positions in the NOMS hierarchy.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/12">I am acutely aware of the Minister's sensitivity to suggestions that NOMS is an expensive leviathan, and I expect that the Government will argue that much of the budget is money that hitherto would have been included in the separate prisons and probation budgets. Even if one takes that into account, there is still a rather large hole-perhaps as much as &#163;300 million-that one can only assume is accounted for by the massive failure in the IT systems that it has been designing. Also, it is estimated that the ratio of bureaucrats to front-line workers is about 1:3.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/13">The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy mentioned a parliamentary question asked by my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" name="Edward Garnier">the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)</phrase>. The hon. Gentleman considered the reply to be rather inadequate because a survey from within the Department did exist at that time. The Minister has said that that document was quite a cursory snapshot, but there is a lot of serious information and strong opinion within it. The document shows that in some probation areas of England and Wales, officers spend as little as 13 per cent. of their time in direct contact with offenders, and the fact that many officers spend less than a quarter of their time doing face-to-face work comes through in the report quite a lot. It also found that officers in some parts of the country see those who are judged as being at low or medium risk of harming the public for as little as 15 minutes a week.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/14">In that survey, there was a tone of anxiety, if not complaint, particularly about the amount of time that officers have to spend on paperwork. One was quoted as saying:</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/15" class="indent">&quot;The impression I have is that for every 15 minutes I spend engaged in face-to-face contact with offenders, I spend another 15 to 30 minutes recording it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/16">Will the Minister commit to offer to the House not only the full publication of that survey-with all the qualifications and, perhaps, inadequacies that she has mentioned-but a written response containing her assessment and explanation of what is important within it? The whole point of the probation service is that it should be looking people in the eye and trying to help them.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/17">Furthermore, the tragic case involving Dano Sonnex illustrated that some probation officers are supervising more than 100 offenders at any one time. A recent written parliamentary answer from the Minister admitted:</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/18" class="indent">&quot;There is no specified maximum number of offenders that an officer may supervise.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-10-12.154"><i>Official Report</i>, 12 October 2009; Vol. 497, c. 154W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/19">I can accept that answer, but will the Minister give us a feeling of what she thinks is an ideal number that they could and should supervise? I think we would all like to reduce officer case loads by redistributing resources to the front line. The Conservatives would like a review that would minimise the time spent on form-filling, ensure that resources follow risk and ensure that the amount of time spent face to face with offenders is maximised as far as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/20">When the prison estate becomes overcrowded, there is a clear and obvious physical display of that, and some limitations, but the same is not true of probation services. When the probation service is overburdened and overworked, as the Prison Service is, in some respects, there is no early-release operation safeguard and there are not the same controls of discipline and prison walls. Overcrowding in the probation service can result in cases such as that of Dano Sonnex and could lead to an increase in reoffending on our streets. More offenders are being supervised by the probation service than there are offenders in prison, but there are far fewer staff. Also, resources are often focused in the wrong place and there is too much emphasis on bureaucracy and process instead of the better public protection that would come with more face-to-face contact.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.2/21">The answer to that problem is not simple, short or straightforward, but we can at least try. It is vital to allocate resources intelligently, focus on front-line work, minimise reorganisation and run simple but effective IT systems, but what we need overall is intelligent, strategic leadership from a Government who value the probation service and the vital role that it has to play in reducing reoffending and keeping the public safe.</p>

	<p pid="c.291.0/1">I am glad to have made the hon. Gentleman's day, but he has made mine as well, so our debate in this Chamber has been mutually beneficial. We have had a good debate about some extremely serious issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.291.0/2">One thing has come across overwhelmingly in everyone's contribution: Members on both sides of the House appreciate the work that probation officers and others who work for our probation service do in all our constituencies and across the land. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> made absolutely clear, sometimes it really is a thankless task that they undertake on all our behalves. They do not get thanked enough when they do brilliantly well, as they usually do, and when something goes wrong it is frequently on the front pages of the newspapers and lynch mobs want to blame someone. I realise, as do all Members who have spoken in the debate, that that makes for a difficult working environment and a difficult job generally. We thank them for the work that they do, because it is generally absolutely brilliant; we all agree on that, if on nothing else. The 42 areas that comprise the national probation service, whether trusts or area probation boards, are generally high-performing organisations, and their performance has been improving over the years.</p>
	<p pid="c.291.0/3">I want to say something about the Sonnex case and London Probation, because that was a particularly appalling instance of failings adding up and resulting in an absolutely terrible situation. We know that Sonnex could and should have been in custody at the time he committed those terrible murders, and that the individual from London Probation who was wrongly charged with looking after him was far too inexperienced to do so. No blame is attached to that individual, as was made absolutely clear at all times in the reviews and reports that were published. Andrew Bridges' report, to which the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy referred, made it absolutely clear that there were serious management failings in London Probation at the time, so much so that the gentleman in charge of that organisation felt the need to resign.</p>
	<p pid="c.291.0/4">London Probation now expects to recruit 120 new probation officers, 100 of whom were being recruited anyway, with money that London Probation already had. One of the biggest concerns highlighted in the Sonnex case related to the poor allocation of resources among the different parts of London Probation that needed them. The problem was caused not by a lack of resources, but by poor management and failure to deal with issues of concern, such as the high work loads of inexperienced officers. London Probation is beginning to make significant improvements, as we expect it to do, so I would hate the whole service to be judged by that set of horrendous failings, which have been acknowledged all round, and which will be put right in London for the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.291.0/5">The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy referred to budgets, and to the consequence of the expectation, which existed until late last week, that the indicative budgets that probation areas had been working to would become next year's actual budgets. It is now known that that is not the case; an additional &#163;26 million has been found, which means that the reduction in budgets for next year across the entire probation service will be 2.68 per cent. The precise allocations from the director of offender management to each probation area or trust have not yet been determined and are being worked out, but we will want to ensure that the money goes from the centre to the front line.</p>
	<p pid="c.291.0/6">There is enough money in the budget to employ 625 probation officers and offer permanent opportunities to all the trainees, about whom Members have expressed concern; they gave the figures from their areas. Some of the people who have been offered only temporary contracts ought now to see those translated into proper, full-time employment opportunities. As all Members who spoke in the debate have suggested, it is nonsense that someone should be trained at a cost of &#163;94,000, and then find that their services are not needed because of budgetary constraints. I can make it clear that that kind of nonsense will not occur under the new training arrangements, because people will not be offered training contracts without a guaranteed job. I hope that the extra resources that we have found for probation areas this year will ensure that those people are able to employ the skills that they have acquired during training.</p>
	<p pid="c.291.0/7">Several Members referred to the 70 per cent. increase in probation resources since 1997. That figure is correct; it is a 70 per cent. increase in real terms, taking account of inflation. There has also been a 53 per cent. increase in the work load, a point to which several Members referred. There has been an overall increase of 49.3 per cent. in the total number of probation staff in post over the same period, and an increase of 15.5 per cent. in the total number of probation officers in post. There have been some real increases, and that is without taking into account the number of probation service officers, which has been subject to a bigger increase. That budget increase has been translated into real and significant increases in front-line staff who are there to do the job. We want to ensure, however, that the money that we provide goes, as far as is possible, to the front line.</p>
	<p pid="c.291.0/8">My hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington asked me to come to one of the justice unions group's seminars, and I would be happy to do that-I do not think that I have ever refused to do so. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I meet the probation trade unions together monthly, and I meet them more frequently than that. I am always open to hearing from trade unions that are representing staff, and from staff directly, if Members wish me to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.291.0/9">I welcome my opposite number, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1795" name="Alan Duncan">the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan)</phrase>, to his new post as shadow Prisons Minister-it will be a long stretch, with tough work to do. He and several other Members referred to the proportion of time that probation officers and front-line staff spend in front of computers. I am not willing to accept that all the time spent in front of computers is not front-line work that reduces reoffending, because some of that time is used to make proper records, which we would all expect them to do, of the work that they do face to face with the offenders whom they manage. That time is also spent completing the risk assessment process using the OASys tool, which is the basis of the system whereby the service as a whole assesses the risks posed by individuals who are being supervised; that is an essential part of the job.</p>
	<p pid="c.291.0/10">In answer to a point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington, I accept that OASys is deeply frustrating to fill in and far too slow. We are looking with our staff at ways of improving and streamlining the process, and we hope to be able to make progress on that. However, it is important that we do not simply say that any time spent in front of a computer is wasted and somehow means that the system is bureaucratic. The work done on computer is a fundamental part of the work that probation staff and officers do, so we cannot promise to remove it completely.</p>
	<p pid="c.291.0/11">The hon. Members for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy and for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes) referred to the situation in Wales and Derbyshire respectively. I accept that the picture can be different in each local area, and that the number of fully qualified probation officers will have decreased slightly in some areas and increased in others. I do not think that it is for me, the Minister sitting in Whitehall, to determine precisely how resources that go to the front line are used. That is why those areas are run locally. It is important that we send the signal that we want the additional money being provided to go to front-line services. I am sending that signal strongly. We certainly want to ensure that over the next year, the extra money-the money that is over and above what was expected-is used on front-line services, to employ trainee probation officers and ease some of the work load pressures to which Members have referred. I am afraid that I do not have time to mention all the other points-</p>

	Pupil Funding (Haringey)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-11-04c.294.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1641" speakername="Lynne Featherstone" colnum="294"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091104/halltext/91104h0009.htm#09110487000287">
	<p pid="c.294.1/1">I am extremely grateful to have secured this important debate, the outcome of which is so vital to children in Haringey, and I am delighted to appear before you this afternoon, Mr. Cummings.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/2">What is the extent of the problem that I have brought here today? In Haringey schools, children get nearly &#163;1,200 less per head-per head-than children in neighbouring boroughs such as Hackney, Islington and Camden. The differential is partly caused by having to pay inner-London pay scales, which are higher, but receiving only outer-London per pupil funding, which is lower, yet Haringey shares its character mainly and most closely with Camden, Islington and Hackney. It faces the same kinds of challenges and costs, yet those boroughs get inner-London per pupil funding to meet their needs, but Haringey does not. Why? How is that fair, when the challenges are so similar? Our teachers rightly deserve the inner-London pay scale, but Haringey also deserves the inner-London per pupil funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/3">When I brought the matter to the attention of the Prime Minister at Prime Minister's questions, he agreed that there was an anomaly that needed to be looked at, but that was before the last funding review, when our children were, on average, only &#163;736 adrift. The gap worsened to more than &#163;1,000 after the last review, which changed nothing for Haringey.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/4">Many local authorities could make a similar argument and say that their funding is less than their neighbour's. In fact, Haringey receives, on average, &#163;845 more per pupil than the Minister's constituency of Kingston upon Hull, North, so no doubt the Minister could make an argument about unfairness, but that is not the argument I am making. This is not a crude argument about them getting more than us, or more than me. All hon. Members could no doubt make a good case for better funding for their schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/5">This debate has been requested because the structural problem in school funding budgets means that Haringey schools do not receive funding that reflects their needs, and that is having an impact on children's education in both the east and west of the borough. It is a historical problem: it is a legacy from Greater London council days, when Haringey was divided into two education authorities, inner and outer London.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/6">Even under the area cost adjustment, which is a measure aimed at ending unfair school funding disparity, Haringey loses out. The ACA formula is supposed to give more funding to areas that have higher labour costs, but it has not been used to help Haringey, even though Haringey has the same ACA factor as Enfield, which pays outer-London staff rates. Bizarrely and inexplicably, boroughs such as Kingston and Richmond upon Thames, which also pay outer-London staff rates, still get 7 per cent. more from the ACA than Haringey.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/7">In 2007, Haringey was ranked as the fifth most deprived London borough by the Government, yet it was 15th of the 33 boroughs receiving the highest level of per pupil funding. Everyone agrees that education is the key to addressing deprivation, yet even if we look at the most generous interpretation of the differences, compared with the 10 inner-London boroughs, Haringey received &#163;757 less than the average in 2008-09. This year, the gap increased to &#163;800, and next year it will grow further to &#163;846. That is if one takes the most generous view of the situation.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/8">If we move away from averages and look at direct comparators with the neighbours who are most like us, we find that in 2008, Haringey received &#163;1,183 less per pupil than Hackney. This year, it will receive &#163;1,248 less, and next year the gap will grow to &#163;1,318. Those are not normal gaps. I have heard many Members discuss differentials in their area, but I have never heard of any in that league.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/9">If Haringey had received the same funding as Hackney, which, as I said, is a borough with similar demographic and educational challenges, its schools would be &#163;39.8 million richer this year. Indeed, based on official growth figures for 2008-11, Haringey schools would be approximately &#163;120 million better off if they received the same funding as Hackney. Per pupil, we get &#163;4,987. Neighbouring authorities get more: Hackney, &#163;6,170; Camden, which is even more like Haringey, &#163;6,161; and Islington, which is still more like Haringey, &#163;5,812. Add the ACA, and each Hackney child gets 24 per cent. more funds than a Haringey child.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/10">What a huge difference it would make if we had fairer funding. We would be looking at 15 extra teachers in each of our 66 schools. Haringey currently has 1,500 teachers; the &#163;39 million differential would deliver 1,021 more teachers. That is a staggering difference, and what a difference it would make to our children.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/11">What is the effect on Haringey of this problem? Because of the legacy from GLC days, Haringey teachers are paid at inner-London rates, and I support their receiving more. They face many of the high costs that merit higher funding-not just because of the challenges in Haringey but, most important, the high housing costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/12">Comparing the Government pay scale for inner and outer London, inner-London teachers are paid, on average, 4.5 per cent. more than their outer-London counterparts. At the top end of the scale, that means that a head teacher will cost &#163;4,018 more in basic salary terms, and even more when national insurance and pension contributions are included. Haringey reported that in 2008-09 it employed 1,500 teachers. From Department for Children, Schools and Families figures in 2006, the average salary for a Haringey teacher was &#163;38,950, or &#163;1,330 more than the London average.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/13">If we use a specific example and make a comparison with Enfield, a neighbouring borough to the north, in 2006, the average Enfield teacher cost &#163;36,480-&#163;2,470 less than Haringey, or 6.8 per cent. On a rough calculation, Haringey has to spend &#163;3.7 million more than Enfield on teachers, but that factor is not taken into account in the current funding structure. That is a significant sum in itself, but the real harm is done by the recognition that the Government give to Haringey as an area of need. They count it as inner London when it comes to staff costs, but not when it comes to per pupil funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/14">Without doubt, Haringey's teachers need and deserve the higher rate of pay, and I trust that the Minister would not for a moment consider that the answer is to take away their inner-London pay rate. The real answer is to give Haringey inner-London per pupil funding, and I am sure she knows that that is the only fair way to meet the needs of children's education in Haringey.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/15">There is real evidence of the impact that the lower level of funding is having. For example, information obtained by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" name="David Laws">the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase> under the Freedom of Information Act put Haringey as the London borough with the highest number of schools-27, or almost one third of all our schools-predicted to end the year in deficit.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/16">I have been engaging with local teachers and parents and the unions on this topic. I have encouraged them to describe the effect of the funding shortfall, and I would like to quote a few of the responses. I was copied into a letter to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills from a board of governors in my constituency. It states:</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/17" class="indent">&quot;If Haringey was fairly funded, our school could afford to provide more books, more equipment, more resources, more computers, our classrooms would not leak when it rains, the list is endless.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/18">That is from Rokesly infant and junior school's governing body.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/19">This is from the chair of the governors of Earlsmead primary school:</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/20" class="indent">&quot;The wards we serve are among the most deprived in the country, with high unemployment, poor housing stock, temporary accommodation and unusually high levels of pupil mobility. We are rightly proud of the achievements of our pupils and staff but we could offer so much more for these young people and their families if we had fair funding.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/21">I received an e-mail from someone who was in the health part of a child protection team in Haringey. She said that Fortismere school in Muswell Hill had to cut its truancy monitoring officer in 2007-08, and hence children who were truanting were missed, which was a great concern in relation to the protection of vulnerable children. That health consultant/paediatrician said that children who miss school may be absent for a variety of problems, including learning difficulties, bullying, problems at home and emotional difficulties, but if the school does not even realise that they are missing or absent, those difficulties cannot be caught, addressed and picked up in time. The failure of monitoring was blamed on financial pressures by the school, which said, when approached about it, that it had to cut that post.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/22">The head of Woodside high school in Hornsey and Wood Green was quoted in <i>The Guardian</i> in September, saying that to stave off a deficit, she had not replaced members of staff this year, including a deputy head, but that even so she is still facing a shortfall of &#163;500,000 next year.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/23">Local teachers have achieved a fantastic amount in raising standards in our borough and they are to be applauded for their achievement in the face of such funding adversity. They rightly deserve inner-London pay scales and they work miracles against one of the most difficult, demanding backdrops. Nevertheless, Haringey performs significantly below the national average. I have no doubt that that gap could have been narrowed by our brilliant teachers if the funding gap had been reduced.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/24">In 2008, 59.7 per cent. of Haringey pupils received five or more A to C GCSEs, compared with a London average of 65 per cent. Other indices show that Haringey is falling behind national trends. In 2007, primary class sizes were larger than the London or national averages and, where national trends showed falling class sizes, in Haringey they rose. University uptake has increased at well below the London average, at 1.7 per cent, compared with 6.7 per cent. across the capital.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/25">What is the solution? Each time I mention unfair funding in Haringey, Ministers answer by pointing to the dedicated school grant area review, which is currently taking place. However, we urgently need interim arrangements. With each passing day, Haringey schools are &#163;109,778.21 worse off compared with Hackney. That differential is there every single day. The scale of the underfunding is so large that I urge the Government not to wait until September 2011, when the review will be implemented. I would like the Minister to commit to emergency funding for 2010-11, so that our schools do not fall further behind.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/26">I have been encouraging all local stakeholders to take part in the dedicated school grant area review, in the hope that our voices will be heard and we will not be ignored. Can the Minister give categorical assurance that Haringey will be in a better financial position at the end of the review? I ask because that was not so at the end of the last review, and thus far I have not succeeded in getting such an assurance from the Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/27">A review was announced in July 2005 for the current 2008-11 funding arrangement, so despite the need level we were ignored last time and our situation worsened, as I have said, from a &#163;736 differential to one of well over &#163;1,000. In a written statement to the House in July 2005, the then Secretary of State for Education and Skills pledged that as part of that review the Government would</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/28" class="indent">&quot;replace the existing distribution methodology with a fairer formula&quot;.-[<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2005-07-21.136"><i>Official Report</i>, 21 July 2005; Vol. 436, c. 136WS</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/29">However, in this 2008-11 period Haringey's per pupil funding only increased at 12 per cent.-below the national average of 13.1 per cent. and a London average of 13 per cent. To us, that is evidence of the previous review's failing to address the specific issues that affect fairer funding for Haringey. Although Haringey was only 1 per cent. and 1.1 per cent. behind those other averages, it started from such an unfair base that we were not getting closer, but moving further apart.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/30">Having a representative from Haringey on the review board would have been one positive way to give us some reassurance about the review's work. I have written on numerous occasions to, and raised the matter directly twice with, the former Schools Minister, but, sadly, my request for Haringey to be represented has been refused. I ask the Minister to reconsider that request, given that Haringey is a special case. I also find it strange that the one representative body not included on the review panel is the National Union of Teachers.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/31">I assure the Minister that this is a cross-party issue. Although I speak as the Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Hornsey and Wood Green, the issue and the campaign are supported by the Minister for Higher Education and Intellectual Property, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1882" name="David Lammy">the right hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Lammy)</phrase>, the Labour leadership on Haringey council, the Liberal Democrat council group, obviously, as well as countless teachers, governors, heads and Haringey NUT, which is here today-and, of course, parents of children at schools in the borough.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/32">In conclusion, I ask the Minister four definitive questions. First, although the Government clearly recognise the high level of need and the challenges in Haringey and direct it to pay our school teachers at the higher inner-London rate, why do they not award them the inner-London per pupil funding? I have never understood why we are considered needy when it comes to teachers but not needy in respect of funding. Secondly, why do the Government not apply the area cost adjustment to Haringey fairly to adjust the unfair funding situation we have found ourselves in?</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/33">Thirdly, although the Minister will undoubtedly say that she cannot prejudge the findings of the dedicated school grant review, given that this unfair funding has gone on for some years and civil servants have clearly not seen fit to do anything about rectifying the situation, and may once again fail to address it in the current DSGR, as happened with the last review, I ask the Minister to put on the record today the case that she will make to the review for Haringey to get fair funding. I am asking for her to make our case for us, as a special case, and asking how she will do so, since we are not to have a representative on the review.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/34">Fourthly, and lastly, the review will not report until late 2010 and its findings will not be implemented until 2011. By then, Haringey will have more problems and more schools in deficit than anywhere else in London. Given that this unfair funding is now clearly causing real damage, will the Minister commit to making an interim bridging fund of &#163;1,000 per Haringey child until the funding anomaly is corrected in the review?</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/35">I look forward to the Minister's answering those four simple questions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-11-04c.298.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1647" speakername="Diana Johnson" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families"  colnum="298"  time="016:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091104/halltext/91104h0009.htm#09110487000288">
	<p pid="c.298.0/1">I hope that my response will cover the four questions that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1641" name="Lynne Featherstone">the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone)</phrase> asked at the end of her contribution. I congratulate her on securing this debate. She has raised the topic several times, and my Department takes it seriously.</p>
	<p pid="c.298.0/2">It is essential that every school receives sufficient funding not just to ensure that their pupils receive the necessary support to learn, but to give teachers the correct amount of pay for their services. I want to ensure that all schools receive the right funding for their circumstances, including Haringey. As the hon. Lady knows, the matter has been the subject of much correspondence, and a question to the Prime Minister. It has resulted in strong lobbying from her, the Minister for Higher Education and Intellectual Property, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1882" name="David Lammy">the Member for Tottenham (Mr. Lammy)</phrase>, and the leader of Haringey council, Councillor Claire Kober. My right hon. Friend has requested a meeting with me, to which I have agreed, and the hon. Lady's debate today provides a further platform for this important issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.298.0/3">On school funding, I want to emphasise the unprecedented amount of investment that the Government have put into schools to address decades of under-investment. Between 1997 and 2010, national revenue funding was increased by &#163;2,410 per pupil, from &#163;1,808 to &#163;4,218 in 2010. We are continuing to ensure that that investment is built on to provide schools with the correct funding for their pupils and staff. That is why we introduced the dedicated schools grant in 2006, which changed how each local authority is funded for the schools in their area. That amount was calculated by the spend plus model, which took the per pupil spend by each local authority in 2005-06, and applied an increase to it. The model was used again in 2006-07 and 2007-08, and it has provided stable and predictable funding levels for all local authorities. That is why, following significant consultation, it continued to be the model from 2008 and will be until 2011.</p>
	<p pid="c.298.0/4">The fact that Haringey receives money for outer-London weighting but must pay its teachers inner-London weighting puts it in a difficult position. The issue is not new, as the hon. Lady said. Haringey has paid inner-London weighting for teachers since the 1970s, and its current funding levels reflect how much it was spending in 2005-06. The significant changes in the way that local government is funded have ensured that Haringey receives substantial funding support. Its funding will continue to rise and, by 2011, will have increased by 12 per cent. from 2008-from &#163;4,987 to &#163;5,364 per pupil in 2010-11. However, we recognise that with that increased funding we need to ensure that there is still a focus on pupil characteristics and their needs. We want to reach a funding formula that distributes funding based on the need of each school and local authority, rather than on historical spend. That is why we are undertaking a review of how the dedicated schools grant is distributed.</p>
	<p pid="c.298.0/5">A key issue that we are considering is the area cost adjustment, which the hon. Lady mentioned. Haringey is one of six London authorities-the others are Barking, Brent, Ealing, Merton and Newham-that pay teachers inner-London pay but are in outer-London ACA bands. We commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to do extensive research to support the review, and an area that it explored was the ACA. Its research was published in the summer and proposed four options for the ACA: an approach based on the general labour market in each area; an approach based on the cost of living and house prices in particular; an approach based on the specific costs that local authorities and schools face in employing teachers; and a mix of the general labour market and specific cost approach. We are exploring each of those possibilities, but I cannot confirm any choice at this time. There are pros and cons in all approaches and we shall publish our consultation in January, but I want to reassure the hon. Lady that we are bearing in mind the issue of the funding for Haringey when we consider the options.</p>
	<p pid="c.298.0/6">When my officials established the formula review group, they worked closely with the Local Government Association to ensure that a large mix of representatives from different councils was in the group. With that approach, a national view could be obtained and potential impacts on the range of local authorities considered. There is a representative from London Councils in the group, and I believe that the issue in London will be represented fully. No individual authority is represented and I do not believe that an exception should be made for Haringey. That is not to say that we did not take individual local authorities' views into consideration.</p>
	<p pid="c.298.0/7">As the hon. Lady will be aware, the head of school funding from the Department for Children, Schools and Families attended the Haringey schools forum conference last year to hear the forum's opinions on the subject. Over the summer, we encouraged interested parties to comment and contribute to the review. We made it known through our website and interaction with partners that we were open to receiving papers from those interested in the review for consideration by the formula review group.</p>
	<p pid="c.298.0/8">I want to explain why the NUT is not in the group. The Government's preferred method of engaging with trade unions is through the work force agreement monitoring group, and unfortunately the NUT is not in that group because it has not signed the work force agreement.</p>
	<p pid="c.298.0/9">I am conscious that time is ticking by. The hon. Lady referred to interim measures that could be brought in now. It is important to say at this point that I understand that the number of schools in deficit in Haringey in 1999-2000 was 28, but in 2007-08 that number had reduced to 15. I point that out just for information. The issue faced by Haringey is a long-term one and we are considering, as I have set out, what to do for the future. However, we are not in a position at this stage to make any additional funding available in the meantime.</p>
	<p pid="c.298.0/10">In early 2007, we consulted on the school funding arrangements for 2008 to 2011, which we published before our announcement for the settlement in November 2007. We received a clear message that the stability and predictability of the spend plus method was right for this period, but that we should carry out a review. It would not be right to reopen the funding settlement now, after we have made it clear to all local authorities that we will not-giving them confidence that they can plan within their means. To reopen the settlement would destabilise the system and we will not do that. Haringey has had, like all other local authorities, an indicative budget for the three years since 2007 to enable it to plan.</p>
	<p pid="c.298.0/11">I commend the hon. Lady for her proactive role in initiating today's debate. It is on an issue affecting other local councils, and we are working to ensure that these matters are considered and to see whether a suitable solution can be put into practice. It is essential that every local authority receives the right amount of funding to support its schools. Through the work that we are carrying out in the dedicated schools grant review with our formula review group, we are ensuring that that need will be met.</p>

	Selective Licensing Schemes
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-11-04c.301.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2026" speakername="Phil Wilson" colnum="301"  time="016:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091104/halltext/91104h0010.htm#09110487000290">
	<p pid="c.301.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cummings. The issues that lie beneath the surface of this subject are of great concern for many of my constituents. I believe that the need to extend selective licensing has both positive and negative connotations. Selective licensing schemes have been introduced in several areas of the country and are established where there is low take-up of housing, a high proportion of private landlords, and antisocial behaviour. There are two schemes in my constituency: one is in Dean Bank in Ferryhill and the other is located in a part of Chilton. The two villages are about a mile apart and are former coal-mining communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/2">Both schemes have been established for more than a year and were made possible by the Housing Act 2004. Schemes need first to be sanctioned by the Secretary of State. The powers under the Act are primarily intended to address the impact that poor-quality private landlords and their antisocial tenants can have on the wider community. If a local authority designates an area as subject to selective licensing, all the private landlords in that area must obtain a licence, and if they fail to achieve acceptable management standards, the authority can take enforcement action.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/3">I have said that selective licensing schemes have both negative and positive connotations-negative because the perception is that the area has antisocial behaviour problems, but positive because the local authority and community want to sort out the problems. Other constituents, in Trimdon Station, and a group in Chilton want the scheme extended to their streets, because they believe that selective licensing offers protection. I believe that the initiative does that, but it is still early days to see how successful the original schemes have been, although evidence from the agencies involved shows that progress is being made.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/4">During the summer recess, I attended many meetings with residents, the police, environmental health officers and local government officers about problems arising from antisocial behaviour and unkempt residential properties. I met residents in Dean Bank, Chilton and Trimdon Station. Many were angry. They felt isolated and powerless to deal with the problems that confronted them in their everyday lives in their communities. There were major similarities in the situations faced by all those residents. They all lived in former colliery terraced housing, where private landlords owned many of the properties. Many of them were absentee landlords who did not seem to care who they were letting their properties to or what those people got up to. As a consequence, antisocial behaviour and a local environment that was growing dishevelled became a major problem. Once-proud communities felt threatened and not in control.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/5">The problem in Dean Bank is in an area where selective licensing is in place and which is dominated by terraced housing. In Chilton, the problem was situated away from the selective licensing scheme area in the village and was focused on the Arthur street, Albert street and Prospect terrace area of the village. All three streets have early 20th-century terraced housing. In Trimdon Station, the problem is also focused on three streets: Station Road East, Station Road West and St. Aidan's terrace.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/6">The history of the areas is similar. We are talking about areas of early 20th-century terraced property, with low demand. Owner-occupiers move out and housing prices stagnate, offering investment opportunities for private landlords. Problem tenants move in, standards decline and then there are empty properties and house prices go down. In a nutshell, that is the history that residents have lived in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/7">To show some evidence of that, I asked Durham county council to provide me with statistics on the make-up of the ownership in the three areas. The statistics showed that of the 1,082 properties in question, 408, or 38 per cent., were held by private landlords. Of those, 51 per cent. lived outside County Durham or lived abroad. In some streets, such as Davy street in Dean Bank, 53 per cent. of the houses were owned by private landlords, the majority living outside County Durham. In St. Aidan's terrace in Trimdon Station, 11 of the 25 terraced properties were owned by private landlords, the majority living outside the county. In Arthur street in Chilton, 50 per cent. of terraced properties were private lets, again with the majority of landlords living outside the county.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/8">The county council listed for me the reported problems, which included, for example, groups congregating on the streets drinking alcohol, fighting, criminal damage, rubbish accumulating in backyards, unsightly properties and poor property conditions. The problems seem to be emanating primarily from properties that are privately let.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/9">I believe that the relative cheapness of the terraced housing in question has attracted a high proportion of private landlords to those three villages. Regionally, about 8 per cent. of the housing stock is privately rented, although nationally the figure is about 13 per cent. In the area around Sedgefield it is 5.5 per cent., but in the areas of Chilton, Dean Bank and Trimdon Station, 38 per cent. of private properties are privately let, the majority by landlords who do not live in County Durham, let alone in those villages. Antisocial behaviour is a significant problem for local residents, and is higher there than in the surrounding areas. That link needs greater attention. How can a landlord who lives in another part of the UK, or abroad, care about the community in which his property is situated? On balance, I do not think that he can.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/10">That does not mean that all private landlords are bad-I do not believe that for a minute. However, there must be a problem at that end of the privately rented sector if it is deemed necessary to have selected licensing schemes that are mandatory for the landlord to sign, and through which fines of &#163;5,000 can be imposed on a landlord who does not follow the rules.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/11">Selected licensing places a duty on private landlords to act responsibly. Part 3 of the Housing Act 2004 provides that the local authority may declare a licensing scheme for privately rented accommodation in an area, as long as certain conditions are met. The area must be, or be likely to become, an area of low housing demand, and it must have a significant level of privately owned houses that are let on short-term arrangements. Furthermore, the local housing authority must be satisfied that the introduction of such a scheme, together with other measures, would lead to an improvement in the social or economic conditions in the area. Such a scheme could be used in an area that is experiencing significant or persistent problems caused by antisocial behaviour, and where the private landlords are not taking appropriate action to combat the problem, and in places where the local housing authority is satisfied that the scheme's introduction, together with other measures, would lead to a reduction or an elimination of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/12">Before declaring a selective licensing area, the local housing authority must consider whether other courses of action that could deal with the issues effectively have been tried. It must ensure that the scheme is consistent with its housing strategy and its approach to homelessness, empty properties and antisocial behaviour. It must also consult landlords, tenants and residents associations.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/13">In an area with a licensing scheme, most private landlords or management companies would be required to obtain a licence in order to let or manage residential property. The mandatory licence conditions would require the holder to meet the following conditions: to take reasonable steps to deal with antisocial behaviour; to provide annually a gas safety certificate to the local housing authority where applicable; to keep furnishings and electrical appliances in safe condition; to keep smoke alarms in good working order; to supply tenants with written terms of occupation; and to demand references from prospective tenants. The local authority may also set any other conditions that it deems necessary.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/14">If the licence holder commits an offence or is in breach of the licence conditions, they can be fined a maximum of &#163;5,000. Non-compliance would also allow the local housing authority to revoke the licence. The LHA may apply for an interim management order in respect of a licensable property that remains unlicensed. That would last for a period of 12 months, and a final management order must be applied for if the LHA still feels that it is unable to grant a licence. Individual problems at an address inside or outside a licensing area would be addressed by the use of a single interim management order. The licence would normally be valid for a maximum of five years, and may be varied by the LHA if there has been a change of circumstance.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/15">The council will reference prospective tenants, assist the landlord in dealing with problem tenants or antisocial behaviour, provide evidence to assist with an eviction process, and facilitate a private landlords' forum to provide a platform for consultation, discussion and the sharing of good practice. As the county council reminded me, selective licensing is only one measure and other tools can be used when tackling problems with private landlords. For example, Durham county council is developing a voluntary accreditation scheme that will be made available to any private landlord who rents out property in the county. The scheme aims to assist landlords in improving their management standards and property conditions, which in turn will benefit tenants and local residents.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/16">The council will offer benefits to accredited landlords, which will include assistance in dealing with problem tenants in the form of joint visits and the collation and production of evidence for legal action. The county council can assist landlords in referencing prospective tenants, and it is developing a system to be used county-wide, such as the traffic light system that is currently used in some areas. The council is also considering a good tenants scheme, which would enable anyone looking for private rented accommodation to apply to become recognised as a good tenant. That would help them to move forward quickly should a suitable property become available.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/17">The council wants to co-ordinate its approach to private landlords by setting up such initiatives and using the full range of powers that the Government have laid down in legislation. It works closely with the police and uses environmental health provisions to help tidy up certain areas. Many of the initiatives that I have mentioned are voluntary, and I want to ask the Minister whether he agrees with them, and whether he will look into how such schemes could be made compulsory, to ensure that private landlords are licensed, not selectively, but before they can let properties.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/18">There are three categories of private landlord. First, there are good landlords who take their responsibilities seriously. Secondly, there are bad landlords who, whatever someone does, are not prepared to play the game because they frankly do not care. The largest group are what have become known as amateur landlords. They are neither good nor bad, but they lack the necessary skills and sometimes have a job other than that of looking after the properties they let. A general licensing scheme would be useful. It should not involve only paying a fee; there should be some qualification or something in the provision that proves that the landlord knows their rights, duties and responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/19">The Rugg review highlighted the fact that 73 per cent. of landlords are either individuals or couples. It also described the private rental sector as a cottage industry. The number of properties that most landlords own is small-44 per cent. of landlords who are individuals or couples own only one property. A further 27 per cent. own two to four properties.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/20">Social trends determine that those who own properties for rent have often inherited the property, have found difficulty in selling it before moving out or have the property as a spare following a partnership formation. However, the majority trend is the investment motive. In 1993-94, the landlords of 48 per cent. of English dwellings viewed their property either as an investment for capital growth or as rental income. By 2006, the proportion of those viewing property as an investment had grown to 70 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/21">In recent years, there has been an increase in the proportion of landlords who are new to the business. In 2001, 53 per cent. of landlords who were individuals or couples had been letting for less than 10 years. In 2006, that figure had grown to 60 per cent. Those are the reasons why, in my view, a general licensing scheme for private landlords should be introduced.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/22">The evidence suggests a growing trend in absentee landlords. The purchase of a property is a capital investment, which makes some purchasers not landlords but property investors and speculators. They tend to hand over their properties to a managing agent, which opens up a whole new can of worms because managing agents are not regulated at all. A general licensing scheme should not just involve receiving the licence for a fee. I believe that a potential or existing landlord should prove his or her competency in letting out property. They must show that they are honest and of good character, and that they know what is expected of them and understand the law. If the landlord is an absentee, they must demonstrate how the property and tenant will be managed in their absence.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/23">I also fervently believe that where a substantial amount of the housing stock in a given area, such as Dean Bank, Chilton and Trimdon Station, is dominated by private landlords, those landlords have a moral responsibility not only to their properties and tenants, but to the wider community. As part of any licensing scheme, the landlord should state what positive role they intend to play in the community.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/24">It is not good enough simply to say that property is a revenue source for an individual landlord. There might be a market in housing, but it should not be a market where standards are driven down in our engagement with our local communities. The high level of mobility common to the private rented sector means that tenants are less likely to settle for long periods or to contribute to the local community. High levels of mobility can lead to void periods between lettings, which can destroy neighbourhoods, particularly when voids last for significant periods.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/25">More worryingly for both tenants and their neighbours, absent or irresponsible landlords who do not manage their stock can lead to continuing disrepair issues. That has an impact not only on housing conditions for tenants, but on the quality of the external environment for the local neighbourhood. Those are all characteristics of the three areas in my constituency that I mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/26">Constituents complain to me about the antisocial behaviour of some of the tenants in private lets. That is not a specific problem of private lets, but it is prevalent in the areas that I have mentioned. On occasion, tenants have been evicted by a social landlord, or have dysfunctional family backgrounds. More often than not, they land up in privately let accommodation. If the regulation is tightened, as it is under selective licensing and tenant reference schemes, private landlords can choose not to offer the individual a tenancy. If the individual cannot find a house from either a social or private landlord, where do they go? They are homeless.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/27">When a family or individual is a nuisance to themselves and the local community, we should build on the Prime Minister's announcement at the Labour party conference on the need for family intervention schemes, such as the Dundee families project. Under such a scheme, problems can be resolved in a safe and caring environment, so that the individual can be reintegrated in the community.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/28">Fundamentally, there is a case for the private rented sector and those who operate in it to show some understanding of the public good. They are providing homes for people. How can we expect tenants to have respect for the property that they rent if, as is often the case, the private landlord has no respect for his property either?</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/29">The combination of a lack of social housing and house prices that are beyond the reach of many people, especially the young, has swelled the number of low-income households seeking to rent in the private sector. As demand grows, so does the problem. The present situation seems unsustainable, particularly as it is closely linked not only to perpetuating poverty and deprivation, but to the cycle of homelessness.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/30">There are two possible options for tackling the problem: abandon the use of the private rented sector for public housing purposes, or proactively ensure its expansion so that it can effectively meet demand. The former requires a substantial increase in the social housing sector to take up the slack. That may be the ambition of the Government's housing policy, but it is, by definition, a long-term approach rather than an overnight solution. We must look at measures over the short and medium term, and possibly consider growing the private sector in a more systematic way. For example, we could consider institutional investment, possibly by housing associations.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/31">Any growth should be on the basis of a licensing scheme that matches the needs of the tenant and the neighbourhood in a way that is not happening now. Leaving the matter to private landlords, many of whom are absent, in it for the capital return in property and amateurish in their approach, is a recipe for chaos. Those people should not be able to determine the country's housing policy. Will my hon. Friend the Minister let me know his views on the introduction of a general licensing scheme for private landlords? Can he tell me what his Department is doing to monitor selective licensing schemes, and what plans there are to extend them?</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/32">In Chilton, where there have been problems and where there is no selective licensing scheme, Ben Hewitt, a local resident who was born in Arthur street, has done a sterling job of pulling the community together to work with the police, councillors and other agencies. The Dean Bank residents association is doing the same thing, and the Trimdon Station local residents have just created a neighbourhood watch scheme. The residents in Chilton and Trimdon Station want the selective licensing scheme to be extended to their area, while the Dean Bank residents want their existing scheme to work.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/33">The communities in my constituency are strong, and they want to live peaceful lives. I am disappointed when I see private landlords-some are good but the majority are absentee-buying up communities for profit without due respect to the local people. That is why I wanted to raise the issue today. I should like the Government to make it a statutory duty on local authorities to liaise and engage with private landlords and monitor them. I know that there is legislation in place to help local authorities, and Durham county council is doing all that it can, but there is no statutory requirement on it to do things systematically, which means that resources are limited. If such a duty was imposed, it would go some way to redressing the problems in my constituency, which, I am sure, are not particular to Sedgefield.</p>

	<p pid="c.306.0/1">Let me start by apologising for coming in late and missing the start of the speech of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2026" name="Phil Wilson">the Member for Sedgefield (Phil Wilson)</phrase>. I congratulate him not just on obtaining this important debate but on all the work that he has done on tackling antisocial behaviour and bad landlords in his constituency. As he said, tackling issues such as antisocial behaviour is one of the Government's top priorities, and I recognise that problems of vandalism, crime and general disorder have a huge impact on the quality of life of ordinary, decent people.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.0/2">We have provided a framework of powers and approaches for the police and other agencies so that they can tackle antisocial behaviour swiftly and effectively. As my hon. Friend said, a minority of bad landlords still make their tenants' lives a misery and tarnish the reputation of the whole sector. We want to identify those people and get them out of the market if they are unwilling to improve their behaviour. In recognition of that, the Housing Act 2004 introduced a variety of measures to tackle poor management practices in the private rented sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.0/3">The 2004 Act gives local authorities the discretionary power, subject to Government approval, to designate certain neighbourhoods as selective licensing areas. They may use such powers in areas that suffer, or are likely to suffer, from low housing demand, or from significant and persistent antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.0/4">To implement such a power, local authorities must show how a selective licensing scheme fits in with their overall, strategic, authority-wide approach to dealing with problems in the private rented sector. They need to show, for example, how the scheme will fit in with existing policies on homelessness, empty homes, regeneration and antisocial behaviour. They must also conduct a full consultation with local residents, including tenants, landlords, owner-occupiers and businesses in and around the proposed designation.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.0/5">Selective licensing will ensure that all landlords and managers of privately rented properties in a designated neighbourhood are identified to the local authority as &quot;fit and proper&quot; persons, and that satisfactory management standards are in place in the property. Landlords will also have to take appropriate steps to deal with their tenants' antisocial behaviour as a condition of a licence, and they will be required to demand references from prospective tenants. Breach of a licence condition is an offence that is subject to a fine of up to &#163;5,000. Letting or managing a property without a licence could result in a maximum fine of &#163;20,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.0/6">My hon. Friend knows that the Department for Communities and Local Government has given approval to Sedgefield borough council and Easington district council to operate selective licensing schemes in their areas. Both schemes are now administered by the newly formed Durham county council. Indeed, the selective licensing scheme in the Dean Bank and Chilton West wards came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-07">7 February 2008</phrase> and, to date, 212 licences have been issued and 17 prosecutions are pending. The council has shown that its schemes fit in with the overall strategic approach on tackling problems in the local private rented sector. It is also seeing success in the level of engagement from local landlords operating in its area. Such success demonstrates what an authority committed to tackling problems with its private rented sector can achieve.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.0/7">As I have mentioned, to establish selective licensing schemes in their area, local authorities are currently required to apply to the Department for approval. When the legislation was introduced, it was made clear that the ultimate aim was a general consent allowing local authorities to establish schemes without seeking approval. Such a consent would not absolve a local authority of the need to comply with the requirements that I have described.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.0/8">The legislation is still relatively new, and before a general consent is issued, careful consideration is needed of how it would work in practice. I should like to stress, however, that the role of the Department is to facilitate the approval process, rather than to refuse applications for selective licensing. Officials work with local authorities to help develop the most appropriate solutions for the problems that they have identified.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.0/9">When a local authority presents a scheme that has been properly developed and meets the legislative criteria, our Department aims to turn around approval within 30 working days. However, it is right that we should challenge schemes that have not been properly thought through and that do not meet the legislative criteria.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.0/10">On approval, licensing schemes last a maximum of five years, and come into force three months from the date of approval. There is no reason why licensing schemes cannot continue and, in certain circumstances, be extended after their end date, if the problems that the schemes are designed to address still manifest themselves.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.0/11">I expect local authorities to take a robust approach to the tools and powers available to them to tackle problems in the private rented sector. However, I am keen to ensure that local authorities see licensing as a way of developing a partnership with good landlords. If selective licensing designations are to help address the complex issues facing wards such as Dean Bank and Chilton West, it is vital that there be good working relationships between the local authority and local landlords.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.0/12">The criteria for establishing selective licensing schemes reflect the experience of private rented sector markets at the time when the legislation was implemented. However, I recognise that there is a need for further consideration of the criteria for selective licensing to ensure greater flexibility for local areas in dealing with problem privately rented properties.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.0/13">My hon. Friend knows that my Department commissioned the independent review, &quot;The Private Rented Sector: its contribution and potential&quot;, from Julie Rugg and David Rhodes of the centre for housing policy at the university of York. It was published in October 2008. Its recommendations included a national register for all private landlords and a reconsideration of the criteria used for selective licensing. It proposed, for example, that landlords include their registration number on all tenancy agreements, and that it be possible to remove them from the register if they fail to comply with the required standards. A register would also enable us to identify bad landlords and get them out of the market if they are unwilling to improve their behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.0/14">My hon. Friend asked what the position would be in relation to private-sector letting and managing agents. Letting and managing agents do not currently need professional credentials, but the review recommends full regulation for private-sector letting agents. At the moment, because professional credentials are not required, neither tenants nor landlords have any realistic redress when things go wrong. To tackle that problem, the Government propose the creation of an independent regulator for all letting and managing agents.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.0/15">The Government published our response to the review for consultation in May and have been encouraged by the positive reaction to the proposals, having received more than 250 responses. We are now considering those responses and will publish the results of the consultation later this month.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.0/16">In conclusion, selective licensing is an important tool available to local authorities to help tackle the worst problems in the private rented sector. Selective licensing will continue to make a valuable contribution to raising management standards in the private rented sector within the designated wards. Through successful implementation of the scheme, the council is sending a clear message that poor management standards will not be tolerated in the region.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.0/17">I congratulate my hon. Friend on all the work that he has done in his constituency with the local authority to tackle the problems created by bad landlords. I would be grateful if he would agree to meet me and take me through the figures that he read out, so that we can consider the problems in his constituency in more detail.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.0/18" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.0/19" class="italic">Sitting adjourned.</p>
