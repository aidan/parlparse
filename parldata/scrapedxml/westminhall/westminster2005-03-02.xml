	<p>I    welcome the opportunity of this Adjournment debate on admissions arrangements for post-primary schools, a subject that is important to many people in Northern Ireland. Retaining our successful grammar schools and the principle of academic selection in Northern Ireland are key priorities for the Democratic Unionist party. The Province's pupils consistently produce the best examination results in the United Kingdom. The recent consultative document from Northern Ireland's Department of Education on new admissions arrangements to post-primary schools confirms neighbourhood comprehensives as the inevitable outcome of the transfer procedure changes that the Government are seeking. In ruling out academic selection, the Government are excluding the principle that the majority of parents obviously support.</p>
	<p>We reject utterly the Government's vision of post-primary education in Northern Ireland. An unaccountable Sinn Fein Minister and the Costello report attempted to ignore the fact that almost two thirds of parents in the Province opposed the Burns report proposals to end academic selection. Now, direct rule Ministers are doing the same. Indeed, I am informed that several schools have applied to the Department for consultation response booklets on behalf of parents, but that the Department has refused to give the schools the booklets, saying that individual parents must contact it directly. I am not aware of such practice in other Departments in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p>Is the Minister afraid of public opinion coming out against the proposals yet again, and thus attempting to limit the parental response? Surely it matters not how a parent obtains the consultation response document. If we are about open government, we should be encouraging more people to participate in the consultation process. Will the Minister deal with such matters in his response to the debate? Students should be placed in the school that best suits their needs on the basis of ability, not by postcode or the ability to pay.</p>
	<p>Despite excellent exam results in the Province, there are undoubtedly areas for improvement. We need to enhance the qualifications of those not so academically gifted. Children from areas of social deprivation do less well&mdash;an issue that we want to address. It is important that more young people from working-class areas reach grammar school and university. It is through a process of academic selection that they are given the best opportunity of proceeding to higher educational attainment.</p>

	<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for that helpful intervention; he is absolutely right. I have spoken to those associated with some of the voluntary grammar schools in Northern Ireland and they are clear that, if the Minister proceeds down the road on which he has embarked, the result may well be that we have private fee-paying schools in Northern Ireland. That will not create the type of social equality that he talks about; it will increase the gap between those who have and those who have not in educational terms.</p>
	<p>The current method of testing children at the age of 11 must be improved, so that it is less stressful for them. I have had two young children go through the transfer system and I know the pressures that it places on families. Those in my party support the scrapping of the current 11-plus transfer test, but we believe that it ought to be replaced by a new assessment system that includes academic selection on transfer. Tests could be conducted over a longer period, such as two or three years, and in-class monitoring by teachers during the latter years of primary school could also contribute towards the transfer procedure.</p>
	<p>By persisting with their current policy, the Government could rob Northern Ireland of one of its key selling points. It is also flying in the face of what the Minister knows to be the wishes of the majority of people living in Northern Ireland. The public want a system of education that includes academic selection and allows everyone, regardless of their economic background, an opportunity to attend grammar schools&mdash;in short, a system that produces pupils educated to the highest standards within the United Kingdom. People in Northern Ireland are proud of what the education system allows individuals to achieve and the fact that academic excellence is open to everyone. At present, the doors of grammar schools are open to everyone in Northern Ireland, not just the rich or those who parents were educated at grammar schools. Under the Minister's proposals, I fear that the net result, whether he intends it or not, will be the opposite.</p>
	<p>Martin McGuinness's consultation received an unprecedented reply from 200,551 households in Northern Ireland. Some 64 per cent. of respondents demanded the retention of academic selection. McGuinness, clearly shocked by the results, tried to massage the figures, but his protestations simply did not wash. He claimed that teaching sectors and unions were in favour of abolishing academic selection. How wrong he was: among teachers in Northern Ireland, the response was an emphatic 62 per cent. in favour of retaining academic selection for determining post-primary placement.</p>
	<p>In desperation, McGuinness then tried to claim that the responses were skewed due to the motivation of the grammar sector in Northern Ireland. However, it is clear that almost one third of Northern Ireland households replied, two thirds of which disagreed with the Minister and current Government policy. Such a high level of return in a Government consultation process is a mark of just how concerned parents are about the current direction of policy.</p>
	<p>Not only was that concern reflected in the Department's household consultative responses, the Omnibus survey for the same period also showed a clear majority in favour of retaining academic selection. It is clear that the people of Northern Ireland and the teachers and the parents of children in the Province wish academic selection to be maintained. The majority of political representatives in Northern Ireland also favour academic selection. The Government should not seek to frustrate the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p>On the day that the Northern Ireland Assembly was suspended, Martin McGuinness moved quickly to abolish the 11-plus without any consideration of an alternative system for post-primary transfer. It is sad that the Government have continued to pursue that flawed and unpopular policy.</p>

	<p>That would be a kind of local referendum to retain a grammar school, and I am not sure that we want to go down that road. However, I am not against the principle of local solutions such as the Dickson plan in Craigavon. I have not heard the Minister explain what will happen with the Dickson plan under his new proposals; I hope that he will address that, because it affects my constituency and that of the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble). Are we going to go down the road of local solutions and retain the Dickson plan?</p>
	<p>I say to the hon. Lady that I have concerns about the idea of referendums to determine the retention of grammar schools. I would much rather we retain grammar schools within the existing education system so that they are accessible to everyone. That is a solution, and there is a large degree of consensus between our two parties on that issue.</p>

	<p>The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. That debate has been part of the discussion about Burns and Costello, yet both reports fail adequately to address whether the Dickson plan will be retained. As far as I am aware from my contact with the schools and those affected by it, the Dickson plan has been a success in the Craigavon area. I do not advocate that solution for the whole of Northern Ireland, but I wonder why the Department seems to have ignored the issue.</p>
	<p>In respect of how the proposals will work in practice, the accusation has been made that the key stage 2 curriculum is skewed by the existence of the transfer test, because schools devote time to practice tests and encourage the learning of key facts by repetition. None the less, statistics from 2003 show that at key stage 2 in English and mathematics more pupils from Northern Ireland reach the expected standards than their counterparts in Great Britain.</p>
	<p>We fully accept the public will that the 11-plus should be abolished as soon as is practical; however, we do not accept that the ending of an imperfect test should be equated with the ending of any form of academic differentiation at 11. Children do not all have the same abilities or interests and it is wrong to suggest that they do so by seeking to enforce a comprehensive system of education in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p>The Government propose the introduction of the pupil profile, which will be drawn up by primary school teachers and may be given to the desired post-primary school prior to a parental interview. However, the Government say that the pupil profile will not be the basis for selection. How can the Minister defend the fact that there is no requirement for parents to show the profile to the receiving school, or even to discuss their child going to the school with either the primary or the post-primary head teacher? Surely the Minister is not so naive as to suppose that parents will automatically, and unerringly, choose the right school for their child, especially if primary teachers are less than honest in their assessment of the pupil's ability. There will be pressures on primary school teachers in drawing up the pupil profile.</p>
	<p>How can a child who lives closest to a former grammar school get a place because of the distance criterion, when a child who lives further away but who has more academic ability cannot get in? How can that be just? It will cause confusion to parents who will see the pupil profile as a key and, perhaps, decisive influence on the transfer process. They will in turn often put enormous pressure on primary school teachers and principals to accentuate the child's strengths and downplay its potential weaknesses. The pupil profile without academic selection simply creates false expectations for parents, who will place considerable weight on it, even though the Minister claims that it will not be the basis for selection. If there is no test, and no other tangible means of assessing the child's ability, it is inevitable that parents will see the pupil profile as the basis for selection, even if that is not the Department's intention.</p>
	<p>The preparation of the pupil profile will mean additional work for primary school teachers and principals. What consultations have been held with primary school principals and teachers about the pupil profile? Without objective testing and external moderation, the new admissions arrangements put the P5, P6 and P7 teachers and primary headmasters in the firing line. The pressure on them to state that a child is capable of pursuing an academic course will be tremendous if it is based on class work and a class teacher assessment, albeit moderated within a school. Does the Minister agree that even if the pupil profile is not to be used&mdash;or even seen&mdash;by the receiving school, primary school teachers will be under greater pressure?</p>
	<p>The implications for post-primary schools are also a matter of concern. Under the Government's proposals, each parent has the right to an interview with the school or schools of their choice prior to selection, which could have significant consequences for such schools, with hundreds of one-to-one interviews being required with principals during the November period designated by the Department. The new admissions arrangements refer a great deal to the objectivity of the pupil profile, but there is no indication as to how that objectivity is to be achieved. It cannot possibly be objective if it is based only on internal assessment. It is also not comparable with that for other children of the same age if there is no external moderation. There can be no consistency, as promised in the new arrangements document, if there is not some external moderation. How does the Minister propose to ensure the objectivity and consistency promised in the consultation document?</p>
	<p>Despite 35 years of civil unrest, our pupils in both grammar and secondary schools have consistently out-performed their counterparts in Great Britain at GCSE and A-level. In 2002, 58.7 per cent. of Northern Ireland pupils obtained five or more A* to C grades at GCSE compared with 52.5 per cent. of pupils in England and Wales. Fewer of our pupils left without any qualifications. The pattern is similar at A-level, with Northern Ireland pupils out-performing their peers in England and Wales by a considerable margin. So why does the Minister want to change the system when it is working? Why does he want to give us the same system that is failing children in England and Wales? Parents in Northern Ireland cannot understand that.</p>
	<p>The Minister's claim that our pupils trail behind Great Britain on the average points statistic is grossly misleading. Employers, universities, pupils and parents regard GCSE grades A* to C as pass grades, but the points system in the Costello report awards points to grades lower than C. That means that a pupil with five C grades at GCSE would have a lower points score than someone who obtained five D grades and two E grades. Moreover, it has been publicly acknowledged by failing comprehensives in England that they have abandoned GCSEs in favour of BTEC qualifications in order to achieve better results&mdash;a practice that is not widespread in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p>The results published by the Programme for International Student Assessment for 2003&mdash;an assessment of 15-year-old students&mdash;suggest that Northern Ireland has one of the best performing education systems in the world. The average score across all Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in each subject area was around 500 points. In Northern Ireland, the average scores were 515 in mathematics, 517 in reading and 524 in science. In reading, mathematics and science only two OECD countries did significantly better than Northern Ireland. Only pupils from Finland and Korea performed better in reading, and only Finnish and Japanese pupils did significantly better in science. The Minister was forced to admit:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;the performance of our young people continues to be well above the international average, in all the areas assessed.&quot;</p>
	<p>The PISA findings did not make pleasant reading for Ministers, as 15-year-olds in England scored worse in mathematics, science and reading than pupils from 17 other industrialised countries. Yet the Minister wants to keep the system in England and to remove the system that is currently succeeding in Northern Ireland by international standards. I and many people in Northern Ireland believe that the Minister has got it wrong. We have a system that is working and when something is working one should not try to fix it. One should try to improve it, but not abandon it as the Minister appears to be doing with his current proposals. Why are the Department and the Government so intent on destroying a post-primary system in Northern Ireland that produces such fine achievements at all levels, only to replace it with a system that has patently failed to produce either good academic standards or social equality in England and Wales?</p>
	<p>The question of admissions criteria also needs to be looked at closely. In the end, with more than 60 per cent. of schools in Northern Ireland currently oversubscribed, admissions criteria will be a major factor in determining where pupils are educated and what schools they attend. Four sets of criteria are set out in the consultation document: family-focused criteria, community-based criteria, geographical criteria, and the so-called tie-breakers. The fact is that three of the four are in reality based on geographical criteria. The family-focused criteria include whether any siblings are currently at the school, and clearly the location of the school is a factor in that. As for the community-based criteria, feeder primary schools and the location of the parish are issues; again, geography comes into that. Then we have the geographical criteria themselves, with school-centred and child-centred catchment areas. Finally, there are the tie-breakers, which include a consideration of proximity of a school to home. In fact, one could argue that all four criteria are based on geography to a degree, but certainly the latter three are based primarily on geography.</p>
	<p>That, I believe, will result in the kind of situation that the hon. Member for South Antrim (David Burnside) mentioned earlier&mdash;some schools will be popular, and parents who can afford to do so will move close to them, because when it comes down to the tie-breaker, it is a matter of either random selection or proximity of a school to home. That will create social inequality in Northern Ireland when it comes to education, and that is simply not acceptable. What are the parents supposed to do in my constituency, in places such as Moira and Annahilt, when they do not have a grammar school within miles, and when the feeder primary schools may be outside the catchment area? Moira in particular is on the edge of the Dickson plan area; parents there are in something of a quandary about all that. They are going to lose out, and why should they? Why should someone lose out simply because of where they were born or where they live?</p>

	<p>I agree with the right hon. Gentleman, not only on educational grounds, but as regards the very proposals and the new system that the Minister proposes to introduce. It seems that one policy is moving forward and another is being adapted, but the current policy does not reflect the implications of the proposals for transfer arrangements in terms of the location of new primary schools and so on.</p>
	<p>Proposals that pupils should attend classes in different schools, and that teachers should teach lessons in more than one school, are impractical and misguided. We wholeheartedly support the development of properly accredited vocational courses and we believe that it is important that society and especially the world of work recognise vocational qualifications as valid and valuable. We must break the cycle of society believing that only academic qualifications have status. That is where the Minister really ought to be concentrating his efforts. Also, he should be supporting the secondary schools that he claims are underperforming, where pupils in working-class areas are leaving without qualifications. Would not it be much better if the money that he is to spend on reforming the system and abandoning the current one were spent on investment in underperforming schools, on helping the pupils who need the help most, and in particular on developing vocational-type courses in those schools? Such courses would really, practically benefit the pupils and give them an opportunity for a future career from which they would really benefit.</p>

	<p>I agree with the hon. Gentleman and I hope that the Minister will address that point. Whether the Minister thinks that what the hon. Gentleman mentions is the reality or not, it is certainly the perception among many in the teaching and educational profession in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p>Under the Government's proposals, academically-focused schools do not exist. It is ironic that specialist schools can exist to provide courses in sports science, drama, the performing arts, technology and computing but not in academic subjects. The Minister needs to address that issue clearly. To ensure a fair system of transfer at 11, the choice of pathways must be equally attractive and valued. Pupils with academic interests and abilities must have the opportunity to pursue those at a grammar school, while those with different talents and interests&mdash;who are no less valued&mdash;must be able to secure a place in a school that will cater for those. If the Minister believes that his proposals will enable grammar schools to continue in their current form, perhaps he will give us the information that I am afraid is lacking in his consultation document.</p>
	<p>Society must be encouraged to afford all post-primary schools equal status. That should not just be bestowed but earned by performance and the resourcing and attitude of the Government towards all schools. The consultation document on new admissions arrangements for post-primary schools and the information on the performance of pupils provide no indication of how the Government intend to ensure objectivity.</p>
	<p>As parents, we are not impartial judges of our children's educational potential&mdash;we need the input of professionals. Underachievement and inequality do not start at age 11. Any current research findings on school attainment levels show that pupils' performance is markedly affected by social class and cultural capital. For example, a recent survey carried out by the university of London's Institute of Education found that primary school pupils eligible for free school meals&mdash;an indicator of family poverty&mdash;began with lower scores in maths and literacy and fell further behind as they progressed up the school. That finding is duplicated in the O'Brien research carried out in the Irish Republic.</p>
	<p>The current system of post-primary education in Northern Ireland, for all its faults, still sends a significantly higher number of pupils from working- class and disadvantaged backgrounds to higher education. Queen's university and the university of Ulster have among the highest levels of students from working-class backgrounds of all universities in the United Kingdom. I believe that the Minister's proposals will result in a reduction in the number of children from working-class backgrounds who make it through to higher education.</p>
	<p>I could say so much more on this subject, but I am mindful that other right hon. and hon. Members may wish to speak before the Minister winds up the debate. However, I want to make an appeal to the Minister. A consensus is developing in Northern Ireland that he ignores at his peril. It is important that this issue should be handled sensitively because the decisions taken today will affect a future generation and will deeply affect Northern Ireland, because one of our best selling points is our education system.</p>
	<p>The Minister should draw back from these proposals. At this stage, we do not know when the Northern Ireland Assembly will be reinstated, and there would be a consensus among Opposition Members that the sooner that happens&mdash;in the right circumstances and with those parties committed to exclusively peaceful and democratic means in government&mdash;the better. The Assembly should have the final say on this issue, representing, as it does, the people of Northern Ireland. The Minister should put this matter on holduntil the Assembly is reinstated and allow the local parties to take the decisions on how we move the system forward.</p>

	<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention.</p>
	<p>It is my belief that in the current circumstances, with Sinn Fein linked to an organisation that is involved in criminality and terrorism, it should not hold any departmental position, never mind the education portfolio. The Unionist parties should co-operate on this issue. I do not want to see a Sinn Fein Minister with responsibility for Education in any future Executive. We need to give that priority, because it is a question of confidence. Many in the education system did not have confidence in the previous Minister and are disappointed that the current one has carried through the very flawed policies adopted by Martin McGuinness.</p>
	<p>In conclusion, <i>The Sunday Times</i> &quot;Parent Power&quot; survey late last year placed 25 Northern Ireland schools in the top 200 UK secondary schools. Given our comparatively small population, that was a fantastic achievement. Such success will not be maintained by destroying academically-oriented schools.</p>
	<p>There is still plenty of room for improvement. My party and I want to be at the forefront in helping to achieve those improvements, particularly for children from working-class Protestant backgrounds in Northern Ireland. Investment is needed in those areas and in education and schools in those areas. That would benefit the whole community.</p>
	<p>Compromising what is best about our education system is no way to proceed. We want a system that allows all children to reach their full potential.</p>

	<p>I will be very brief because I want to see all my friends from Northern Ireland get the chance to speak.</p>
	<p>I just want to make two points. I am a product of a grammar school in Northern Ireland&mdash;Belfast royal academy&mdash;which, 40 years on, still contains a broad social mix and is producing excellent results. It is quite wrong of my Government to be pushing forward with this whole change to the education system in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p>There is a huge democratic deficit in Northern Ireland. We now have Ministers, some of whom probably had not been to Northern Ireland before they were appointed, trying to change an education system that has served the people of Northern Ireland extremely well. Those Ministers have no mandate in Northern Ireland&mdash;not a single person there voted for the Government currently running Northern Ireland, because of the ridiculous democratic deficit of not allowing Labour party members in Northern Ireland to be in any way organised.</p>
	<p>I will continue from the final point made by the hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson), whom I congratulate on securing this Adjournment debate. He said that the proposals should be withdrawn. The consensus on working towards a change in the transfer system&mdash;and there is no doubt that change is needed&mdash;should be followed, and no decisions should be taken until the Assembly is back. It is wrong for any Minister, and for a Minister of this Government in particular because they take no votes from Northern Ireland, to blunder in, pick up a proposal from a known terrorist, Martin McGuinness, who threw it in at the very last minute of the previous Assembly, and take it on. It is wrong that that should happen. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister has just taken over the existing situation. I had hoped that he would listen, learn, look, talk to people, talk to head teachers and parents, and that he would take a different decision. I had hoped that he would not be carried along by the small group of people in the Northern Ireland Department of Education who have wanted to see the end of grammar schools for a very long time. Those people got their chance when Martin McGuinness was running things&mdash;I hope that we will never again have someone from his party running education. That small number of officials have been zealous in trying to end grammar schools. I am sorry that my Government are colluding in that, and I hope that, even at this stage, they will draw back from the policy.</p>
	<p>There is no doubt that Northern Ireland education stands out in the United Kingdom as the best. We see that clearly from all the results. One particularly important figure is that fewer pupils in Northern Ireland leave school without any GCSEs than anywhere else in the UK. Many people who go to Northern Ireland are willing to take jobs there because of the excellence of the education system. We should not change the system radically in the way that the Minister suggests.</p>
	<p>We can all agree that changes need to be made and that improvements are needed in some of our secondary schools. There are some excellent secondary schools in Northern Ireland, however, and the transfer between secondary and grammar schools, in areas where the schools work together is wonderful. Children really do have a choice, and as they grow older and it becomes obvious that they need to be at a different school, that is made much easier by the way in which the system works in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p>If we put an end to the current system, we will see a growth in the private sector&mdash;people will buy their way into a better education. At present, that does not happen: very few people are educated privately in Northern Ireland. That is a tribute to the education system. We should not destroy it, and we should certainly not destroy it without the support of the people of Northern Ireland and the representatives of the people of Northern Ireland. The Minister should listen to the Members of Parliament from Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p>I will begin my remarks by again reminding the Government that the Ulster Unionist party remains totally opposed to the imposition of a comprehensive education system in Northern Ireland, for good reason. However, that reason, no matter how often it is repeated, not just by politicians but by parents and teachers, seems to be lost on this Government. We simply do not want our grammar school system to be replaced by a comprehensive one that has failed Great Britain.</p>
	<p>It is not just Northern Ireland's elected representatives, teachers and parents who believe that the Government's plans are fatally flawed and will destroy the excellent system that already provides the best post-primary education available in the country. The United Kingdom's leading education expert, Dr.   Chris Woodhead, expressed the same opinion. Speaking at the launch of Concerned Parents for Education's &quot;Vision for the Future&quot; document in Belfast last Wednesday, Dr. Woodhead dismissed the Government's plans as &quot;crazy&quot;. He said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;You have the best performing system in the United Kingdom. Why would you want to dismantle that?&quot;</p>
	<p>That is the very question that we have repeatedly asked the Government since the suspension of the Assembly in autumn 2002, and that they have consistently failed to answer. Perhaps the Minister will tell the House how grammar schools can be retained without academic selection.</p>
	<p>We are rightly proud of our education system in Northern Ireland and are committed to raising standards in all our schools. Every parent wants the highest standard of education for their children. We must support all schools in focussing on the essentials and making the most of each child's abilities and aptitudes, thereby allowing every child to develop to their fullest potential. The comprehensive school system that the Costello proposals will create will inevitably introduce a hitherto unknown level of social division and put a high price on education for everyone. The system will pave the way for the expansion of independent schools, which will charge fees that will be unaffordable for most families. Moreover, in Northern Ireland, more pupils from deprived backgrounds go on to higher education than in England and Wales, and the difference between Northern Ireland and Scotland in that regard is even greater. Everyone in Northern Ireland has access to academic schools, regardless of income, property or domestic location, which is not the case in England and Wales.</p>
	<p>I am shocked to hear the hon. Member for Brent, East advocating a comprehensive system that has failed the public and proved to be socially divisive in Great Britain. Rather than producing more division, would not the public be better served if the Government were to employ their resources in improving our primary and secondary schools? How can the Government justify promoting specialist schools in Great Britain, yet deny Northern Ireland the right to retain our academic specialist grammar schools and the opportunity to develop vocational specialisms in secondary schools?</p>
	<p>In a statement to the House last year, the former Secretary of State for Education said of the education system in England and Wales,</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;we expect all secondary schools to become specialist schools with a centre of excellence. They will now be able to take on a second specialism. High-performing specialist schools could become training schools or leaders of partnerships.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, </i>8 July 2004; Vol. 423, c. 1012.]</p>
	<p>In Northern Ireland, we have not even got our first centre of excellence and specialism in a secondary school. It strikes me as ironic that the Government support specialist schools in arts, technology, IT and sports, yet they are determined to remove schools that specialise in nothing other than academic excellence.</p>
	<p>Parents, teachers and their political representatives have been met with insurmountable Government intransigence. Clear and reasoned arguments are falling on deaf ears, and so are the wishes of 64 per cent. of the parents of Northern Ireland who expressed a desire to retain some form of academic selection. Ministers and officials appear determined to press ahead, regardless of how often the arguments are exposed as misleading and unrepresentative. Flawed arguments make for flawed policies. We do not wish to see a flawed comprehensive education system in Northern Ireland. The education of our children and the future of our region must not be based on over-generalised, over-simplistic educational theories.</p>
	<p>The Government's Costello plan will introduce selection by postcode. In that way, choice of school will be determined by where people can afford to live rather than by their child's ability. A parent's right to choose the most appropriate and suitable school for their child will be taken away. Parents and a fair system of selection should determine the best schools for their children. As Dr. Woodhead concluded, there is no logic in jumping to the conclusion that if we are getting rid of the 11-plus, we might as well get rid of the grammar school system while we are at it. There is no correlation between the two.</p>
	<p>The Ulster Unionist party will continue to work at Westminster in the way that it has done, representing the interests of all parents and protecting our children's education and schools from the Government's failed comprehensive agenda. That is why my party will continue to call for raised standards in all our schools, fight to keep our grammar schools, replace the 11-plus with a fairer system of academic selection, and defend   parental choice and oppose the Costello recommendations.</p>
	<p>Finally, I again call on the Government to adhere to the democratic wishes of the majority of the population in Northern Ireland, and to spare us from a failed comprehensive system, which has blighted the British education system for generations.</p>

	<p>I think that I speak on behalf of all Northern Ireland Members present when I say that this is not a single narrow defence of grammar schools, but a campaign for the whole education system in Northern Ireland. If I can catch the eye of the Chairman of the Northern Ireland Grand Committee next week, I will raise the subject again when we consider the total budget spend for Northern Ireland, because we are suffering badly from expenditure-related problems across the primary, secondary, university and further education sectors.</p>
	<p>I want to take up a point made by the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)&mdash;she is not right honourable but she should have been made so a long time ago&mdash;about the influence in the Department of Education in Northern Ireland of a small number of people. That is seriously important. The Minister should step back a little and identify the civil servants and the number of representatives of academia in Northern Ireland who have been carrying out a campaign since they gave up their kaftans and sandals in the 1960s and 1970s, when they were outwardly left-wing socialists. That is all they are. They campaigned at that time to undermine the education system in England and Wales, and were successful in destroying it; as my right hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) said, they lowered academic standards in England and Wales.</p>
	<p>Standards in Northern Ireland were higher because we had a widespread, selective, fair and equal education system. There are people in the Minister's Department, and some of the advisers who were involved in the Burns report and the Costello report, who are, frankly, left-wing retreads. The quality of their academic research is not objective, quantitative or qualitative, and is highly questionable.</p>

	<p>I address the accusations to the Minister; I ask him to trace the record of his ministerial position and responsibilities in the Department back to the time of the Assembly, and to consider the bias in the composition of the Costello committee. It was not representative of the academic world, and could not have come to any conclusion other than to be against academic selection. If one considers the background pronouncements, submissions and public statements of those appointed to the committee, one realises that the committee was biased, and that was because of the recommendations from officials in the Minister's Department who are against academic selection. I have made my point strongly, and accept the Minister's defence of his civil servants. I would never attack the integrity of civil servants, who have to do their jobs and who, in Northern Ireland overall, do so excellently. However, there is a bias on subject matter in his Department that needs to be questioned.</p>
	<p>In the short time available I turn to one other point that has not been raised so far in this important debate. The Minister should look at the slide presentations that were made during the worst days of the troubles by the Industrial Development Board&mdash;now Invest Northern Ireland&mdash;at Berkeley street, or in New York or Taiwan, in an effort to get investment into Northern Ireland. Companies said that they did not want to be near Northern Ireland&mdash;hopefully, we are past those very bad days, and businesses are investing and will continue to invest in Northern Ireland&mdash;but the one thing above all that we were able to sell, despite the troubles and our bad image, was the quality of our education system. The Minister is proposing that we lower the quality of that system, and that will be bad for investment.</p>
	<p>When an inward investor comes to Northern Ireland, he looks at the return on the investment, the profitability of the enterprise, the amount of support that he can get, and for an environment in which people can enjoy living and working. He also looks at the quality and availability of an educated work force, and the proposals will damage that. That has not been raised so far and I should like the Minister to take it into account. We need investment in Northern Ireland. Let us not destroy what is good in our academic system. Let us improve primary, secondary and the grammar school system, not destroy it.</p>

	<p>The course of this debate seems as predictable as everything else that happens in Northern Ireland politics. I now find myself starting at half-past 10.</p>
	<p>First, I congratulate the hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) on securing the debate. As one who still looks in on Northern Ireland politics as an outsider I found it fascinating. His presentation was exceptionally measured, well reasoned and detailed. Those are not accusations that I would normally level at him, so he can take the praise on this occasion as being absolutely genuine. One remark struck me in particular. He said that we were dealing with an ideologically driven measure. Coming from this new Labour Government, I find that quite refreshing. I may not necessarily agree with the measure, but it makes a pleasant change.</p>
	<p>I can bring something of a different perspective to the debate. Unlike the Northern Ireland Members who have all gone through a grammar school, selection-based system, and unlike the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) and the new Labour Minister, I had a comprehensive education. A quick look at <i>Vacher Dod</i> tells me about the other two Members. For the benefit of the hon. Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs), the new Minister represents Brent, North, not Brent, East. My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) is rather shorter and has rather less facial hair than the hon. Member for Brent, North (Mr. Gardiner).</p>
	<p>It was an excellent education and I want to consider for a few seconds why that was. It has a bearing on the debate. I want to try to widen the context of our considerations this morning. First, I got an excellent education because my school was very much part of my community. There was a strong sense of community. That is also true of Northern Ireland. I sometimes think that if Northern Ireland had a slightly weaker sense of community it might find it rather easier to regulate its affairs. But I say that simply in passing.</p>
	<p>I also got an excellent education because I attended a school where there were good, well-motivated teaching staff who maintained excellent discipline and because the resources that were given to the school were adequate for the job that was required of it. We always want more resources, especially in an area like education. My experience is that the institutional structure in which we educate our children is often less important than the strength of the community, the integration of the school in the community and the way in which the teaching staff are resourced, the children are disciplined and the school functions as part of that community.</p>
	<p>My sisters and I are the first generation of my family to go to higher education and to obtain degrees. I come from, to borrow an expression from the hon. Member for Lagan Valley, a working-class Protestant family. My father was a shepherd. I attended school with the children of doctors and teachers. It is no accident that we are the first generation to attend higher education. I do not think that this was a generation in which the Carmichaels just happened to get smart. We are the product of a generation given opportunities by a comprehensive education system that were denied to previous generations.</p>
	<p>I do not say that Northern Ireland should necessarily throw the baby out with the bathwater and go down the same route, because there are few more dangerous things in this place than people considering their experience on this side of the Irish sea&mdash;or the north channel in my situation&mdash;and then trying to transfer it lock, stock and barrel to the situation in Northern Ireland. However, I say to Northern Ireland Members that they should be measured in their criticism of comprehensive education&mdash;there is a lot of good to be had in it, and it is not the end of civilisation as they might know it.</p>

	<p>First, may I congratulate the hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) on securing the debate? It is a subject that, in my journeys to Northern Ireland, I have found to be of huge interest and concern to parents and teachers from all backgrounds and communities.</p>
	<p>We have heard today from representatives of both Unionist parties, and I should put it on record that yesterday morning I had a meeting in County Tyrone with Monsignor Denis Faul and representatives from the Catholic grammar schools, who wanted to make clear their outright opposition to the Government's proposals. This is not an issue that divides people along sectarian lines.</p>
	<p>I am glad too that we were able to get a slight moderation from the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) of his party's customary hostility to academic selection in all its forms&mdash;a hostility that the Liberal Democrats have expressed often in speeches and votes in both the House of Commons and local authorities in England and Wales in recent years.</p>
	<p>Today's debate has centred on the Government's proposal to end academic selection from 2008. As we have heard from the hon. Members for Lagan Valley and for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs), there is no evidence that that will improve academic attainment within Northern Ireland. In fact, the English evidence suggests that the opposite is likely. What we see in Northern Ireland is better results in public examinations than in Great Britain and a better record of enabling pupils from all backgrounds to get into higher education. Would that Great Britain could match the standards currently achieved in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p>Everybody accepts that there has to be a mechanism of some sort for determining admissions to schools that are oversubscribed. The Government's consultation document makes it clear that they are looking at two basic options. The first is random selection&mdash;some form of lottery with a Minister or one of his officials saying metaphorically to parents, &quot;It could be you&quot;. I can think of nothing that is more likely to provoke confusion and uncertainty among parents, who want to have a clear idea of where their children are likely to go to school.</p>
	<p>The second option, which is more likely to happen if the proposals become law, is that the distance between home and school will in practice decide where a child should be educated at secondary level. After all, that is what happens in most of England. If that happens, it will place at a particular disadvantage parents and children from rural areas who will almost by definition be further away from schools, which for the most part will be in   towns. As the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) said, the Government's model will also place at a disadvantage children living in poor, working-class areas, who will be more likely to be trapped in a neighbourhood comprehensive in the same way as they are trapped in so many inner cities in England and Wales at the moment.</p>
	<p>I want to say a quick word about the proposals in the Government document on pupil entitlement, because it has not been mentioned much. The minimum figure of 24 courses for GCSE and 27 for A-level is somewhat arbitrary. We are all in favour of a broad-based curriculum, but to impose such a rigid total is likely to mean one of two things: either split-site schools, perhaps the worst mistake of 1960s educational reform with children being bussed around from one site to another; or an accelerated programme for the closure of small schools, particularly in rural areas, with pupils herded together in large comprehensives. One thing that we know from the English experience and international evidence is that disciplinary and pastoral problems are much more difficult to manage in large secondary schools than in schools with fewer pupils.</p>
	<p>There is a better way, and I want to make it absolutely clear that if, as I hope, a Conservative Government are elected this year, my party would abandon this misguided policy immediately. The hon. Member for Lagan Valley made it clear that there are many constructive approaches that can be taken to address the problems that exist with schooling in Northern Ireland. Certainly, we should consider international evidence and build on the idea of the pupil profile to create an alternative mechanism for academic selection to that of the 11-plus exam. We should focus on how to improve schools that are not working well, and in Northern Ireland, as in Great Britain, we should work to establish those high-quality technical and vocational routes through secondary education that Rab Butler saw as essential way back in 1944, but which the United Kingdom has never managed to operate successfully in the decades since then.</p>
	<p>I want to give the Minister time to respond, so I shall make my final point. I have always found the Minister to be a genial and pleasant parliamentary colleague and opponent, but I believe he has been sent to the debate today to defend a cowardly, mendacious policy that will be destructive to the life chances of thousands of children throughout Northern Ireland. It is cowardly because the Minister and the Government know that every test of public opinion in Northern Ireland shows a decisive majority opposed to what the Government want to do. The response booklet, which was published with the Government's consultation document, shows that parents were not even asked directly to express an opinion on whether they support the end of academic selection. That amounts to trying to cheat the people of Northern Ireland of a clear say over the future of the educational system in the Province.</p>
	<p>Despite the language and the promises about the proposals being designed to improve children's education, they are driven by another motive: ideological prejudice. The central proposal, which is to dismantle that part of the Northern Ireland system that works best, is both paradoxical and a flagrantly destructive way to go about education reform.</p>
	<p>I hope that the Minister will listen to the debate and to the views of people in Northern Ireland and that even at this late stage the Government will show that they are willing to think again.</p>

	<p>I will speak fast; I will take no interventions&mdash;solely because in the time available I want to try to answer the many questions that have already been raised.</p>
	<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the points made by the hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson). I was astonished by some of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington). He must forgive us for wondering whether he read anything but extracts from the document, as he cited only the two criteria suggested as possible tie-breakers&mdash;after all the other criteria had been exhausted&mdash;as the most likely means that would be adopted for admitting children to post-primary schools in Northern Ireland. That is less than worthy.</p>
	<p>Hon. Members will know that on 28 January I published for consultation options for admissions arrangements to post-primary schools in Northern Ireland. As we are in consultation, I am in listening mode; it would not, therefore, be appropriate for me to pre-judge the consultation process, but I want it to be based on facts, not on the rumours or speculation that are regularly reported. The consultation is not about re-running the old arguments about whether the transfer tests should end; it is a consultation on how we should proceed after 2008, when the transfer tests have gone.</p>
	<p>While responding to the points raised in the debate, I should like to take this opportunity to lay the facts before the Chamber. I assure hon. Members resent that their views will be taken into account along with the other responses to the issues covered by the consultation. I intend to publish a summary of the consultation responses after they have all been received and analysed.</p>
	<p>Today, and over the past weeks and months, I have heard much about schools, and how the new admissions arrangements may affect successful schools. I am no different from any other hon. Member present in that I greatly value good schools, and I respect and admire the work of their teachers and other staff. However, my focus is not and should not be on schools; it is and must be on children. My focus is not the school's success but the child's. What matters is not a school's position in a league table, but that more children are achieving better results and realising their potential.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Lagan Valley will be aware that, even in his own constituency, there are wide variations. In some schools almost all pupils achieve five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C, but in others, the figure is below 20 per cent. and even as low as single figures. I cannot believe that he is therefore satisfied that the present arrangements are serving all pupils in his constituency equally well and that they are being given the best opportunities to realise their potential.</p>
	<p>Even before the consultation was published, there was a great deal of public comment, widely reported in the media, about the proposed new post-primary arrangements. Many have said that they want an education system that gives every child a good education regardless of their social background, the area in which they live or their wealth. Many have said that we need a system that opens up opportunities for every child rather than closing them down, gives all children an opportunity to realise their potential, and leaves them with a positive attitude to education that will have a lasting effect. Likewise, many have said that we need a system that recognises the value of different types of learning, including academic, vocational and work-related learning. We need a flexible, realistic and relevant curriculum that recognises and rewards those different types of learning and provides clear progression routes for all young people, whether it is into further or higher education or the workplace.</p>
	<p>I cannot stress too strongly that I agree wholeheartedly with all of those remarks; they are exactly what we are trying to achieve, and I believe that the new arrangements for post-primary education will provide all of those things. However, there appear to be misconceptions, confusion and uncertainty about the new arrangements, so let me clarify what the new arrangements are not about.</p>
	<p>First, let me say, as I have said many times before, that the new arrangements for post-primary education are not about abolishing grammar schools. There is a clear demand for an academic style of education, as evidenced in the responses to the Burns consultation and in correspondence that I have received. Grammar schools have a key role in the new arrangements and will continue to provide that style of education. However, like all good schools, they are about much more than whom they admit. Parents consider them to be good schools because of the curriculum that they offer, the pace of teaching and learning, the facilities and range of opportunities available, the quality of teaching, the leadership, the tradition and the sense of community. Changing the admissions process will not change those aspects of a school or the value that a school can add to the education of their pupils.</p>
	<p>Secondly, the new arrangements are not about imposing a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach. I want all pupils to have access to the entitlement framework and to a wide menu of general and applied courses. Schools will decide how to do that&mdash;working with other schools and the further education sector&mdash;and what the precise mix of courses will be. Those arrangements will be developed at local level to respond to local needs. That is hardly a centrally imposed, &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach, as has been suggested.</p>
	<p>Thirdly, the new arrangements are not about introducing a comprehensive system. We all recognise that pupils have a range of different educational needs. I want there to be a range of school types, each offering a distinctive approach. I want all schools to develop their curricular strengths, to become centres of excellence and to share their expertise and experience with their neighbours. Parents and pupils will choose the approach and the courses that best meet the child's educational needs and his or her interests, aptitudes and aspirations&mdash;</p>

	<p>The House will know that local bus services in counties such as Norfolk are vital to many people. A large number of people without access to private transport rely on those services. For example, local buses bring 500,000 people into King's Lynn town centre and that excludes those buses that bring in students to the local educational colleges and schools. Bus passengers contribute &pound;12.5 million to the retail economy, and that shows the importance of bus services to King's Lynn.</p>
	<p>The days of Eastern Counties' double-decker buses plying routes around Norfolk two-thirds or three-quarters empty are over. There is now a new breed of bus company in Norfolk. Most are privately owned, flexible, highly focused, well managed and with highly motivated work forces. One such example is Norfolk Green, based in King's Lynn in my constituency. Its managing director is Ben Colson, who has a huge amount of experience in the industry. His company, founded in 1992, runs 39 buses with an average age of 7.5 years, slightly ahead of the industry average. Its buses cover roughly 4 million km a year, operate on 850 miles of mostly unclassified rural roads with variable maintenance and carry 1.2 million passenger journeys a year. The company employs 75 people, most of whom are on flexible working arrangements to fit their needs, and the buses put a substantial amount of money into the local economy. Norfolk Green is typical of the new generation of bus companies in Norfolk and East Anglia.</p>
	<p>However, life for the medium-sized rural and urban bus operator is becoming more and more difficult and challenging. First, traffic congestion is unquestionably getting worse and worse; it is costing the UK economy &pound;25 billion a year. Scaled down by population alone, that represents an additional cost of &pound;1.8 million for King's Lynn. In fact, King's Lynn is more congested than average; peak-hour journey speed on London road is about 3 mph, lower than that of central London before congestion charging. The real cost of congestion in King's Lynn is probably more than &pound;3 million a year.</p>
	<p>Modern buses cost roughly &pound;30 an hour, or &pound;1 for every two minutes, to operate. In the King's Lynn area, that is slightly more than the average fare paid; every two minutes of extra time on the timetable because of congestion means that bus companies have to carry one extra passenger. Bus industry costs are rising at roughly 9 per cent. a year. The main culprits are employer and public liability insurance premiums and fleet insurance premiums. In addition, there has been a very big increase in regulatory pressures, which I shall come to in a moment.</p>
	<p>First, I should like to say a word or two about the situation in King's Lynn and West Norfolk. We are seeing a number of planning decisions that have consistently tilted the balance in favour of car use. Recently, we have had a number of developments of out-of-town and edge-of-town shopping stores. All of them are geared entirely to the car user, and unfortunately we do not yet have a park-and-ride scheme in King's Lynn.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, roadworks in King's Lynn never appear to be properly co-ordinated; I hope that my local borough and county councils will get to grips with that. I can understand why the environmental health department is keen that work does not continue after 6 o'clock, because of intrusive noise to residents. However, at one stage last summer, there was resurfacing on Gaywood road and work at the South Gate scheme, the Loke road junction and the Anglia Canners access junction, and the result was almost total gridlock in King's Lynn. There was a total lack of co-ordination between the borough council and the county council; I hope they will address that.</p>
	<p>I turn to some national regulatory issues that affect the industry and the bus operators in our Norfolk constituencies. For the period between 2004 and 2007&ndash;08, there is a swathe of significant new transport-specific EU directives. Some of them are perfectly acceptable&mdash;especially those that will improve health and safety and those that are aimed at helping the disabled&mdash;and taken individually they might not be crippling. However, there is a concern that their total cumulative weight will bear down on companies and destroy wealth&mdash;and, possibly, jobs as well.</p>
	<p>Let us look at the cost of some of these directives. First, there is an EU directive to change weekly driver rest periods, which is expected later this year. That will take away flexibility in the way that drivers can be rostered to work, and it will have the effect of reducing bus services on Saturdays. That could have a significant impact on teenagers and other youngsters who want to have access to various leisure services and facilities in Norfolk. The additional cost to Norfolk Green's operation, if it does not abandon or reduce service levels, will be approximately &pound;60,000 a year.</p>
	<p>The EU new recording devices directive replaces paper recording with an EU-wide digital recording device scheme. The capital costs of that to Norfolk Green will be &pound;40,000 over five years, plus half a clerk to administer the scheme. It will bring no improvement in safety; it is merely an EU-wide measure for conformity.</p>
	<p>The EU directive on the financial standing requirements will come into force in January next year. It requires each operator to have financial headroom in their bank accounts; that sum will be set in relation to the size of their fleet. It also requires non-euro states to reset that sum every five years by reference to the euro. That means that Norfolk Green must have an extra &pound;102,000 in its bank account. That is a significant sum. The one-off cost to Norfolk Green will be &pound;10,000 a year.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-02.280.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/726" speakername="Henry Bellingham" colnum="280"  time="11:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050302/halltext/50302h02.htm#50302h02_spnew2">
	<p>My hon. Friend reinforces the point. He mentions the extra financial headroom that is required of that bus company; it is a slightly larger sum than the &pound;102,000 that Norfolk Green will need.</p>
	<p>It is one thing if directives are properly consulted on, but the change to operators' licences that will be introduced in 2006 was not consulted on. Currently, operators can opt for either a national or an EU-wide fleet operation status. I gather that, as part of implementing the directive, the UK Government, for its own administrative convenience, amalgamated the two tiers into one at the higher international cost level. The cost to Norfolk Green in this case will be &pound;31,000 a year. I ask the Minister: did the UK Government have any choice in that matter? Could they have implemented at the lower, national level, or were they obliged by the EU directive to go for the higher international cost level?</p>
	<p>We then have the EU directive on driver retraining, which requires all bus drivers to receive a minimum number of days' retraining per annum, regardless of their individual standards, professionalism and experience over previous years. Norfolk Green said to me that if it cannot source the extra drivers&mdash;and there is a local and national shortage&mdash;bus services will have to be cut. The additional cost to Norfolk Green would be &pound;20,000 a year.</p>
	<p>Then there is the EU draft directive on driver age; there is no start date yet. That will increase the minimum age for bus drivers from 21 to 24, thereby reducing career prospects and attractiveness in the industry, which is a pity. The additional costs resulting from that will depend on the age mix of staff at the introduction of the directive, but there will certainly be an extra cost to industry. Will we, as a country, have any flexibility to perhaps get a derogation from that directive?</p>
	<p>I want to mention the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which is mainly a UK piece of legislation, and which most people support. My concern, in terms of the road transport industry, is that under the Act there is a reasonableness test for buildings and other built structures, and particularly for houses, but there is an absolute requirement for the road transport directive to be implemented. The regulatory impact assessment carried out by the Department showed that a financially positive change would result for urban bus services, but not for rural bus services. Norfolk Green, for example, will have to spend a lot of money replacing vehicles over the next 10 years. The new compliant vehicles will cost roughly &pound;75,000, whereas the modern non-compliant ones cost &pound;50,000. The compliant vehicles are wider, lower and cannot always access some very small rural lanes, thereby leading possibly to less access for some communities.</p>
	<p>There will be a substantial additional cost to Norfolk Green as a result of the DDA&mdash;roughly &pound;57,000 a year. However, that is a measure that will benefit bus users in Norfolk, and we welcome it. The problem is that all these other EU directives will be a cost and a drag on the business, and will reduce the money available for investment.</p>

	<p>I agree. That is a common-sense suggestion from my hon. Friend, and I can tell him that most of the bus companies in my constituency have gone down that path, and that is to be welcomed. Obviously, in this climate of extra regulation, most bus companies will bend over backwards to try to make life easier for the travelling public.</p>
	<p>The last directive that is of great concern is the road transport directive, which is coming in on 23 March. I gather that we will hear more details about that from the Department imminently. The UK had an individual opt-out from the original EU working time directive. That came in under health and safety; it was not under the social chapter. The working time directive restricts the working week for particular employees to 48 hours. As I understand it, the road transport directive came in under what is called a horizontal amending directive procedure. That overrules the original working time directive, and there is no UK individual opt-out. It will substantially increase the cost to many of our bus companies. A similar directive has been applied to junior doctors' hours and it costs the NHS a great deal of money. This provision will cost the rural and urban bus companies a substantial amount of money. I will explain why in a moment. It will add about &pound;45,000 to Norfolk Green's costs. The total costs of all the extra regulations will be &pound;236,000 a year for Norfolk Green. That is a substantial sum to a medium-sized company.</p>
	<p>On top of those EU directives there are all the other burdens that are being put on business at the moment. Only last week, the British Chambers of Commerce estimated that the total cost of the extra burdens that have been imposed on business since the previous election is now &pound;40 billion a year. That includes all the extra employment and social costs, in addition to the road transport-specific directives and costs.</p>

	<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that take on the overall situation. Some of his points are valid, but I would point out that small independent operators in my constituency are running services from Spalding to King's Lynn and on to Cromer, and from Cambridge to Wisbech to King's Lynn and on to Cromer. Many of the smaller villages are involved. For example, there is a service from King's Lynn to Gayton to Great Massingham to Harpley. Many of those services had lapsed under the old regime. There was the regular sight of large Eastern Counties double-decker buses going round Norfolk's lanes, most of them three quarters or half empty. It was not an economic way of operating. We now have many more flexible operators providing services. They are doing their level best in a difficult regulatory environment.</p>
	<p>I want to say a few more words about the road transport directive. It was aimed mainly at long-distance drivers. Obviously, they come under more stress. It is much more monotonous to drive down a motorway. Someone driving a lorry or a bus on a long journey comes under more stress and there is a greater likelihood of their getting tired. Someone driving in an urban or rural environment and going over shorter distances faces much less stress. That is why the EU brought in an exemption under the road transport directive for journeys of less than 50 km. As I understand it, having talked to various experts from the industry, the idea was to exempt urban and bus companies. That is obviously sensible, because such journeys are shorter and should not be subject to the directive. However, many of Norfolk Green's routes are more than 50 km long.</p>
	<p>I know that the Minister is having meetings with the Confederation of Passenger Transport UK. The industry is rightly pressing for that limit of 50 km to be raised to 80 km. That would solve many of the problems. We are not asking for drivers to be made to work longer hours or for them to take risks on health and safety. I understand, however, that several Norfolk bus companies are having difficult discussions with drivers, who are worried that they will lose substantial sums under the directive. They may well be considering alternative employment, where there are obviously other opportunities. That cannot be good for the industry.</p>
	<p>As we want the Minister to have at least 10 minutes for the winding-up speech, I will conclude. The Government must carefully consider whether, through discussions with their EU colleagues and with the Commission, that 50 km limit can be raised to 80 km. Can the Minister say anything about the other directives, where there may be some scope for flexibility? Can he tell us anything about the overall picture for the future of rural bus services? As I mentioned, we have a significant number of dynamic companies serving our constituents in Norfolk. They are exceptionally focused and efficient companies with highly motivated work forces, but the overall burden of regulation on business has now reached the stage where they will have to take difficult decisions and probably reduce the number of services. That will be to the detriment of our constituents, so I hope that the Minister will be able to answer some of those points and give us some cause and hope for optimism.</p>

	<p>I congratulate the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) on securing this important debate.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of congestion in King's Lynn, particularly focusing on the lack of co-ordination of roadworks. He will be delighted to know that the Traffic Management Act 2004 will help considerably in ensuring such co-ordination. As he will know, local authorities will have the power to fine, for instance, utility companies for digging up the road and overstaying their welcome. We are currently looking at the implementation of that Act, and it should help a lot.</p>
	<p>Another congestion issue is bus priority measures, which many local authorities have introduced via their local transport plans to great effect. I urge the hon. Gentleman's local councils too consider them. He also mentioned the impact of planning decisions that are geared to the car user. His local authorities should consider a park-and-ride scheme for King's Lynn, as I understand that one does not exist at the moment, to ensure that people park their cars outside and then take the bus into town.</p>
	<p>Many of the details about the EC directives could be best dealt with by correspondence. For instance, the road transport directive to which the hon. Gentleman referred does not apply to local journeys under 50  km. If he really is concerned about raising the level to 80  km, I would be interested to hear from Norfolk Green, or any other local bus operator, and the confederation about how that would affect rural bus services. We do not want to create any obstacles for rural bus services, but I am concerned that he doubts whether we should be pushing for driver retraining. In my experience of using buses in rural areas and that of my constituents, driver training is vital. A bus user's confidence is reliant on the driver's attitude. For a passenger who happens to be disabled, whether or not that involves using a wheelchair, driver response is vital. I do not know exactly what the hon. Gentleman's concerns are about that directive, but I would not like any reduction in the focus on retraining.</p>

	<p>Possibly that is the case, but we are dealing not necessarily with a good local firm such as Norfolk Green, but with the general situation. I have heard stories that I would not like to repeat here about particular drivers in particular companies who desperately need training.</p>
	<p>On the point about the shortage of drivers, I believe that many companies are doing innovative work in, first, creating more flexible working for drivers to make the job more attractive and, secondly, recruiting drivers who are already trained from Poland, the Czech Republic and other such places. On the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, I would not want to tell my rural constituents that they should receive less of a service in terms of disability access than their urban neighbours, so I would be very concerned about reducing the level of responsibility.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman talked about access to lanes. As I shall say later in my speech, many rural services now offer flexible, demand-responsive buses, which tend to be the smaller vehicles. The Government have significantly improved the funding arrangements for rural bus services, and Norfolk in particular has benefited. During the past seven years from 1998, nearly &pound;450 million has been allocated specifically for the support of rural bus services, mainly through the rural bus subsidy grant, providing some 2,200 new or improved bus services. Norfolk has had the highest allocation of RBSG of any local authority in the country&mdash;&pound;2.4 million this year alone, rising to &pound;2.5 million in 2005&ndash;06. That is a large sum by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright) referred to deregulation. Sure enough, far from being a golden age of rural bus services, under deregulation such services were heavily reduced. We are bringing back a range of subsidies to ensure that rural residents receive the same sort of service as urban residents.</p>

	<p>I apologise, Mr. Deputy Speaker; I know that familiarity breeds contempt and I would not like to earn your contempt at this time and place.</p>
	<p>When the subject was announced, it provoked interest from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) contacted me, as did Ofcom and the BBC. However, I was not contacted, other than en passant by a Westminster correspondent, by ITV, which was illustrative of its attitude towards what goes on in this place&mdash;more of that later. My hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth) and I also contacted our television expert in the person of Mr. Phil Redmond of Mersey Television.</p>
	<p>Let me put on the record how great and diverse an amount of television talent, in all its many manifestations, there is on Merseyside. As I mentioned, Phil Redmond is an outstandingly successfully producer; we have award-winning writers such as Jimmy McGovern, Willy Russell, Alan Bleasdale and Frank Cottrell Boyce, as well as a galaxy of stars who learned their performing skills on Merseyside. In short, we have a massive pool of creative talent in the city and the sub-region. It is partly out of concern for their professional well-being and to ensure that they have the opportunity to increase and promote the offerings that they make to the world of television and general broadcasting that we are here today. I should also say that in BBC Radio Merseyside we have one of the most widely listened to radio stations in the country. The north-west is a vibrant centre of broadcasting.</p>
	<p>I applied for this debate in the aftermath of the BBC announcement that it would relocate &pound;500 million-worth of resources to Manchester&mdash;Manchester, not the north-west; the BBC's press releases referred to Manchester. As one would expect, the local Manchester newspaper took a similar line. For example, on 21 January the <i>Manchester Evening News</i> reported that:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Manchester is to boost its credentials as a major TV centre as independent companies follow the BBC's lead and head north.&quot;</p>
	<p>Therefore, not only was the BBC to relocate part of its operations to Manchester, but the relocation of independents associated with some of the BBC departments that were transferring was on the cards. There is a question about what that means for the wider north-west.</p>
	<p>In order to consider the matter in more detail, it was necessary to speak to representatives of various media interests and to read documentation. I read a report, &quot;A New Vision for the BBC in the North&quot;, written by Mr. John Dickie, head of BBC public affairs. I thought that title reflected a typically London-centric view of the country: &quot;in the north,&quot; &quot;oop north&quot;&mdash;it could be anywhere north of Watford.&quot; Nothing would have made the slightest difference to Mr. Dickie and his cohorts at the BBC&mdash;he went on ad nauseam in that document to emphasise just how little thought had gone into the ramifications of a transfer to Manchester, as opposed to the north or even the north-west, which is our concern in this debate.</p>
	<p>Happily, I had a far more fruitful meeting with representatives of Ofcom, in which we looked at the review of public service broadcasting published in early February. Although I was appreciative of the range of its considerations, and of its intentions for public service broadcasting, especially regionally, there are gaps that need to be filled. For example, looking more closely at the proposals reveals that the new production partnership fund proposed by ITV plc is hardly generous: its value is &pound;9 million over three years. We may say that that is a straw in the wind, although I would not disagree that it is heading in the right direction. However, &pound;9 million distributed around the regions and nations of this sceptred isle is not a great deal to shell out to achieve the stated objective, which is to support the delivery of new ITV1 production requirements. In fact, I would argue that that is a derisory amount. Nevertheless, I accept that it is going in the right direction.</p>
	<p>The aim is to introduce plurality through a thriving production sector, and to that end there will be an increased quota for ITV1's out-of-London production and commitment. However, as in all matters, the devil is in the detail. Ofcom stipulates a quota of 50 per cent. by value and volume, but what is out-of-London production, and how does it relate to quality and, critically, to the regional dimension? It is fair to cite a programme such as &quot;Trisha&quot;, which is hardly enlightening to the good burghers of the north-west&mdash;one may as well watch Jerry Springer speaking in Swahili as watch some of those shows. Nevertheless, it could be defined as part of the 50 per cent. out-of-London production quota. What does that quota mean and who will actually make it?</p>
	<p>We questioned Ofcom very closely on the potential for companies to set up shell companies that, to all intents and purposes, are new producers but that could very well involve the same personnel and owners under another guise. I was relieved to discover that Ofcom has thought about the potential for that. It says that it has means of ensuring that that does not happen and that there is new production in the regions. However, the definition is still loose.</p>
	<p>The proposal is to maintain &quot;typically&quot; 5.5 hours per week of regional news. Well, the regional news in the north-west is hardly reflective of the north-west; it is probably more reflective of Greater Manchester. I was surprised when Ofcom told me that it had been assured&mdash;certainly by Granada, and I think by the BBC&mdash;that more bodies were being put out there on news gathering to increase coverage. I had to report&mdash;I am sure that colleagues will endorse this&mdash;that our subjective experience is quite the reverse: we think that there is less coverage of the north-west, or at least of huge parts of the region. Coverage does not spread to cover all parts of the region.</p>
	<p>That assurance comes on the back of a long history of our being told one thing by the BBC and ITV, but seeing another. That was particularly the case with ITV when it was Granada. At the time of licence renewal, when there was talk of how the obligations under the licence would be met in terms of comprehensive coverage of a region. The promised coverage simply does not materialise. Unless there is enforcement by the regulator, I have little faith that the undertakings entered into will be met. Ofcom tells me that it is determined to ensure that enforcement takes place and that it will monitor things closely, although I have to confess that I do not know what measures can be taken if people are once again in breach. The history in our region is one of increasing withdrawal from the commitments to the intra-regional coverage that we have been led to expect.</p>
	<p>When we met Ofcom, I was particularly taken with one idea&mdash;that of the public service publisher. I have had the opportunity to speak to others and to read a little about that and it seems to be an extremely welcome idea. I understand that the public service publisher would be based in one of the regions away from the normal centres of media activity. No one will disagree with that. The idea has great potential to allow many things to happen at even sub-regional or local community level. A friend of mine, Mike Short, who used to be a producer for &quot;World in Action&quot;, has involved himself in a co-operative exercise called Toxteth Television in the south end of Liverpool, and he is looking at a venture in my constituency in the north end of Liverpool. The idea is to enable communities to have access to the airwaves in a way that is meaningful to them and results in broadcasting that reflects their interests, instead of some of the tripe that is recycled by terrestrial and other broadcasters and force-fed to the nation. Perhaps such ventures will begin to release some of the great television potential that has hitherto gone unrealised.</p>
	<p>We have great hopes for that idea in terms of its being located in the north-west and fitting in with the north-west digital platform. The north-west digital platform is not an easy concept for people such as me, who are na-ve about broadcasting technology, to take in, but my understanding is that it will act as a gateway for the multitude of potential channels that will be open from 2008, with the onset of digitalisation. The question is how that can best be used to the advantage of all&mdash;producers and consumers&mdash;and to enhance the quality of broadcasting in every sense. It has been developed through Mersey Television and is supported by other organisations in the north-west and by people such as John Roberts of United Utilities, who is a prominent supporter of it, and John Bills of Trinity Mirror group newspapers. Those substantial individuals can see the merits of the north-west digital platform, how it can fit neatly with the public service publisher, and how it will, in turn, affect small community groups. I quoted Toxteth Television&mdash;a local group in my city&mdash;but with the new technologies would be equally appropriate to Tower Hamlets television.</p>
	<p>Referring to my earlier comments about the huge reservoir of talent that we have on Merseyside, the new technology means that we can use that talent, not only for the benefit of our local community, but for the benefit of communities and producers throughout the United Kingdom. Merseyside already has some advantages&mdash;as well as talent, I believe that we are the most wired-up city, literally and metaphorically, in the United Kingdom. We have the technology in place with which to do some marvellous things.</p>
	<p>I bear in mind Ofcom's own definition of the public service publisher and what it is intended to do. It is to be</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;charged with developing services and content that take full advantage of new distribution technologies . . . a free-to-view premier content service and community services.&quot;</p>
	<p>I hope that the Minister will respond with some encouraging words about the public service publisher, and where he thinks that that idea will end up. Although I understand that he cannot make a pledge on behalf of Merseyside any more than he can make a pledge on behalf of Sheffield, he will understand the arguments that are being made: that we do not want a London-centric broadcasting industry to be replaced by a London-and-Manchester-centric broadcasting industry. The new technologies allow us to be far more diverse than has hitherto been possible. We are entering an era in which we will have the choice instantaneously between watching a biopic of Mother Teresa or looking at the Chubby Chasers website, whatever our predilection might be. That is the kind of opportunity that the technology allows. It gives freedom of choice for the individual to access all the many sources of broadcasting.</p>
	<p>I have a particular concern about some of the weaknesses in current legislation&mdash;</p>

	<p>That is one of those fables that are best left to gather dust. It originates with my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound), who is fond of fabricating exotic tales about people's status on even more exotic websites.</p>
	<p>I return to the subject of the north-west digital platform. In 1989 Granada was challenged for the ITV franchise by North West Television, which offered to put the north-west into television service. Hon. Members will remember well the bold and imaginative plan to turn the focus away from being part of what was then regarded widely as a national cartel, and is now a national plc, to becoming a stand-alone, regionally focused broadcaster that made programmes for the north-west. There was nothing too dramatic in that, but it was a little too radical for its time. Sixteen years have passed, technology has moved on and the consolidation foreseen by North West Television has now begun. The people who identified with the region in the Bernstein era have all gone. It is fair to say that that arm of television has just become another business. It has lost the distinctiveness that Granada used to have.</p>
	<p>We need a clear and simple mechanism of communication, knowledge transfer and information exchange and exhibition, as well as some celebratory space for people in the north-west in what will become a crowded and cluttered digital landscape. We do not know exactly where we shall go, but we are worried that, unless we are careful, we will be inundated not only with choice, but with mediocrity so lacking in clear identity that it would be a disservice not to flag up such matters now.</p>
	<p>ITV is in retreat from regional programmes. Channel 4 and Five are national by definition. Both the public service publisher to which I alluded and the north-west digital platform are exciting and valid, but unproven concepts. We must look for a wee bit of certainty. In today's statement, the Secretary of State said that she had left an opening so that that the funding regime might change at some point in the future, but I thought that that was an vague comment. I certainly hope that the Government are not considering doing it in the short term. Will my right hon. Friend the Minister clarify the position?</p>
	<p>At present, only one public service broadcaster&mdash;the BBC&mdash;by its remit and by funding, reaches from national to regional to truly local services through, for example, its strong local radio services in my home town. The BBC wants to play to that strength and has announced plans to base a series of local digital television services on its existing local radio network, but there are difficulties with that and such proposals need to be thought through. The whole point about the technology is that developments are ongoing and not yet complete, and we do not know what the outcomes will be. We must be prepared to make the best and most varied possible use of those developments.</p>
	<p>I wish to refer briefly to the move to Manchester by the BBC, which gave rise to the debate. The BBC is to move between 1,700 and 1,800 people to Manchester by 2010, but my research with the <i>Manchester Evening News </i>shows that, with independents moving there, too, the number of people moving might be between 2,500 and 3,000, which is a sizeable number. It is not for me to say to the BBC which of its departments it moves to Manchester, but it strikes me that BBC Online could well be based in Merseyside and enhance its service rather than have it diminished by the move. We have to be careful with new technology because of the provisos that I gave about it still being developed, but we have to recognise that location is not the determinant of where a service is best provided. Look at Manchester, where&mdash;once again&mdash;we will end up with empire building. The old Manchester building houses 700 or 800 people now, but a new centre is to be built and new hard infrastructure provided. Is that needed in Manchester?</p>
	<p>I do not want to sound as though I am carping and whinging about Manchester and its success. I wish Manchester all the very best. It has done some good things, not least in television. In the old days, it provided not only the light entertainment typified by Granada's &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, but some very good investigative programmes, such as &quot;World in Action&quot;. I would not detract from Manchester's history or its capacity and ability to promote itself and do well, but I honestly believe that when we look at the totality of the north-west&mdash;a heavily populated, relatively compact but region&mdash;I question whether the concentration of facilities and investment in Manchester is something for the north-west as a whole to be pleased about.</p>
	<p>I should point out our history. At one time, television facilities were promised&mdash;indeed, they were provided at one stage&mdash;by ITV, or Grenada as it then was, in Lancaster, Preston, Liverpool and Chester. However, the ITV company clawed back from that provision, starting with the &quot;This Morning&quot; show with Richard and Judy, which was produced in Merseyside but was pulled out and taken to London. ITV has a mere token presence in Liverpool now. Not long ago, I asked it about the building in Liverpool in which it is housed, and I was told that it would be the base from which it would cover Liverpool's year of being the European capital of culture in 2008. However, I read the following week in the local newspaper that it was selling the building to national museums and galleries on Merseyside.</p>
	<p>We have a history of not getting a fair share of the pie, and I do not believe that we are getting a fair share now. The truth of the matter is that the technology allows businesses&mdash;whether the BBC or ITV&mdash;to locate in a whole variety places. ITV is now being consolidated into one company, but despite its best wishes and the 50 per cent. of regionally produced programmes, I believe that ITV will become more London-centric. All Manchester is doing is following what happened for a while in the 70s. We are consolidating the BBC on two sites instead of one. I do not think that it is meeting the regional requirement in terms of jobs or best value. It is not reflecting, in any shape or form, what I understand still to be a prime requirement on both independent television and the BBC: ensuring that there is regional content that really reflects regional needs and diversity.</p>

	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) on securing this important debate. I am a big supporter of BBC North West and ITV, but I believe that both organisations as they stand now are failing the north-west public. Regional programmes and news have declined in recent years, and the quality and content of the programmes is on a downward spiral. If both ITV and the BBC are to justify their charter and licence obligations, we should be able to expect high standards from both organisations. As far as I can see there is reduced coverage of local and national political issues. There is a lot less coverage of Westminster and party conferences. I was amazed to discover that ITV no longer had a desk at party conferences. ITV journalists wandered around without a base. It was difficult for politicians who wanted to talk to them about some of the issues that were being addressed at the conference to get in touch with them. It is certainly a step backwards, in my view.</p>
	<p>The current affairs programmes that we see on both BBC and ITV in the north-west are of a lower quality and the coverage is not what it used to be. Most of the current programmes are of the &quot;Kilroy&quot; variety. They take complex issues and turn them into soundbites. They prefer to provoke political punch-ups than to get to the bottom of a complex issue or to inform the general public. They are more of an entertainment. They deal with trivia, gossip and scandal. A typical example would be the recent programme in which a prospective parliamentary candidate was selected. I do not know whether any other Members watched that, but I watched with horror as a racist was eventually chosen as the most suitable candidate to stand in the forthcoming general election. That is unacceptable television. It drags standards down even lower.</p>

	<p>The responsibility lies with the management of those organisations. The north-west group of MPs will be inviting the head of the regional programme news to a meeting to discuss some of the issues that we are raising here today. Generally most of us are dissatisfied with the management of both those organisations as regards regional programming. It will be difficult to change both organisations. When I speak to representatives of the BBC and ITV, they seem to think that politicians should support them because they are there. They say, &quot;Well, we are Granada and we have existed for many years, so just support us.&quot; The only justification for granting a charter, and for allowing people to be charged a licence fee, is that the broadcasters provide good-quality programmes and deal with regional issues. If they fail to do that, we will have to look at other forms of media, and my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton has suggested ways to do that.</p>
	<p>There must be a complete review of both those organisations. The regulator needs to look far more closely at the content of their programmes. He also needs to hold them to the agreements they made when the charters were first signed, because I do not believe that they are maintaining the conditions of their charter. They should be challenged on a regular basis if that can be proved, and I think evidence could be provided to demonstrate that.</p>

	<p>I think so. I hope that the decentralisation of BBC services will be a continual programme, and that over the coming years more and more of those functions will be put out to the regions. I certainly think they should be spread around regions; I do not see why Manchester or Liverpool, or any one centre, should get the whole of the operation.</p>
	<p>Frankly, I think that the BBC is very bad at managing its resources. People quite rightly criticise the size of the licence fee and the amount of money that the general public have to pay for the BBC. The least it can do is ensure that it is as cost-efficient as it can be. It cannot be cost-efficient while the majority of the programmes and the majority of the organisation are based in London. That runs counter to any logical argument. The second thing that people can expect from the BBC is higher quality. It should set the targets for other media and broadcasters to follow. It is running scared of satellite services. It is dumbing down programmes and running after the same sort of audience. In doing so, it is doing a disservice to itself and to the general public.</p>
	<p>Our democratic system relies on the information flow to the general public. If we are not going to use the television systems&mdash;the BBCs and the ITVs&mdash;to get over the complex issues and to start to debate them, and to explain what we are doing in places such as this one about addressing those serious issues, how will we have a thriving democracy?</p>
	<p>It is about time that the Government took a tough line with these people and set out clear, precise, rational ideas about what they want from the BBC and from the independent ITV services. The regulator should take a much tougher line if they fail to meet standards. We want to see them not just once every five years or whenever the charter is renewed. We should have a regular review to ensure that they are delivering what they promised. In terms of both the BBC and ITV services, failures are taking place.</p>
	<p>I hope that this debate will start one within the BBC and ITV and I hope that they will start to realise that they cannot take the support that I think they enjoy from most people in this Room unless they deliver the product that we expect them to. It is a sad day when MPs have to stand up and say that.</p>
	<p>I am not having a go at individuals in the BBC or ITV. I like most of the people who work in both those services. Many of the creative people and the people in front of the camera understand what we are saying. If they were not employed by those organisations, they would be making the same points as myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton have made today. I hope that the management will start to examine the issue. We need to hand some things back.</p>

	<p>My hon. Friend is far more knowledgeable about these things than I, but I take the point that he made. We do not just want the existing services decentralised to our region. We want our region to be able to develop its own programmes and to focus on local issues in current affairs, general programmes and news. We want a north-west based service that deals with north-west issues.</p>
	<p>It is ironic that when I meet people in the media round here they often come from the north-west. My hon. Friend just mentioned one such person. It is amazing. One falls over such people down here. All those people have to travel down to London to make a career in television and it is a disgrace. As I said, it makes no economic or cultural sense. The sooner we get back to a system where the BBC represents us all and not just a small elite in London, the better.</p>

	<p>I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) on his good fortune in securing this debate and on the comprehensive way in which he introduced the subject.</p>
	<p>We are all anxious to emphasise that this is not another scouser whinge. We are not complaining that Manchester is getting a bigger share of the cake or voicing sub-regional enmity towards Manchester based on football rivalry or some esoteric event in the past. We are certainly not going to bring the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) into the debate; enough has been said on that subject. What my hon. Friend has described is a systemic failure. Large corporations do not know how to provide services that are essentially regional in character&mdash;that is the truth of the matter. The business logic of their position is always to go back to what they know best and centralise everything, usually in London. My hon. Friend, other people and I have tried to address these problems over the years, and he rehearsed the arguments more fully than I need to. Repeatedly, we have been given assurances about services that would be located on Merseyside and for a short while they have been, but as soon as it has become inconvenient to maintain them, away they go. Until the next time there is some negotiation about charters or licence fees, the issue is completely forgotten about. That is how large corporate bodies operate.</p>
	<p>I listened to the statement made by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, my right hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Tessa Jowell) in the Chamber this afternoon. I was particularly encouraged by what she said about regional broadcasting&mdash;that &quot;To reflect the whole of the United Kingdom and its different and diverse communities, the BBC also needs to make sure that a significant slice of production takes place outside London. It needs to provide a specific range of services for the UK's nations and regions. People should see the full diversity of the UK and their local communities reflected in mainstream as well as regional programming.&quot; That is what is to happen in the BBC, and is precisely the direction in which my hon. Friends the Members for Liverpool, Walton and for St. Helens, North (Mr. Watts) and I are trying to steer provision.</p>

	<p>Generally, I agree; I simply did not want to get involved in a debate about proportions, although I intend to cover how such matters should be guaranteed in future. My hon. Friends make a good point.</p>
	<p>My first point is similar to one made by my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, North about what gets covered by whom and where. The current preoccupation in news and current affairs is with headline issues. If there is a big issue in Liverpool and stations have someone available, they might send a film crew out to cover it, but there are all sorts of things going on below the radar that nobody covers.</p>
	<p>I have a specific example. On Monday morning my hon. Friend and I attended an event in his constituency organised by the Young Women's Christian Association. It involved a group of&mdash;from what I could gather&mdash;teenage and single mothers talking about the difficulties that they experienced. Their agenda was for better buggy access to public transport and more breastfeeding facilities in all sorts of places. What took place was a fascinating discussion about how they got to where they were, the problems that they face and what they think that schools should have done. I will not bore the Chamber with what they think about men in general, but it is not very flattering. That would have made fascinating television, but who turned up? The <i>St. Helens Star</i>, Radio Merseyside and a couple of other print journalists attended, but nobody from the television companies did so, even though it would have been a fascinating film. Such activity is replicated all over Merseyside, and probably all over the north-west, and nobody expresses the slightest interest in it.</p>
	<p>My second point, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton also referred, is that there is an enormous amount of talent. Liverpool John Moores university, with which I have an association as an alumnus and as the father of another graduate&mdash;my oldest son&mdash;has an excellent facility for training film and television programme makers. In fact, it covers the whole gamut of media studies&mdash;a branch of learning that takes a knocking in some quarters but covers a growing market with a growing number of jobs. There are talented people on Merseyside but, as my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, North said, they mostly end up having to go somewhere else. How do young potential programme and film makers get into the corporations that have the power to commission programmes? I do not know how, but there are some things that can be done to encourage them.</p>
	<p>The same is true of young musicians. My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton is involved in the Mersey music industry and was instrumental in the organisation of a very good concert in support of UNICEF. There are a lot of young musicians about, but how do they ever get showcased? Who takes any interest in them? If there were another Beatles out there, would anybody actually spot them? I do not know that anybody is producing the music programmes that provide local or regional opportunities.</p>

	<p>As ever, my hon. Friend adds great weight to my argument. A serious amount of young talent is simply not being tapped, but what can be done about it?</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend mentioned the potential of a north-west digital platform. Like my right hon. Friend the Minister, when I was young I trained in engineering, but as my family will confirm, I am so technophobic now that my sister-in-law managed to receive 14 texts from my new mobile phone that I never sent. I am hopelessly incompetent with technology, and if I were to show the next part of my speech to my family they would laugh loudly.</p>
	<p>The north-west digital platform is made up of three constituent parts: first, a digital television channel; secondly, a digital content hub and, thirdly, a broadband internet site&mdash;that is how my hon. Friend managed to link it into his Chubby Chasers website, about which he earlier refused to reveal more. That is the basic proposal from Phil Redmond of Mersey Television, who says:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The platform will initially occupy a dedicated television channel available on digital satellite (BSkyB), digital terrestrial (Freeview) and digital cable (Telewest e.g.). This channel will become the region's digital shop-window promoting and showcasing regionally produced content, products and services on a free-to-air basis.&quot;</p>
	<p>That is where we want to go. That is how all that young talent will be identified and developed.</p>
	<p>At this stage, it is only a proposal on the Secretary of State's desk, but Ofcom is proposing a public service publishing fund of &pound;300 million. A public service publisher means something slightly different from the traditional publisher. There will be an access fund&mdash;a way of commissioning that is outside the stultifying central way of doing things at present. I support Ofcom's proposal, which provides a means by which the deficiencies that we have described can be put right. It is important not only to get the money in place but to ensure that the fund is properly administered in a way that meets the regional objectives and that it can be accessed by independent people outside ITV, Five, Channel 4 and the BBC. The only way we will expand regional input and output is by encouraging more independent people to be involved and giving them the means to do it.</p>
	<p>To return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton in an intervention, my right hon. Friend the Minister should ensure that such matters are nailed down in legislation where that is appropriate, or, if it is not appropriate, in proper regulations. Too many promises have been made that were never delivered because there was no statutory basis on which they were given. If Ofcom says that something will be done, it should be codified and monitored to ensure that it actually does what it says it will do.</p>
	<p>The BBC have an obligation to consider the potential on Merseyside&mdash;my hon. Friends and I include St. Helens, Knowsley and Sefton as well as Liverpool in that area, and my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, South (Mr. Chapman) would add Wirral, too. The potential is there and if BBC Online can be relocated, I hope that my hon. Friend and his ministerial colleagues will point the BBC in the direction of Merseyside because we have a great deal to offer.</p>
	<p>There are many things that can be done and there is a great deal of potential out there. I hope that the Government, whom I support in almost everything, will act as the catalyst to ensure that the potential is used to make programmes and films, that performing is encouraged and that they ensure that the fascinating things that are going on below the radar are broadcast so people can see what is going on at community level.</p>

	<p>When I entered the room, I was genuinely horrified to hear the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) speaking. I know that that is a common reaction, but in my case it was because I had mistimed the sitting. My hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) asked me to speak on his behalf in this debate and, despite my grovelling apologies for being late, that decision will have a beneficial outcome, because I can guarantee that I will be even more supportive of the general thrust of the hon. Gentleman's argument&mdash;possibly even more so than my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p>I was sorry to miss the first part of the hon. Gentleman's contribution. He has bravely broken the golden rule of the politician, which is not to annoy the media&mdash;a rule to which I subscribe in most circumstances. Very few people break that rule. The Mayor of London is an exception and the hon. Member for St. Helens, North (Mr. Watts) has done it to some extent on this occasion, but politicians normally do not do it. People might have expected the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton to defer to that rule and not put his city before transient popularity, but he seems to have done precisely the reverse.</p>
	<p>There is a false choice on offer, because the BBC can genuinely be persuaded that it is in its interest to look harder at Liverpool. That is not an anti-Manchester point, but a recognition of the position that I hope the BBC will bear in mind. The BBC needs to take into account important sub-regional interests and genuine sub-regional differences, which should be reflected in regional broadcasting. I welcome the move of the BBC and its executive to the north. In turn, the BBC should welcome the wealth and diversity of talent that it will find there and recognise that, whatever it thinks, the north-west is not homogenous and that centralisation exclusively in Manchester might be a mistake.</p>
	<p>We are all aware, as are broadcasters in Merseyside, how poor the BBC facilities are. I understand that there is only one small studio in Paradise street that contains little modern, up-to-date equipment and requires considerable technical assistance from the Manchester end. That is not desirable in Liverpool, a capital of culture and one of Britain's major cities. I concur with the sentiments of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton and I support their general thrust.</p>
	<p>Public service broadcasting in general was mentioned by the hon. Member for St. Helens, North, who has observed, as do we all, what I call the tabloidisation of the BBC and its tendency to reduce serious issues to simple conflicts of opinion. One can understand to some extent the BBC's point of view&mdash;it feels obliged to demonstrate that it can get the ratings to justify the money that it charges the public, so it has two competing objectives: first, to get the ratings, and secondly, to be a responsible public service broadcaster. The result is a muddle, because those are two different things: one deals with what is attractive to the public and the other deals with what is important to the public, and the two things do not necessarily coincide. There is a resolution to that difficulty for the BBC, which is to make the genuinely important things attractive. That is not impossible; it can and should be done.</p>
	<p>I concur with the sentiments expressed by other hon. Members. Regional journalism, whether in the broadcast media or the press, and even local journalism in our own areas, is in many ways individualistic, sharp-edged. It has a great deal to contribute. Since coming to Westminster, I have been amazed by the somewhat herd-like tendencies of the parliamentary lobby and the national media. Perhaps I may give a recent, slightly controversial example. If I were to tell my local press that I was to make an announcement about something on Monday, they would say, &quot;Well, we'll wait until Monday. You go ahead and do it and we will report you then.&quot; However, I note that in their pre-election run-up the Conservatives tell us each Sunday what they will announce on Monday and receive massive coverage throughout the BBC. That strikes me as a bizarre journalistic response, but that is by the bye.</p>

	<p>I congratulate the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) on obtaining the debate on a day when broadcasting is particularly topical and when most of us are focusing on the BBC. I hope that that will mean that his remarks receive even greater attention than they would otherwise.</p>
	<p>As a Member of Parliament who represents a constituency in Essex, which is some way removed from north-west England, I take a relatively neutral position in the debate between Manchester and Liverpool. The hon. Gentleman is correct to say that, when I read the subject of his debate on the Order Paper, I was not entirely clear what he wished to pursue. He informed me helpfully of that before the debate, so I shall be brief.</p>

	<p>When I spoke to the hon. Gentleman, I was not entirely clear myself about the subject matter of the debate. He should not be put off by the fact that he represents an Essex constituency. After all, the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) received copious coverage in the north-west not so long ago.</p>

	<p>It is my hon. Friend's experience that causes me to be even more cautious and perhaps more brief than I would usually be.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman said that ITV had apparently shown little interest in his debate, but I want to say a few words in defence of ITV. It sent me a brief on its activities in the north-west for use in the debate, which I shall be happy to share with him after our discussions if he has not seen it. ITV has been a regionally structured entity. We have recently seen the coming together of the regional companies to form ITV plc, which is probably in the interests of ITV in the new, much more competitive broadcasting environment. We have also received assurances, which I hope will be kept to, that ITV will remain very much regionally focused. Granada, its regional company in the north-west, is perhaps one of the best-known companies&mdash;if not the best known&mdash;in the group. ITV has made clear to me that it employs 1,000 core staff in the region and that it contributes &pound;150 million to the creative economy in the north-west, which I understand is now the heart of ITV's children's programming.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for St. Helens, North (Mr. Watts) referred to the controversial production, &quot;Vote for Me&quot;, which I, too, watched with some horror. Having seen the effect on the music industry of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, I was concerned that &quot;Vote for Me&quot; might have a similar effect on the House of Commons. The fact that almost no one watched it is therefore of some comfort to me. I do not think that we can expect Mr. Hilton-Potts to arrive here after the general election.</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman is right to distinguish between regional production and regional programming; they are totally different, and the quota I mentioned is for regional production. However, I also want to talk about regional programming, because that is important in terms of reflecting the way of life in the north-west. It is an expensive activity for ITV to undertake&mdash;indeed, in some cases, the regional production quotas may increase costs. Ofcom rightly identifies a problem in that ITV is having to compete against broadcasters that are not subject to public service obligations, and the value that ITV currently enjoys from having access to the analogue spectrum is diminishing as a result of the steady growth of digital penetration. Ofcom rightly flagged up the problems ITV will face, which led it to recommend that the obligation for non-news and current affairs regional programming should be reduced.</p>
	<p>Two hon. Members referred to the Ofcom proposal for a public service publisher. I do not find that option attractive: I am not drawn to the idea of creating another nationalised broadcaster at a time when there is a proliferation of channels. However, I regret the Secretary of State's apparent dismissal of the recommendation of Lord Burns to allow commercial broadcasters to have access to licence fee money. We understand that that was supported by Lord Birt in No. 10 Downing street, but it did not find favour in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. I regret that, because that recommendation provides a potential solution to the problem that ITV will face in maintaining public service broadcasting. If people believe that it is important that commercial television companies continue to offer regional programming, whether from the north-west or elsewhere, supporting them to do so seems an appropriate use of public money . That could have been achieved under that recommendation in the Burns report.</p>
	<p>ITV is a commercial company. It must compete and survive in the marketplace, unlike the BBC. The BBC receives &pound;2.8 billion of public money and is rightly subject to strong public service obligations. It has something like 27,000 employees, and I entirely share the feelings expressed by the hon. Member for St. Helens, North about visiting television centre and seeing miles and miles of corridors. There is no question that it is expensive to produce programmes in London and the south-east, and the BBC has a duty to be present across the whole of the United Kingdom. For that reason, I support, so far as it goes, the transfer of programme making away from London to Manchester. I understand the feeling of the Merseyside Members here today that Manchester may not seem a huge improvement on London. The BBC, on the other hand, says that the move will help to create a hub of media excellence, which is what it is trying to do in Manchester.</p>
	<p>Where I feel the BBC could do more, and from which Merseyside could benefit&mdash;as would every area of the United Kingdom&mdash;would be to increase by a significant amount the proportion of its programmes made by independent production companies. The Government imposed on the BBC a requirement to meet a 25 per cent. quota of independent production. It is a disgrace that, for a number of years in succession, the BBC has failed to meet that quota. It has now said that it will view it as an absolute minimum and has talked about creating a window of opportunity for the next 25 per cent. I was interested in the Secretary of State's remark a couple of hours ago that she feels that that may not go far enough. I certainly do not feel that it goes far enough. The BBC has enormous power to encourage the creative economy in Merseyside and throughout the United Kingdom by investing more in independent production. I urge the Secretary of State to do more than just consider that.</p>
	<p>The other area that I should like to touch on is radio. When discussing broadcasting, it is very easy to concentrate on television and forget about radio. Radio is very locally based and some of the most successful radio stations are plugged into the centre of their communities. I also welcome, therefore, the opportunities that the Communications Act 2003 will provide for even more localised radio stations, such as community radio.</p>
	<p>I end by agreeing strongly with the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton about the potential for alternative forms of broadcasting, particularly the internet and through the growth of new technology. There is no doubt that the world is changing very rapidly indeed. In some ways, the idea of the BBC or ITV dominating the broadcasting sector will not survive for much longer. As we move into an age of multimedia convergence, the opportunities for extremely localised broadcasting&mdash;Toxteth Television or the Chubby Chasers website, which I am clearly going to have rush from the Chamber to access&mdash;represent a potentially very important new sector in the media. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on obtaining this debate and wish him well in his efforts to attract even more of the creative economy into his city.</p>

	<p>I shall try to remain within the confines of the title of the debate&mdash;broadcasting in the north-west of England&mdash;and not stray too far from that. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) on securing the debate. He knows as well as other hon. Members who have participated that it has been the subject of a number of Adjournment debates in the House. There is tremendous interest in regional television, particularly in an age when broadcasting is increasingly a global business. I am particularly reassured to see some much affection for programmes that reflect the identities of different groups and regions around the country. I suppose, to use the jargon, that it is a case of &quot;think globally, act locally&quot;.</p>
	<p>I should like to take this opportunity to emphasise the Government's real commitment to the regional dimension of public service broadcasting. That has been reflected this afternoon in the statement on the broadcasting Green Paper made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. We also built it into the Communications Act 2003, ensuring that broadcasters continue to invest time and money in producing high quality programmes for the regions.</p>
	<p>A key challenge that now faces the regulator&mdash;Ofcom&mdash;is how public service obligations, such as programming for the nations and the regions, can best be maintained in a period of rapidly increasing competition and the huge impact of digital take-up. That is where Ofcom's review of public service television broadcasting and the future extent of regional broadcasting on commercial channels become important. The third and final phase of Ofcom's review was published a few weeks ago and has been fed into the charter review process. The charter review Green Paper has been published today.</p>
	<p>An important part of Ofcom's review is the examination of ITV's public service obligations and the requirements placed on it to produce a certain amount of regional programming. Those obligations are set out in the 2003 Act, and Ofcom has the responsibility of implementing them. Notably, it has to define what constitutes, in the words of section 287 of the Act, a &quot;sufficient amount&quot; of regional programming in the context of ITV's overall public service obligations. As has already been indicated, ITV has already pledged &pound;50   million to ensure continued investment in its regional network production.</p>

	<p>As the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) said, that was the subject of debate during the passage of the Communications Act. It is Ofcom's responsibility under section 287 of the 2003 Act to determine what is a &quot;sufficient amount&quot; of regional programming.</p>
	<p>As I said, ITV has already pledged &pound;50 million to ensure continued investment in its regional network production. That will secure a move to more out-of-London production. ITV has shown further commitment to regional news by beginning a &pound;40 million investment programme in its digital news centres across the UK.</p>
	<p>Ofcom is therefore faced with some hard choices. Those who disagree with its conclusions that the current regional broadcasting quotas are unsustainable need to be able to demonstrate either that ITV can sustain all its public service broadcasting obligations regardless of the impact of increased competition, or that some other element of its obligations should be removed.</p>

	<p>I am glad to see that the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)&mdash;the Minister for Thanet&mdash;is here. We shall be able to resume our discussions&mdash;and possibly our duels&mdash;on this matter.</p>
	<p>I want to focus on acute services in my constituency. However, it is worth saying at the outset that there has recently been steady progress on many fronts on health in my constituency. For instance, in the past those who had had strokes were often left with very little support or assistance. However, recently a new stroke unit at Hemel Hempstead hospital has been offering a much-extended and appropriate service. I should like to place on the record my thanks to the many voluntary bodies that campaigned so hard for that, including Dacorum hospital action group, and to the Government for having the courage to increase national insurance by 1p to raise the funds to improve our health services.</p>
	<p>Although similar developments for some other serious conditions are at an earlier stage in terms of effective provision, I am encouraged by the Minister's recent reply to me about the provision of nursing specialists for conditions such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. In general, there has been a very welcome focus on the plight of those with chronic long-term conditions. For that group to be helped, health services need to be willing to have a close liaison with social services. Hertfordshire has been a leading authority in making progress in that area, with explicit Government support. A good Government produce real benefits, particularly for those groups of people who have reached a time of life or who are in such a condition that they need the help of others. In that regard, the Government are a good Government carrying out their mandate. However, it is inevitable that in an Adjournment debate I should focus on those areas in which the train looks a bit as if it is coming off the rails. That is my intention in this debate.</p>
	<p>As far as the community that I represent is concerned, the body that occasions so much grief is called the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire strategic health authority. I want to make it clear that I realise that health provision needs to be planned outside the scope of a single constituency&mdash;or possibly that of a single county, although that would be more difficult. However, a lot of the complaints that I wish to make relate very much to the people who have been given that job and how they have chosen to do it.</p>
	<p>It was pretty unusual that a newspaper advert by the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire health authority&mdash;&quot;Healthcare fit for Herts&quot;&mdash;was taken to the Advertising Standards Authority, which found that the advertisement was deceptive. That is an astonishing thing to happen to a public body, and there ought to be much more public accountability when that kind of thing happens. Recently, that health authority had another shot: &quot;Better care for sick children&quot;, it said. In that advertisement it talked about there being a bigger, purpose-built ward, although we know that beds for children in the area are going to be reduced from 35 to 26. That advertisement too will doubtless end up at the Advertising Standards Authority, but this time we would welcome the Minister's interest in the fact that a public body has used public money to give a demonstrably false impression to the public.</p>
	<p>It has not simply been that. An edition of the <i>Health Service Journal</i> recently had a brief headline; the letter F was followed by three stars, which were followed by the word &quot;off&quot;. One does not need to be a genius to work out what the stars stood for. That expression was used repeatedly by the chief executive of the strategic health authority and was directed at the chief executive of the West Hertfordshire Hospitals trust at a Christmas dinner.</p>
	<p>The result of that exchange was that it made the headlines of the <i>Health Service Journal,</i> as it should, as an example of the sort of behaviour that should not be tolerated in public servants. It also occasioned the resignation of the chief executive of that trust, someone who had the trust of the community that I represent. The person who preceded the current occupant of the chief executive's chair of the strategic health authority, John de Braux, also had that trust.</p>
	<p>The previous incumbent was Jane Herbert. She made every effort to understand the Hertfordshire health economy and the role that Hemel Hempstead hospital in particular, and the large undeveloped site next to it, could play in trying to secure improved health provision for the people of my constituency and those around it.</p>
	<p>I put it to the Minister that not simply is such behaviour, on the face of it, at least problematic, but it is extremely strange that there seems to be no way in which that behaviour can be called into question, as it should be.</p>
	<p>The advertisement that I mentioned gave what I can only call a pernicious interpretation of a health strategy that people have been using. The pernicious interpretation involves projecting forward to 2012, when, we are told, there will be marvellous new facilities at Hatfield and Watford. I have in front of me an artist's impression of a field, which is yet to be designated, and a wonderful new hospital at Hatfield. So far, so good. I hope that the people of Hatfield enjoy their new facility. That is not the issue. The issue is whether, as part of that strategy, we should be planning for a reduction of level of service in certain areas of the county.</p>
	<p>On Monday, I went to a meeting to discuss the reconfiguration of children's services in my area; it was not a reconfiguration, but a contraction&mdash;from a significant number of beds to rather less. The pernicious interpretation of the strategy involves the idea of creating a hospital at Watford one day, costing, let us say, &pound;330 million. It will be accessible by some kind of monorail from Hemel Hempstead, which will get people there in, let us say, 10 minutes. I suspect that if that were the case, there might not be too much worry in my constituency about the health facilities that people need being quite far away. As it stands, they could be enormously far away.</p>
	<p>That does not apply only to health. In 1993, my local further education college was combined with a college in Watford. Then, all the services at Hemel Hempstead began to be contracted. As a result, there is little FE provision for my constituents, because Watford is too far away. Kids stay on at school doing unsuitable subjects, because the alternatives are non-existent.</p>
	<p>The Government say that they want national health service customers to have choice. My constituents want the choice of being treated in their local hospital, not only because it is convenient and gives them a good service, but because as things stand Watford is a hospital in the process of demolition. To move a service from a perfectly functioning hospital with a large number of new facilities to a hospital that is in the process of being demolished is entirely perverse.</p>
	<p>If that is the strategy, one should at the very least make the best possible use of the excellent hospital at one's disposal, while perhaps reconfiguring services or doing demolition jobs at the target hospital. Indeed, that is exactly what has happened elsewhere in Hertfordshire in the relationship between Stevenage hospital and hospitals in the Welwyn Hatfield area. Services have been established at Stevenage to try to ensure that at least Stevenage plays an appropriate role in the transition process, which is anything but finalised and has yet to get even an outline business case.</p>
	<p>Why is not Hemel Hempstead playing such a role? The answer is, because we are severely disaffected with the strategic health authority. It wants to ensure that we are brought into line by effectively taking every decision as quickly as it can in what I can only describe as a malevolent way. There is no rational argument here. The language that is used and the advertisements that we are forced to plough through, all have the effect of marginalising the process of rationality.</p>
	<p>One of the issues that we have tried to get across repeatedly&mdash;utterly unsuccessfully so far, but with the Minister's help perhaps that can change&mdash;is the fact that efforts are being made to get a regeneration programme going in Hertfordshire. I have taken a particular interest in that regeneration programme because there is land in my constituency that is in public ownership and not in the green belt. Without any infraction on amenity space it could provide a site for a significant programme of affordable housing for our youngsters and for the next generation.</p>
	<p>That land is potentially available and yet whenever we mention that Hemel Hempstead might take some of the regeneration that Hertfordshire is expected to achieve, there has never been any suggestion of trying to improve the health infrastructure to service that enlarged community. That is not because it is not a reasonable thing to request, but because we have a health authority that is entirely unreasonable and deaf to rational argument. When I put those arguments to the strategic health authority board there was a stony silence. When the board asked whether there were any questions, the answer was &quot;No.&quot; There were no questions, no interest and no engagement. The response was simply, &quot;Mr. McWalter, you are from Hemel Hempstead. You are out of the loop and the quicker you get out of the room, the better.&quot; Well, we are not going away.</p>
	<p>There is a desperate democratic deficit in all this. I sat in a room on Monday and people on a top table had the power of decision in these matters. Where was their democratic mandate? I represent a parliamentary constituency. I ought to have a say. But the people who were taking the decision included the chair of the local primary care trust. She voted in favour of these proposals. I think she was leant on somewhat, but I cannot believe that more than 1 per cent. of my constituents would vote in favour of these plans. The main political parties at the next election will all be opposed to them. If somebody stood at the next election on a pro-strategic health authority ticket&mdash;a &quot;Consolidate Children's Services at Watford&quot; party&mdash;I wonder exactly how many votes they would get. The only votes would be from people who accidentally put their cross in the wrong box. Yet the chair of the primary care trust voted for them and not for the huge majority of people in my area. That is a democratic deficit.</p>
	<p>We are also told that the Government will not carry out any major reconfiguring of services. That is bad news for the strategic health authority because it really does not like Dacorum primary care trust. It is the oddball&mdash;the one that the authority could not bribe its way to get. I use that term not in the sense of personal benefits but in the sense that when Watford looked as though it would oppose the plans, along came a &pound;330  million development to stuff its mouth with gold and ensure that it came into line. My constituency was never offered that. The reality now is that the strategic health authority has decided that our primary care trust does not need its own chief executive, so it will give us a joint one. Who with? Watford. Where is she based? Watford. There is a de facto joining together of primary care trusts to quieten further the voice of my constituents on these important matters.</p>
	<p>Many people in the country are seeing the benefits of having a Government who have had a passion for health and a commitment to improvement, to making an investment in our health services and to changing tack from the story of asset stripping and provision reduction that characterised health in the 1980s and 1990s. That resulted in proposals that all Hertfordshire hospitals should close, that there should be only one and that the system should be much smaller to be economical. We fought off the report proposing that, called &quot;The Right Approach&quot;, and we fought off a number of other threats.</p>
	<p>This debate is not about the closure of Hemel Hempstead hospital but about service displacement, irrationality, profligacy and an authority that should be much more democratically accountable than it is now. I ask the Minister to review the events that I have described with a view, as I have asked before, to suspending those who treat people in such a way, to inquiring into the falsehoods perpetrated in advertisements and, eventually, to giving us some people whom we can trust to listen to our arguments.</p>

	<p>I congratulate my hon.   Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter) on yet again securing a debate on this matter. I know that it is of great concern to him and his constituents. I responded to the debate that he secured in December 2003, I have had meetings with him, and my officials and I have studied the reports that he has written in recent months. He has for many years been a fervent supporter of his local hospital and the services that it provides. Whatever else his constituents may have concerns about, they can be sure that they have a Member of Parliament who is tireless in campaigning on their behalf.</p>
	<p>Like the people of Hemel Hempstead, my hon. Friend is eager to secure the high-quality health services that any community should expect. That vision is shared by the Department of Health and the local national health service in Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire. I am sorry that he feels that advertisements placed by the strategic health authority have been unfair or misleading. Misleading adverts should not be placed, and I shall be interested to hear the views of the Advertising Standards Authority.</p>
	<p>It is a fact that we need to change if we are to improve. Our health care system is under pressure. Patients are still waiting too long for their operations, and many hospitals are in a poor state and need updating. My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The huge amount of money that the Government are putting into health care is driving improvements nationally, including in his constituency, but we still have a lot to do, and those pressures need to be addressed. That has been the case for many years, but we realise that we in Whitehall cannot make decisions about local matters, because we do not know areas as well as local people do. That is why, under our &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power&quot; policy, we pushed decision making down to local areas.</p>
	<p>Frankly, across Beds and Herts some health services, particularly the major hospitals, are unlikely to be able to deliver the quality of, and continuous improvement in, care that we expect in England in the 21st century. In West Herts the situation is particularly acute, with the local trust zero star rated. The NHS cannot accept that, and the local NHS is right to demand that it be addressed. That is why there was an initial process to consider changes in health care in the area. That was followed by a formal public consultation known as &quot;Investing in Your Health&quot;, which ran from March to December 2003.</p>
	<p>Due process was followed in that matter. When local NHS organisations have under consideration a proposal for service change they must comply with the consultation requirements of sections 7 and 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001. Section 7 requires the   NHS to consult relevant overview and scrutiny committees on service changes that are of a substantial nature. Nobody disputes that the changes described by my hon. Friend are of a substantial nature. Section 11 requires NHS organisations to consult and involve patients, the public and their representatives in the planning and development of services, and in decisions affecting the operation of services.</p>
	<p>Following the consultation process, the scrutiny committees had the opportunity to refer the issue to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health for intervention. They did not do so. As a result&mdash;I know that this will and does upset my hon. Friend&mdash;even if he were able to convince me of his case, I have no basis for intervention in this matter. It was a matter for local determination, and decisions must now remain with the local NHS.</p>
	<p>During the consultation period, two options for the future reconfiguration of hospital services were proposed. Both entailed retaining six major hospitals in Beds and Herts, including Hemel Hempstead and Watford general hospitals. As my hon. Friend is aware, option 2 was preferred, which would mean a new hospital at Hatfield with a cancer centre, and development of Watford hospital as a major acute hospital and Hemel as a major non-acute hospital.</p>
	<p>I appreciate that that is not the option preferred by my hon. Friend, but this is not about winners and losers; it is about benefits for users of health services across the two counties, and that was the major driver for change. Following on from the consultation process, last April and again in June Department of Health officials reviewed the deliverability of the proposals decided upon by the local NHS, and they were satisfied that they were deliverable. In particular, they were satisfied that the two proposed major acute developments could fit on their proposed sites and meet the highest NHS design and space standards; that the proposals were properly costed and likely to be affordable within a reasonable projection of the health community's resources; that the authority had already completed a significant public consultation, in which the proposals were supported by the vast majority of stakeholders&mdash;I accept that that does not include my hon. Friend and his constituents&mdash;and that the trusts and the strategic health authority understood the challenge of delivering the scheme, and were committed to making the necessary project management resources available.</p>
	<p>An earlier peer review by the capital investment unit for the London strategic investment unit formed similar conclusions. As a result, the scheme was approved by Ministers and announced last July. The scheme is now finalising its procurement strategy and recruiting to its project team so that it can develop its outline business case with a view to procurement commencing in 2006 or early 2007, and construction potentially starting in 2009. I want to assure my hon. Friend that under option 2, Hemel Hempstead hospital has a future and will receive investment of around &pound;25 million to develop it into a modern, high-quality major hospital specialising in planned surgery.</p>
	<p>I also understand that Dacorum primary care trust is developing plans for the site, including an intermediate care facility and possibly a general practitioner surgery and mental health in-patient facilities. I am assured that Hemel hospital will have more patient contacts than Watford and will continue to play a vital role in health service provision for the people of Hertfordshire.</p>
	<p>My hon Friend has raised concerns today about the children's consultation process. May I state clearly that no decision has been made? I understand that Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire strategic health authority has honoured the commitment given during the &quot;Investing in Your Health&quot; consultation process to talk with local people about how it achieves the services laid out in option 2. I am pleased to note that over the past few months the health authority has been listening to the views of local people on the proposals and important issues, such as the opening times for the Hemel children's accident and emergency unit and the design of the new units.</p>
	<p>At a meeting held on Monday, which was open to the public, the proposals on the children's review were unanimously agreed. My hon. Friend might have views as to whether the chairman of the local PCT should have agreed them, but the fact was that they were unanimously agreed. Some of these proposals include a children's rapid assessment unit at Hemel hospital open 12 hours a day, every day, alongside the main accident and emergency department; a rapid referral clinic run alongside the children's out-patient departments at Hemel Hempstead and Watford, offering an alternative to treatment in accident and emergency; a new, specially designed children's day unit at Hemel Hempstead hospital, staffed by specialist children's doctors and nurses and providing planned treatment and surgery; an enhanced community nursing team to ensure that more children could be cared for at home; and a children's in-patient ward at Watford hospital.</p>
	<p>I would advise my hon. Friend to get access to the national service framework for children, which we have recently published, and compare the proposals with the best practice that is set out in the national service framework. If he does not believe that the proposals match that best practice guidance, that would provide him with valuable ammunition with which to challenge the proposals.</p>
	<p>I also appreciate my hon. Friend's concerns regarding the single chief executive for the two local primary care trusts, but may I remind him once again that that is a local decision for the local PCT trust board? I understand that both PCTs are happy with the current arrangements.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend also raised concerns about transport around Watford hospital. I am aware that a transport and access group, drawn from a range of bodies, is studying how public transport can be improved.</p>
	<p>In the final minute available to me, I shall deal with the points made by my hon. Friend in respect of the national position and put them in context. The latest round of revenue allocations to PCTs, covering the period 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08, were announced on 9 February 2005 and represent a &pound;135 billion investment in the NHS over two years. That is equivalent to an average increase of 9.2 per cent. for 2006&ndash;07 and 9.4 per cent. for 2007&ndash;08&mdash;an average of 19.5 per cent. over the two years. As a result of the 2006&ndash;08 allocations, Dacorum PCT will receive record increases in funding. For the current three-year allocation period, covering 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06, Dacorum PCT has received a total increase in its funding of over &pound;33 million, which is an increase of 31.8 per cent. For the two-year allocation period covering 2006&ndash;07 to 2007&ndash;08, the PCT will receive a total increase of &pound;28.2 million, which is an increase of 18.5 per cent.</p>
	<p>I realise that that will provide little comfort to my hon. Friend, who will continue to campaign passionately for Hemel Hempstead hospital, and I have no doubt that between now and any political events that may come up in the near future, he and I will be discussing it further. I hope that we will continue this debate in the Chamber after those political events and that his constituents continue to have a wonderful constituency MP who works hard on behalf of the people who put him here and will continue to do so in future.</p>

	<p>I thank the Speaker for selecting this important topic for debate this afternoon. I know that other hon. Members who represent Scottish constituencies that have ferry ports will want to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p>It is obvious that ferry services are important for islanders. The islands and peninsulas of the west of Scotland have been served for many years by the state-owed Caledonian MacBrayne shipping company, known locally as CalMac. The importance of shipping to the islands is reflected by the well-known parody of the 24th psalm:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The earth is the Lord's, and all it contains, except the Western Isles, which belong to MacBrayne's.&quot;</p>
	<p>That parody shows how important ferry services are to islanders. They dictate much of island life.</p>
	<p>Owing to the small populations on the islands, the CalMac services are viable only because the company receives an annual subsidy from the Scottish Executive. However, because of that subsidy, European Union regulations dictate that those services must be put out to competitive tender. There is no demand from islanders for those services to be put out to tender, but tenders are being forced on the Scottish Executive by the 1992 European maritime cabotage regulations. It is important to note that that demand did not originate in Brussels. It originated much nearer home, from the British Tory Government. That Government held the presidency of the European Union in 1992 and, during the term of their presidency, they pushed the regulations through Europe.</p>
	<p>At the start of the British presidency, the then Transport Secretary, John MacGregor&mdash;now Lord MacGregor&mdash;boasted in a written answer that he would</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;take forward the increasingly rigorous application of the state aid rules in the transport sector so as to provide for full and proper competition in the single market.&quot;</p>
	<p>He certainly succeeded in that aim: he drove the regulations through the Council. However, Lord MacGregor clearly did not have a clue what he was talking about because, in the same written answer, he said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The anachronism of the United Kingdom and some other member states having their coastal trades open while the rest did not will be ended.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons, </i>24 June 1992; Vol. 210, c. 247&ndash;248W.]</p>
	<p>The written answer made it clear that Lord MacGregor was completely unaware that, within the United Kingdom, Caledonian MacBrayne-operated services were not open to competition. When, as President of the Council, he signed the legislation into law, he seemed unaware of the situation on the CalMac routes. So we have a set of European rules that were foisted on us by a Tory Government who did not have a clue about the reality of ferry services in Scotland.</p>
	<p>It is interesting to note that the legislation came into effect on 1 January 1993, yet here we are 12 years later without Britain being compliant with the regulations. During the latter years of the Tory Government, both Secretaries of State for Scotland&mdash;now Lord Lang of Monkton and Lord Forsyth of Drumlean&mdash;wisely ignored the legislation that their Cabinet colleague had promoted. Even the arch-privatiser, Lord Forsyth, decided that it was a privatisation too far.</p>
	<p>The Commission noticed eventually that the United Kingdom was not complying with the legislation and shortly after the establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, it ordered the Scottish Executive to comply. However, the Scottish Executive have found it difficult to comply with the legislation and, after six years of discussion and consultation, they have still not succeeded in coming up with a workable solution.</p>
	<p>It is important to remember that the legislation was designed to open up the lucrative sea routes to holiday islands in the Mediterranean and the Aegean to competition.</p>

	<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I was not aware that the Greeks were still not complying, although I knew that they had a derogation until 2004.</p>
	<p>The measure is completely impractical for the unprofitable routes in the west of Scotland. In the second half of this year, the UK will again hold the EU presidency. My purpose in requesting the debate was to draw the House's attention to how unworkable the proposal is, and, assuming that the Government are still in office and that a certain event does not remove them before then, to ask them to use the power and influence of the presidency to get these unworkable European rules changed, so that the tender does not have to go ahead. A British presidency was responsible for creating this mess; let us make another British presidency bring it to an end.</p>
	<p>I now want to turn to why the European rules are unworkable in the west of Scotland context. If left purely to the market, there would be sailings only to the larger islands and in winter, even those large islands would receive a very poor service; the small islands would have no service at all, so a subsidy is clearly necessary. Under the EU rules that means a tender; a tender means a contract and a contract must have a tight    specification. That means complete timetable inflexibility for the six years of the contract. Under the current arrangements, no one in the public or the private sector would dream of trying to set a ferry timetable six years in advance, but under these rules, that is what has to be done. Until now, timetables have been reviewed every six months and can be altered as circumstances change. That flexibility will go with the tender.</p>
	<p>Six years is the maximum length of the contract that the EU rules allow, but a six-year contract is clearly not long enough to allow the operator to think of the long term and develop the services. The vessels themselves will still be the property of the Scottish Executive, but the operator will be responsible for the maintenance during the six years of the contract. A vessel normally has a working life of about 25 years, but the operator will simply skimp on maintenance and not care what state the vessels are in at the end of the six-year contract. We all know that we look after our own car far better than a hire car, and that is inevitably what will happen in this case.</p>
	<p>The European legislation ignores the fact that shipping services comprise many elements: vessels and crews, and land-based infrastructure such as piers and harbours. In order to implement the legislation, the Scottish Executive will be forced to set up a vessel-owning company with the generic name of Vesco and an operating company with the generic name of Opsco. They have to be set up as two separate companies instead of being integrated into one company, as at present. Clearly, that will cause problems.</p>
	<p>The piers and harbours are owned by many different organisations, some by CalMac, some by local authorities, some by trusts. A multiplicity of contracts between Vesco, Opsco and the port and harbour authorities will be necessary, which reminds me of the railways fiasco. The situation has been called Railtrack on water and we are heading for the same sort of mess.</p>
	<p>Another problem is what happens if the operator, Opsco, goes bankrupt. I doubt if the Scottish Executive will have retained the expertise necessary to step in and pick up the pieces. Any private shipping company asked to step in at short notice will be able to hold the Executive to ransom. After only a few days without a ferry service the islands will start to run out of food and other essential materials.</p>
	<p>In order to compete with the private companies, CalMac will be forced to transfer the employment of its crews offshore to avoid paying United Kingdom employers' national insurance contributions, which will cost the Treasury &pound;1 million a year. Under the EU rules, the Scottish Executive cannot insist on the vessels remaining under a UK flag; they can sail under the flag of any EU country. But other EU countries have lower standards for training and expertise of the crews than Britain, so standards will inevitably fall.</p>
	<p>In order to enforce a contract it clearly needs penalty clauses for lateness or failure to complete a sailing. However, that also leads to problems. Already, because of the penalty clauses in rail contracts, connecting trains will not wait at the station if the boat is late. We will now be faced with the same situation with the ferries. The boats will not wait for the late trains for fear of the penalty clause.</p>
	<p>Inevitably, we will get into a situation when passengers from the train at Oban, say, could even be sprinting along the pier, only to see the captain order the gangway up in order to avoid the penalty clause. To some small islands, the next sailing could be three days later. That is clearly a farcical situation, but it is what we will be faced with under a penalty clause system. A huge majority of my constituents want CalMac to continue to operate these lifeline services. CalMac has its faults&mdash;nobody would say that it is perfect&mdash;and it certainly has plenty, but a public body can be lobbied and pressurised into making changes, whereas a private sector body will be interested only in conforming to the timetable, avoiding penalty clauses and making a profit.</p>
	<p>Crews often live on the islands and are part of the local community. In the small islands, a large proportion of the work force work for CalMac. The crews have a commitment to those islands, whereas a private operator, with crews possibly from the far side of Europe, will not have same commitment to the island communities.</p>
	<p>The legislation has already wasted a great deal of taxpayers' money. CalMac has spent considerable sums engaging consultants and has devoted a great deal of time and energy to preparing for the tendering process that would have been better spent improving ferry services.</p>
	<p>One of the principles of the European Union is subsidiarity, which is supposed to be about devolving power to local communities. However, the Scottish Parliament is against the tendering, as are the local communities. The Government should back those communities in Europe.</p>
	<p>As I have said before, the Tory Minister who was responsible for the legislation had not a clue about the situation in the west of Scotland. He was simply following the &quot;if it moves, privatise it&quot; ideology that gave us Railtrack. Rail privatisation failed. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) wants to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and he will be able to tell the House how these regulations failed the Northern Isles.</p>
	<p>It is also interesting to note that the regulations do not apply to buses. European Governments can subsidise buses without the need for competitive tenders. There is no sense in the rules applying to ferries but not to buses. The Scottish Executive could subsidise the bus to Skye without a tender, so why not the ferry to Tiree? There is no logic in that at all.</p>
	<p>I have explained all the problems that the regulations will cause. In the second half of this year, Britain will be in a uniquely influential position in Europe through holding the presidency. I urge the Government to use that position to persuade the Commission and the Council of Ministers that it simply does not make sense to enforce the rules in the fragile economies of the peninsulas and islands of the west of Scotland. They were designed for the lucrative Mediterranean, where competition might make sense. However, it does not make sense in those fragile economies.</p>
	<p>This unwanted legislation could well wreck those economies completely. It was never designed for such a situation. I remind the Minister that even Lord Forsyth shied away from implementing it. I hope that the Government will not support such a privatisation and I appeal to them to do all that they can to end these unwanted and unworkable rules.</p>

	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) on securing the debate and on having presented a detailed and cogent case on behalf of his island and peninsula communities. I know well the importance of such services to his constituents, as I was born and brought up on one of the islands in his constituency, as well as representing an island constituency.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend highlighted a number of the problems that have resulted from competitive tendering. Such problems are well known to us in the Northern Isles because we are one step down from the situation currently faced by the Western Isles. We have had one round of competitive tendering. The tender was called in early by the Scottish Executive and we are now going through the tendering process for the second time. Many of the fears that my hon. Friend outlined today have been well founded in our experience.</p>
	<p>The matter to which I wish to bring the House's attention today, and on which I seek Government support, is that in the course of the re-tendering process, we have been told that the EU Commission has decided that state aid rules should exclude livestock transportation, so that livestock is to be treated in the same way as any other freight transport. The impact of that on Shetland farmers and crofters is an increase of up to 50 per cent. in the costs that will be exigible for the transportation of sheep and cattle to mainland Scotland. My farmers and crofters are already operating on exceptionally tight margins, so that will be a critical issue to be resolved in the next few months.</p>
	<p>Yet again, I find myself frustrated in the extreme that although state aid rules are intended to ensure open competition, they operate in a narrow, restrictive way that excludes constituents of mine and, I suspect, other peripheral island communities from participating in the marketplace. The European Commission is supposed to operate according to the treaty of Amsterdam, subject to the special treatment of peripherality, as it is called. Island and remote communities can be treated differently, and it is an immense source of frustration to me that that never seems to apply in practice. It is a small point, but I hope that if the opportunity arises for the Minister to support our case, she will do so.</p>

	<p>I should like to congratulate the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) on securing the debate on this important issue, and should like to make two quick points, as I agree pretty much with everything that he said. If it were possible to amend the European regulations, that would be a terrific breakthrough. Can the Minister enlighten us as to whether that is possible?</p>
	<p>My first point is that one of the difficulties that people have is not knowing whether the whole tendering process was initiated at the behest of the Commission and forced upon the Government, or less cleverly, whether it was initiated by the Executive themselves. If people could be sure that it was forced on the Government by the Commission, they would not necessarily be happier, but would realise that such matters have to be accepted without breaking the law. Can the Minister address that point and give a reassurance that it is not something that the Government have initiated or rushed into, and that it has been forced on them? If so, that would be welcome.</p>
	<p>My second point, which was touched on by the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute, concerns the question of the terms and conditions of employees of CalMac, and its health and safety record, which, we would all agree, is second to none. There is concern that the tendering process will threaten both the terms and conditions of those employees and CalMac's health and safety record. The Minister will know that the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers is currently balloting, trying possibly to call industrial action, and we would all agree that it would be disastrous if that went ahead. It would be helpful if the Minister could give a reassurance that nothing in the tendering process will diminish the   continuing commitment of CalMac&mdash;and the Government&mdash;to the health and safety record that it has established on the west coast, as well as to the employees' terms and conditions.</p>

	<p>I congratulate the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) on securing this important debate, and other hon. Members on being here to represent their constituents on this important issue.</p>
	<p>Let me first set out the situation, so that hon. Members are absolutely clear about it. Clearly, the Government have not chosen the situation. In terms of UK law, responsibility for transport links in Scotland lies within the devolved sector, by virtue of the Scotland Act 1998. As the hon. Gentlemen know, the Department for Transport's Ministers have absolutely no say in what ferry services in Scotland should be subsidised, what the specifications are, or what the balance should be between subsidy provision and revenue from the farebox. Crucially, neither do the UK Government have any financial responsibility for any subsidy provided in Scotland. They are matters for local judgment in Scotland. The Scottish Executive have adequate policy and financial powers to support and maintain the lifeline ferry services.</p>
	<p>It is important to make it clear that there is no threat to those services. The Scottish Executive specify the level of service, and will continue to do so. EU guidelines allow alterations to be made to the contract during the six-year period. It is not a matter of setting the level in stone six years in advance and sticking to it throughout. The service pattern can be changed. Neither the Scottish Executive nor the UK Government are, however, free-handed on the method by which such services are procured. Both are strictly bound by the UK's participation in the EU and by what EU policy and practice require.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman pleaded with the Government to change the rules, but whether or not we hold the EU presidency&mdash;I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reaffirming his belief that we will be returned to government after the general election, whenever that is&mdash;and having said that the Commission has the monopoly and the initiative to make changes, the presidency is a neutral chairmanship and does not have the chance to suggest changes to the regulations. We want to make progress on a range of issues, but an amendment to the regulations does not fall within our ambit.</p>
	<p>As hon. Members will know, the EU policy of particular relevance is the single internal market in services and goods and in the movement of citizens and labour. As one would expect, there is a direct application of that doctrine in shipping services, as shipping is pre-eminently a service industry. Most services operating within the EU do so commercially without particular or distorting subsidy. That applies from Finland and Cyprus to Portugal and the UK. Where it is found that the single market is not being correctly applied, the Commission properly investigates and challenges the policies of member states. Where it is not satisfied that specific policies are being applied in accordance with treaty obligations, it is empowered to take member states to court, to seek rectification and to recover any money improperly applied as state aid. All that is inherent in the accession treaty signed by the UK. So we have no choice.</p>
	<p>Inevitably, EU policy on the single market is also translated into EU regulation for purposes of enforcement. There is also, however, provision for addressing circumstances in which, exceptionally, shipping services cannot be sustained on a purely commercial basis. These are cases in which everyone agrees that subsidy is necessary and appropriate. In the case that we are examining today, regulation 3577/92 applies as the requirement specific to the supply of shipping services in EU member states.</p>
	<p>A basic single-market freedom is the freedom to provide services competitively. That applies in shipping, too. It also applies specifically to the freedom to provide those services in return for a subsidy. As all Members know, article 4(1) is key. It states that member states must impose public service obligations on a non-discriminatory basis in respect of all Community shipowners.</p>
	<p>The crucial words are &quot;on a non-discriminatory basis.&quot; An exclusive financial arrangement between a subsidy provider, in this case the Scottish Executive, and a service provider, in this case Caledonian MacBrayne, fails the test. With the completion of a single market, other prospective operators of shipping services must have the opportunity to bid for whatever subsidy the public authority considers to be justified. Accordingly, the current arrangements must be replaced by those that comply with regulation 3577/92.</p>

	<p>As the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute stated, this Government did not negotiate the article. At present, we are stuck with something that was done by the previous Conservative Government. I appreciate the point that the hon. Gentleman made that the lifeline services are crucial to his constituency, and the very fact that it is remote indicates that when the tendering exercise does take place it is unlikely that many other companies would want to tender for the services, as they are specialist services. However, we must accept that they have to be subject to a competitive tender.</p>
