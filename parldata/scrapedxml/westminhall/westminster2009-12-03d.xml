<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-03d.149.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" speakername="David Heath" colnum="149"  time="014:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091203/halltext/91203h0001.htm#09120354000130">
	<p pid="d.149.0/1">This is not the best attended debate I have seen. It seems wrong that Members who every day, in their private conversations and correspondence, show a lively awareness of the work of the House of Commons Commission and of members of staff working in the House should not have sufficient curiosity to ask questions about the Commission's annual report. It is left to the representatives of the three parties to do so. That is regrettable, but perhaps understandable in the present circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="d.149.0/2">The understatement of the year and possibly of the century is contained in the first words of the Speaker's foreword to the report:</p>
	<p pid="d.149.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Recent months have been turbulent for the House.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.149.0/4">They most certainly have. However, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" name="Nick Harvey">the Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey)</phrase> said, the report covers matters that largely fall outside those areas of turbulence. Nevertheless, we owe it to all the staff and Officers of the House to put on record our appreciation of the work they have had to put in under very trying circumstances. I hope that message will be transmitted to those involved.</p>
	<p pid="d.149.0/5">I would also like to thank members of the House of Commons Commission. I do not always say that; I have had my differences with the Commission and with how it sometimes operates, but it has had a particularly difficult row to hoe in recent months.</p>
	<p pid="d.149.0/6">The other specific issues that I want to cover are few. Some things in the report are good and my hon. Friend has already referred to them. One, the Members Centre in Portcullis House, is a huge improvement on previous arrangements. It has been convenient for Members and, I think, works well. Although, as a slightly old-fashioned Member I feel saddened that people are now corralled behind a glass screen when they visit the Chamber and never really get a sense of what the Chamber is like, I nevertheless recognise that the arrangements for visitors, with the new Visitor Centre at the entrance to the House, have been greatly improved. We should put that on record.</p>
	<p pid="d.149.0/7">I am not convinced that the website is entirely user-friendly yet, and we need constant feedback on that process. I am sure that I am not the only Member who still sometimes has difficulty finding things they feel they ought to be able to get to, and quickly, and has to use a circuitous route through cyberspace to get basic information about the business of the House, <i>Hansard</i><i></i>and so on. That may be a sign of my inadequacy in using systems, but if so, it is shared by an awful lot of Members and their staff. We therefore need a continuing dialogue to ensure that the website is improved.</p>
	<p pid="d.149.0/8">One thing that my hon. Friend did not touch on is sharing video footage. He knows that there is some interest in that in the House, and that early-day motion 211 on the subject has been tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">the Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase>. There seems to be an almost inexplicable obstacle to sharing material of the kind that is valuable to people and commonly shared in other legislatures. I would have thought that we want to facilitate rather than obstruct such sharing, and I therefore ask my hon. Friend to take that matter back to the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="d.149.0/9">As far as the fabric of the House is concerned, it will always be difficult to maintain such a building. It is a singular, unique and fantastical building, with huge maintenance requirements. I am interested in what my hon. Friend said about the decanting contingency plans. Have he, his colleagues and the House looked also at the need to find ways of maintaining the fabric of the House that are consistent with the House's meeting for a rather longer time during the summer months or the early autumn?</p>
	<p pid="d.149.0/10">The last time we had experimental meetings in September, it was farcical. It was farcical that so much of the fabric of the House was in a state of refurbishment that it was almost impossible to walk down a corridor, go into an office or even get into the Chamber without falling over something that was under repair. I have dark suspicions about that. I suspect that there was an agenda to prevent us from ever having the effrontery to suggest meeting in September again. However, there is common ground among quite a few Members that the long summer vacation is something that we want to try to avoid-I mean the recess, which is not always a vacation, of course.</p>
	<p pid="d.149.0/11">There is a case for the House's being able to hold the Government to account during the autumn and before the party conference season. If that is inconsistent with the House's maintenance arrangements, I am afraid that those arrangements will have to change, and I do not think that it is unreasonable to suggest that, even with the constraints of keeping up the fabric of the building. It is possible without effectively closing for business for four months a year. I do not know of any large corporation, or stately home even, in the country that does that to carry out its routine maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="d.149.0/12">My next point is an important one and was touched on by my hon. Friend. It is that the environmental performance of the House is simply not good enough. I was very disappointed that the House was not prepared to accede to the motion that I and my right hon. and hon. Friends tabled a few weeks ago effectively to sign up the House to the 10:10 campaign to reduce our emissions. I was disappointed that apparently we could not even make that an aspiration. We are moving in the wrong direction.</p>
	<p pid="d.149.0/13">The figures on environmental performance on page 49 of the report show that energy use per square metre is going up, and has gone up substantially since 2004-05. We had a blip in 2005-06 and I am sure that there was a reason for that; there is a reference to a footnote that simply says &quot;figure revised&quot;. However, the revised figure is higher than the figures for subsequent years but lower than the figure for this year, which is 362.5 kWh per square metre. We ought and need to do better than that. I wonder whether a large part of the current wastage is related to thermoregulation on the estate. Sometimes we are very cold and sometimes extraordinarily hot; very rarely do we seem to be exactly right. Perhaps a small amount of investment could yield dividends in reduced energy use.</p>
	<p pid="d.149.0/14">My last point is on IT for Members, and indeed on the IT systems' operation in the House. This is no criticism of the people who work in the organisation, but sadly it is a constant frustration that continual abuse by Members results in machines being put out of action and things not functioning as they should. There is a repertory company among those who work frequently in the House of Commons Library that feels that the machines there are less than we would wish for in terms of performance, and often seem to let us down, normally at critical moments. We can be working against a deadline and desperately need the machine to print something and it refuses to do so, and I think that that is symptomatic of House procurement policies.</p>
	<p pid="d.149.0/15">We seem to have a gift in the House for buying equipment that is not very good or up to date, and which becomes rapidly not so good or up to date. I know that that is often done to save money, and I do not regret the fact that people are being careful to save money in contracts, but most of us are working on equipment that does not have as good a specification or performance as that which we could buy in our local computer store, or even in our local Tesco.</p>
	<p pid="d.149.0/16">As part of what is provided by the House, we are forced into having equipment that often does not work in our constituencies. I have just taken delivery of a new PDA and because of the phone company with which we have the contract, it works in only a couple of places in my constituency-not in my home as I get no phone signal there-and it frequently breaks down. If I went to a phone shop, I could buy a phone for a lower price with a higher performance. Regrettably, however, if I do that, I cannot have the parliamentary software that I need to maintain contact with the House. That is just a small moan, but one that is commonly shared by Members.</p>
	<p pid="d.149.0/17">My very last point relates to the report of the Members Estimate Audit Committee, but neither of the right hon. Members who chair the Committee is here today. The report, I think, is less comprehensive than I have seen previously. There is less information in it about the audit activities of the Committee. The function of auditing is increasingly important in the context in which we now operate. I am afraid that one of the outcomes of the Legg review will be to throw into sharp relief some of the inadequacies of internal audit over recent years. It will suggest, I think, that a number of payments have come to light that could not be justified and that should have been picked up at audit. The House needs a comprehensive report of audit systems, and to be satisfied that when a specific topic for audit has been undertaken, it receives a full report, which will be available to Members. I put that as a suggestion to my hon. Friend and hope that it will be put in train.</p>
	<p pid="d.149.0/18">I thank the staff of both the Commission and the House for everything that they do to keep this building and those who work in it in some semblance of order. It is a thankless and enormous task, and we are grateful.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-03d.152.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1475" speakername="Shailesh Vara" colnum="152"  time="014:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091203/halltext/91203h0001.htm#09120354000131">
	<p pid="d.152.0/1">I echo the comments made about the number of people who have taken the trouble to turn up for today's debate. Given that it impacts on everyone who works or operates in and around the Palace of Westminster, it is regrettable that on the one occasion that they have an opportunity to make their views known, they fail to do so. That being said, I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" name="Nick Harvey">the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey)</phrase> and the rest of the Commission, who, working with the Management Board, have carried out sterling work in producing this report.</p>
	<p pid="d.152.0/2">As was mentioned earlier, this has not been an easy year, and to say that it has been challenging is to put it mildly. The media have dominated the headlines with comments about MPs' expenses and allowances and so on. That has directly impacted on the entire community that works in and around the Palace of Westminster. Some Departments have been more affected than others. For example, the people handing the freedom of information requests have had a hard time, as have people in the Department of Resources. It is noteworthy that we put that on record to recognise the enormous stresses and strains that have been experienced by the support staff in this place.</p>
	<p pid="d.152.0/3">Sir Kevin Tebbit's reforms continue to have an impact on the management of the parliamentary estate, and it is good to see that the staff have managed the changes well. Given the economic climate, I was pleased to see on page 36 of the report that the House Service has broadly met its medium-term financial strategy for 2008-09 by ensuring that expenditure on core services was the same as in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="d.152.0/4">I also welcome the fact that PICT and the House Service will be seeking Investors in People status, which clearly is recognition by this place of the need to adapt and to provide care and attention for its staff in the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid="d.152.0/5">Clearly, one of the important functions that takes place here is support for Members. It is also noteworthy that the role of Members of Parliament in recent years has increased and become more demanding, particularly with the growth of the internet and the use of e-mails. Again, that impacts directly on all those who help us to do our jobs. Let me highlight three or four of those particular Departments. PICT has improved considerably. There is still a little bit to do by way of improvement, but it continues to strive to do better than in the previous year. In that, it has certainly improved compared to last year.</p>
	<p pid="d.152.0/6">The Library staff continue to impress by meeting the ridiculous demands that we sometimes put on them, especially when they have to provide research and information at short notice. In my case, they have always delivered on time. That view, I think, will be shared by most of us-Members from all parts of the House. The service we get, at short notice, is excellent. I believe that some 99 per cent. of Members have used the Library services.</p>
	<p pid="d.152.0/7">The Members Centre in Portcullis House has well and truly bedded in and is used extensively by Members and their staff. The staff of <i>Hansard </i>continue to impress. Their accuracy has improved, according to the annual report. I will leave it for others to decide whether that is because the staff have improved or because the former Deputy Prime Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1646" name="John Prescott">the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott)</phrase> makes fewer contributions.</p>
	<p pid="d.152.0/8">Members have tabled some 85,000 parliamentary questions in the past year, which is a phenomenal number to deal with. All the questions have to be processed and dealt with accurately and efficiently. I take this opportunity to say that that task has been well achieved. It is a pity, however, that the Ministers who reply to the questions do not do so with equal accuracy and timeliness of response, but perhaps that is beyond the remit of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="d.152.0/9">Additional pressure on staff has also been felt by those who look after the various Select Committees. In particular, the addition of Regional Select Committees, which have been boycotted by the Liberal Democrats and my party, has provided extra background work. Staff have to go to the various venues and service the Committees, and there is a cost of some &#163;1 million plus. None the less, all credit to the staff for dealing with that extra work.</p>
	<p pid="d.152.0/10">Reference has already been made to the work that is so urgently required on the building and on the infrastructure across the parliamentary estate. I hear the words of the hon. Member for North Devon, but perhaps he will tell us, if possible, the precise sum of money that is envisaged today for the overall works, some sense of when a decision might be made about whether we will all move to another place for a given period, and if so how long that period might be, and whether work will continue to be done during the recess? It would be helpful if he provided further clarification on those points, but I appreciate the difficulty he has.</p>
	<p pid="d.152.0/11">Asbestos is another issue. I would like to know whether any cases of asbestos affecting members of staff have arisen. We are aware of asbestos in large parts of the estate, but it would be interesting to know whether it is having a direct impact on staff.</p>
	<p pid="d.152.0/12">Accommodation is an ongoing problem for Members and their staff. I am pleased to see in the report that that issue is being addressed and that efforts are being made to secure further accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="d.152.0/13">One area of concern is the fact that there has not been the reduction in energy use that we would have liked to achieve; in fact, there has been a 6 per cent. increase. I accept that the size of the estate has also increased, but given that all of us in this place are in the business of asking people outside to try to conserve energy, we need to lead by example. Although I accept the reasons for the increase, perhaps we need to consider the matter again so that we can truly speak and set an example.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-03d.153.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1475" speakername="Shailesh Vara" colnum="153"  time="014:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091203/halltext/91203h0002.htm#09120354000133">
	<p pid="d.153.1/1">I hear what the hon. Gentleman says and perhaps the hon. Member for North Devon might be able to say in his winding-up speech whether there is any particular reason for the increase-this may be a one-off year. He might also say whether there will be a reduction next year.</p>
	<p pid="d.153.1/2">The security aspects of the House are, of course, tremendously important. I commend the Serjeant at Arms and her team, and all the police and security staff who work so hard in trying to keep this place safe. That being said, we must remain vigilant, and the two rooftop protests in the past year showed that there can be no let-up and that security arrangements must be kept under constant review.</p>
	<p pid="d.153.1/3">Particularly because of the negative publicity that this place has encountered in the past few months, but also because of the importance of engaging with the public at a time when communications are improving so greatly throughout the globe, it is important that the methods with which Parliament engages the public are always kept under scrutiny. I am pleased to say that the new visitor centre seems to have had much success. As well as providing enhanced security, it offers better reception and information facilities for those people who visit this place.</p>
	<p pid="d.153.1/4">I think that the 1 million-plus visitors who have been through the new visitor centre would certainly have better comments to make about their visit than those who visited under the previous arrangement. Tours of the Palace of Westminster are always popular and 130,000 MP-sponsored tours is certainly no mean feat.</p>
	<p pid="d.153.1/5">I am also pleased that the exhibitions that we hold regularly in various parts of the estate are continuing. Often, they are sponsored by Members, and they are a valuable way to ensure that charities and similar organisations that would not otherwise receive showcase publicity have the opportunity to receive such publicity when they hold an exhibition on the estate.</p>
	<p pid="d.153.1/6">Education is always a matter of importance. I am delighted that there were 36,000 school visits to the Palace last year, which is an increase of about 25 per cent. It is worth noting that, when it comes to elections, young people aged between 18 and 24 are the most disenchanted group of people and the group least likely to exercise their vote. So, it is important that we try to engage an interest in the world of politics among those young people, because what happens here impacts on their lives.</p>
	<p pid="d.153.1/7">I repeat that I am particularly pleased that we have had so many school visits. If the hon. Member for North Devon is able to enlighten us further, I shall look forward to hearing about the progress of the feasibility study for a dedicated education centre. I believe that that centre, if its construction goes ahead, is proposed for 2012-13.</p>
	<p pid="d.153.1/8">Furthermore, I very much welcome the travel subsidies that have been provided for schools outside London for visits to Parliament. On the first day that the subsidies were available, it was good to see that they had all been taken up; that is certainly a good sign for the future. Again, it would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman said how many schools made use of the subsidies and in what areas they were located, whether in outer London or much further afield. It would also be helpful to know what types of school-primary, senior and so on-arranged visits.</p>
	<p pid="d.153.1/9">As always in this debate, I conclude by thanking all the people who really make this place work, in addition to the House of Commons Commission and the Management Board. The list is extensive, but it includes the cleaners, the caterers, the Clerks and the support staff. They are the people who rarely get a mention and who-dare I say it?-perhaps are not thanked as often as they ought to be. Consequently, it was good of the Clerk of the House to invite some people who have served in the House for a long period to an event that simply marked their service. It is no bad thing that, as life gets more complicated, rushed and stressful, all those in a position of seniority take the time to thank all the other people who make their lives that much easier.</p>
