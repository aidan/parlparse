<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.177.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1535" speakername="Mark Todd" colnum="177"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0001.htm#09033133000454">
	<p pid="a.177.3/1">I had wondered about the temperature and whether it was due to my heavy cold, which has made my already deep voice even deeper.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/2">I am grateful to the Motor Neurone Disease Association, which suggested the topic for the debate. It is the only national organisation that tries to support people who suffer from this terrible disease. One of its focuses is, of course, to find a cure, and another important one is to support people through the process of the disease until their death.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/3">Not many people know a huge amount about motor neurone disease, which is quite rare. About 5,000 people in the UK suffer from it and partly because of its late diagnosis the typical period between diagnosis and death&mdash;it is incurable&mdash;is about 14 months. I shall return to why that is material. The disease affects the motor neurones&mdash;the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control muscles. All muscles are affected, including the respiratory muscles, which control regular breathing&mdash;critically when asleep&mdash;and keep people alive. Ventilatory impairment is one of the most frequent causes of eventual death in people who suffer from motor neurone disease. The respiratory muscles fail to work and the sufferer is unable to breathe. The process is very distressing, and causes the sufferer and their carers tremendous anxiety. I shall speak about some of the issues that arise for carers of people with MND.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/4">Not only is ventilatory failure a main cause of death, it is a main cause of poor health in the later stages of the illness because poor sleep leads to dramatic loss of quality of life, including headaches, cognitive failure and, in extreme cases, hallucinations when awake. It can also lead to lethargy, requiring additional care simply to maintain the normal course of life. Ventilatory problems are a critical part of the path of motor neurone disease in the typical survival period after diagnosis. The disease dominates family life, and sleep impairment is a critical part of the impact on carers. If a sufferer is not sleeping properly and is perhaps in danger of dying in their sleep, a carer becomes anxious and spends a lot of time supporting the sufferer and trying to help them through the episodes. That leads to poor health among carers, so the difficulty has a multiple effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/5">Non-invasive ventilation, which is the subject of this debate, is a relatively simple technology involving a pump, an air filter, and a means of delivering air, usually a mask, into the sufferer's lungs, essentially to keep air flowing into the body to keep the sufferer alive when the ventilatory muscles are not functioning properly. The full kit is not particularly expensive, and costs about &pound;6,000. The face mask and so on are obviously personal to the individual, but the key piece of technology supporting the ventilatory muscles&mdash;the pump&mdash;is reusable and can be passed to another patient when necessary. Unlike a drug, it is an efficient means of helping people with a terrible illness.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/6">Non-invasive ventilation relieves sleep disturbance because it provides the passage of air into the body at regular intervals without the use of the muscles, so the sufferer can sleep normally. It can also be used for longer periods; in the later stages of the disease the problem occurs during the day, as well as at night. Clinical research published in 2006 showed that non-invasive ventilation typically increased the median survival period for people with motor neurone disease by seven months. As I said, the typical survival period is 14 months, so seven months would be a material change in someone's survival, and a major change in their quality of life and that of their carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/7">I have met people who have had the technology available to them, and it has revolutionised their own feelings and transformed the life of the family caring for them, who can be more relaxed about the sufferer going off to sleep and can lead a more normal life when at home looking after the sufferer. It has a holistic impact on the family unit affected by motor neurone disease. Studies to date have shown that it is a profoundly beneficial technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/8">One might think that suggests that a simple decision could be made about the availability of the technology to MND sufferers. It is relatively cheap, is largely reusable, substantially lengthens life, and improves life quality for sufferers and their carers. The judgment seems to be relatively simple, so it is difficult to explain why the only study that has been done on availability showed that only about 3 per cent. of those suffering from motor neurone disease have the technology made available to them. It may not be appropriate for some sufferers of MND, either because the disease has not yet affected the respiratory muscles, or for other clinical reasons, but it is hard to understand how only 3 per cent. of sufferers might benefit from the technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/9">The evidence also shows that use of the technology is very unevenly distributed among neurological consultants who choose to prescribe it. Some neurological consultants regularly prescribe the technology for those suffering from motor neurone disease; others scarcely prescribe it at all. Prima facie, one would expect in that circumstance that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence would be the first port of call, because it is a classic case of the postcode lottery and uneven distribution of care that NICE was set up to address. It is not surprising, therefore, that shortly after the clinical study showed the benefits of the technology, NICE was approached to suggest that a study be done. That was in 2006&mdash;more than three years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/10">I say straight away that I am an enthusiastic defender of the NICE process. There has been a profound improvement in the way in which we allocate resources in the NHS and there is a much better framework for establishing best practice in both technologies and medicines for NHS patients. Of course there is controversy attached to the treatments; that is inevitable. I am not speaking as a regular critic of the institution&mdash;far from it. I am a regular defender of it, sometimes to my constituents, who are not as willing to listen to that side of the argument as I am.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/11">However, it is surprising that there was such a lengthy delay. It is also surprising&mdash;I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister provides some useful information on this&mdash;that following contact with the Department to suggest that NICE engage in the study, there was an interval of nearly three years before a referral was made to NICE at the end of last year to consider the technology. That is harder still to understand when NICE's own studies, through its consideration panel, showed that the technology had a score of four and a half out of five. Clearly, as I have said, the technology met many of the criteria that NICE is interested in when considering a particular treatment and technology. We require explanations of what happened and why there has been such a delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/12">We are now at the point we are at. NICE has had the referral and is considering how quickly to proceed. Regrettably, what it has said so far is that it will proceed with a study starting at the end of this year and finishing in 2011. Let me put that in a time frame relevant to those who suffer from the disease. Assuming that clinical practice does not alter voluntarily&mdash;sadly, it often does not&mdash;it will mean that in the next two and a half years, before NICE pronounces, some thousands of people suffering from the disease will not receive that treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/13">The case is solid for rapid consideration of the technology and for a judgment to start that consideration as soon as possible. I hope that the Minister gives us some reassurance that that is the message she will be giving her Department and those who liaise with NICE on its work programme, and perhaps to NICE itself. I recognise that it is an independent agency&mdash;it should be independent. Nevertheless, it should listen hard to its stakeholders and those who are critically interested in the care of people who suffer from terrible diseases such as motor neurone disease.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.0/1">Well, I shall join the throng in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/2">I must explain that although I am operating somewhat out of my comfort zone, I was so impressed by the case that was made for the need to get the equipment into the possession of people suffering from this dreadful wasting disease that I decided to take a chance and venture into areas on which I am wholly dependent on advice and briefing from the Motor Neurone Disease Association. I shall unashamedly be relying on the material that it has given me.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/3">I often say to constituents who come to see me with dreadful problems that MPs have influence but no power. We cannot overrule bodies that are empowered by law to take responsibility for policy implementation. However, we can sometimes speed up a process whereby those bodies would probably get round in the end to doing what needs to be done, because it is in line with policy as laid down by Parliament and Government, but they have been dragging their feet.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/4">Like the hon. Gentleman, I do not intend to cast any aspersions on the work of NICE. I do not know enough about the queuing system that it has for dealing with one task after another. I fear that it may operate on a first come, first served principle, which may mean that a relatively simple decision about a relatively inexpensive measure that needs to be taken has to wait a disproportionate time before it is considered, purely because it is in a queue behind a much more complicated decision that has to be taken about much more expensive equipment or treatment for a much more challenging dilemma and disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/5">Therefore, I hope that what we say today in this Chamber will not overrule any procedures that NICE must follow, but will give it a bit of a prod, especially when we bear in mind everything that the hon. Gentleman said about the life expectancy that someone diagnosed with motor neurone disease can have. Let us not forget that one vicious aspect of the disease is that the person's mind remains totally unaffected right up to the end. They know exactly what is happening; they are well aware of the fact that their whole system is gradually closing down. It is of great concern if, knowing that they are under a death sentence of 14 months&mdash;that is the average time from diagnosis to death&mdash;we are not doing everything that we can to make that time as bearable for those people as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/6">I am told by the Motor Neurone Disease Association that one reason why I may not have heard too much about problems relating to NIV treatment in my constituency of New Forest, East is that we are very fortunate in my part of the world. When someone is diagnosed with motor neurone disease, the first step is for their neurologist to refer them to the respiratory services department. That department is usually found in a general hospital, and there is certainly one in Southampton general hospital, which serves my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/7">The disease can lead to rapid degeneration, including in the gaps between appointments with the neurologist, so if the neurologist does not refer a motor neurone disease sufferer to respiratory services after their first appointment, that person's situation and quality of life may deteriorate substantially before it is possible to see the neurologist again and get a referral on a second or subsequent appointment. Making neurologists aware of the need to anticipate what may happen and to make a referral as soon as possible is therefore one aspect of this question.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/8">A top neurologist specialising in this terrible disease serves my constituency and the people of the Southampton area. Respiratory services at Southampton general hospital also have a fabulous person working for them, who is in a good position to supply the NIV kit as soon as she gets the referrals. The kit consists of a box, pump and tubes to allow air to be supplied to the patient overnight and, in the later stages, possibly in the days as well. I understand that Hampshire primary care trust, which serves my constituency, also supplies these kits. I am therefore speaking from a very fortunate minority position and I congratulate the general hospital, the neurological department, the respiratory services department and the PCT on what they are doing for MND sufferers in my part of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/9">NICE apparently rates the priority with which it wishes to deal with the question of supplying pumps at four and a half out of five on its priority scale&mdash;very highly, in other words.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/10">On the question of expense, we have heard that the whole equipment package costs &pound;6,000 per person, but all that money is not lost. After the initial period of use is, sadly, over, the pumps are entirely reusable, and a large part of the cost is recycled for the benefit of future sufferers.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/11">NIV is believed to increase the lifespan of MND sufferers by up to 11 months. Compared with other forms of treatment, which are much more expensive and which are believed to increase lifespan by up to three months at most, NIV is obviously incredibly good value for money. However, we should look at the issue not just in monetary terms, but in terms of humanitarian assistance. As has been said, when one knows that one is going to die in little more than a year, what is more valuable than being able to make those few remaining months tolerable and worthy of living, rather than constantly wishing that the agony was over? As the MND Association says,</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The human cost in terms of life extension and quality of life of denying access to this vital treatment for so many people with MND is enormous.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/13">Ventilatory failure arising from respiratory muscle weakness, which gradually progresses as the disease takes hold, is the most common cause of death in MND and is frequently preceded by sleep-disordered breathing. That, in turn, is associated with considerable morbidity, which causes disturbed sleep, severe daytime sleepiness and headaches, reduced appetite and cognitive impairment. Some people with MND have such disturbed sleep that they report having hallucinations during the day. Anybody who has ever suffered from severe sleep deprivation for any reason&mdash;mental breakdown, physical illness, abuse by captors in a conflict situation&mdash;will know the devastating effect of being systematically deprived of sleep. It is the worst form of torture that one can inflict on a human being, and that is what this disease does to sufferers during much of the 14 months that they have left once the diagnosis is confirmed.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/14">Clinical trials have shown that NIV significantly improves quality of life for people with MND by increasing blood oxygen levels, which leads to significantly higher-quality sleep, fewer terrible daytime headaches and increased appetite. It is what the military would call a force multiplier. If people's brains can receive more oxygen, every one of their remaining bodily and mental functions will be improved for as long as they live, their quality of life will be better and the period left with their families and friends will be extended.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/15">The MND Association gives an example of the personal experiences of someone who has had NIV:</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/16" class="indent">&quot;Mr S said that prior to using NIV he was waking very frequently at night&mdash;up to 39 times per hour according to his consultant. This meant he felt very unwell during the day, describing how he felt as having a very bad hangover. He was also hallucinating during the day. Since using NIV however he sleeps well at night, feels much better during the day and has stopped having hallucinations. He said that NIV has completely changed his life. His wife...said that NIV was a lifeline for them.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/17">Research carried out in 2001 and funded by the MND Association showed that only 5.5 per cent. of people with MND who were under review were receiving NIV. There was a marked variation in clinical practice, with just three neurologists responsible for 30 per cent. of all referrals in the whole United Kingdom. I have no idea how many neurologists in the UK have MND sufferers on their books, but the fact that only three, who are clearly enthusiasts for the treatment, account for almost a third of referrals nationally indicates that there is a huge ocean of unnecessary suffering out there.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/18">As soon as research was published showing that NIV was effective in treating MND although not widely available, the MND Association suggested NIV to NICE so that guidance could be produced for the NHS. As we have heard, that was in January 2006. Nearly three years later&mdash;at the end of 2008&mdash;the Department of Health finally referred NIV to NICE. There must be all sorts of sensible reasons for that delay, but I do not think that they would have cut much ice with the thousands of people who were suffering from MND over that long period.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/19">Throughout those three years, the MND Association repeatedly asked for progress on NIV and was told that it was, as I have said, considered a high priority, scoring four and a half out of five in NICE's consideration panel for topic selection. All I can say is that it makes me wonder about those rated with lower priorities. Given all the billions that have been spent on health, if NICE is indeed doing a good job its capacity is clearly under-resourced. It needs to do a good job&mdash;if that is what it is doing&mdash;more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/20">When NIV was finally referred to NICE, the MND Association expected work on the guidance to start straight away, but NICE said it could not start work until late 2009, as we have heard; the guidance was due to be published early in 2011. The MND Association says&mdash;who can disagree?&mdash;that it is unacceptable that it could take five years to produce guidance for a vital treatment for that fatal disease. More than 8,000 people will have died from MND during the time in question, many of whom will have been denied access to the life-extending and life-enhancing treatment offered by NIV.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/21">NICE has said it will produce a short clinical guideline on NIV and that it can work on only a small number of projects at any one time, to produce such guidelines. The MND Association has identified several such projects that will be completed this spring, and it therefore believes that work on NIV can start then. My appeal to the Minister is that she will use what influence she feels she properly can to get the simple and relatively inexpensive process in question into that available slot in the NICE agenda, if statute and the proprieties that govern her role allow her to exert such influence. The questions that I have been asked to raise are why it took nearly three years for NIV to be referred to NICE, when it was considered a high priority; whether the Minister thinks that it is acceptable for it to have taken that long, and for 8,000 people with MND to die waiting, and why NIV work cannot begin when other short clinical guidelines are completed in April. It would be interesting to receive an insight on how NICE prioritises treatments that are referred to it in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/22">I said earlier that I am operating out of my comfort zone, which is usually mainly military and security matters. However, there was a strange convergence of my interest, because when I was preparing for the debate my mind went back to one of the most inspiring interviews I ever read. It inspired me so much that I had special copies printed and framed, and was able to present one of them to the widow of the person who gave the interview. He was the late Lord Cheshire, better known as Leonard Cheshire, VC, DSO, DFC, and countless bars to those awards. He was famous twice over, but he deserves to be famous three times over. He was famous for being one of the most courageous and certainly the most highly decorated bomber pilot of world war two. He was famous also for his piety and his amazing achievement in founding the Cheshire Homes for the terminally ill.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/23">I feel that he should be famous as well for the interview that he gave. The article, by Anne de Courcy, was published in the <i>Evening Standard </i>a few days after Lord Cheshire died in 1992, and explains:</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/24" class="indent">&quot;He had the fatal muscle-wasting disease, motor neurone, and his condition was rapidly deteriorating. Two days earlier, he had rung to warn me that his voice was weak 'but do come . . . this will be my last interview'.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/25" class="indent">He sat in his electrically operated armchair, back to the windows of his upstairs study, knees raised to avoid pressure on his emaciated hip bones.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/26" class="indent">Every few minutes he sucked through a straw from a glass of orange liquid; this, it transpired, was a mixture of Lucozade and a high-calorie food powder.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/27" class="indent">He explained matter-of-factly that the internal muscles degenerate with the external ones, so that breathing, voice and eating are all affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/28" class="indent">'You can't chew, and you can't swallow properly, so you tend to choke.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/29">The article continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/30" class="indent">&quot;'Am I frightened?' he said. 'Oh no, how could I be? I've worked all these years with disabled people and, really, it's a kind of confirmation of my vocation. Before, it was always a case of me and them but I can now say, 'We disabled'.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/31" class="indent">'I mustn't be presumptuous&mdash;I may find that the physical difficulties get me down&mdash;but it has given me a kind of inner joy. If you're a Christian'&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/32">which, of course, famously, he was&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.180.0/34">That interview was entitled &quot;My Fear and the Final Journey Home&quot;. It ended with Lord Cheshire saying that the only time he had been really scared during the war was when, after completing a particularly dangerous mission, he let his guard down for a moment and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/35" class="indent">&quot;'We've made it...Give me a course for home.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/36">At that moment his aircraft was caught by searchlights and he had a dreadful time escaping. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/37" class="indent">&quot;I've learned now never to say you're home until you've crossed that finishing tape.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/38">Everyone who is diagnosed with motor neurone disease knows they are heading for the finishing tape. It is our duty to exert every scrap of influence that we have to make sure that that final journey is as dignified and tolerable as it can be made.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.184.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" speakername="Lembit Öpik" colnum="184"  time="010:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0002.htm#09033133000460">
	<p pid="a.184.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1535" name="Mark Todd">the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd)</phrase> on securing the debate with such apparent ease&mdash;first time lucky. If he is indeed reliable in matters of betting, perhaps he will, by way of intervention, indicate the likely winner of this weekend's grand national. That would make me very happy and give a quick way to make a considerable contribution to the coffers of the Motor Neurone Disease Association.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/2">My involvement with the association did not come about for happy reasons. My father died of motor neurone disease in April 2005, and the hon. Gentleman and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase> accurately described exactly the process that takes place when someone experiences that affliction. In simple terms, the body shuts down from the outside in. As we know, the individual's intellectual faculties are rarely affected, so the disease is in some ways the antithesis of Alzheimer's, in which the body remains sound but the mind becomes frail. With motor neurone disease, the mind remains sound and observes the body becoming frail, until a person is indeed trapped&mdash;a prisoner in their physical form, knowing that it is only a matter of time before the end comes.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/3">My view on the disease is exactly as that set out by the hon. Member for South Derbyshire: the experience of the disease is undergone not just by the immediate sufferer, but by the family and friends&mdash;perhaps more than in almost any other disease I have seen&mdash;because everyone knows where it is heading. Also, because of the difficulty in diagnosing this disease, it is, as we have heard, 14 months on average from diagnosis to death. In my father's case, it was a matter of weeks from him effectively diagnosing his own condition to his death. It is likely that affected individuals have the disease in their body for much longer, but we have not yet found a reliable form of diagnosis. That is a matter for research and it may offer a pointer in the direction of cure.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/4">What is most remarkable about the disease, and what I have discovered since my first formal link with the association, is, first, the inescapability of the outcome. People pretty much know that they are going to die from the disease at the point of diagnosis. The second remarkable thing is the irrepressible outlook of those who experience the disease. The hon. Member for New Forest, East described the archetypal viewpoint of many who suffer it. When I started visiting the association's branches and seeing those who suffer from MND, I recognised their positive acceptance of the circumstance. I have little doubt that that acceptance, in itself, extends the lives of those who suffer the disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/5">One often sees a degree of black humour, but there is always warmth and rarely resentment about the cards that life has dealt. That is salient to the matter of non-invasive ventilation. The better the care of those who have MND, the better their outlook and the less abandoned they feel, and the stronger their physical ability to extend what life they have left to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/6">What is most encouraging about non-invasive ventilation is the relative simplicity of the technique. It is not rocket science. It does not even involve oxygen. It involves pumping hot air into the lungs. In essence, it helps weak lungs to breathe more normally through the use of air pressure. That is very much it. As such, it is not difficult. One has to be an expert to understand how it works and to be a practitioner, but compared with the many challenges faced by medicine these days, it is not top of the technological list. In that sense, it produces beneficial effect with relatively little difficulty. That is why it is called non-invasive ventilation.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/7">We should remember what non-invasive ventilation does: if one cannot breathe, one cannot sleep; if one cannot sleep, one becomes tired, which weakens one's ability to fight the disease. Ultimately, the lack of respiratory capacity leads to death. Indeed, that is how my father died. As we heard, non-invasive ventilation improves not only the immediate quality of life, but, on average, adds seven months to the lives of those with the disease. I recognise that seven months is half the usual span from diagnosis to death, but it represents a 50 per cent. increase in survivability. That is 50 per cent. not only for the sufferer; for the reasons that I have described, it is also 50 per cent. for the families.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/8">I am persuaded that the research is robust. It has already been cited, but is so important that I shall cite it again. It is by S.C. Bourke et al, published in volume 5, issue 2, pages 142-47, of <i>The Lance</i><i>t Neurology</i> in February 2006, and entitled, &quot;The effects of non-invasive ventilation on survival and quality of life in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a randomised controlled trial&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/9">I put that on the record for those specialists and correspondents who take a particular interest in the disease. They will see how clear-cut and unequivocal the research is. Indeed, in a complementary prospective study, non-invasive ventilation increased survival in MND sufferers by almost 11 months, so there is little doubt that it does what people claim. Practitioners are completely persuaded that this is the way to go.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/10">The people of New Forest, East are blessed in two ways. First, they have an outstanding Member of Parliament, in the hon. Member for New Forest, East&mdash;for the purposes of this debate, my hon. Friend. Secondly, they have an outstanding medical facility in Southampton hospital. Last year, in my then capacity as president of the association, I had the honour to visit that facility, and it was made perfectly clear that, together with other forms of support, non-invasive ventilation is an important tool in combating premature death from the disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/11">That being so, it seems obvious that non-invasive ventilation should be readily available to those with motor neurone disease who are capable of benefiting from it. Yet, as we have heard, fewer than one in 30 victims of the disease has access to it. I am sorry to say that my constituency of Montgomeryshire is very much a black hole, and as far as I can ascertain, there is no availability whatever of that methodology in the area. I therefore hope that we can make a practical intervention today on the methodologies available to MND sufferers throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/12">We should think about the figures: with 5,000 people suffering MND at any one time, fewer than 200 are experiencing the benefits of non-invasive ventilation. The delay is baffling. Those hon. Members who have already spoken share my bemusement. The hon. Member for South Derbyshire said that thousands will have died by 2011, and the hon. Member for New Forest, East said that 8,000 are likely to die in the time that it will take the Department of Health and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to reach a conclusion about non-invasive ventilation.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/13">I do not believe that five years is an acceptable delay, given that we already have something that is proven to extend life by a considerable degree. Furthermore, it is usual that caution should be at the heart of such delays. So many times I have heard people saying, &quot;We would like to do it, but we have to make sure that there are no unintended consequences.&quot; I cannot believe that there is any unintended consequence or any careless oversight, the damage caused by which would exceed the damage caused by the premature death of people who would have lived longer had they received non-invasive ventilation.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/14">The cost-benefit calculation must surely be in favour of the expeditious implementation of a relatively inexpensive methodology, which has been tried and tested thousands of times, with individuals consistently praising the benefits of the ventilation technique. I am guessing, but I assume that this is caution. However, that caution is itself creating the unintended consequence of people dying more than half a year sooner than they would otherwise have died.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/15">The only other possible explanation is that of prioritisation&mdash;other methodologies are so important that they exceed the benefits that sufferers gain through non-invasive ventilation. I would be interested to hear whether that is the Minister's view, but I suspect that that is not the case. The association knows that NICE has been considering the matter, but although NICE's work is unquestionably worth while, the association argues that introducing non-invasive ventilation treatment is a far higher priority than some of the other choices.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/16">The long-term solution is to find a cure. That is an important element in the association's work. During the past decade, we have made more progress in dealing with the disease than in the rest of medical history. The primary objective of the association has changed from care to care and cure. The care agenda is all that it had when there seemed to be no prospect of a clinical solution to this dreadful disease. However, some of the best medical researchers and practitioners in the world are hard at work on the case. I praise the work of the association's global symposium in Birmingham last year and give credit to the Minister for opening that symposium, the first time that a Minister has done so in the history of symposiums on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/17">The parallel objectives of care and cure are exactly the right way for the association to go. In recognising the importance of introducing non-invasive ventilation, I hope that we do not take our eye off the ball, as curing the disease would obviate the need for many of the support mechanisms. I have previously described the search for a cure as attempting to complete a 1 million-piece jigsaw when one has only a few pieces. Ten years ago, we probably had two or three, and now we have a few dozen, but as that investment is made, the pieces will begin to fall into place exponentially.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/18">I praise the Government once again for their support in the campaign to raise &pound;15 million, as an initial target, for the cure fund. The former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, was very supportive of that campaign, and the current Prime Minister was very responsible, with other Ministers, for securing the potential for match funding of &pound;7.5 million towards specific projects designed to research and test cures. I am glad to report that more than &pound;12 million has been raised towards that &pound;15 million target&mdash;three years ahead of schedule. I am optimistic, therefore, that the cure route will ultimately prove to be the long-term solution to all that we are discussing. It will save money and lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/19">In the shorter term, however, we must find ways to care for those who cannot be cured. Our mission is to find a cure not for death, but for a specific and particularly cruel form of death&mdash;motor neurone disease. Until then, we must do our best for those who cannot be cured and who accept their fate in stoic and&mdash;usually&mdash;optimistic mood. NIV is simple, relatively cheap and the single best intervention for extending the life of a person with MND. Fewer medical investments are more capable of helping the health service to achieve its stated goals of improving quality of life and saving lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/20">For all those reasons, I fully support what hon. Members have said today. Will the Minister now adopt the MND Association's humble request to prioritise the work on NICE NIV clinical guidelines from April 2009? The association believes that, with planning and consideration, it should be possible to prioritise the necessary work on NIV and to get it on stream relatively quickly&mdash;certainly this year. It can be done, and we have all agreed that it will be done at some point, but please let us not wait until 2011, when many more people will have died without having been given the opportunity of that priceless improvement in their quality of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/21">For the sake of the thousands of UK residents experiencing MND and the thousands of families living with them, and for the sake of saving lives that cannot yet be saved but which can be made longer and more comfortable, I hope that the Minister will accord with our request. The value of this cannot be measured in the money that it costs; it can be measured only in love, compassion and humanity. I hope she will oblige.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.0/1">It is a pleasure to take part in such an important debate, which has included contributions from hon. Members who have personal experience of motor neurone disease and are members of various relevant groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1535" name="Mark Todd">the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd)</phrase> on securing the debate. We have already heard how lucky he has been in so doing, but luck travels with us when we have a really important debate on something that touches people's lives. Fate moves in strange ways, as might have happened in the Speaker's Office when the debates were being plucked out of the box. I praise the work carried out by the all-party group on motor neurone disease and the hon. Gentleman, who chairs it. He touched on many aspects of the excellent work done by the Motor Neurone Disease Association.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/3">I was not down to respond to the debate on behalf of Her Majesty's Opposition until about half-past 4 last night, so a tiny piece of sleep deprivation took place while I caught up with the subject area, but it was self-induced, because once I started to read about the disease and non-invasive ventilation, I became more and more interested in why things have taken so long. Even though I did not get its brief, the association's online services are fantastic. Most of my data will be identical to those already used, but that is useful, because at least I shall not make a huge gaff by quoting the wrong things.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase> made a powerful speech and talked about referrals. In certain parts of the country, including his own constituency, referrals relating to such technology and other wonderful facilities are available. However, we have heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit Öpik">the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> about huge holes in that respect. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence was supposed to create a level playing field across the country to guard against such holes.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/5">The hon. Gentleman's personal experiences were brought out in his speech, and his passion, as president of the association, is there for all to see. He mentioned our enormous lack of knowledge in diagnosing the disease early enough and the importance of having experts in place who know what to look for. While reading the research last night, I was shocked to discover how far advanced this terrible disease can be before someone realises. He told us how his father realised before anyone else. It is amazing that such a situation can arise in this day and age. I wish the all-party group and the association every luck in their work and in raising the money needed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.188.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" speakername="Lembit Öpik" colnum="188"  time="010:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0002.htm#09033133000462">
	<p pid="a.188.0/1">I have now handed the presidency over to Colin Blakemore, former head of the Medical Research Council, who has seen fit to apply himself to that work because we are making so much progress in research. I am also encouraged that, on examination of the data, the hon. Gentleman came to the same conclusion as the rest of us in this Chamber, and I hope he will join me in encouraging the Minister to take the steps that we are looking for today.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.188.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" speakername="Michael Penning" colnum="188"  time="010:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0002.htm#09033133000463">
	<p pid="a.188.1/1">I certainly shall encourage the Minister, and I would like to know how we got into this situation. In the interests of MND sufferers and of ensuring that this does not happen to other needy people, we need clinical guidance. However, no one has pointed out the fact that NICE cannot be used as an excuse for not providing the treatments that people require. All primary care trusts can consider the clinical evidence and needs, and make those decisions themselves. NICE was set up to allow for a more level playing field and to move us away from the postcode lottery, as the hon. Member for South Derbyshire said, but it must not be used as an excuse for delaying treatments or failing to give medicines to needy people.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.189.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1535" speakername="Mark Todd" colnum="189"  time="010:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0002.htm#09033133000464">
	<p pid="a.189.0/1">The point has been made about the unevenness of neurological diagnosis ability and expertise in this area. As a member of the governing party, I must mention that our shortage of highly qualified neurologists relative to other countries makes the situation regarding the accurate prescription of such treatment more explicable. We must give attention to that area. The hon. Gentleman is right that it would be wrong to say that the absence of a NICE judgment provides an excuse. Highly qualified people are in place who ought to be making those judgments for themselves.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.189.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" speakername="Michael Penning" colnum="189"  time="010:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0002.htm#09033133000465">
	<p pid="a.189.1/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the NHS and the Department of Health, through its guidance, have overall responsibility for addressing these problems. I am not blaming them for individual cases, because, obviously, we have devolved power to the trusts and PCTs, but NHS governance is essential. The chief medical officer, Ministers and the Secretary of State need to ensure that such problems do not occur.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/2">It is clear from today's evidence, which was so deep and passionate, that this is a real problem. How come so few people, whom we sadly know will die, are having their life experiences and expectancies improved by NIV? Of course, NIV is not perfect for everyone. There are some people for whom it will not help, but it will help a lot more than 3 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/3">There is no logical reason why NICE cannot improve the situation quickly. As always, one of its concerns relates to negative outcomes. If it is considering a new drug or procedure, it worries that there will be negative outcomes. I have not seen or heard anything from the clinical evidence to suggest that there are negative outcomes from such a procedure. The only things it can do are not help very much or help greatly; it can enhance someone's life.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/4">For example, NIV can help people to sleep through the night, which enables the carers and loved ones to have a good night's sleep. That helps them to come to terms with this terrible illness and the fact that they know that their loved one will die. Moreover, if the sufferer has a portable pack&mdash;the system is battery operated in most cases&mdash;in the latter stages of the illness, they are able to get out and about and interact with other people, which improves their life experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/5">I know that I am no expert, but I cannot see why the procedure is taking so long. I could understand if we were talking about a dangerous drug or procedure, or if this procedure had side effects, but in this particular case it does not.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/6">It normally takes about three months for Ministers to refer a matter to NICE, but this has taken nearly three years. Will the Minister tell us why it has taken so long? I know that the matter has been raised by other hon. Members. I am talking about not just this procedure, but procedures we will follow in future. We need to learn from the mistakes that have been made. Moreover, why do we still have the requirement that a Minister of State has to refer a matter to NICE? Why can NICE not make its own decisions?</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/7">If we want to take politics out of the NHS and allow clinical experts to make decisions on our behalf, why does a matter still have to go to the Department of Health for the Minister to make a decision on the referral? Surely, such decisions are for NICE to make, and to make a lot earlier. For example, it could make a decision as trials come towards their end&mdash;there is no need to wait for them to finish&mdash;and then refer the matter to the Minister. It could then be referred back to NICE. NICE should be engaged at the latter part of trials, which would speed up procedures all the way through.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/8">We have had an excellent debate and some passionate and informative speeches from people who are much more knowledgeable on the subject than me. I encourage the Minister to look again at the procedures and to use whatever powers she still has to ensure that NICE introduces such a procedure as soon as possible to ensure that people do not use the lack of NICE guidance as an excuse for not making the procedure available throughout the country. She should also consider the shortages relating to clinical expertise. Please give people with this disease the opportunity to have a better and longer life. Although the disease is, sadly, incurable, we can still give sufferers much better life experiences.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1535" name="Mark Todd">the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd)</phrase> on securing the debate. I pay tribute to him for his work as Chair of the all-party group on motor neurone disease and to the valuable work that is undertaken by the Motor Neurone Disease Association.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/2">I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit Öpik">the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase>, who spoke in a very quiet but assertive way about this important subject, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase>, who said that he felt out of his comfort zone because he was relatively new to the subject. I do not think that he was out of his comfort zone at all given the eloquence with which he spoke. He made some very moving points about the huge contributions that Lord Cheshire has made.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/3">Many of the points my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire made about the process of considering guidelines for non-invasive ventilation for motor neurone disease are valid. I agree with him and other hon. Members that NICE undertakes an incredibly important and delicate process of assessment for the NHS. Over 10 years, it has made considerable progress, but the job is not finished. In responding to the debate, I want to explain&mdash;as the hon. Member for New Forest, East asked me to do&mdash;what lies behind the decisions, and what the extenuating circumstances are for the long delay in referring this topic. Such a delay is deeply regrettable and something for which I am personally sorry. My hon. Friend is entitled to an explanation of some of the consequences that lie behind the delay. I will outline how I intend to help the matter proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/4">My hon. Friend is right that the topic was originally put forward for NICE guidance in 2006 and finally referred to NICE as a short clinical guideline topic in November 2008. It might be helpful if I say a little about NICE's clinical guidelines programme, and recap briefly on the process whereby topics for NICE are chosen.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/5">NICE's clinical guidelines programme is the largest such programme in the world. To date, NICE has published more than 80 clinical guidelines, addressing major disease areas, such as mental health, cancers and cardiovascular disease, and a further 40 guidelines are in development.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/6">However, even a programme of such world-leading scale cannot develop guidance on every topic where it might be of value. NICE's work has to be prioritised, and a clear process is in place for that to happen. That touches on the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" name="Michael Penning">the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning)</phrase> about how topics get referred. Topic ideas may come from a dedicated horizon-scanning team, which actively identifies new</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/7">drugs and technologies. Anyone can suggest a topic for NICE guidance using the suggestion form on NICE's website, and many groups and individuals do so every year. Suggestions are then sifted to ensure that NICE guidance is appropriate and does not duplicate existing work. Topics are then prioritised by one of seven multidisciplinary consideration panels at NICE before being considered by a small group chaired by the NHS medical director, which makes recommendations to Ministers. The process was introduced in 2006 and is designed to be as open as possible while dealing with the large number of suggestions that NICE receives each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/8">In this case, the topic selection process took far too long to consider the guidance suggestion. The reasons behind that delay, as I understand it, were threefold. First, when the topic was suggested for NICE's work programme in 2006, there was a backlog of hundreds of topics awaiting consideration. The changes that were made to topic selection arrangements in 2006 were designed to address that situation but the backlog took time to clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/9">Secondly, there was a discussion between interested parties on whether the topic would be most suitable for NICE's short clinical guidelines or for its technology appraisal work programme. That was important in ensuring that the product NICE developed for the NHS was the most appropriate to support the delivery of care to that group of patients, but the process took too long. There are many complexities, and I do not want to go back over them.</p>

	<p pid="a.191.1/1">I should like to give the three reasons for the delay before I give way. To make it absolutely clear, I am not condoning the delay, but Members are entitled to know what actually happened, what we have done about it, and what happens in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.1/2">As I said, the deliberations are necessary to ensure that NICE addresses the guidance topic through the appropriate route and develops the kind of advice that the NHS needs. In this instance, that took too long.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.1/3">Thirdly, internal staffing problems in NICE played a significant role in the delay. It would not be appropriate for me to go into detail, but I assure my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire and all other hon. Members that lessons were learned to ensure that, if at all possible, such a thing never happens again. Ministers can never say never but, with all due certainty, I can say that it will not happen in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.1/4">The cumulative effect of those three events meant that it was not until November 2008 that the topic was referred to NICE. As I have made clear, I am not condoning that; I am explaining the situation to hon. Members because they are entitled to an explanation.</p>

	<p pid="a.192.0/1">I thank the Minister for her description of what was happening, and I realise that she is not condoning the delays. What was the period between the committee referring the matter to the Minister and the Minister referring it to NICE? If the Minister cannot answer that question today, perhaps she could drop me a line.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.192.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" colnum="192"  time="010:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0003.htm#09033133000470">
	<p pid="a.192.1/1">As I understand it, the period was very short indeed. The role of Ministers is now to formalise the work that pre-dated the request for them formally to refer something to NICE. I was not personally involved in this case, but in others where I have been involved, we would be talking about an incredibly short period.</p>

	<p pid="a.192.2/1">The Minister is helpfully explaining what has happened. The Motor Neurone Disease Association was in regular contact during the nearly three years of delay, trying to find out what was happening and what the delay was, so it was not a case of saying, &quot;Well, we have told them once, and now we are waiting for something to come out of the other end of the tube.&quot; It would be helpful if the Minister could describe the review process that presumably happens when there are such repeated contacts.</p>

	<p pid="a.192.3/1">I will be happy to write to my hon. Friend on the detail. However, I understand that the discussions did not involve the MNDA pressing the question why a decision had not been made. Rather, there was an interaction with the association about what the process and its outcome should be. Of course, I will look into it further.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.3/2">My hon. Friend has written to the chief executive of NICE about the time taken to refer the topic decision and I am assured that he will receive a full reply very shortly. I have asked to be copied in when the reply is sent because, undoubtedly, lessons can and will be learned from the process, although, ultimately, the rate at which NICE can develop guidance will depend in large part on its guidance capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.3/3">The hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead asked how long it took the Minister to refer the matter. The submission went to the Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-20">20 November</phrase> and it was referred on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-26">26 November</phrase>&mdash;in the same year&mdash;which is what we would call a reasonably prompt turnaround.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.3/4">The topic has now finally been referred to NICE's short clinical guidance work programme. It has ensured that the topic will be in its work programme at the earliest opportunity. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire mentioned, NICE expects to commence work later in 2009, but I will return to that matter. The issue is NICE's guidance production capacity. Although NICE is an extremely valuable body and the resources that we have made available to it have grown considerably since it was established 10 years ago, any Government would need to consider the balance&mdash;the need for proper resourcing of NICE and the prioritisation of funding for front-line services.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.3/5">I do not condone the delay, but NICE fulfils an incredibly important, delicate and often difficult function. It has to prioritise topics for guidance and strike the right balance between the speed of guidance development and accuracy to ensure that it is robust. At the same time, it must also confront the sheer scale of medical innovation and clinical care and the flow of new ideas, evidence, treatments and drugs that are constantly emerging.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.3/6">The Government recognise the importance of timely NICE guidance both for patients and the NHS, as well as the need to build NICE capacity and expand it in new areas of activity. That was a central message of last year's next stage review. As well as reducing the time it takes NICE to produce guidance on new drugs, we have worked with it to introduce the shorter clinical guidelines process, which is specifically designed to allow NICE to tackle guidance topics that do not need a full clinical guideline. So far, it has published short clinical guidelines on a range of issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.3/7">The Department of Health is working with NICE to see whether it is possible to expand the capacity of the short clinical guidelines programme, through which the topic is being addressed, which could mean that it is able to start work earlier than is currently planned. I will ensure that my hon. Friend is kept fully informed of progress as we seek to move the discussion forward. My colleague, Lord Darzi, is looking at the issue with a view to identifying further action for the Department to take in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.0/1">I thank the Minister for the comprehensiveness of the account that she is giving. In her work with NICE on the possible expansion of the short clinical guidelines procedure, will she especially raise the point that, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" name="Michael Penning">the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning)</phrase> indicated, separate consideration ought to be given to cases of this sort, when we are not talking about drugs, but about relatively simple physical procedures? There should be an accelerated consideration of such cases, because the prospect of adverse side effects is vanishingly small.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.1/1">I confirm that that is precisely what the introduction of the short clinical guidelines programme seeks to do. One of the reasons for the delay of the referral&mdash;I gave the three reasons earlier&mdash;was uncertainty about which programme the topic should have been in. I am trying to provide information, but the House will not gain anything if I look back and say, &quot;The delay may not be to do with the Department or NICE,&quot; or, &quot;So and so did this or that, which caused a delay.&quot; The urgent questions to address in this debate are: what were the delays, were they reasonable&mdash;I do not think that they were&mdash;what lessons have we learned to ensure that the same situation does not arise again, and what are we doing to ensure the timely consideration not only of this case, but of other short clinical guidelines programmes?</p>

	<p pid="a.193.2/1">Before the Minister comes to what I imagine will be her concluding remarks, may I say that I am encouraged by what she is saying? If she is saying, in effect, that the NICE system is to start considering the opportunity costs of not making quick decisions&mdash;not just on motor neurone disease treatments but on other things as well&mdash;that is encouraging. If she is also saying that the informal conversations that she is having about non-invasive ventilation recommend that NICE might wish to make a judgment about the benefits of delay versus the benefits of immediate implementation, given the very small risks that have already been described, she is saying something that everybody in this Chamber, the Motor Neurone Disease Association and victims of the disease want to hear.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.194.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" colnum="194"  time="010:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0003.htm#09033133000476">
	<p pid="a.194.0/1">I am not putting myself in the place of the clinical experts on whom I as a Health Minister rely absolutely. The hon. Gentleman knows from discussions on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, for instance, and from the good research that can now be done with embryonic stem cells, that we depart from the best clinical and scientific advice at our peril. I shall not do that today. The process that he just described is the one that is supposed to be in place and that works now. Looking back to 2006, when this particular case started, a number of things happened that, regrettably, slowed it down. I believe that the changes made should ensure that does not happen on any referral in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/2">However, that still leaves us with the important question that the hon. Gentleman and others asked: when will NICE consider the issue? I told him what NICE said originally. All the issues are priorities. NICE is not picking and choosing. I hear what the hon. Gentleman says about high priority, but he knows as well as I do that the national health service treats some 1 million people every 36 hours. All the complexities that our staff must handle and the fantastic things that they can do with the help of science, drugs and technologies&mdash;some of which he mentioned in relation to motor neurone disease&mdash;make choosing priorities a difficult job. They are all of equally high priority, but we are taking them forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/3">The hon. Members for New Forest, East and for Montgomeryshire expressed concern about the thousands of patients who, they said, had died prematurely and in circumstances that all of us would want to alleviate, as a result of the delay in developing guidance on the topic. I understand their perspective absolutely, and I respect the passion with which they spoke on the matter. The hon. Member for New Forest, East went on to answer his own question. If there is good evidence that a treatment works well and it appears to be a good use of resources, the NHS should not hide behind the lack of guidance from NICE, as the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead mentioned. We have made that clear repeatedly to the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/4">Most of the services delivered by the NHS have not gone through NICE, but the NHS does not say, &quot;We're not going to do this because NICE hasn't considered it.&quot; NICE is about trying to reach more sensible and equal decision making across the NHS. The Government have always maintained that the absence of NICE guidance on treatment does not mean that individual PCTs should decline to make funding decisions on individual treatments based on assessment of the evidence. I have written to primary care trusts on that subject. Lack of guidance alone is not an acceptable reason for not funding treatment. I have made that clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/5">The hon. Member for New Forest, East complimented his health service on its performance in that respect and for the excellent services provided in Southampton. We have made it absolutely clear what is expected, how NICE should play it and what the Government's role is, and we will continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.0/1">That relates to the point that I raised when intervening on the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead about the unevenness of distribution of expertise on a disease that is not prolific. Many people will not encounter motor neurone disease more than once or twice in a clinical career. Partly for that reason, we must address it through a NICE process, but it is worth making the point that the Minister is making. The remedy lay in the hands of the NHS all along, as Southampton illustrates.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.1/1">I agree absolutely with my hon. Friend. Most neurologists&mdash;there are some 900 of them in the UK&mdash;are involved in the diagnosis of MND, and many are involved in multidisciplinary local MND teams. The vehicles do exist, but NICE guidance would undoubtedly help. That is why the association requested that such guidance should be undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/2">I have done my best to reassure Members about the prioritisation process now and to explain why the situation occurred. The hon. Member for New Forest, East asked why it took so long. I have tried to explain that. He asked whether it was acceptable. I have explained that I do not think that it is. He also asked whether the treatment was prioritised. I have explained that NIV is, and that we are taking it forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/3">In conclusion, to encapsulate where we are going now, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire once again on securing this debate. I thank him for the powerful arguments that he has made. I do not pretend for a moment that the handling of that important guidance topic has been in any way satisfactory, and I have outlined some of the factors at work, although they are no excuse. I hope to be able to reassure him that I acknowledge the regrettable problems that have occurred and that we and NICE have learned lessons from the experience. NICE will be progressing the topic at the earliest opportunity and, as I have promised, I will ensure that my hon. Friend is kept fully informed of developments. I leave it to him to tell me whether he will pass that information on to other hon. Members who have taken part in the debate, or whether he would like me to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.3/1">In that case, I am grateful for the opportunity to explain the position and how the Government intend to take things forward. As I said, delays occurred and I have explained why, but I do not condone them. I hope that the House is satisfied that I intend to take the matter forward with great vigour to ensure that the situation is addressed.</p>

	Nuclear Energy
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.196.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" speakername="David Heathcoat-Amory" colnum="196"  time="010:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0004.htm#09033133000481">
	<p pid="a.196.1/1">It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Illsley. I know that you have an interest in energy policy. I sought this debate because although nuclear power is not often debated in the House, it is important, particularly in the wider context of Britain's energy and environmental policies. All countries need energy, and all advanced countries need secure, dependable and economical energy supplies. As electricity is the most versatile and adaptable form of energy, this debate will largely be about electricity generation.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.1/2">Due to a combination of short-sightedness and wishful thinking, this country faces a looming energy gap between future demand and supply, because we have been decommissioning our nuclear power stations without replacing them. Many stations have already been decommissioned, and the rest will largely disappear in the next 10 years. Coal has also declined in importance: many coal-burning stations are increasingly obsolete and will fall victim to the tightening regulatory system, particularly the EU large combustion plant directive, which will take them out of service. So far, the difference has largely been made up by burning more gas. Incidentally, the so-called dash for gas was largely the reason why the Government were able to claim that they had complied with the Kyoto commitment on carbon dioxide stabilisation. That happened anyway, because gas produces less carbon dioxide per unit than does coal, and was nothing to do with what the Government had done elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.1/3">The massive switch to gas burn cannot continue for ever, and is becoming expensive. There were significant price rises last year, which have not been fully reversed, and which created a lot of grief both domestically and industrially. Also, gas reserves around our shores are declining&mdash;it is not just North sea oil that is running out&mdash;and we are having to import more and more gas. Indeed, we will soon be overwhelmingly dependent on imported gas from countries that, by and large, are unstable, unfriendly, or both. Many of those gas-exporting countries clearly use their energy exports as a foreign policy tool. Russia is a good example of that. Europe, as a whole, is very dependent on Russian gas, but those supplies are interruptable, and this country is at the end of the pipeline.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.2/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for making that point about gas, but does he acknowledge that the new liquefied natural gas terminal at Pembrokeshire, in Wales, is extremely important? Does he, like me, support the project being put forward by Cantaxx to take on LNG in Anglesey and deliver it through a pipeline to Preesall in Lancashire? Those projects are part of the energy mix, and I hope that they both prove successful.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.3/1">I do know of those projects, particularly the one into south Wales, but the gas is derived from the middle east. It comes from a friendly country there, Qatar, but the middle east is not known for its political security. Also, the gas comes by sea, so, although those imports and that system are very welcome, they do not give the security of supply that I seek for the overall future of British energy sources.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.1/1">The hon. Gentleman may be proposing that Scotland is somehow not part of the United Kingdom, but I look at the UK as an energy unit, and I think that Scotland would be ill-advised to shut off the nuclear option and rely entirely on gas, if that is what he is suggesting. However, I shall discuss alternative supplies later.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.1/2">First, I am setting the scene for the future of the UK's energy sources, and I am afraid that the Government have done nothing about the problem, if they saw it coming. We have had a succession of anti-nuclear Secretaries of State, who have ignored the problem of replacing nuclear power stations, while signing up to ever more demanding CO2 reduction targets. We are now committed to a CO2 reduction of 80 per cent. by 2050. That is well beyond the term of office of anyone here, which might be why those promises are being made now, but it is irresponsible to set targets and to will the end without willing the means. Apparently, the Government are relying on a vast expansion in renewable energy.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.3/1">I am not exempting any party entirely from my strictures. I was once a Minister in the Department of Energy, and I had responsibility for the nuclear industry. I tried my best to keep the nuclear flame alight, if I may use that metaphor, but the mood at the time was very much against it, as there had been a number of accidents and nuclear power was clearly uneconomical when compared with fossil fuel. However, Labour has been in charge for the past 12 years, and its Secretaries of State have taken an almost explicit anti-nuclear stance. That is what I am criticising.</p>

Gentleman says about the anti-nuclear climate, but one reason why that power station did not go ahead earlier was that before 1996 the Government had nowhere to put the waste, and did not make a decision. Does he accept that that long-term problem has caused the industry to contract in many ways?</p>

	<p pid="a.197.5/1">I agree that Governments of all complexions have not solved the problem of deep-storing or disposing of nuclear waste, but I do not think that that is the sole reason for the drift and negligence of recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.5/2">My point is slightly different. The Government are relying on another source of energy that is based largely on make-believe&mdash;a vast expansion in renewables. We are now committed to deriving 15 per cent. of all our energy requirements&mdash;not just electricity&mdash;from renewable sources by 2020, but we currently derive only about 2 per cent., and we are nowhere near getting to 15 per cent. within that time scale. That commitment is legally binding and will be in treaty law. We know that EU law is superior to national law, but I do not know who will go to prison when these commitments are not fulfilled&mdash;it will probably be another lot of Ministers in the future. Today's Government are signing up to a specific, legally binding commitment that is not attainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.5/3">Some renewable technologies make sense, such as hydro and, possibly, tidal power, but the rest are usually small-scale and expensive. The Government are relying strongly on wind power. The Secretary of State has said that those who oppose having wind turbines where they live are antisocial&mdash;like people who do not wear a seat belt. Those who have to live next to such noisy, expensive and unreliable machines are being made to feel socially inferior. That is not a clever way in which to proceed. Wind turbines are also expensive and increase electricity prices for everyone else. They create fuel poverty and make industry pay more for its power costs. At the same time as we are industrialising the landscape, we are de-industrialising the rest of the economy. That is not a clever policy and it is certainly not one on which we can rely for many future years.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.5/4">I want this debate to be about solutions, not just problems, blame and complaints. The solution both for energy security and the reduction of CO2 emissions is to replace those nuclear stations, advance further and expand civil nuclear power in this country. We used to be a world leader in nuclear. We were the first country successfully to harness atoms for peace and to turn nuclear fission into a technology for the benefit of mankind. We led the world. The story is not altogether a happy one, and I am not starry-eyed about the nuclear industry. Mistakes were made and certain expectations were not fulfilled. However, by and large, it was a British success story. It is true that we were too slow to switch to water-cooled reactors&mdash;the French did that successfully before us, and all credit to them. We also never hit on a standard design of reactor to replicate and therefore we did not benefit from the successive production of a single reactor type. Despite that, our recently built reactors have largely performed well and safely.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.5/5">The percentage of electricity supplied by nuclear climbed steadily and reached a peak of 27 per cent. in a fateful year&mdash;1997. I do not want to read too much into that. One could make all sorts of party political points, but it is a fact that during the past 12 years, there has been a steady decline in the percentage of electricity derived from nuclear stations. The figure is now down to around 15 per cent. At the same time, Britain has become a net importer of energy. The Government have now finally woken up, and their policy of drift and neglect is no longer sustainable.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.0/1">I have already made the point that I was an Energy Minister about 15 years ago. However, during my time in the Department, the contribution from nuclear was still rising. I had something to do with Sizewell. I visited Sizewell, which was successfully commissioned and is now a good generator of power into the grid. I am not ashamed of the role that I played. I contrast that with the succession of White Papers that we have had from the Government, which have clearly sidelined nuclear and gunned for the illusion of renewables taking up the slack and replacing the nuclear contribution. On top of that, the Government hope that renewables will meet long-term commitments on the reduction of CO2 .</p>

	<p pid="a.199.1/1">On wind turbines, whether one is for or against nuclear, is the right hon. Gentleman aware&mdash;as, indeed, my constituents are&mdash;that people have actually made a fairly objective judgment that such a variable source will not necessarily be able to provide base load in the way that nuclear unquestionably can? Has he done a price comparator on the costs of, for example, wind versus nuclear? The nuclear industry has given me the impression that it could operate without subsidy in terms of the commissioning operation, decommissioning and safety factors. Does he have a view on that point, which he might have been coming to?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.199.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" speakername="David Heathcoat-Amory" colnum="199"  time="010:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0004.htm#09033133000493">
	<p pid="a.199.2/1">I was going to come to that point, but I will give him the price comparator now, which comes from an official source. The consultation document on the Severn tidal power scheme was published by the Department in January. On page 18 of that document there is a comparator of the costs, which gives the pounds per megawatt hour for a number of generating sources. Tidal power is somewhere between &pound;104 to &pound;317, which is very expensive at this stage. Broadly speaking, the next most expensive is power from biomass. Wind-derived power is a little more economical as the figure varies between roughly &pound;70 to &pound;80 per megawatt hour. Much cheaper than that, at &pound;53, is energy from combined-cycle gas turbines and the cheapest source is nuclear at &pound;38 per megawatt hour. On that basis, nuclear is far and away the cheapest technology listed by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/2">The inescapable point is that we are in a weak position now because of a policy of neglect. One of the decisions made by the Government was, indeed, to sell off Westinghouse&mdash;our last remaining consortium capable of designing and building a nuclear reactor&mdash;to Toshiba. We now hear that the Government are selling off the commercial arm of the UK Atomic Energy Authority. Again, that is for all the wrong reasons and is to plug another gap&mdash;this time in the national finances. We are not in a position to take a lead anymore, even if we wanted to.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/3">The Government apparently want eight new reactors in this country. They will now all be built by foreign consortiums&mdash;probably Electricit&eacute; de France and Westinghouse. We are in a long queue now because the rest of the world also wants nuclear power. The population of the world is rising rapidly and will increase to at least 9 billion before the end of the century. Energy demand in developing countries is rising even faster, and the electricity component of that is rising fastest of all. The only hope of meeting that demand without having an enormous increase in CO2 emissions is nuclear power. Worldwide, about 40 nuclear stations are under construction and over 100 more are in the planning phase. We could have led this revolution and done so much for our manufacturing base and engineering skills. Instead of that, we are now an also-ran. We are clowns, spectators, supplicants. It is a very sad story.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/4">To give credit to the Minister, I think that he is personally aware of that. He knows that there have been policy mistakes and that we must do something about it. The Government have revised their cost estimates&mdash;I have already given them&mdash;which are highly favourable to nuclear power at the moment. In addition, nuclear power is secure. There is plenty of uranium left in the earth's crust and we have also stock-piled a lot of it. There is a great deal of uranium and plutonium at Sellafield, which can be used in future reactors, if they are adapted or built to take it. Fast reactors can make better use of uranium, and thorium is another element in the earth's crust that can be used for nuclear fuel. Thorium is even more abundant than uranium. We are not going to run out of nuclear fuel; it is stable and secure.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/5">In operation, nuclear power is virtually CO2 free. Of course, the reactors have to be built, and that absorbs a lot of energy, but exactly the same thing is true for every other power station. In operation, nuclear power is a highly effective, low-carbon source of power.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/6">None of that makes nuclear power easy. As I said, I have no illusions about the problems. In the past, certain expectations were not met. It is a demanding technology, project management of the sites is complex, and the industry has not always been good at explaining itself. We have to be open with people and engage them in debate about the costs and problems, as well as the benefits, of nuclear energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/7">There are hard choices to be made about energy, but often people do not want to face up to them. All forms of energy generation have an effect on the environment&mdash;that is inescapable. I agree with the point that has already been made that we have been slow to find a deep storage site for nuclear waste, but that vulnerability is a technical problem that can be solved.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/8">Meanwhile, public attitudes have changed in favour of nuclear energy&mdash;again, no thanks to the Government. I wish that the last Prime Minister had used just a fraction of his political authority to lead the debate on energy. In 2004, I asked him about it at Prime Minister's questions. I criticised wind power and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/9" class="indent">&quot;At the same time, nuclear power, which does make a positive contribution, will be allowed to wither away without replacement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/10">In reply, Prime Minister Blair stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/11" class="indent">&quot;We made it clear in the White Paper that we have not shut the door on nuclear power, but until the issues of cost and public concern about safety can be met there is simply not the consent to go ahead with it.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-09-15.1267"><i>Official Report</i>, 15 September 2004; Vol. 424, c. 1267-8</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/12">That was not leadership; it was totally supine. He did nothing to explain or meet people's concerns about safety. That was a missed opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.0/1">Is there not another consequence of dithering, delay and pushing decisions out into the long grass? For example, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1952" name="Albert Owen">the hon. Member for Ynys M&ocirc;n (Albert Owen)</phrase>, who is the Member for Anglesey, has always supported continuous generation of nuclear energy on the Wylfa site. Decisions now to extend the life of that power station will come too late. There will be a gap: as I understand it, it will not be possible to put in new nuclear power generation on the site until 2018, simply because the Labour Government have ducked the issues. They did not get to grips with them early enough.</p>

	<p pid="a.201.0/1">My hon. Friend gives a good illustration of what I am saying. It is now very late in the day to get into gear and do something about nuclear power to close the looming energy gap.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/2">My main point is that there is a contrast between the rigid, legal, binding commitments on CO2 reduction, and the vague, uncommitted way in which the Government speak about energy production. We have seen that in the succession of White Papers that I mentioned. In 2003, the most the Government could say was:</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/3" class="indent">&quot;This White Paper does not contain proposals for building new nuclear power stations. However, we do not rule out the possibility that at some point in the future new nuclear build might be necessary if we are to meet our carbon targets.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/4">That is all that they could say about nuclear power when the stations were all being decommissioned and the energy gap was becoming more and more apparent. Even in 2006, the energy review stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/5" class="indent">&quot;A new generation of nuclear power stations could make a contribution to reducing carbon emissions and reducing our reliance on imported energy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/6">But, again, almost nothing was done. There was no leadership, commitment, energy or determination.</p>

	<p pid="a.201.1/1">The right hon.

He was courting the green lobby and said that nuclear power should be the last resort. At the time, the Government were putting through the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Bill and, indeed, a Planning Bill to help make nuclear power part of the rich mix. The Conservative leader was not doing that.</p>

	<p pid="a.202.0/1">I shall not repeat what I said earlier. I am making these points about nuclear power to people of all parties and all persuasions, and I am totally certain of my views on it. The Minister is part of the Executive. He is in office, it is his responsibility and it is his Department and Government who have failed. It is intriguing that they are now more and more interested in our views and what we will do.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.0/2">I have confidence that my party will take forward these policies, and I hope that we will hear from my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells that he is not anti-nuclear, that he sees the importance of what I am saying and that we will do something about it. It will be difficult and urgent, precisely because of the failures of policy that are only too clear from the succession of White Papers, all of which are on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.0/3">I believe that the private sector must finance, build and operate the reactors, but the framework is inescapably the responsibility of the Government, who regulate, approve and tax the industry. They are responsible for the planning system and for setting the environmental policies to which I have already referred. They are inextricably part of the nuclear programme, and that is where they have failed.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.0/4">I hope that when the Minister replies to the debate he will be suitably humble about past mistakes and candid about the constraints under which he now operates. I believe that he wants eight new reactors built in this country. Will they be built in time to close the energy gap to which even the Government have referred? What supply bottlenecks has he identified, and where are the skills shortages, which we know exist? Specifically, the nuclear installations inspectorate is short of inspectors and skilled personnel to carry out generic design assessment. The shortage has been investigated by the Government, and they have had a report on it. What are they doing about it? Only they can deal with that urgent matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.0/5">Finally, what part is this country playing in the design of the next generation of nuclear reactors? Another mistake that the Government made was to withdraw from active membership of the Generation IV International Forum. That was certainly a mistake because new reactor designs can make better use of existing fuel. They can burn plutonium&mdash;indeed, even from warheads. They can operate reactors at higher temperatures and thereby produce hydrogen as well as electricity, and they can be more proliferation-resistant. This country must be part of developing that dynamic technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.0/6">I hope that when the Minister replies he will tell us not simply about the past but about the future. Will we be part of the nuclear industry as it evolves, or will we yet again be relegated to the role of spectators and sub-contractors?</p>

	<p pid="a.203.0/1">Thank you for the opportunity to speak in this debate, Mr. Illsley. I shall start on a personal note. My father spent his whole working life in the electricity industry, with one company. He was very committed to his work; we were not allowed to have gas in the house; and I remember that, once, we had a family day out to Hunterston nuclear power station.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/2">Despite all that, I think that nuclear energy has many disadvantages, not least its costs. The UK Government estimate the cost of a new plant to be &pound;3 billion, and Finland, as well as facing many delays with its new developments, talks about the cost being &pound;4.3 billion. Furthermore, nuclear clean-up could cost anything between &pound;73 billion and &pound;90 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/3">Reliability is often mentioned, but, in 2006-07, Hunterston's reactor 3 was off for 353 days and its reactor 4 was off for 244 days. On reliability throughout the UK, in 2004, there were unplanned outages at Heysham 1 and Hartlepool; in 2005-06, there were prolonged unplanned outages at Hartlepool and Heysham 1; and, in 2006-07, there were losses due to boiler issues at Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B. It is often said that wind power is not reliable for electricity production, but, from a Scottish perspective, I can confirm that wind is pretty consistent, and it is used widely in Norway, Canada and Iceland, where they have a mix of renewable sources for electricity production. Hydroelectricity is very flexible and can be switched on and off easily.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/4">On the environment, Greenpeace said:</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Nuclear Power can only deliver a 4 per cent. cut in emissions after 2025... too little too late at too high a price.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/6">I shall mention renewables later, but, even if we use coal and gas, we can improve on carbon emissions and we could have clean coal technology. Indeed, we could have had carbon capture at Peterhead, but the UK Government blocked it.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/7">Each country should deal with its own radioactive waste, and Scotland is committed to keeping its waste in Scotland. We should not send it to England, and nor should English waste come to Scotland. There is a lack of skilled engineers to fill many of the jobs that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase> mentioned. The nuclear industry has been run down, and this country is not going to get many jobs if it has no skilled engineers.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/8">Nuclear power generated 26 per cent. of Scotland's electricity in 2007, but, in reality, we produce more electricity than we require. We export 20 per cent. to England and Northern Ireland, and Scottish consumption from non-nuclear sources in 2007 was 87.8 per cent. It could have been 92.5 per cent. Scotland is not in a weak position, as the right hon. Gentleman said. That argument applies to England: England may be in a weak position; Scotland is not.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a case against nuclear power, so why is it his party's policy to extend the lives of Torness and Hunterston power stations? The issue is important not only because of the electricity generated, but, if he is opposed to nuclear power owing to the waste that it produces, because his policy actually supports the production of more waste. I am intrigued by the conundrum that the Scottish National party has placed before the Scottish people.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.0/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his valid point. However, it raises two separate points: first, the extension of existing nuclear power stations is a decision for British Energy or whoever; and, secondly, new or replacement nuclear power stations should be decided on by Governments. The question is, therefore, should we build nuclear power stations to export electricity from Scotland? There is much talk of, and some argument for, generating electricity near the point of use, so, if the energy is right here, is it not better to use a local nuclear power station? For example, Battersea used to have a power station, and I am sure that it would make a very attractive site. If I can be assured that it is safe, I do not see why Battersea should not have a power station. Indeed, it would be an added tourist attraction for London.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/2">Clearly, Scotland has considerable reserves of oil and gas. There is at least as much left in the ground as has been extracted and, as I mentioned earlier, Scotland will be self-sufficient in gas until at least 2020. Sadly, however, we have not had the opportunity to build up an oil fund, as Norway, Alaska, and Alberta have, to invest more in renewables.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/3">The Scottish Government's target is for 31 per cent. of electricity to be produced from renewable sources by 2011, and that is well ahead of the EU target of 12 per cent. by 2010 and even further ahead of the UK target of 10 per cent. by 2010. Indeed, the Scottish target is 50 per cent. by 2050. Scotland is leading the way on renewables, as it is in so many areas, and the UK is lagging behind. In fact, if we add our installed renewable projects to our consented renewable projects, we have 5.5 GW, which is 35 per cent. of our needs, so it looks as if we will be ahead of the target in 2011. In comparison, nuclear capacity in Scotland generates 2.1 GW.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/4">It is clear that new nuclear power stations are neither necessary nor wanted in Scotland. Scotland can have a secure, low-carbon, non-nuclear energy future by combining a growing renewables sector with the exploitation of a range of technologies, including marine energy.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.1/1">I well understand the hon. Gentleman's party's policy of complete opposition to nuclear power, but does it mean that he wants the British Energy facility in my constituency&mdash;the UK's nuclear industry headquarters&mdash;to close down, Doosan Babcock to stop production for the nuclear industry, Rolls-Royce to leave the industry and the university base at Strathclyde, Aberdeen and Herriot-Watt to close down its nuclear physics and engineering capability? Those could be the consequences of his policy, so I should welcome his views.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.2/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman again for his intervention. I have already tried to make it clear that we do not suggest stopping what is already happening; we are talking about not having any new nuclear power stations. On the point about what a university does, public finances are limited, and, if &pound;1 or &pound;1,000 is spent in a university on nuclear work and research, that is a choice not to make that money available for renewables research. We have a choice, which is either/or, and I would rather see the money and the academic skills going into renewables research.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.2/2">We can combine marine energy, micro-generation, cleaner energy from fossil fuels and improved energy efficiency. Scotland is the premier location for renewables in Europe, with 20 per cent. of Europe's wind energy potential and 25 per cent. of Europe's tidal power potential. The Scottish Government have introduced a &pound;10 million Saltire Prize, the world's biggest innovation award for marine renewables, and we have had 94 applications from 23 countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.2/3">The renewables industry creates jobs. The Danish wind industry employs 15,000 individuals&mdash;slightly more than the right hon. Gentleman mentioned. Some of those jobs could have been in Scotland, but our development has been held back because we are in the United Kingdom. The right hon. Member for Wells mentioned top-end jobs, but are they going to be in France, Germany, Japan or here? The Scottish Government certainly intend to use their limited resources through planning controls to block nuclear power stations, so can the Minister assure us that he will not impose the will of the UK Government on the people and Parliament of Scotland?</p>
	<p pid="a.204.2/4">We do not intend to close nuclear stations during their expected lifetimes, but, when they come to the end of their lives, they will be shut. The International Atomic Energy Agency says that worldwide nuclear output will fall from 15 per cent. to 13 per cent. by 2030. We must accept that nuclear is the fuel of the past and that wind, wave and tidal power are the fuels of future.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.0/1">I represent a halfway house between the last two speakers, because I am pro-nuclear and pro-renewables. I see no contradiction in that stance if we are to meet our two targets of a low-carbon economy and a secure supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/2">The next generation of new nuclear stations is starting a little too slowly for my liking, but there are good reasons for that. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase> on rightly saying in his opening remarks that we need to debate this matter openly and honestly; in the past the pre-nuclear lobby has had a tendency not to do so. The nuclear industry, in many ways, speaks in jargon that the public do not understand and we need to change that as well. When we talk about fast breeders and various other issues, the public do not engage and do not understand the benefits that new nuclear can bring to industry and the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/3">Nuclear energy in my part of the world provides an awful lot of highly skilled and well-paid jobs with transferable skills. I want that to continue, which is why I have been campaigning since becoming a Member of Parliament in 2001 for new nuclear to be on the agenda as part of a rich portfolio of energy sources. Under Conservative Governments&mdash;I mention this because the right hon. Member for Wells referred to it&mdash;in Wylfa, in my constituency of Ynys M&ocirc;n, land was set aside in the early to mid-1980s for the development of a second nuclear power station. That was put off for various reasons, in my opinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/4">First, in respect of public opinion, which the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, there were fears and perceptions of high risks in the nuclear industry. If we look at it rationally and consider other sources of energy, nuclear is a safe industry. In respect of fatalities, the number of workers killed in the nuclear industry is far smaller than in other industries, including hydro, coal and gas. The public's perception about nuclear being dangerous is now being put to one side when people have an open, honest debate about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/5">Secondly, successive Governments have not handled the waste issue well. I support the deep burial chambers, such as the ones that are going ahead in Finland, although those are late. We could have done that a lot sooner and gone ahead and had safe disposal of nuclear waste.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the excellent examples of decommissioning of a nuclear site is in Trawsfynydd in mid-Wales, where we are successfully decommissioning and creating a safe site within a national park?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.206.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1952" speakername="Albert Owen" colnum="206"  time="011:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0005.htm#09033133000509">
	<p pid="a.206.1/1">Disposal of waste is a subject for another debate, because of time restraints, but it can be done at different levels. If people consider it rationally, most of the volume of nuclear waste is low level and can be dealt with alongside what comes out of the military, and with medical and health waste, which needs to be dealt with safely, as does intermediate waste. As the hon. Lady says, intermediate waste is stored safely at Trawsfynydd, which is a fantastic feat of engineering and which is, again, leading to high-skilled jobs in that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/2">I want to talk about low-carbon generation for the future, with a low-carbon nuclear industry, with its transferable skills, at the centre of that. We will not meet our targets through renewables alone. In my constituency&mdash;I could speak on a number of issues in this regard&mdash;we have wind farms, which have been accepted by the local community, and we have plans for liquified natural gas and for marine turbines. Alongside nuclear, the Isle of Anglesey&mdash;Ynys M&ocirc;n&mdash;which I represent, can be an energy island and can work with Government at various levels, for the future, to provide the security and the supply of clean energy that we need, with a skilled work force.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/3">The nuclear academy is up and running. We are planning for the future. Many young people in my area who are taking apprenticeships in the nuclear industries will have the opportunity to get the high skills that are needed to keep people in the Ynys M&ocirc;n area. In the 1980s and '90s there was a mass exodus of young people from that area because of the contraction of much of the manufacturing and many high-paid jobs. The lynchpin of the nuclear industry has kept many people there and many families and generations depend on it. But that should go further.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/4">I congratulate the Government on considering a balanced portfolio, because development and research in renewables, alongside new nuclear technology, can take place in this country and can put us on a good footing for the future. We need to get this right and we need to do it properly. We also need to dismiss some of the myths that go along with nuclear.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/5">I believe that Wylfa B will happen. It will meet the criteria in the Government's strategic site assessment, because it has the infrastructure and the skills base and it has potential for the future. That is important. When <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2035" name="John Mason">the hon. Member for Glasgow, East (John Mason)</phrase>, who speaks on behalf of the Scottish National party, says that it wants to extend certain schemes, he is admitting that nuclear power is good for this country in terms of energy security. But he will not say that because he knows that it is politically damaging to close power stations when they have an extended safe generation period. It is the same with Plaid Cymru in my area: the leader of Plaid Cymru, who is my Assembly Member, says that he is against nuclear in principle but supports it because of jobs. That is not a sustainable position. I have been honest with the electorate and now Plaid Cymru is jumping on the nuclear bandwagon and saying that it is in favour of nuclear power, although its leadership is not so sure because it might lose a few votes.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/6">Nuclear is too important an issue for us to play party political point scoring. We need nuclear for the future security of the United Kingdom. We need to meet the targets. Climate change carries more risks than a nuclear explosion, which many people fear. Many of the top scientists and environmentalists are acknowledging that. People who are ideologically against nuclear power are now coming out in favour of it. Even the leader of the Conservative party, who was not too keen on it when he first became a Member of Parliament, is now suggesting&mdash;I am sure that his Front Bench spokesman will confirm it&mdash;that we need nuclear as part of the energy mix.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/7">Yes, successive Governments have been too slow in moving forward, but we are at an important juncture and we are now moving in the right direction to get the skills and the security of supply necessary to meet the needs of the future, not just for this country, but on a global scale. Nuclear power should be part of that.</p>

	<p pid="a.207.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase> on securing this debate. He is right; we do not have enough of these kinds of debates in Parliament on a subject that is important for this country and its people's needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/2">I shall just get some of the innocuous stuff out of the way. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2035" name="John Mason">The hon. Member for Glasgow, East (John Mason)</phrase> gave his party's usual line of not understanding the facts, having done no investigation, and does not understand anything to do with the industry at all. In general, his party is run by dogma and has nothing to do with the needs of the people of Scotland. Having got that out of the way, let us talk about the subject we are here to talk about: nuclear energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/3">The right hon. Gentleman was good, although he slightly reinvented history. The Government have done well, not only in turning round my party from holding completely the opposite view&mdash;from not supporting nuclear to supporting it&mdash;but for taking the argument out to the people and letting them make the decision. We have listened and we have come to the conclusion that a balanced energy policy is required in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/4">I have a vested interest. As chairman of the all-party group on nuclear energy, I am obviously pro-nuclear, but I am also pro-coal, pro-gas and pro-renewables. There is a place for everyone. We should not put all our eggs in one basket. It is important that we serve the needs of the people of the United Kingdom. Energy is a reserved matter. We deal with the energy of the country. It is a bit disingenuous to say that people can have all the gas, oil, electricity, renewables and whatever that they like. At the end of the day, the people of this country have stood and fallen together. We have fought side by side in wars, we fight side by side in industry and we compete against a world that would be quite happy to have half the resources and people that we have. That is important, because it is where our future lies.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/5">The new build will cost this Government next to nothing. The companies will supply the money: that is part of the deal. If they want to build a new power station, they will supply the money&mdash;that also includes the decommissioning. We must also consider security of supply. The right hon. Gentleman mentioned Russia and the middle east, and there is a British Gas project in Nigeria to liquefy gas. We must look to gas to meet our needs into the middle of the next decade. The right hon. Gentleman also referred to the Select Committee on Energy and Climate Change and said that the gap can be filled. I hope that he is right.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/6">Questions were asked about gas storage, which will be important to cover the decommissioning of our old nuclear power stations. We have problems with coal, because a European Union directive requires power stations such as Cockenzie and Longannet to be closed by 2015, unless they can meet emissions requirements, which is doubtful as they are old. So we have an even bigger problem. If those coal-fired powered stations close down, and if our nuclear power stations are decommissioned and closed, we must consider where we are going. There will be a gap, and gas and renewables will have to fill it, but during the cold spell in the winter renewables provided 0.01 per cent. of our energy needs in Scotland. That is a long way from the 50 per cent. of renewable electricity that the hon. Member for Glasgow, East was talking about. We must have a base load that will run industry and keep the lights on.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/7">Where do we go next? Education has been mentioned, and I was at an all-party group meeting this morning when we talked about that very subject. British companies are lining up to work with universities&mdash;some are already doing so&mdash;to provide apprenticeships and university degrees for the nuclear industry. They know that there is a shortage in the work force, and they want to fill it as quickly as possible. The right hon. Gentleman said that for those young men and women the world will be their oyster, and it certainly will because the amount of work in the rest of the world will mean great prospects of highly paid jobs anywhere in the world. However, we also have a place there, because our education system is second to none, and with the right drive and support from the Government, we will get there.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/8">The safety of nuclear power stations in this country is also second to none. In all the major disasters, barring Chernobyl&mdash;we all know what happened there and the number of lives lost&mdash;no one was killed or poisoned by radiation. Although the power station at Three Mile Island was lost, the safety precautions worked. The safety record in nuclear power stations is great compared with the number of lives lost in the coal industry, which must amount to hundreds of thousands throughout the world. Tens of thousands are killed in China alone almost every year. Many people die on a regular basis in the coal industry, so the nuclear industry does well.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/9">My hon. and learned Friend the Minister will have to consider waste management. We know that there will be a report in the autumn and we hope that it will tell us exactly what we must do. Those of us who were lucky enough to go to Sweden last year and see its experimental project in Oskarshamn could not fail to be impressed by what is being done with the waste material. I do not agree with the adage that Scottish waste must stay in Scotland and Welsh waste must stay in Wales. It is British waste, and the United Kingdom Government must deal with it. That is the deal, that is how it is at the moment, that is how Parliament has set its store, and we must go along with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/10">The right hon. Gentleman said that he would come back to planning. I do not know whether he did, but if he did I missed it. The Government have bitten the bullet and introduced the Planning Act 2008 to ensure that what happens in Scotland will not happen elsewhere. If an area wants a new power station requiring billions of pounds of investment to provide jobs, if a company wants to supply the money to build that power station to provide that work, and if the Government want it to supply electricity to meet people's needs, that should not be stopped by an obscure planning rule, which is what happens in Scotland. We want to ensure that that does not happen in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.1/1">I am glad that the hon. Gentleman said that, because his party's investigations showed that 52 per cent. of the Scottish population wants nuclear energy, and only about 24 per cent. does not want it. The Scottish people would rather keep the lights on than use political dogma to turn them off as the hon. Gentleman's party would like to do. I really thank him for that intervention, because I had forgotten about that information.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/2">This has been an excellent debate, and I thank the right hon. Gentleman once again for introducing it. The most important thing is that the British people have the lights on, and that there are jobs and investment in this country.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase> on securing this debate. It is good to see a Conservative Member ferociously and unashamedly in favour of nuclear power. It has been a little difficult to track the Conservative party's attitude over the past couple of years, particularly during the passage of the Energy Act 2008. It has been unclear whether it was pro or anti-nuclear, and sometimes it seemed to be both at once, so it is a little rich of him to criticise the Government for inconsistency.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.2/2">The right hon. Gentleman raised some important points. First, on timing, he referred to what is sometimes perceived as the energy gap and the likely tightening of energy supply as various power stations come off line over the next 10 or 15 years. Obviously, there are various ways of trying to cope with that energy gap, and my favourites and those of the Liberal Democrat party are energy efficiency, fossil fuel technologies if they can be provided with carbon abatement&mdash;on which development is promising, although without much help from the Government&mdash;and an increasing role for renewables. However, I have not seen any evidence that nuclear power can play much of a part in filling that energy gap, because there is not much evidence that any new generation nuclear power stations will come on line before 2020 at the earliest. Today is the deadline for the nomination of new nuclear sites, and perhaps the Minister will confirm that the timetable is still running to schedule.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.0/1">Last week, I had an Anglesey day when representatives from the community of Anglesey came to the House. The chairman of the county council is a Liberal Democrat, who is in favour of nuclear power because he can see its benefit in the local community. He is also in favour of extending the life of existing power stations. Is the Liberal Democrats' official policy to extend the life of nuclear power stations to help to bridge the gap that he is talking about?</p>

	<p pid="a.210.1/1">No, the consistent policy of my party's Front-Bench spokesmen and our party conferences over the years has been to phase out nuclear power as soon as possible. We are a democratic party, and we have different opinions. We welcome a diversity of opinions, but they have never managed to persuade the majority to be pro-nuclear.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/2">The right hon. Gentleman rightly mentioned process, and some interesting issues arise. I am sure that he does not welcome it, but we are in an EU-determined process called justification, which the Minister might like to comment on. Some legal opinion has it that when the justifying authority&mdash;the Secretary of State&mdash;has decided that nuclear is justified, it becomes difficult to reopen issues of safety and the rationale for nuclear power in later years. I would be interested to hear the Minister's opinion on whether the justification decision is irrevocable once taken, and why it should be done in that way. The EU does not determine who should be the justification authority, so it does not have to be the Secretary of State. There could have been a public inquiry, or he could have nominated the Environmental Audit Committee or the Committee on Climate Change or perhaps even the Sustainable Development Commission, which is the body established by Government to advise them on sustainable development.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/3">[Mr. Roger Gale <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/4">The Secretary of State has already made his pro-nuclear position clear, so it is fairly clear what the justification decision will be even before all the public consultation, but the Sustainable Development Commission has considered the issue as well. It wrote to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" name="Daniel Rogerson">the Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson)</phrase> in 2006, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Our final position weighs up the advantages and disadvantages of nuclear power to find that there is no justification for bringing forward plans for a new nuclear programme at this time and that any such proposal would be inconsistent with the Government's own Sustainable Development Strategy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/6">The commission raises issues of long-term waste, cost, inflexibility, the undermining of energy efficiency, and international security. I agree with all those points.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/7">Let us consider some of the sustainability issues involved in the debate. It is now often suggested that nuclear is part of the answer to reducing carbon emissions, yet the Sustainable Development Commission calculates that 10 GW of new nuclear generating capacity, replacing 10 old nuclear power stations, would contribute precisely 4 per cent. of savings in carbon emissions after 2024, which is hardly a quick or sufficient contribution to reducing carbon emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/8">The Select Committee on Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills has said in a report that many of the engineers working in the industry are approaching retirement and not enough young people are being trained. As other countries become more interested in buying nuclear skills, we may find ourselves with a skills shortage in this country.</p>

	<p pid="a.211.1/1">The general position is that we need transitional technology over the coming decades to replace the contribution of nuclear and other industries, because it is true that renewables alone will not fill that gap. However, the obvious candidate is carbon capture and storage. That technology, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2035" name="John Mason">the hon. Member for Glasgow, East (John Mason)</phrase> pointed out, was being progressed in projects such as that at Peterhead, which have been truncated by the Government's rather measly and limited carbon capture competition. We could have put much more effort and initiative into becoming a world leader in carbon capture; instead, we are being overtaken left, right and centre on that technology. That is the technology that I see as the important transitional one over the coming decades.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.1/2">Then there is the question of whether UK plc will really benefit from what is proposed. In a recent report, Sir John Houghton, the former director general of the Met Office and former co-chair of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, highlighted the fact that the only working example of a new generation nuclear power station in Finland is already experiencing quite a lot of problems. He wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.211.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The delays and cost over-runs at Finland's new Olkiluoto 3 reactor (the first nuclear reactor to be built in Europe since 1991) cast doubt on the ability of nuclear to play a large role in the timeframes necessary to effectively deal with climate change&quot;.</p>

We still do not know where that will be stored, when it will be stored and exactly how it will be disposed of.

	<p pid="a.212.1/1">I really do not have time; I am sorry.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/2">Clearly, we need to find a way of disposing of waste that has already been created, but that is no justification for repeating the mistake, not least because the sites, even with low-level contamination, can take 100 years to be cleaned up and decommissioned fully. Most of them are coastal, so a sea level rise and an increased risk of flooding is clearly also a danger. There are so many dangers that it would be foolish to go down this road again when we have not solved the problems of the last generation of waste at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/3">Energy security is often mentioned. The idea is that somehow nuclear is a more reliable form of energy than something such as gas, and the spectre of Russian gas negotiations is often raised. In fact, a large proportion of our gas comes from that well known and unstable country, Norway. Very little of it comes from Russia. As for uranium, about 44 per cent. comes from very stable countries&mdash;Canada and Australia. After that, 16 per cent. comes from Kazakhstan and then the list includes Russia again, but also Niger, Namibia, Uzbekistan and other well-known stable countries. That suggests that the international supply of uranium is not quite as secure as we might think. Certainly if there are new generations of nuclear power stations worldwide, there will presumably be a price hike in uranium as well, which might threaten once again the economics of nuclear power.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.5/1">It is not really a fear story, is it? If there is increasing demand, with world supply dependent on countries such as Kazakhstan, Russia and Niger, there will be a rise in the price, which is the last point that I made. That clearly threatens the long-term economic viability. Then there is the long-term economic threat relating to the cost of waste disposal and how any future liabilities that we have not worked out will be disposed of. The hon. Member for Glasgow, East referred to the potentially multi-billion pound bill for undisclosed nuclear liabilities. During the passage of the Energy Act 2008, many of us tried to tighten up its provisions to ensure that there was no possibility of the taxpayer ending up footing the bill in decades to come, when presumably many of the companies now involved in developing the so-called funded decommissioning programmes will be long gone. They might well have collapsed and there will be no one to sue in the event of costs rising. Inevitably, the taxpayer will have to pick up the ultimate liability; it is clear that the ultimate liability for a nuclear programme still rests with the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.5/2">However, the real capping argument against nuclear power at the moment is that we have an urgent need to develop genuinely renewable clean energy sources and the concentration of the Government on nuclear will crowd out the development of renewables. I was, frankly, horrified by the right hon. Gentleman's attack on wind power. I do not have time to refute it, except to say that it certainly can be refuted. The argument is that nuclear can crowd out renewables in terms of both capacity and investment. The signals coming from Government as to where investment from energy companies should go are mixed. They have given a clear green light to nuclear and they are giving very mixed signals on renewables. They have got it exactly the wrong way round. Renewable energy is clean, green, reliable and safe. Nuclear will leave us with a toxic hangover from the 20th century well into the 22nd and it should be phased out completely as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.213.0/1">You have joined us for the end of an excellent debate, Mr. Gale. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" name="Martin Horwood">The hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase> mentioned the word &quot;mix&quot; and I think that a mix is the key to our energy policy. On both sides of the Chamber, we have recognised that we face a prospective energy crunch, to which the solution has to be one of diversity. There is broad, albeit not necessarily universal, agreement on both sides of the Chamber that we have been slow to come to the position in which we can send clear signals to the industry that we will have a stable framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/2">First, however, let me congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase> on giving us the opportunity to have the debate and on his contribution, which, as ever, was serious and analytical. He always demonstrates genuine personal concern for the future of our nation, bringing that to all our counsels. He has done so again today.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/3">I am delighted to see my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1495" name="Cheryl Gillan">the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)</phrase>, who is shadow Secretary of State for Wales, in her place. As the presence of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1952" name="Albert Owen">the hon. Member for Ynys M&ocirc;n (Albert Owen)</phrase> also indicates, nuclear policy is a great issue for the Principality.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/4">It is clear from the contributions that have been made that we face a parlous energy security situation in the years ahead, and three factors contribute to that. First, there is the predictable decline in North sea oil and gas output. Some estimate that we will be 80 per cent. dependent on gas imports by the end of the decade, which could have been foreseen many years ago, in the past decade. Secondly, we are likely to have to decommission nine of our most polluting coal-fired power stations by 2015. Finally, six of our 10 nuclear power stations are likely to reach the end of their life, unless it is extended, by 2018. Over the years ahead, therefore, we face a significant capacity problem in generating our future energy supplies.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/5">In 1912, Sir Winston Churchill said that security in oil depends on diversity and diversity alone, which extends to our discussion of energy today, because we need a diverse energy supply. Unless one has an objection in principle to nuclear on the grounds of safety, and my party does not, it is clear that the technology makes a low-carbon contribution to diversity of supply. Providing that it is economically viable and does not present a charge on the taxpayer, therefore, it will be one of our diverse sources of energy going forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/6">There is agreement that we need to be clear about such issues, because we are contemplating major investments. Providing that Government subsidy is not involved in construction, operation, decommissioning or the storage of waste, no regulatory obstacles should be put in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.0/1">During the passage of the Energy Bill, the Conservative party asked for more reassurances on the long-term liability to the taxpayer and, in particular, on what was meant by a fair share of long-term waste disposal costs. Is the hon. Gentleman now satisfied or dissatisfied with the Government's position on that?</p>

	<p pid="a.214.1/1">I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman has raised that question, because it is crucial. The history is that nuclear power has left the taxpayer with liabilities. Some years ago, I was a special adviser in the Department of Trade and Industry and I well recall the sale of British Energy. That sale was partly designed to take liabilities off the public balance sheet, but I was there when officials came to tell the Secretary of State that it was not possible and that those liabilities had to remain in the public sector. The arrangements going forward therefore need to be absolutely rigorous so that there is no chance the taxpayer will face an unfunded liability.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.2/1">I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying in theory, but I am not clear what it means in practice. He has just acknowledged that there is a capacity problem and that nuclear could be part of the solution. How would he get the guarantees that he mentions? The programme needs years to develop, and there could be an incoming Conservative Government in that period. When would he say, &quot;Yes, we are pro-nuclear and we are going ahead with this,&quot; and what assurances must the industry give him?</p>

	<p pid="a.214.3/1">Each application needs to come before the Secretary of State for approval, and it is essential that the guarantees in place&mdash;whether on decommissioning liabilities or operating costs&mdash;provide Ministers with sufficient satisfaction that a charge will not be laid on the taxpayer. The fiscal risk must be taken care of, because it has been a problem in the past and it must not be one in the future. I therefore look to the Minister for an update on whether he is satisfied that such guarantees are in place in the proposals that have come before him for discussion so far.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.4/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that it is difficult to answer the question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1952" name="Albert Owen">the hon. Member for Ynys M&ocirc;n (Albert Owen)</phrase>? I was looking at the lifetime plan for Wylfa, and the milestones over the decommissioning period go right up to 2125, when none of us will be around. It is therefore impossible to give a strictly honest and accurate answer to his question at present.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.5/1">I am grateful for that intervention, which takes us to an important part of the debate. We need to concentrate now on ensuring that we have rigorous arrangements in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.5/2">Yesterday, we had the announcement of the prospective sale of UKAEA Ltd, which raises similar issues. I have no problem in principle with a private company operating the contracts, but UKAEA Ltd will have the long-term contract for decommissioning nuclear power stations. How can we be satisfied that a delegation from a private company will not come to the Minister some years down the line, when the contract is with that company and work has proceeded, to demand more money than was provided for in the contract to finish the job? We need satisfaction on such issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.5/3">It is the Government's responsibility to remove excessive regulatory risk. There is enough risk involved in making major multibillion pound investments&mdash;not least the cost of capital and the anticipation of future energy prices and the cost of carbon. Public policy should not amplify those risks, but most people in the industry would say that the 10-year delay that we have seen and the inconsistency of energy policy&mdash;indeed, the lack of a credible policy&mdash;have amplified them. That is not the way forward if we want to take up our traditional role in the energy sector as a world leader in nuclear technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.5/4">On planning issues, it is important that the Conservative party supports the type approvals used by the nuclear installations inspectorate, because they allow safety standards, which are obviously crucial, to be applied consistently. On planning applications, it is important that there is genuine scrutiny, but not a review of national energy policy lasting for years on end for each application. The Government's role in ensuring that we have a long-term safe storage capability is also important.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.5/5">We have suffered the consequences of policy ambiguity and indecision on this issue, and there is no better example of that than the Isle of Anglesey. Anglesey Aluminium Metals Ltd is contemplating 500 job cuts&mdash;those are important jobs&mdash;because any prospective decision on a second Wylfa nuclear power station will come too late to avoid interrupting the energy supplies that are necessary for investment and production to carry on.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.0/1">The hon. Gentleman mentions my constituency. Does he not accept that the decision to decommission Wylfa was made in 2000, so it is not as if there is any irrationality now? The Wylfa B plan was put in place in 1987, and had it been carried out in the relevant time scale, even with the ad hoc planning that we have seen, it would have come on stream many years ago. It is therefore incorrect to put the blame on people now.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.1/1">There is no advantage in casting around blame. All I would say is that if decisions on the replacement had been taken sooner, we would have avoided the hiatus, which has caused the loss of jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/2">Skills have been mentioned, and there have been severe consequences for some of our most skilled professions because of the delay and vacillation over energy policy. British Energy has estimated that only 6 per cent. of the nuclear industry's 100,000 employees are under 24 and that 40 per cent. of its employees will retire in the next 10 years. Dr. Tim Stone, one of the Government's advisers, makes much the same point about the nuclear installations inspectorate, which is a crucial body. He says that there are staffing shortages related to the age profile of the expert and highly experienced inspectors being skewed towards retirement age.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/3">I want to leave time for the Minister to reply. I do not want to sow division for the sake of it, because it is important that we do not present potential investors with a view that creates difference where there is none. Instead, we should present the possibility of a stable public policy regime. However, we need to ask whether the Minister, who is in a position to judge, can be satisfied that the fiscal risk of nuclear is adequately taken care of; whether some of the outstanding questions about public confidence and safety are being dealt with properly at Sellafield, where some of the NII safety specifications relating to legacy ponds and silos still have not been met&mdash;public confidence is very important; and, as I mentioned earlier with respect to yesterday's statement on UKAEA Ltd, whether there are sufficient guarantees that the sale would not lead to a charge on taxpayers' funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/4">This has been a constructive debate. It is important that we set out clearly the policy regime that would be in place for potential investors, and I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

Since that time there has been public concern about nuclear. That is something that he had to deal with when he was the Energy Minister from 1992 to 1994. He talks about the period of decline after 1987&mdash;well, he was part of that period of decline, so taking the mote out of one's own eye is part of what he needs to accept.

Gentleman was a member, and he, as a Minister in that Government, need to accept some responsibility for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.2/2">The right hon. Gentleman talks about leadership. I remind him that Tony Blair and the current Prime Minister led a party that was anti-nuclear, by and large, and have turned it into one that is by and large pro-nuclear with a policy set out in a White Paper&mdash;an energy policy that is clearly looking to build new nuclear power stations and has revitalised the industry in a very short period. That is decisive leadership.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.2/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1884" name="Greg Clark">The hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark)</phrase> complains of vacillation and delay. Let us see what is meant by those words. When we put forward our White Paper, at a pretty decisive moment for nuclear, where was the Conservative party? Its members were with their new&mdash;their current&mdash;leader, and their current leader was, as has already been said, in his green phase, when he decided that the Conservative party would no longer be the pro-nuclear party it once was. He turned a nuclear party into not an anti-nuclear, but perhaps a non-nuclear party; it was the great big Tory nuclear wobble.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.0/1">I am disappointed that the Minister has turned the debate in the direction he has, but he will recognise that in 12 years of Government, in which there have been 10 Energy Ministers&mdash;in which sequence he has, I think, taken the role twice&mdash;the decisions that needed to be taken rested with the Government, not the Opposition. If he wants to look backwards he should reflect on the record of the Government over the past 12 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.1/1">I can also reflect on the fact that the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. Friend complain about leadership, yet the Government, unlike their current leader, have provided leadership on the issue. We have moved to a clear strategy. The country and the world face huge challenges in the face of climate change and energy security issues. We have set up a new Department whose key objectives are to create a sustainable energy policy, to deal with climate change&mdash;a policy that is secure, to deal with the problems facing this country in the long term and the decline of North Sea oil and gas, and affordable, to ensure that the people of this country get security and sustainability in a way they can afford; and to do that now, in the face of the problems associated with the credit crunch.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/2">We need to decarbonise our electricity supplies and ensure that we have nuclear alongside renewables in a low-carbon economy. Combating climate change must be our top priority. We need to change our energy mix, so that we are less reliant on heavily polluting fossil fuels. We need secure affordable energy and we must ensure that we diversify the roots from which we get our gas and other supplies. By the way, contrary to the comments made earlier by the right hon. Member for Wells when he raised concerns about Russia, we get about 2 per cent. of our gas from Russia and the recent dispute between Ukraine and Russia did not have a major impact on our gas supplies.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/3">We recognise as a party that nuclear is secure, affordable and low-carbon, and that without it achieving the climate change targets we have set ourselves would become difficult and costly. The cost of generating electricity would rise and we would be increasingly reliant on renewables, and although those are important technologies they cannot always provide the base load of electricity that is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/4">As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1952" name="Albert Owen">the Member for Ynys M&ocirc;n (Albert Owen)</phrase> said, we need not only a nuclear base load but renewables, because they are low-carbon and can supply electricity on a large scale; but they have a problem in relation to intermittency. Therefore we also need the flexibility in energy supply that involves coal, with carbon capture and storage in due course, we hope, and gas.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/5">As to talk of energy gaps, we believe that any gap that might in theory exist will quickly be supplied by the energy companies. That might be through gas or, we hope, coal with carbon capture and storage, but we believe that it will be supplied, because there is a lot of money to be made by energy companies in preventing such a gap. Anyone looking at their energy bill will know that there is a lot of money to be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/6">There are massive opportunities for the UK in creating new nuclear build in this country. There will, I believe, be new nuclear power stations pepper-potting the globe in years to come. If the UK can build up&mdash;as we want it to&mdash;a supply chain, there is potential for massive benefit for the economy of this country. That is why we have worked so hard with the industry in recent months to build up the supply chain and get interest in it, and ensure that we have the capacity not only for new build but to benefit the country in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/7">Westinghouse and Areva have announced initiatives to work with the UK supply chain. The Nuclear Industry Association is working closely with industry to highlight what companies need to do to get involved, and our nuclear White Paper has set out clearly the basis and the policy framework. We hope we are in the process of creating the right conditions to enable the UK to be a target for investment in the future.</p>

	Thalidomide Victims
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.219.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1597" speakername="Martin Caton" colnum="219"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0007.htm#09033133000540">
	<p pid="a.219.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. Most of us, certainly those who were around in the late 1960s and early 1970s, know something of what the drug thalidomide did to the human foetus if the pregnant woman had been using it for a number of years on prescription. However, before looking at the more recent and current health issues for thalidomiders, it will be useful briefly to recall some of that history and to consider the lives of those whose bodies have been affected by the drug.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/2">Thalidomide was developed by the German firm Chemie Grunenthal as an anti-convulsant. It did not work for that purpose, but trials showed that it had sedative properties, with the apparent added benefit that overdoses resulted not in death, but simply in prolonged sleep. It was first marketed in Germany in 1957 and in the United Kingdom in 1958. It was sometimes combined with other drugs to treat a variety of conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/3">The promotion of all those products laid great stress on the safety of thalidomide. Grunenthal also claimed that thalidomide was completely safe for pregnant women and could therefore be used to treat morning sickness and some of the other negative aspects of early pregnancy. Astonishingly, the company made that claim without testing the drug on pregnant animals or testing the science behind the claim that an overdose would not normally kill. The latter factor was the result of the fact that although thalidomide was a highly toxic drug, it had a low absorption rate. That, however, could be affected by other illnesses, the taking of other medicines and, crucially, pregnancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/4">Distillers, which manufactured thalidomide in the UK under licence, had to conduct its own tests on the drug, and commissioned researchers at Glasgow university to consider the effect of thalidomide on the body's hormone balance. The results, published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, showed a marked reduction in the activity of the thyroid gland. That should have set alarm bells ringing. It was known at the time that any drug that affected the thyroid was likely to be able to pass through the placenta, yet Distillers, like Grunenthal, did not test the drug on pregnant animals.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/5">Even more disturbing, however, is the fact that the body appointed by the Government to establish whether new drugs had been properly tested&mdash;the Cohen committee&mdash;failed to ask whether tests had been made on pregnant animals. Instead, it described thalidomide as a drug of proven value. As a result, it went on to the NHS prescription list and was exempted from purchase tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/6">We should contrast that with how the Food and Drug Administration dealt with the application by Richardson-Merrell to market the drug in America. There, Dr. Frances Kelly recognised that a variety of factors could affect the absorption rate. She required tests to be made on pregnant animals. Tests were carried out on pregnant rabbits, and deformed foetuses were born.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/7">If the Cohen committee, acting on behalf of the Government, had required similar tests to be done here, it would have seen similar deformities in baby rabbits&mdash;the sort that were later to be seen in human babies. It did not. Some 3,800 babies died, and 508 were born with disabilities to mothers who had been taking thalidomide, assured that it was perfectly safe to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/8">When we think of people affected by thalidomide, most of us think of people with rudimentary arms and/or legs, but the drug caused a far greater range of debilitating conditions. Many suffered damaged ears and hearing. In others, eyesight was affected. A few suffered brain damage, with associated sensory limitations. Some who have legs have no arms, and a large number have arms ranging from half or two-thirds of normal length to 2 or 3 in. Many of those with hands have fingers missing and no thumbs. Leg damage often resulted in one or both legs being short, and feet absent or significantly damaged. In addition, there could be extensive damage to the internal organs and the skeletal structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/9">Before the establishment of the Thalidomide Trust, which was later to protect the interests of those children, they were subject to well-meaning but questionable and certainly unwelcome professional attention. Some endured a series of operations intended to make them look &quot;more normal&quot;, such as constructing ears where they had none or removing vestigial digits. There was a drive to find functional artificial arms, but experience of them as children put the majority of thalidomiders off such prosthetics in adult life.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/10">What is truly remarkable is how those individuals affected by thalidomide have responded to the disadvantages dealt to them. In their teens, many refused to accept the limited lifestyle that some thought appropriate for people so badly disabled, and they determined to live as fulfilling a life as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/11">Sadly, 46 of the original 508 have died, but a large proportion of the survivors have taken life by the horns. A majority of them are married and between them have more than 500 children. Many have become highly qualified and have successful professional careers; others are running their own businesses. A large number of them have regular full-time jobs, and half are in some form of paid employment. Many of those not in paid jobs are bringing up their families. However, their very determination to get on with things has taken its toll.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/12">By the late 1990s, it was becoming clear that thalidomiders were facing a new set of health problems, which were brought about by their wholly admirable commitment to activity. They are entering their 40s and 50s, but have always had to use their limbs and other parts of their bodies in ways for which they were not designed. Many have needed hip replacements, or even shoulder replacements, at the age of about 40. Others have reluctantly been forced to give up work or are considering doing so, creating personal financial difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/13">One thalidomider, Paul, writes:</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/14" class="indent">&quot;My physical damage is manifested by the absence of arms and legs. In spite of the obvious difficulty caused by my impairments, I am proud to report that I have been in continual employment since I finished my education more than 20 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/15" class="indent">As a result of years of using my body in unorthodox ways to achieve everyday tasks, I am now experiencing increasing pain caused by osteo-arthritis and find it extremely difficult to continue my job, which necessitates me using a stick in my mouth to type on a computer keyboard for most of the working day. I have been advised by my GP that continuation of this activity is detrimental to my health and that I should consider terminating my job.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/16">Paul is not alone. The Thalidomide Trust recently carried out a study of 108 thalidomiders, which showed that, on average, each thalidomider has six or more complex and chronic health problems. They include ear, nose and throat problems; poor vision; palsy, kidney, heart and gastrointestinal problems; arthritis; osteoporosis; sciatica; epilepsy; and obesity.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/17">Another study, recently published as a paper by Summerside, Johnson and Newman, showed that those people can be helped, but that there are considerable obstacles to them gaining access to that help. The authors described those obstacles as a hierarchy of information gaps and network failures.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/18">The first gap is between the patient and information about their condition, the existence of those similarly affected, the trajectory of the condition, effective treatments, specialist help and the existence of centres of excellence. The next gap is in the knowledge of GPs and other primary-level carers, which means that patients are always referred to a specialist.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/19">Usually, however, it is just that&mdash;a specialist in only one of their half dozen or more complex and chronic health problems. That identifies another gap, which is that between the second-level specialist and the pool of expertise and specialisms relevant to the individual thalidomider. Most significant, however, is the lack of an effective network between patients and other patients with similar problems, and the primary, secondary and tertiary care providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/20">The Thalidomide Trust shows that networking is the key to improving the quality of life for thalidomiders as they face those new health problems&mdash;an approach that works equally well for those with other rare conditions. The trust initiated a pilot project to establish such a network service for its 108 referrals so far. That has proved successful for many, simply by homing in on the right expertise and sharing it. Indeed, the network does not stop at national borders.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/21">The Thalidomide Trust was aware of Swedish and German centres of excellence for assessing people with such a range of problems and for identifying the best treatments for individuals. It made use of those institutions, which are now important nodes in the new network, and intends to create further centres in France, Poland and the UK, all of which will be part of that network. That approach will provide a coherent care pathway for thalidomiders, instead of sending them from pillar to post to be dealt with by high-quality experts functioning only in their specialism bunkers.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/22">In this country, most of the expertise required to fit into those networks lies within the NHS. I hope that the Government will work with the Thalidomide Trust, and its partners in this country and abroad, to develop an improved network for delivering individual care and treatment to thalidomiders and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/23">I have deliberately concentrated on the health issues faced by thalidomiders and the best approach for delivering quality health care, but I have not focused on the financial problems that they face as a result of these new conditions in purchasing, in particular, the expensive equipment to permit them to maintain satisfactory mobility. The all-party group on thalidomide, which I chair, is concerned about that point. I would be very grateful if my right hon. Friend the Minister agreed to meet its members, as well as thalidomiders, after Easter to discuss that very issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1597" name="Martin Caton">the Member for Gower (Mr. Caton)</phrase> on securing the debate. All Members should recognise the important points that he made regarding the thalidomide tragedy and wider questions about disability. I am grateful that he concentrated on social care, which has wider ramifications, as he also made the valid point that as people with disabilities caused by thalidomide reach their 50s, they will face increased health problems and, in some cases, will need a much greater level of care and support. It is very important to understand that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/2">I agree with my hon. Friend's conclusion about the history of thalidomide. It is shocking nowadays to think that a drug so inadequately tested could have been prescribed to pregnant women purely on the manufacturer's testament that it could</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/3" class="indent">&quot;be given with complete safety to pregnant women and nursing mothers without adverse effect on mother or child&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/4">We can all appreciate that such a situation could not arise today. The discovery of the links between thalidomide and birth defects led to a complete overhaul of the regulations on the testing of new drugs, encapsulated in the Medicines Act 1968.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/5">My hon. Friend touched on a number of other issues, however, and asked for the Government's response. On direct financial support, all Governments have, as he will know, adhered to the long-held policy not to make ex gratia payments to patients who have been, or are believed to have been, injured by a defective pharmaceutical product. That responsibility must rest with the company concerned. People with disabilities caused by thalidomide receive additional financial support, and a compensation package is in place through a private settlement agreed with Distillers&mdash;now Diageo. Furthermore, under a relatively recent agreement with Diageo, the company will continue to make annual payments to the trust. I understand that the most recent settlement will pay &pound;150 million to the trust by 2037. Agreements were also concluded with previous Governments. I refer specifically to payments made in 1974 and 1978, and to a full and final settlement to the trust in 1996. A review of the tax relationships was also carried out to get them into the best possible position.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/6">My hon. Friend mentioned a meeting with the trust, which has approached the Secretary of State, who has written back on two occasions, the most recent being yesterday.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.222.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1597" speakername="Martin Caton" colnum="222"  time="012:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0008.htm#09033133000542">
	<p pid="a.222.1/1">That is not exactly right. The trust has not made the case for financial assistance, because it is a charity and so unable to engage in political lobbying. The trust's advisory group, consisting of thalidomiders elected by all the thalidomiders in the country, was offered a meeting with officials, but the proposal to discuss financial assistance was precluded. My request to the Minister was for the all-party group, along with one or two thalidomiders, to meet her.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.222.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" colnum="222"  time="012:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0008.htm#09033133000543">
	<p pid="a.222.2/1">My hon. Friend went on to raise specific important points about social care packages and access to services for the 457 individuals, but much wider issues, which the trust has raised with us, also need to be dealt with. The Secretary of State replied yesterday in a letter to the chairman of its national advisory council. In it he mentioned a meeting with the Department as well as with the Treasury, because the trust has raised tax and other wider issues with us&mdash;even if my hon. Friend might not have done so today. The Secretary of State wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/2" class="indent">&quot;I find it disappointing that you feel that a meeting would sidetrack you from the focus of your campaign, this offer was made in good faith and I believe your actions are not in the best interests of the members you represent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/3">I again offer that meeting to begin discussions on these very important issues. We need to hold the meeting if we are to engage in these important and complex discussions and to provide a way forward, particularly on access to services and social care. I ask my hon. Friend to use his good offices to ensure that those preparatory meetings take place, so that we can progress the discussions.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.0/1">The all-party group is not an agent of the advisory council or anybody else. It is a group of MPs concerned about thalidomide, and we would be grateful for a meeting with the Minister to discuss various issues, including some that I have mentioned today.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.1/1">I shall certainly not deny the all-party group a meeting. However, if it expects me to take those issues forward, I need to know exactly what they are. The Secretary of State and I have received representations directly from the trust, and the chairman of the national advisory council has put a number of issues on the table for consideration. There has been no word from the trust or anyone else to indicate that those are not the issues of concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/2">My hon. Friend reiterated the issues today. The first relates to finance and the second relates to access to appropriate services. Government policy is designed to ensure that a person can live independently, with as much choice as possible in their care and greater opportunities to control their future. A number of policies deliver such goals, but as my hon. Friend rightly said, each individual has a number of specific and detailed personal issues, which need careful consideration. Such issues relate to access to social care and appropriate GP services and then referral to specialist services.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/3">I confirm to my hon. Friend that I should be more than pleased to receive details from the all-party group on the points that it expects me to cover in the meeting. I should also be grateful for an indication of how such information varies from the letter-writing campaign, the early-day motion and the work and campaigning of the national advisory council. That would help me to address the points that my hon. Friend has raised. I should be more than happy to facilitate such a meeting. However, what I cannot do, as I am sure that my hon. Friend appreciates, is discuss policies that might not necessarily be a matter for the Department of Health. They might, for example, be a matter for Diageo, or even the Treasury if the matter relates to tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/4">On that basis, I hope that my hon. Friend feels that we have a way forward. I want to do all that I can to facilitate a meeting with the all-party group, but to assist me in ensuring that the meeting has the focus that everyone wants, I should be grateful if my hon. Friend would provide me with the necessary detail. I am confident that all of us will ensure that we do the right thing with regard to the rights of these individuals. I thank my hon. Friend again for the opportunity of answering this Adjournment debate, and I look forward to receiving the points on which he wants us to reflect and then to facilitating the meeting with the all-party group.</p>

	<p pid="a.224.0/1">Has the Minister looked at the networking approach that the Thalidomide Trust and others have engaged in for dealing with the complex combination of problems? Referring a patient to one specialist and then to another does not deliver for them as a more holistic approach would do.</p>

	<p pid="a.224.1/1">I am aware of that, as are my officials. It was precisely because we wanted to focus on that area that we decided that the initial meeting should be with Department officials. We wanted to concentrate on that proposal and whether there was more that could be done. I refer to the point made about service delivery. Perhaps the trust interpreted our request of, &quot;Will you please meet with officials of the Department of Health initially to discuss this&quot; as a brush-off or a way of parking the issue rather than meeting the Minister. The opposite was the case. The initial request was to ensure that the matters raised by my hon. Friend were thoroughly considered so that we could see whether recommendations could be made to Ministers to take the matter forward. I accept that my hon. Friend is raising in this debate issues about how we can better improve and deliver services on a personalised and individualised basis, because that is necessary for all such groups&mdash;although urgently for thalidomide sufferers. I am trying to find a path to do that without a lot meetings that end with me saying, &quot;I am going to go away now and ask my officials to look at it and give me more detail before we take it forward.&quot; I hope that my hon. Friend will accept my suggestion on that basis. Perhaps we could do both: the trust could meet the officials, and I will meet the all-party group&mdash;as I am happy to do&mdash;to see how we can take the matter forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/2">I hope that my hon. Friend is now reassured. I look forward to meeting him in the not too distant future.</p>

	Child Seat Bases (VAT)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.225.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" speakername="Bob Russell" colnum="225"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0008.htm#09033133000548">
	<p pid="a.225.2/1">I have been a Member of Parliament for nearly 12 years, and this is the first time that a Minister has not been in his or her place at the start of a debate in which I have been involved. I find that regrettable, to put it mildly, particularly because today is my birthday.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/2">Nothing would give me greater pleasure if, as a result of the debate, there is one less child fatality on our roads. I am grateful to the Baby Products Association, which provided an extensive briefing on this important subject, not only on the child safety aspect, but on the nonsense of the variables in the VAT system, whereby the base on which a car seat is fixed is levied at 15 per cent., but the car seat that sits on it is levied at 5 per cent. Clearly, the base and the seat are one and the same, because neither is any use without the other. The Government should address that and bring the levy to a universal 5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/3">I declare that I am chairman of the all-party road safety group, which is backed by Brake, the road safety charity. I am also chairman of the associate parliamentary justice for road traffic victims group, which is supported by another charity, RoadPeace. I make no apology for additionally declaring an interest as the grandfather of Joseph, Owen and Jessica, who are seven, four and six months respectively. I am anxious that they and all other children who travel in cars are as safe as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/4">Every year, 30 children up to the age of 16 are killed while travelling in cars, more often than not when sitting in a car seat alongside parents who thought they were safe. Each year, more than 16,000 children are injured, 300 seriously. At 30 mph, an unrestrained child can be thrown forward with a force of 30 to 60 times their body weight. They would be thrown around inside the vehicle, injuring or possibly killing themselves and anyone else who was in their trajectory. They are also likely to exit the car through one of the windows.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/5">Those deaths and injuries can be prevented. We all know that the safest way for children to travel in cars is in a car seat that is suitable for their age, height and weight. A properly fitted child restraint keeps the child static in their seat. It prevents them from being thrown about, which reduces the likelihood that they will be injured or killed in a crash. Not only does that make perfect sense; it is the law of the land.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/6">I am grateful to the Royal Automobile Club Foundation for its briefing. Its research has shown that as many as one in 10 children who should be restrained in appropriate car seats are not. With so many children being put at risk, it is not surprising that such a large number end up killed or injured.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/7">In these difficult economic times, some parents and carers could be putting babies and small children in danger because they are simply unable to afford the best available child seats and other in-car safety equipment. Any deterrent, including prohibitive VAT rates, to the purchase of child car seats needs to be eliminated. The RAC Foundation's Philip Gomm stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/8" class="indent">&quot;The Government might be in desperate need of revenue but raising it at the expense of road safety in general, and the safety of the nation's children in particular, is a false economy, and sends out the wrong message to all responsible motorists...The RAC Foundation would urge the Chancellor to reconsider his policy on VAT on these sorts of child car seats and so support the objectives of the DfT's Think! Campaign which is aimed at reducing child casualty rates.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/9">Since 2006, children must be placed in the correct restraint for their age until they reach the age of 12 or the height of 135 cm, which in old money is about 4 ft 6 in. However, neither cars nor car seats are universal. Standard restraints with no base, placed directly on the vehicle seat and employing the existing adult belt system, can be fitted with the wrong tension and with the belt fed through the wrong pathways. Indeed, the car seat may be wrong for the car. Research has shown that only 25 per cent. of belt-fitted child car seats are fitted correctly at any given time. I am advised that data published by Halfords go as far as predicting that four in every five seats is fitted incorrectly. There is a danger that parents are being lulled into a false sense of security, and are unaware that despite their best efforts their children are still at risk every time they do the school run, visit grandparents or take a day trip to the seaside.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/10">There is also a danger that improvements in child safety technology are outpacing road safety laws. I am now becoming something of an expert on car seats and their fixings. Since 2007, International Standards Organisation FIX points are fitted as standard on all new models of European car. ISOFIX points are the international standard for attachment points for child safety seats. They allow base systems to be plugged directly into the chassis of the vehicle. ISOFIX bases for child car seats are simple and effective. They are fitted correctly 96 per cent. of the time, which is a margin of error of only 4 per cent. That might be 4 per cent. too much, but 96 per cent. of the time, things are okay. We should, however, compare that to the statistics for older models.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/11">Additions to the family can be fantastically expensive&mdash;there are so many things to buy&mdash;but one piece of equipment on which we must never compromise is the restraint system for the car. There may be a temptation to buy second-hand products from eBay and the like, but parents simply must not do that if they value their child's safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/12">The Baby Products Association has warned that the trend to use sites such as eBay, and car boot sales, smalls ads in newspapers and shop window postcards, means that parents are unwittingly risking their children's safety by purchasing second-hand equipment without knowing whether it has been involved in an accident or whether it complies with UK safety standards. On just one day recently, 1,420 used child restraint products were up for auction on eBay, including 434 forward-facing car seats, 736 rear-facing seats and 104 booster cushions.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/13">The BPA has launched a national campaign entitled, &quot;Think Before You Sell&quot;, aimed at nursery retailers, doctors' surgeries, antenatal departments, social services, playgroups, carers and the general public. The campaign, which is supported by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, calls on online sites to refuse to let sellers auction baby equipment unless they can provide a record of purchase, proof that the item has not been involved in an accident, full fitting instructions and guarantees that the seat meets the United Nations standard regulation 44.03 or 44.04.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/14">Peter White, chief executive of the BPA said last month:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/15" class="indent">&quot;As the credit crunch bites it is all too easy for families to opt for the cheapest option and go online. We have to remove the element of doubt when it comes to safety equipment as the alternative does not bear thinking about&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/16">If people do not know the history of a car seat, or if they do not have the instruction manual, the seat can become lethal. It may not be compliant with the necessary safety regulation, which I am advised is UN Economic Commission for Europe regulation 44. What is more, such is the speed of technological development, a car seat from only a few years ago will definitely not afford the same level of protection as a new one that is designed and built to the latest safety requirements. ROSPA is clear that people should not reuse car seats that have been in accidents. However, the sad fact is that many parents who think they are doing the best thing simply do not know that they are putting their children in danger every time they go out in the car.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/17">In an ideal world, we would have Government support to ensure that everyone with a vehicle can afford the best and safest car seat. Such support would ensure that parents struggling in the credit crisis would be able to avoid second-hand or hand-me-down products. There are a number of simple ways in which to make a real difference to hundreds of families who risk having their lives shattered by ill-fitted car seats. Make no mistake, the threat of poorly fitted children's car seats is on our roads every day.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/18">The BPA, which represents safety seat manufacturers, has been working closely with retailers such as Halfords and fuel companies such as Total as part of GMTV's &quot;Check It Fits!&quot; campaign. Working with local authority safety officers and the emergency services, they have run a series of safety spot checks in garages and retail parks, providing a service for families on the school run. Some of the things they found in one week recently include:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/19" class="indent">&quot;Monday, Aston Clinton. One driver had a child in the front of the car when it should have been in the back, we tried to put it in the back but found the seat belt connectors broken, the car supposedly had an MOT.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/20" class="indent">Tuesday, Burnham. Two-year-old in the back of an old Mini on a booster cushion with adult seatbelt around its neck&mdash;parent and grandmother declined free safety check and advice on correct restraint to use.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/21" class="indent">Wednesday, High Wycombe. Taxi driver with a two-month-old baby in the back of the car slumped in an adult seat belt and a three-year-old loose in the back of the car jumping up and down. His excuse were the restraints were in the other car. He did take some leaflets before roaring off.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/22" class="indent">Estate car pulls in with eight people inside. Two children in the luggage area unrestrained and one baby stuffed between the front seats. No child restraints anywhere, their excuse...they were on holiday! Another car pulls in with a child in the back of the car sitting in the child seat but not secured by the harness or seatbelt. The excuse was 'He can undo it himself so it's not worth doing it up'.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/23" class="indent">Thursday, Buckingham. All seats we checked were fitted correctly. ISOFIX prevalent&mdash;well done Buckingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/24" class="indent">Friday, Chesham. Final day of first week. One gentleman came in and had a child unrestrained in the back. When we advised him of the child seat regulations he said he lived in Hungary so it did not affect him.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/25">The campaign continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/26">All I am asking for is a simple package of measures that will make a real difference. The Baby Products Association is calling for the proper enforcement of police stop and check procedures to cover car seat safety as a matter of course when stopping vehicles for traffic infringements. After all, an adult would be fined immediately if they were found not to be wearing a seat belt. The proper fitting of child car seats should become part of the MOT test, so that without a properly fitted adult seat belt, the vehicle would fail the test.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/27">Industry has a role to play working in partnership with retailers, manufacturers, local and central Government and the automotive industry to train motor mechanics to put child safety first. Finally&mdash;this is what today's debate is all about&mdash;the BPA is calling for a change in VAT rules to make ISOFIX bases more affordable for ordinary families. ISOFIX bases are not currently considered a baby product by the Treasury because the technology has changed since the Finance Act 2001, which first applied the reduced 5 per cent. VAT rate to baby products. The full 15 per cent. VAT rate still applies to each base sold. The Finance Act 2001 considers bases as a car accessory, like fluffy dice or go-faster stripes. I fail to see how an integral part of a safety system that can save children's lives can be treated as a mere accessory.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/28">The Government reduced the VAT rate on standard car seats for children to 5 per cent., which is to be applauded. I simply ask that the same logic be applied to ISOFIX technology. The consumer is being disadvantaged on cost, and possibly forced to choose inferior and less safe products, putting young lives at risk. That is clearly an anomaly, and I hope that it can be addressed in the Chancellor's Budget on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-22">22 April</phrase>. The industry has been discussing possible changes with officials. Let us hope for good news.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/29">As part of their response to the financial emergency, the Government decided to reduce the top-line VAT rate from 17.5 per cent. to 15 per cent. to stimulate the economy. It has been estimated that the change will cost the Treasury &pound;12.5 billion. The cost of reducing VAT on car seat bases would be just &pound;3 million. Let us hope that on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-31">31 December</phrase> this year, one fewer item will revert back to 17.5 per cent.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.228.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1899" speakername="Angela Eagle" speakeroffice="The Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury"  colnum="228"  time="013:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0009.htm#09033133000549">
	<p pid="a.228.0/1">I apologise to everyone here for my tardy arrival, particularly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase>, who has secured a timely debate about an issue that is clearly due to be considered before the Budget. I wish the hon. Gentleman a happy birthday. I hope that he manages to get to his party earlier than I managed to get to this Chamber. Once more, I apologise.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/2">The hon. Gentleman has raised an important issue relating to children's car seat bases. Like any issue involving child safety, it is an important one for us to consider. The Government remain committed to ensuring the safety of children and babies travelling in vehicles. The Government's road safety strategy, &quot;Tomorrow's Roads&mdash;Safer for Everyone&quot;, seeks to reduce deaths and serious injuries of children involved in road accidents by 50 per cent. by 2010. Overall, casualties are down and we are on target to achieve that welcome reduction. The number of children killed and seriously injured in Great Britain was reduced from 515 in 2002 to 276 in 2007. Clearly, every one of those is one too many, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that we are going in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/3">To meet the modern-day challenge of safety on the roads, the Government continue to highlight the dangers and promote good practice through our various &quot;Think!&quot; road safety campaigns. The Government introduced changes to seat belt regulations in 2006 to ensure that the majority of children use the correct child or booster seat. The changes mean that, with very few exceptions, all children up to 135 cm in height must now use the correct child seat or booster for their weight in both front and rear seats. Department for Transport publicity continues to promote the use of children's car seats.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/4">Recognising the importance of child safety in vehicles, the Government introduced a reduced rate of VAT of 5 per cent. for children's car seats in 2001. At that time, as the hon. Gentleman was kind enough to highlight positively in his remarks, the Chancellor raised concerns about the number of children killed in road accidents and introduced the reduced VAT rate to help tackle the problem. He announced:</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Around 6,000 children under eight years old are killed or injured each year on Britain's roads. It is vital that child car seats are correctly fitted and used to help protect children from harm when travelling by car. The VAT rate on children's car seats will be reduced from 17.5 per cent to 5 per cent. This will reduce the cost of buying an essential piece of safety equipment, and encourage parents to buy better quality car seats, which can often be easier to fit.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/6">I am pleased to say that in 2002, the number of injuries suffered by children under eight years old travelling in cars fell to 5,107. By 2007, it had fallen further to 3,243. The Government continue to consider ways of reducing the number even more.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/7">All child and booster seats that support the 2006 seat belt regulations benefit from the existing rate of VAT. The UK is one of only three countries among the 27 EU member states that have taken advantage of introducing that particular reduced VAT rate.</p>

	<p pid="a.229.0/1">I appreciate all the positive things that have been done. Does the Minister accept that the base and the car seat need each other, and that, having rightly reduced the VAT on car seats to 5 per cent., the Government should also reduce the VAT on the base, as the car seat cannot be used without it?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.229.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1899" speakername="Angela Eagle" colnum="229"  time="013:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0009.htm#09033133000551">
	<p pid="a.229.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly reasonable point. I am aware that the main issue in question is that a reduced VAT rate is not available for children's car seat bases; I just wanted to set the debate in context. I am sure that he understands that the picture is improving, and we all have an interest in seeking to improve it further.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.1/2">The Government did not introduce a reduced rate for children's car seat bases in 2001, when the relief was first introduced for children's car seats, because such products did not really exist. Recent advances in technology have resulted in more specialised systems&mdash;the hon. Gentleman has mentioned ISOFIX&mdash;which improve the performance of child seats by rigidly attaching them to the car's structure by simply plugging them into location points. This greatly increases the likelihood of children's car seats being fitted correctly, which is obviously important. The hon. Gentleman has given some rather difficult examples of where that has not happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.1/3">The issue is that some of those systems use children's car seats in conjunction with separate car seat bases, and that there is an anomaly because those systems do not qualify under the current rules. They have a relatively small market share at the moment, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that the seats that plug into those new base systems do benefit from the reduced VAT rate, although the bases do not. I am aware that Treasury officials have met the Baby Products Association, as the hon. Gentleman did before bringing this matter to the attention of the House, and that this issue has been discussed in detail in those meetings. I am also aware that the BPA has contacted a number of other MPs, who have consequently made pre-Budget representations for a reduced VAT rate for children's car seat bases.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.1/4">As the hon. Gentleman has said, the Budget will take place shortly. We are currently in the middle of pre-Budget processes, during which issues such as this are brought to our attention and considered, so it would be premature of me to make an announcement today. I am sorry if that disappoints the hon. Gentleman, but I congratulate him on securing the debate. He has brought this important issue to our attention, and his comments are being considered along with the representations being made to us from all directions as part of the pre-Budget process. If there are to be any changes, they will be announced in the Budget in a few weeks' time. I am sorry to leave the hon. Gentleman dangling, and I am sorry that I cannot give a more detailed response at this juncture, but I hope that he understands why. We all share the common aim of reducing to zero, if possible, the fatalities of children and babies travelling in cars on our roads. We have made good progress with some of the changes that we have introduced, but more needs to be done, and we are considering this issue very closely.</p>

	Renewable Energy
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.231.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1534" speakername="Natascha Engel" colnum="231"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0009.htm#09033133000552">
	<p pid="a.231.2/1">I am grateful for having secured this Westminster Hall debate on what is becoming an increasingly urgent issue&mdash;the implementation of renewable energy targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/2">In initiating the debate, my main aim is to make some constructive proposals to help us to move on from what I think is becoming an unsustainable situation. The main thrust of my argument is that we, as national Government, set UK-wide targets for renewable energy. However, the detail of those targets is left to each region's spatial strategy to determine, and the planning application and the political fallout from implementing those targets are left with local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/3">Local authorities have to deal with the local campaign groups, which are almost always against having a wind farm or a waste-to-energy gasification plant near where those people live. The process is massively time consuming, with local groups organising meetings, petitions and marches on town halls, and often results in planning applications being turned down. That suits no one and goes no way towards meeting our important renewable energy targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/4">Nationally, the Government have set themselves the ambitious target of having 15 per cent. of the UK's electricity produced from renewable sources by 2010 and 35 per cent. by 2020. Along with most other MPs, I support those targets. Most people now understand the urgent need to wean ourselves off environmentally damaging, unsustainable and dirty fossil fuels. In fact, when the targets were announced, many MPs had postbags full of letters from constituents demanding that the targets be set much higher, and, when we look at the current situation, it is easy to understand why.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/5">The Local Government Association says that the electricity generated by renewables accounts for less than 5 per cent. of the UK's total energy output. The Government have done much more to address the problem of global warming and CO2 emissions than any previous Government, but, in our hurry to implement those important policies, we are overlooking their impact on the people who live with the consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/6">For example, in and around North-East Derbyshire, two controversial planning applications are in the pipeline. The first is for a waste-to-energy gasification and incineration plant on the Sheepbridge industrial estate just outside Chesterfield. The second is for a wind farm on the edge of the Peak District national park. Those are two very different examples, but they illustrate how difficult implementation of our national targets is. I know that waste and recycling are not dealt with by the Minister's Department, but I hope he will indulge me, because the point I shall make towards the end of my comments will show why it is important to raise those issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/7">The developers for the gasification plant claim that energy generated from their scheme would provide enough electricity to supply 16,000 homes, which is not an insignificant number. The plant is planned for an ex-industrial site and would use new, and as yet unproven, technology to convert compostable materials, such as wood and food, to gas for heating and hot water. Those compostable materials would be extracted from noxious and non-compostable materials. Some 75,000 tonnes of commercial waste a year would be delivered to the site, 15,000 tonnes of which would be separated and made into energy. The rest would be incinerated on site.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/8">People, including me, support the development of new technologies to tackle our mounting waste problem. We need to stop sending so much waste to landfill and look more constructively at how we can reuse our waste to make energy. I absolutely support that. However, although the company planning the gasification plant at Sheepbridge says that any hazardous waste would be treated and would not escape into the atmosphere and surrounding towns and villages, people who live nearby do not want to take the risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/9">The site may well be ex-industrial, but it is staggeringly close to the heavily populated outskirts of Chesterfield, including the whole of Dunston, Cutthorpe, Barlow and Whittington Moor. More than 20,000 people and several schools are in very close proximity to the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/10">One 1,500-signature petition, several extremely well-attended public meetings and an expensive legal opinion later, the final decision on whether to grant planning permission has still not been made. The local authority will have to make that decision in the teeth of such opposition and local councillors will have to live with the political consequences. And now&mdash;this matter is dealt with by the Minister's Department&mdash;another planning application has been made, this time for five turbines at the Matlock wind farm, which is on the edge of the Peak District national park. Three of those turbines would be in my constituency of North-East Derbyshire and two in the Derbyshire dales, an area represented by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1536" name="Patrick McLoughlin">the right hon. Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/11">That area may not be as heavily populated as the outskirts of Chesterfield, but it is, without doubt, an area of outstanding natural beauty. People have moved to the area specifically for its peacefulness, tranquillity and stunning views. Tourists come in great numbers every year for exactly the same reason. The Peak District and other national parklands are Britain's backyard. People come from far and wide&mdash;especially from our cities&mdash;to enjoy the beautiful countryside. Right by the turbines is the Darwin Forest country park, with its lovely pine lodges. It is situated there because it is miles from anywhere and has some of the most lovely surroundings. Tourism is the local economy, and putting wind turbines in the middle of the scenery would destroy it. If we are talking about sustainability, we need to calculate how many tourists would stop coming to the Peak district, get on an aeroplane and fly abroad instead.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/12">I totally support wind farms. Although many people find them ugly and industrial, I absolutely love them. However, our national parks are not an appropriate place to put them. Again, the ultimate decision, along with the political consequences for it, rests with the local authority. A vocal local campaign group has sprung up, petitions have been signed and public meetings held. A lot of time and money have been spent, the local community has been divided and conflict fills the local press.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/13">Rural versus urban is also an issue that is relevant to the debate. It is unlikely that a similar five-turbine wind farm application would be made for central London. It therefore falls disproportionately on rural and semi-rural areas to deal with implementing these targets. However, serious tensions also occur in rural areas. Farming is, without doubt, suffering hard for all sorts of different reasons. Farmers need to be ever more creative in generating income to keep themselves afloat, and having a wind farm or a composter on their land can be a lucrative lifesaver for them at a time when conventional farming is less profitable.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/14">When we think rural and semi-rural, we usually imagine rolling countryside and landed gentry, but that is not always the reality. Places such as North-East Derbyshire are predominantly ex-mining and have been involved with other heavy industries. People in North-East Derbyshire have lived for generations with polluted landscapes and toxins. Many people just do not think it fair that many of these applications are made in their areas because they are classed as former industrial sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/15">I want to make a small point about nimbyism. Whenever I meet people from local campaign groups who want to prevent projects from being built close to where they live, they always start by saying, &quot;We're not nimbys, but...&quot; I am sure that people are being nimbys, but there is nothing wrong with that. We are asking them to live with the consequences of the decisions that we are taking nationally. There is strong evidence to suggest that incinerators, and perhaps even wind farms, adversely affect house prices. If we want people to have such schemes in their backyard, we should be willing to compensate them. That could be done at the point of designating land that we make available for renewables and recycling schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/16">Given that we set our renewables targets nationally, we should also take responsibility for implementing them. The planning decision must still be made at local authority level, but the &quot;small p&quot; political decisions should be made here in Westminster. We need to act quickly. According to <i>The Sunday Times</i> this week, renewable power companies have so far erected 2,390 wind turbines at 200 onshore sites. Another 4,800 are planned, with many more to follow. That is a lot of people's backyards.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/17">Clearly, something needs to be done about the implementation of our ambitious targets to avoid costly, time-consuming and divisive local campaigns. I have two proposals to which I would like the Minister to respond. First, we should consider designating certain areas within each region where planning applications for renewable energy projects could be actively encouraged. Those areas would be identified nationally and would take account not only of areas of outstanding natural beauty, but of proximity to dense populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/18">While we are still putting the finishing touches to the Infrastructure Planning Commission, which is a national body that will look at planning decisions of national significance, we should consider including projects for renewables and recycling, as well as sites for nuclear energy generation, large road-building projects and aviation schemes. A nationally led but locally determined system for managing those applications seems to be the only way ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/19">Secondly, I would like the Minister to look at the feasibility of 2-km buffer zones, which have been considered in Scotland and other European countries, most of which are far less heavily populated than England. The IPC could make recommendations on buffer zones, which would mean that any applications for renewables or waste-to-energy projects were ideally at least 2 km from cities, towns and villages, and certainly as far away from densely populated areas as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/20">The 2-km buffer zone would be a consideration when the IPC designated land for renewables and recycling use. The advantage would be the designation of areas, not the planning application itself, becoming the issue. That would mean that difficult arguments could be resolved before an application even went in, which would leave local authorities to make planning decisions on the merits of the scheme alone, rather than having to deal with the political fallout from applications for unpopular schemes. It would certainly be more time-efficient and far less costly.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/21">I appreciate that I am straying into the responsibilities of the Department for Communities and Local Government, but a 2-km buffer zone would mean applications such as the one for the gasification unit at Sheepbridge, which would be so close to a major town and surrounding villages, never being made.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/22">I am concerned that, unless we resolve the issue of how we implement our national targets, we may end up either entirely failing to meet them or forcing them on to unwilling communities. I hope that the Minister will take my suggestions in the helpful spirit in which they are intended. I look forward to hearing his response, although I will fully understand if he does not want to veer into areas covered by other Departments.</p>

	<p pid="a.234.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1534" name="Natascha Engel">the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase> on securing this debate, and on her erudite and constructive contribution to the crucial issues that it raises about renewable energy and ensuring that suitable sites are found for development. She raised a couple of cases that are currently in the planning process. She will understand that, as a result, I cannot comment on them, but she has, with her usual forcefulness, set out the case of her constituents and ensured that it is brought to the attention of Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/3">Combating climate change while ensuring that we have secure energy supplies is the biggest long-term challenge that this country and, indeed, the world faces. Energy efficiency, nuclear power, carbon capture and storage, and renewables all have a role to play in meeting our commitments to provide 15 per cent. of our overall energy from renewable sources by 2020, and to reduce greenhouse gases by 80 per cent. by 2050. As my hon. Friend said, we are looking for about 35 per cent. of our electricity to come from renewable sources by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/4">To have the best chance of meeting those challenges and ensuring that our actions are not just ambitious but fair to people and sustainable, we must consider all reasonable options. The UK is in the privileged position of having outstanding natural resources for renewable energy: hydropower, onshore and offshore wind, and wave and tidal stream energy. We are starting from a low base of deployment, but we have made significant progress in recent years, with a near tripling of our renewable electricity generation since 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/5">We have been successful in encouraging the market to deliver investment, and there is much more in the pipeline. As of October 2008, more than 2,000 MW of renewable electricity generating capacity was under construction, 6,300 MW has been consented to and 8,700 MW is in planning. The UK is now No. 1 in the world for offshore wind, overtaking Denmark in October last year. At the same time, we passed the 3 GW mark for installed wind, both on and offshore.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/6">However, if we are to meet the challenging targets that we have set ourselves for increasing the proportion of our energy that comes from renewables, we need a contribution from all renewables technologies, not just onshore and offshore wind; for example, from waste, biomass, microgeneration, and heat technologies. Notwithstanding the impacts of the current financial downturn, the Government are committed to meeting their targets for renewables, and we are looking at ways to help companies invest.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/7">To reach our target, we will need to increase deployment some eightfold in just 11 years, but we must be clear that meeting the challenge will require a more rapid deployment of new infrastructure across the UK, and that there will be local impacts from such deployment. Along with our plans for new nuclear power and energy efficiency, that represents a significant change in how this country will use and supply energy over the next decade. Delivering on that national change, our Big Energy Shift means getting the framework right to ensure that schemes are built in the right places, at the right times. It also means engaging with communities at all levels to ensure that not just national benefits but local and community benefits are delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/8">Planning will be key to getting the renewable energy infrastructure that must be built in time for 2020. The planning system is where we ask economic, social and environmental objectives to be integrated, and where potential conflicts between the interests of individuals or local communities and the needs of the nation as a whole are reconciled.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/9">Given the scale of the challenge that we face, each and every decision on a renewable energy project counts. We must be aware of the interests of local communities, listen to legitimate concerns about specific proposals and their location, and give industry as much certainty as possible on whether a project is likely to gain consent and, if so, when. If the risk of development is too great, investment will stop flowing and could move to other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/10">Where and when we get renewable energy developments is dependent on business wanting to invest and having the confidence to do so. Likewise, if local communities feel ignored, they will lose trust in the accountability of the decisions that are made on their behalf. The planning system must create an attractive environment for the private sector to invest in renewable technologies but balance that with local concerns. We need to tackle delays in planning and ensure that projects for renewable energy are refused planning permission only if there are sufficient reasons for doing so. That means getting good quality applications through the planning system and looking at ways to improve the system in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/11">We are gearing up the planning system to help make the move to a low-carbon economy with much higher use of renewable energy. The reforms that we introduced last November in the Planning Act 2008 will play a vital part in achieving that. The delivery of the reforms set out in the Act will be key to meeting our 2020 goals, and we are on track to produce national policy statements for consultation and parliamentary scrutiny later this year. They will set out for the first time the national importance of energy infrastructure and how the policy interacts with the planning process. National policy statements will be a material consideration for decisions made under Town and Country Planning Acts and will help to ensure that renewables decisions are taken consistently whether they are large or small.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/12">The planning policy statement on climate change already encourages regions and local planners actively to plan for and support renewable energy generation, including by allocating and safeguarding sites. That is an important part of encouraging a proactive approach to increasing the amount of renewable energy but also helps to ensure that there are more benefits for local communities. However, we need to do more.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/13">In our renewable energy consultation last summer, we set out a range of ideas for increasing local and regional ownership of planning applications for renewable energy, for increasing capability in the planning system, and for improving the quality of applications. The Government are committed to publishing our renewable energy strategy this summer, in which we will set out our views in light of consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/14">In our heat and energy saving strategy consultation published last month, we further explored how to engage with local communities and householders on energy use and supply, and in particular how we can ensure that consumers, businesses and communities are able to realise the benefit of lower energy bills and reduced carbon emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/15">My hon. Friend put forward a number of suggestions, and I shall deal with them now. She asked us to consider the idea of designating, within each region, certain areas where planning applications for renewable energy projects would be encouraged. There is already an expectation that regions will set some targets for renewable energy in line with national policy. Planning policy statement 1, in its supplement on climate change published in December 2007, asks regional and local authorities to identify broad areas that they consider appropriate for renewables development, and sites. We set out a range of possible measures in our renewable energy strategy consultation, which was published last summer, to ensure that regional and local authorities plan positively for renewable energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/16">Although we are not quite doing what my hon. Friend suggests, we can look at her ideas with great care, because they fit in with the broad strategy that is being adopted. We want local authorities to plan positively for renewable energy, and, in the renewable energy strategy this summer, we will set out our views on how that can be taken forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.236.0/1">When my hon. and learned Friend talks about designating areas, does he mean local authority areas or specific sites within those areas?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.237.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1910" speakername="Mike O'Brien" colnum="237"  time="013:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0010.htm#09033133000555">
	<p pid="a.237.0/1">The general idea is that local authorities will identify broad areas either where renewable energy projects will be encouraged or considered for development, or where concerns are low. To some extent, the companies that bring forward the projects will decide where they want an application to be considered. They will make the application, and we need to ensure that the planning process determines it in the most appropriate way.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/2">We are looking for areas, within each local area or region, where local and regional authorities can take a view on the location of renewables. We are not necessarily saying &quot;This is the field,&quot; but, more broadly, &quot;This is the area where applications will be considered.&quot; The local authority and the applicant will then decide on the application's location.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/3">My hon. Friend also asked about the role of the infrastructure planning commission. It will deal with major infrastructure projects and decide on onshore renewable electricity projects of more than 50 MW in scale. Smaller project clusters of cumulatively more than 50 MW will be called in to the IPC, too. We firmly believe, however, that it is important for local government to maintain its role in deciding on 50 MW projects and lower. That is our view on relatively small projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/4">My hon. Friend asked about 2 km buffer zones, and that issue is addressed by the current planning process&mdash;in a sense. Local authorities and planners can determine the buffer zone for an application. She says that, generally, there should be a 2 km buffer zone, but, although separation distances are needed for a range of impacts, such as noise, health and safety and so on, they tend to depend on the specificities of the project, such as the number, height and location of the turbines, the general topography of the land and more. We therefore consider that, currently, separation distance can be dealt with case by case&mdash;in line with PPS 22, on renewable energy, and its companion guide.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/5">My hon. Friend suggested something broader with a general application, but the issue depends on the area. Some urban areas may want wind turbines of a significant size. For example, they may be located in an urban estuary area, and the local authority may take the decision. We would not want to do anything to prejudice the local desire to locate a project in their area just because it did not happen to fit in with the 2 km suggestion. The planning system currently has to consider in each case the idea of a reasonable distance between villages, towns and larger urban areas and the location of a planning application.</p>

	<p pid="a.237.1/1">The issue is normally wind turbines, and, in all the documents that I have read, a lot of consideration is given to areas of outstanding natural beauty, but densely populated areas are not discussed much at all. On the issue of a 2 km buffer zone, those areas ought to be top of the agenda, but I did not see them anywhere.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.238.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1910" speakername="Mike O'Brien" colnum="238"  time="013:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0010.htm#09033133000557">
	<p pid="a.238.0/1">When we introduce feed-in tariffs, local communities will see the benefit to them, because the tariffs mean that a certain amount of money could come out of the generation and go into the local community, providing not only energy but financial resource. The tariffs come in next year, and we expect them to have a significant impact on people's views. It is all very well locating a number of wind turbines in a community, because they generate electricity for the rest of the country; however, the community has to have the turbines and, if, like my hon. Friend, it quite likes them, that is fine, but if it does not, it has a problem. Each person tends to have a different view, so it is best if we find a way for local communities to see that they could benefit from wind turbines.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/2">In Germany, for example, feed-in tariffs mean that local communities often welcome a turbine in their area, either because they want it to generate electricity from which they will benefit, or because they see that the turbine will generate beneficial funds for the community as a result of its location. Such feed-in tariffs may affect the attitudes of some local people: if they see a positive local benefit, they may take a different view. In a democracy, people always take all sorts of views and, in many ways, the joy of living in a democracy is that people are entitled to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/3">We agree with my hon. Friend that local and regional authorities must begin to consider their areas and plan for renewables proactively, rather than simply consider applications as they come in. They will have to do that in any event. If they have a view about where they think it right and permissible to locate wind farms or other renewables, they should ensure that local communities know the expectations for that area. That is true in relation to renewables, but it would not necessarily apply to other applications. To some extent, local communities, and local authorities in particular, must decide what is best for themselves. We do not want to centralise everything. We want local communities to have their say, and we want to ensure that, in a democracy, people who are directly affected by something have the right to voice their view about it and to make sure that that view is not only heard but, in many cases, listened to, resulting in the decision being made as they want it to be.</p>
