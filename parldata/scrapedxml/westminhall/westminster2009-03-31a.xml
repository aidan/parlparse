<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.177.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1535" speakername="Mark Todd" colnum="177"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0001.htm#09033133000454">
	<p pid="a.177.3/1">I had wondered about the temperature and whether it was due to my heavy cold, which has made my already deep voice even deeper.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/2">I am grateful to the Motor Neurone Disease Association, which suggested the topic for the debate. It is the only national organisation that tries to support people who suffer from this terrible disease. One of its focuses is, of course, to find a cure, and another important one is to support people through the process of the disease until their death.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/3">Not many people know a huge amount about motor neurone disease, which is quite rare. About 5,000 people in the UK suffer from it and partly because of its late diagnosis the typical period between diagnosis and death&mdash;it is incurable&mdash;is about 14 months. I shall return to why that is material. The disease affects the motor neurones&mdash;the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control muscles. All muscles are affected, including the respiratory muscles, which control regular breathing&mdash;critically when asleep&mdash;and keep people alive. Ventilatory impairment is one of the most frequent causes of eventual death in people who suffer from motor neurone disease. The respiratory muscles fail to work and the sufferer is unable to breathe. The process is very distressing, and causes the sufferer and their carers tremendous anxiety. I shall speak about some of the issues that arise for carers of people with MND.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/4">Not only is ventilatory failure a main cause of death, it is a main cause of poor health in the later stages of the illness because poor sleep leads to dramatic loss of quality of life, including headaches, cognitive failure and, in extreme cases, hallucinations when awake. It can also lead to lethargy, requiring additional care simply to maintain the normal course of life. Ventilatory problems are a critical part of the path of motor neurone disease in the typical survival period after diagnosis. The disease dominates family life, and sleep impairment is a critical part of the impact on carers. If a sufferer is not sleeping properly and is perhaps in danger of dying in their sleep, a carer becomes anxious and spends a lot of time supporting the sufferer and trying to help them through the episodes. That leads to poor health among carers, so the difficulty has a multiple effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/5">Non-invasive ventilation, which is the subject of this debate, is a relatively simple technology involving a pump, an air filter, and a means of delivering air, usually a mask, into the sufferer's lungs, essentially to keep air flowing into the body to keep the sufferer alive when the ventilatory muscles are not functioning properly. The full kit is not particularly expensive, and costs about &pound;6,000. The face mask and so on are obviously personal to the individual, but the key piece of technology supporting the ventilatory muscles&mdash;the pump&mdash;is reusable and can be passed to another patient when necessary. Unlike a drug, it is an efficient means of helping people with a terrible illness.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/6">Non-invasive ventilation relieves sleep disturbance because it provides the passage of air into the body at regular intervals without the use of the muscles, so the sufferer can sleep normally. It can also be used for longer periods; in the later stages of the disease the problem occurs during the day, as well as at night. Clinical research published in 2006 showed that non-invasive ventilation typically increased the median survival period for people with motor neurone disease by seven months. As I said, the typical survival period is 14 months, so seven months would be a material change in someone's survival, and a major change in their quality of life and that of their carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/7">I have met people who have had the technology available to them, and it has revolutionised their own feelings and transformed the life of the family caring for them, who can be more relaxed about the sufferer going off to sleep and can lead a more normal life when at home looking after the sufferer. It has a holistic impact on the family unit affected by motor neurone disease. Studies to date have shown that it is a profoundly beneficial technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/8">One might think that suggests that a simple decision could be made about the availability of the technology to MND sufferers. It is relatively cheap, is largely reusable, substantially lengthens life, and improves life quality for sufferers and their carers. The judgment seems to be relatively simple, so it is difficult to explain why the only study that has been done on availability showed that only about 3 per cent. of those suffering from motor neurone disease have the technology made available to them. It may not be appropriate for some sufferers of MND, either because the disease has not yet affected the respiratory muscles, or for other clinical reasons, but it is hard to understand how only 3 per cent. of sufferers might benefit from the technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/9">The evidence also shows that use of the technology is very unevenly distributed among neurological consultants who choose to prescribe it. Some neurological consultants regularly prescribe the technology for those suffering from motor neurone disease; others scarcely prescribe it at all. Prima facie, one would expect in that circumstance that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence would be the first port of call, because it is a classic case of the postcode lottery and uneven distribution of care that NICE was set up to address. It is not surprising, therefore, that shortly after the clinical study showed the benefits of the technology, NICE was approached to suggest that a study be done. That was in 2006&mdash;more than three years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/10">I say straight away that I am an enthusiastic defender of the NICE process. There has been a profound improvement in the way in which we allocate resources in the NHS and there is a much better framework for establishing best practice in both technologies and medicines for NHS patients. Of course there is controversy attached to the treatments; that is inevitable. I am not speaking as a regular critic of the institution&mdash;far from it. I am a regular defender of it, sometimes to my constituents, who are not as willing to listen to that side of the argument as I am.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/11">However, it is surprising that there was such a lengthy delay. It is also surprising&mdash;I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister provides some useful information on this&mdash;that following contact with the Department to suggest that NICE engage in the study, there was an interval of nearly three years before a referral was made to NICE at the end of last year to consider the technology. That is harder still to understand when NICE's own studies, through its consideration panel, showed that the technology had a score of four and a half out of five. Clearly, as I have said, the technology met many of the criteria that NICE is interested in when considering a particular treatment and technology. We require explanations of what happened and why there has been such a delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/12">We are now at the point we are at. NICE has had the referral and is considering how quickly to proceed. Regrettably, what it has said so far is that it will proceed with a study starting at the end of this year and finishing in 2011. Let me put that in a time frame relevant to those who suffer from the disease. Assuming that clinical practice does not alter voluntarily&mdash;sadly, it often does not&mdash;it will mean that in the next two and a half years, before NICE pronounces, some thousands of people suffering from the disease will not receive that treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/13">The case is solid for rapid consideration of the technology and for a judgment to start that consideration as soon as possible. I hope that the Minister gives us some reassurance that that is the message she will be giving her Department and those who liaise with NICE on its work programme, and perhaps to NICE itself. I recognise that it is an independent agency&mdash;it should be independent. Nevertheless, it should listen hard to its stakeholders and those who are critically interested in the care of people who suffer from terrible diseases such as motor neurone disease.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.180.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" speakername="Julian Lewis" colnum="180"  time="009:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0001.htm#09033133000459">
	<p pid="a.180.0/1">Well, I shall join the throng in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/2">I must explain that although I am operating somewhat out of my comfort zone, I was so impressed by the case that was made for the need to get the equipment into the possession of people suffering from this dreadful wasting disease that I decided to take a chance and venture into areas on which I am wholly dependent on advice and briefing from the Motor Neurone Disease Association. I shall unashamedly be relying on the material that it has given me.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/3">I often say to constituents who come to see me with dreadful problems that MPs have influence but no power. We cannot overrule bodies that are empowered by law to take responsibility for policy implementation. However, we can sometimes speed up a process whereby those bodies would probably get round in the end to doing what needs to be done, because it is in line with policy as laid down by Parliament and Government, but they have been dragging their feet.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/4">Like the hon. Gentleman, I do not intend to cast any aspersions on the work of NICE. I do not know enough about the queuing system that it has for dealing with one task after another. I fear that it may operate on a first come, first served principle, which may mean that a relatively simple decision about a relatively inexpensive measure that needs to be taken has to wait a disproportionate time before it is considered, purely because it is in a queue behind a much more complicated decision that has to be taken about much more expensive equipment or treatment for a much more challenging dilemma and disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/5">Therefore, I hope that what we say today in this Chamber will not overrule any procedures that NICE must follow, but will give it a bit of a prod, especially when we bear in mind everything that the hon. Gentleman said about the life expectancy that someone diagnosed with motor neurone disease can have. Let us not forget that one vicious aspect of the disease is that the person's mind remains totally unaffected right up to the end. They know exactly what is happening; they are well aware of the fact that their whole system is gradually closing down. It is of great concern if, knowing that they are under a death sentence of 14 months&mdash;that is the average time from diagnosis to death&mdash;we are not doing everything that we can to make that time as bearable for those people as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/6">I am told by the Motor Neurone Disease Association that one reason why I may not have heard too much about problems relating to NIV treatment in my constituency of New Forest, East is that we are very fortunate in my part of the world. When someone is diagnosed with motor neurone disease, the first step is for their neurologist to refer them to the respiratory services department. That department is usually found in a general hospital, and there is certainly one in Southampton general hospital, which serves my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/7">The disease can lead to rapid degeneration, including in the gaps between appointments with the neurologist, so if the neurologist does not refer a motor neurone disease sufferer to respiratory services after their first appointment, that person's situation and quality of life may deteriorate substantially before it is possible to see the neurologist again and get a referral on a second or subsequent appointment. Making neurologists aware of the need to anticipate what may happen and to make a referral as soon as possible is therefore one aspect of this question.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/8">A top neurologist specialising in this terrible disease serves my constituency and the people of the Southampton area. Respiratory services at Southampton general hospital also have a fabulous person working for them, who is in a good position to supply the NIV kit as soon as she gets the referrals. The kit consists of a box, pump and tubes to allow air to be supplied to the patient overnight and, in the later stages, possibly in the days as well. I understand that Hampshire primary care trust, which serves my constituency, also supplies these kits. I am therefore speaking from a very fortunate minority position and I congratulate the general hospital, the neurological department, the respiratory services department and the PCT on what they are doing for MND sufferers in my part of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/9">NICE apparently rates the priority with which it wishes to deal with the question of supplying pumps at four and a half out of five on its priority scale&mdash;very highly, in other words.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/10">On the question of expense, we have heard that the whole equipment package costs &pound;6,000 per person, but all that money is not lost. After the initial period of use is, sadly, over, the pumps are entirely reusable, and a large part of the cost is recycled for the benefit of future sufferers.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/11">NIV is believed to increase the lifespan of MND sufferers by up to 11 months. Compared with other forms of treatment, which are much more expensive and which are believed to increase lifespan by up to three months at most, NIV is obviously incredibly good value for money. However, we should look at the issue not just in monetary terms, but in terms of humanitarian assistance. As has been said, when one knows that one is going to die in little more than a year, what is more valuable than being able to make those few remaining months tolerable and worthy of living, rather than constantly wishing that the agony was over? As the MND Association says,</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The human cost in terms of life extension and quality of life of denying access to this vital treatment for so many people with MND is enormous.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/13">Ventilatory failure arising from respiratory muscle weakness, which gradually progresses as the disease takes hold, is the most common cause of death in MND and is frequently preceded by sleep-disordered breathing. That, in turn, is associated with considerable morbidity, which causes disturbed sleep, severe daytime sleepiness and headaches, reduced appetite and cognitive impairment. Some people with MND have such disturbed sleep that they report having hallucinations during the day. Anybody who has ever suffered from severe sleep deprivation for any reason&mdash;mental breakdown, physical illness, abuse by captors in a conflict situation&mdash;will know the devastating effect of being systematically deprived of sleep. It is the worst form of torture that one can inflict on a human being, and that is what this disease does to sufferers during much of the 14 months that they have left once the diagnosis is confirmed.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/14">Clinical trials have shown that NIV significantly improves quality of life for people with MND by increasing blood oxygen levels, which leads to significantly higher-quality sleep, fewer terrible daytime headaches and increased appetite. It is what the military would call a force multiplier. If people's brains can receive more oxygen, every one of their remaining bodily and mental functions will be improved for as long as they live, their quality of life will be better and the period left with their families and friends will be extended.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/15">The MND Association gives an example of the personal experiences of someone who has had NIV:</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/16" class="indent">&quot;Mr S said that prior to using NIV he was waking very frequently at night&mdash;up to 39 times per hour according to his consultant. This meant he felt very unwell during the day, describing how he felt as having a very bad hangover. He was also hallucinating during the day. Since using NIV however he sleeps well at night, feels much better during the day and has stopped having hallucinations. He said that NIV has completely changed his life. His wife...said that NIV was a lifeline for them.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/17">Research carried out in 2001 and funded by the MND Association showed that only 5.5 per cent. of people with MND who were under review were receiving NIV. There was a marked variation in clinical practice, with just three neurologists responsible for 30 per cent. of all referrals in the whole United Kingdom. I have no idea how many neurologists in the UK have MND sufferers on their books, but the fact that only three, who are clearly enthusiasts for the treatment, account for almost a third of referrals nationally indicates that there is a huge ocean of unnecessary suffering out there.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/18">As soon as research was published showing that NIV was effective in treating MND although not widely available, the MND Association suggested NIV to NICE so that guidance could be produced for the NHS. As we have heard, that was in January 2006. Nearly three years later&mdash;at the end of 2008&mdash;the Department of Health finally referred NIV to NICE. There must be all sorts of sensible reasons for that delay, but I do not think that they would have cut much ice with the thousands of people who were suffering from MND over that long period.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/19">Throughout those three years, the MND Association repeatedly asked for progress on NIV and was told that it was, as I have said, considered a high priority, scoring four and a half out of five in NICE's consideration panel for topic selection. All I can say is that it makes me wonder about those rated with lower priorities. Given all the billions that have been spent on health, if NICE is indeed doing a good job its capacity is clearly under-resourced. It needs to do a good job&mdash;if that is what it is doing&mdash;more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/20">When NIV was finally referred to NICE, the MND Association expected work on the guidance to start straight away, but NICE said it could not start work until late 2009, as we have heard; the guidance was due to be published early in 2011. The MND Association says&mdash;who can disagree?&mdash;that it is unacceptable that it could take five years to produce guidance for a vital treatment for that fatal disease. More than 8,000 people will have died from MND during the time in question, many of whom will have been denied access to the life-extending and life-enhancing treatment offered by NIV.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/21">NICE has said it will produce a short clinical guideline on NIV and that it can work on only a small number of projects at any one time, to produce such guidelines. The MND Association has identified several such projects that will be completed this spring, and it therefore believes that work on NIV can start then. My appeal to the Minister is that she will use what influence she feels she properly can to get the simple and relatively inexpensive process in question into that available slot in the NICE agenda, if statute and the proprieties that govern her role allow her to exert such influence. The questions that I have been asked to raise are why it took nearly three years for NIV to be referred to NICE, when it was considered a high priority; whether the Minister thinks that it is acceptable for it to have taken that long, and for 8,000 people with MND to die waiting, and why NIV work cannot begin when other short clinical guidelines are completed in April. It would be interesting to receive an insight on how NICE prioritises treatments that are referred to it in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/22">I said earlier that I am operating out of my comfort zone, which is usually mainly military and security matters. However, there was a strange convergence of my interest, because when I was preparing for the debate my mind went back to one of the most inspiring interviews I ever read. It inspired me so much that I had special copies printed and framed, and was able to present one of them to the widow of the person who gave the interview. He was the late Lord Cheshire, better known as Leonard Cheshire, VC, DSO, DFC, and countless bars to those awards. He was famous twice over, but he deserves to be famous three times over. He was famous for being one of the most courageous and certainly the most highly decorated bomber pilot of world war two. He was famous also for his piety and his amazing achievement in founding the Cheshire Homes for the terminally ill.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/23">I feel that he should be famous as well for the interview that he gave. The article, by Anne de Courcy, was published in the <i>Evening Standard </i>a few days after Lord Cheshire died in 1992, and explains:</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/24" class="indent">&quot;He had the fatal muscle-wasting disease, motor neurone, and his condition was rapidly deteriorating. Two days earlier, he had rung to warn me that his voice was weak 'but do come . . . this will be my last interview'.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/25" class="indent">He sat in his electrically operated armchair, back to the windows of his upstairs study, knees raised to avoid pressure on his emaciated hip bones.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/26" class="indent">Every few minutes he sucked through a straw from a glass of orange liquid; this, it transpired, was a mixture of Lucozade and a high-calorie food powder.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/27" class="indent">He explained matter-of-factly that the internal muscles degenerate with the external ones, so that breathing, voice and eating are all affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/28" class="indent">'You can't chew, and you can't swallow properly, so you tend to choke.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/29">The article continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/30" class="indent">&quot;'Am I frightened?' he said. 'Oh no, how could I be? I've worked all these years with disabled people and, really, it's a kind of confirmation of my vocation. Before, it was always a case of me and them but I can now say, 'We disabled'.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/31" class="indent">'I mustn't be presumptuous&mdash;I may find that the physical difficulties get me down&mdash;but it has given me a kind of inner joy. If you're a Christian'&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/32">which, of course, famously, he was&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/33" class="indent">&quot;'then you have to believe that the Christian way is the way of the Cross. I've had a good life. This is just something to be got round&mdash;a bit of flak on the way to the target.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/34">That interview was entitled &quot;My Fear and the Final Journey Home&quot;. It ended with Lord Cheshire saying that the only time he had been really scared during the war was when, after completing a particularly dangerous mission, he let his guard down for a moment and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/35" class="indent">&quot;'We've made it...Give me a course for home.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/36">At that moment his aircraft was caught by searchlights and he had a dreadful time escaping. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/37" class="indent">&quot;I've learned now never to say you're home until you've crossed that finishing tape.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/38">Everyone who is diagnosed with motor neurone disease knows they are heading for the finishing tape. It is our duty to exert every scrap of influence that we have to make sure that that final journey is as dignified and tolerable as it can be made.</p>

	<p pid="a.184.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1535" name="Mark Todd">the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd)</phrase> on securing the debate with such apparent ease&mdash;first time lucky. If he is indeed reliable in matters of betting, perhaps he will, by way of intervention, indicate the likely winner of this weekend's grand national. That would make me very happy and give a quick way to make a considerable contribution to the coffers of the Motor Neurone Disease Association.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/2">My involvement with the association did not come about for happy reasons. My father died of motor neurone disease in April 2005, and the hon. Gentleman and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase> accurately described exactly the process that takes place when someone experiences that affliction. In simple terms, the body shuts down from the outside in. As we know, the individual's intellectual faculties are rarely affected, so the disease is in some ways the antithesis of Alzheimer's, in which the body remains sound but the mind becomes frail. With motor neurone disease, the mind remains sound and observes the body becoming frail, until a person is indeed trapped&mdash;a prisoner in their physical form, knowing that it is only a matter of time before the end comes.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/3">My view on the disease is exactly as that set out by the hon. Member for South Derbyshire: the experience of the disease is undergone not just by the immediate sufferer, but by the family and friends&mdash;perhaps more than in almost any other disease I have seen&mdash;because everyone knows where it is heading. Also, because of the difficulty in diagnosing this disease, it is, as we have heard, 14 months on average from diagnosis to death. In my father's case, it was a matter of weeks from him effectively diagnosing his own condition to his death. It is likely that affected individuals have the disease in their body for much longer, but we have not yet found a reliable form of diagnosis. That is a matter for research and it may offer a pointer in the direction of cure.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/4">What is most remarkable about the disease, and what I have discovered since my first formal link with the association, is, first, the inescapability of the outcome. People pretty much know that they are going to die from the disease at the point of diagnosis. The second remarkable thing is the irrepressible outlook of those who experience the disease. The hon. Member for New Forest, East described the archetypal viewpoint of many who suffer it. When I started visiting the association's branches and seeing those who suffer from MND, I recognised their positive acceptance of the circumstance. I have little doubt that that acceptance, in itself, extends the lives of those who suffer the disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/5">One often sees a degree of black humour, but there is always warmth and rarely resentment about the cards that life has dealt. That is salient to the matter of non-invasive ventilation. The better the care of those who have MND, the better their outlook and the less abandoned they feel, and the stronger their physical ability to extend what life they have left to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/6">What is most encouraging about non-invasive ventilation is the relative simplicity of the technique. It is not rocket science. It does not even involve oxygen. It involves pumping hot air into the lungs. In essence, it helps weak lungs to breathe more normally through the use of air pressure. That is very much it. As such, it is not difficult. One has to be an expert to understand how it works and to be a practitioner, but compared with the many challenges faced by medicine these days, it is not top of the technological list. In that sense, it produces beneficial effect with relatively little difficulty. That is why it is called non-invasive ventilation.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/7">We should remember what non-invasive ventilation does: if one cannot breathe, one cannot sleep; if one cannot sleep, one becomes tired, which weakens one's ability to fight the disease. Ultimately, the lack of respiratory capacity leads to death. Indeed, that is how my father died. As we heard, non-invasive ventilation improves not only the immediate quality of life, but, on average, adds seven months to the lives of those with the disease. I recognise that seven months is half the usual span from diagnosis to death, but it represents a 50 per cent. increase in survivability. That is 50 per cent. not only for the sufferer; for the reasons that I have described, it is also 50 per cent. for the families.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/8">I am persuaded that the research is robust. It has already been cited, but is so important that I shall cite it again. It is by S.C. Bourke et al, published in volume 5, issue 2, pages 142-47, of <i>The Lance</i><i>t Neurology</i> in February 2006, and entitled, &quot;The effects of non-invasive ventilation on survival and quality of life in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a randomised controlled trial&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/9">I put that on the record for those specialists and correspondents who take a particular interest in the disease. They will see how clear-cut and unequivocal the research is. Indeed, in a complementary prospective study, non-invasive ventilation increased survival in MND sufferers by almost 11 months, so there is little doubt that it does what people claim. Practitioners are completely persuaded that this is the way to go.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/10">The people of New Forest, East are blessed in two ways. First, they have an outstanding Member of Parliament, in the hon. Member for New Forest, East&mdash;for the purposes of this debate, my hon. Friend. Secondly, they have an outstanding medical facility in Southampton hospital. Last year, in my then capacity as president of the association, I had the honour to visit that facility, and it was made perfectly clear that, together with other forms of support, non-invasive ventilation is an important tool in combating premature death from the disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/11">That being so, it seems obvious that non-invasive ventilation should be readily available to those with motor neurone disease who are capable of benefiting from it. Yet, as we have heard, fewer than one in 30 victims of the disease has access to it. I am sorry to say that my constituency of Montgomeryshire is very much a black hole, and as far as I can ascertain, there is no availability whatever of that methodology in the area. I therefore hope that we can make a practical intervention today on the methodologies available to MND sufferers throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/12">We should think about the figures: with 5,000 people suffering MND at any one time, fewer than 200 are experiencing the benefits of non-invasive ventilation. The delay is baffling. Those hon. Members who have already spoken share my bemusement. The hon. Member for South Derbyshire said that thousands will have died by 2011, and the hon. Member for New Forest, East said that 8,000 are likely to die in the time that it will take the Department of Health and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to reach a conclusion about non-invasive ventilation.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/13">I do not believe that five years is an acceptable delay, given that we already have something that is proven to extend life by a considerable degree. Furthermore, it is usual that caution should be at the heart of such delays. So many times I have heard people saying, &quot;We would like to do it, but we have to make sure that there are no unintended consequences.&quot; I cannot believe that there is any unintended consequence or any careless oversight, the damage caused by which would exceed the damage caused by the premature death of people who would have lived longer had they received non-invasive ventilation.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/14">The cost-benefit calculation must surely be in favour of the expeditious implementation of a relatively inexpensive methodology, which has been tried and tested thousands of times, with individuals consistently praising the benefits of the ventilation technique. I am guessing, but I assume that this is caution. However, that caution is itself creating the unintended consequence of people dying more than half a year sooner than they would otherwise have died.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/15">The only other possible explanation is that of prioritisation&mdash;other methodologies are so important that they exceed the benefits that sufferers gain through non-invasive ventilation. I would be interested to hear whether that is the Minister's view, but I suspect that that is not the case. The association knows that NICE has been considering the matter, but although NICE's work is unquestionably worth while, the association argues that introducing non-invasive ventilation treatment is a far higher priority than some of the other choices.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/16">The long-term solution is to find a cure. That is an important element in the association's work. During the past decade, we have made more progress in dealing with the disease than in the rest of medical history. The primary objective of the association has changed from care to care and cure. The care agenda is all that it had when there seemed to be no prospect of a clinical solution to this dreadful disease. However, some of the best medical researchers and practitioners in the world are hard at work on the case. I praise the work of the association's global symposium in Birmingham last year and give credit to the Minister for opening that symposium, the first time that a Minister has done so in the history of symposiums on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/17">The parallel objectives of care and cure are exactly the right way for the association to go. In recognising the importance of introducing non-invasive ventilation, I hope that we do not take our eye off the ball, as curing the disease would obviate the need for many of the support mechanisms. I have previously described the search for a cure as attempting to complete a 1 million-piece jigsaw when one has only a few pieces. Ten years ago, we probably had two or three, and now we have a few dozen, but as that investment is made, the pieces will begin to fall into place exponentially.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/18">I praise the Government once again for their support in the campaign to raise &pound;15 million, as an initial target, for the cure fund. The former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, was very supportive of that campaign, and the current Prime Minister was very responsible, with other Ministers, for securing the potential for match funding of &pound;7.5 million towards specific projects designed to research and test cures. I am glad to report that more than &pound;12 million has been raised towards that &pound;15 million target&mdash;three years ahead of schedule. I am optimistic, therefore, that the cure route will ultimately prove to be the long-term solution to all that we are discussing. It will save money and lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/19">In the shorter term, however, we must find ways to care for those who cannot be cured. Our mission is to find a cure not for death, but for a specific and particularly cruel form of death&mdash;motor neurone disease. Until then, we must do our best for those who cannot be cured and who accept their fate in stoic and&mdash;usually&mdash;optimistic mood. NIV is simple, relatively cheap and the single best intervention for extending the life of a person with MND. Fewer medical investments are more capable of helping the health service to achieve its stated goals of improving quality of life and saving lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/20">For all those reasons, I fully support what hon. Members have said today. Will the Minister now adopt the MND Association's humble request to prioritise the work on NICE NIV clinical guidelines from April 2009? The association believes that, with planning and consideration, it should be possible to prioritise the necessary work on NIV and to get it on stream relatively quickly&mdash;certainly this year. It can be done, and we have all agreed that it will be done at some point, but please let us not wait until 2011, when many more people will have died without having been given the opportunity of that priceless improvement in their quality of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/21">For the sake of the thousands of UK residents experiencing MND and the thousands of families living with them, and for the sake of saving lives that cannot yet be saved but which can be made longer and more comfortable, I hope that the Minister will accord with our request. The value of this cannot be measured in the money that it costs; it can be measured only in love, compassion and humanity. I hope she will oblige.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.189.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" speakername="Michael Penning" colnum="189"  time="010:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0002.htm#09033133000465">
	<p pid="a.189.1/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the NHS and the Department of Health, through its guidance, have overall responsibility for addressing these problems. I am not blaming them for individual cases, because, obviously, we have devolved power to the trusts and PCTs, but NHS governance is essential. The chief medical officer, Ministers and the Secretary of State need to ensure that such problems do not occur.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/2">It is clear from today's evidence, which was so deep and passionate, that this is a real problem. How come so few people, whom we sadly know will die, are having their life experiences and expectancies improved by NIV? Of course, NIV is not perfect for everyone. There are some people for whom it will not help, but it will help a lot more than 3 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/3">There is no logical reason why NICE cannot improve the situation quickly. As always, one of its concerns relates to negative outcomes. If it is considering a new drug or procedure, it worries that there will be negative outcomes. I have not seen or heard anything from the clinical evidence to suggest that there are negative outcomes from such a procedure. The only things it can do are not help very much or help greatly; it can enhance someone's life.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/4">For example, NIV can help people to sleep through the night, which enables the carers and loved ones to have a good night's sleep. That helps them to come to terms with this terrible illness and the fact that they know that their loved one will die. Moreover, if the sufferer has a portable pack&mdash;the system is battery operated in most cases&mdash;in the latter stages of the illness, they are able to get out and about and interact with other people, which improves their life experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/5">I know that I am no expert, but I cannot see why the procedure is taking so long. I could understand if we were talking about a dangerous drug or procedure, or if this procedure had side effects, but in this particular case it does not.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/6">It normally takes about three months for Ministers to refer a matter to NICE, but this has taken nearly three years. Will the Minister tell us why it has taken so long? I know that the matter has been raised by other hon. Members. I am talking about not just this procedure, but procedures we will follow in future. We need to learn from the mistakes that have been made. Moreover, why do we still have the requirement that a Minister of State has to refer a matter to NICE? Why can NICE not make its own decisions?</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/7">If we want to take politics out of the NHS and allow clinical experts to make decisions on our behalf, why does a matter still have to go to the Department of Health for the Minister to make a decision on the referral? Surely, such decisions are for NICE to make, and to make a lot earlier. For example, it could make a decision as trials come towards their end&mdash;there is no need to wait for them to finish&mdash;and then refer the matter to the Minister. It could then be referred back to NICE. NICE should be engaged at the latter part of trials, which would speed up procedures all the way through.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/8">We have had an excellent debate and some passionate and informative speeches from people who are much more knowledgeable on the subject than me. I encourage the Minister to look again at the procedures and to use whatever powers she still has to ensure that NICE introduces such a procedure as soon as possible to ensure that people do not use the lack of NICE guidance as an excuse for not making the procedure available throughout the country. She should also consider the shortages relating to clinical expertise. Please give people with this disease the opportunity to have a better and longer life. Although the disease is, sadly, incurable, we can still give sufferers much better life experiences.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1535" name="Mark Todd">the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd)</phrase> on securing the debate. I pay tribute to him for his work as Chair of the all-party group on motor neurone disease and to the valuable work that is undertaken by the Motor Neurone Disease Association.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/2">I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit Öpik">the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase>, who spoke in a very quiet but assertive way about this important subject, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase>, who said that he felt out of his comfort zone because he was relatively new to the subject. I do not think that he was out of his comfort zone at all given the eloquence with which he spoke. He made some very moving points about the huge contributions that Lord Cheshire has made.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/3">Many of the points my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire made about the process of considering guidelines for non-invasive ventilation for motor neurone disease are valid. I agree with him and other hon. Members that NICE undertakes an incredibly important and delicate process of assessment for the NHS. Over 10 years, it has made considerable progress, but the job is not finished. In responding to the debate, I want to explain&mdash;as the hon. Member for New Forest, East asked me to do&mdash;what lies behind the decisions, and what the extenuating circumstances are for the long delay in referring this topic. Such a delay is deeply regrettable and something for which I am personally sorry. My hon. Friend is entitled to an explanation of some of the consequences that lie behind the delay. I will outline how I intend to help the matter proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/4">My hon. Friend is right that the topic was originally put forward for NICE guidance in 2006 and finally referred to NICE as a short clinical guideline topic in November 2008. It might be helpful if I say a little about NICE's clinical guidelines programme, and recap briefly on the process whereby topics for NICE are chosen.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/5">NICE's clinical guidelines programme is the largest such programme in the world. To date, NICE has published more than 80 clinical guidelines, addressing major disease areas, such as mental health, cancers and cardiovascular disease, and a further 40 guidelines are in development.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/6">However, even a programme of such world-leading scale cannot develop guidance on every topic where it might be of value. NICE's work has to be prioritised, and a clear process is in place for that to happen. That touches on the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" name="Michael Penning">the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning)</phrase> about how topics get referred. Topic ideas may come from a dedicated horizon-scanning team, which actively identifies new</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/7">drugs and technologies. Anyone can suggest a topic for NICE guidance using the suggestion form on NICE's website, and many groups and individuals do so every year. Suggestions are then sifted to ensure that NICE guidance is appropriate and does not duplicate existing work. Topics are then prioritised by one of seven multidisciplinary consideration panels at NICE before being considered by a small group chaired by the NHS medical director, which makes recommendations to Ministers. The process was introduced in 2006 and is designed to be as open as possible while dealing with the large number of suggestions that NICE receives each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/8">In this case, the topic selection process took far too long to consider the guidance suggestion. The reasons behind that delay, as I understand it, were threefold. First, when the topic was suggested for NICE's work programme in 2006, there was a backlog of hundreds of topics awaiting consideration. The changes that were made to topic selection arrangements in 2006 were designed to address that situation but the backlog took time to clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/9">Secondly, there was a discussion between interested parties on whether the topic would be most suitable for NICE's short clinical guidelines or for its technology appraisal work programme. That was important in ensuring that the product NICE developed for the NHS was the most appropriate to support the delivery of care to that group of patients, but the process took too long. There are many complexities, and I do not want to go back over them.</p>

	<p pid="a.192.2/1">The Minister is helpfully explaining what has happened. The Motor Neurone Disease Association was in regular contact during the nearly three years of delay, trying to find out what was happening and what the delay was, so it was not a case of saying, &quot;Well, we have told them once, and now we are waiting for something to come out of the other end of the tube.&quot; It would be helpful if the Minister could describe the review process that presumably happens when there are such repeated contacts.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.0/1">I thank the Minister for the comprehensiveness of the account that she is giving. In her work with NICE on the possible expansion of the short clinical guidelines procedure, will she especially raise the point that, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" name="Michael Penning">the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning)</phrase> indicated, separate consideration ought to be given to cases of this sort, when we are not talking about drugs, but about relatively simple physical procedures?

	<p pid="a.194.0/1">I am not putting myself in the place of the clinical experts on whom I as a Health Minister rely absolutely. The hon. Gentleman knows from discussions on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, for instance, and from the good research that can now be done with embryonic stem cells, that we depart from the best clinical and scientific advice at our peril. I shall not do that today. The process that he just described is the one that is supposed to be in place and that works now. Looking back to 2006, when this particular case started, a number of things happened that, regrettably, slowed it down. I believe that the changes made should ensure that does not happen on any referral in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/2">However, that still leaves us with the important question that the hon. Gentleman and others asked: when will NICE consider the issue? I told him what NICE said originally. All the issues are priorities. NICE is not picking and choosing. I hear what the hon. Gentleman says about high priority, but he knows as well as I do that the national health service treats some 1 million people every 36 hours. All the complexities that our staff must handle and the fantastic things that they can do with the help of science, drugs and technologies&mdash;some of which he mentioned in relation to motor neurone disease&mdash;make choosing priorities a difficult job. They are all of equally high priority, but we are taking them forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/3">The hon. Members for New Forest, East and for Montgomeryshire expressed concern about the thousands of patients who, they said, had died prematurely and in circumstances that all of us would want to alleviate, as a result of the delay in developing guidance on the topic. I understand their perspective absolutely, and I respect the passion with which they spoke on the matter. The hon. Member for New Forest, East went on to answer his own question. If there is good evidence that a treatment works well and it appears to be a good use of resources, the NHS should not hide behind the lack of guidance from NICE, as the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead mentioned. We have made that clear repeatedly to the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/4">Most of the services delivered by the NHS have not gone through NICE, but the NHS does not say, &quot;We're not going to do this because NICE hasn't considered it.&quot; NICE is about trying to reach more sensible and equal decision making across the NHS. The Government have always maintained that the absence of NICE guidance on treatment does not mean that individual PCTs should decline to make funding decisions on individual treatments based on assessment of the evidence. I have written to primary care trusts on that subject. Lack of guidance alone is not an acceptable reason for not funding treatment. I have made that clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/5">The hon. Member for New Forest, East complimented his health service on its performance in that respect and for the excellent services provided in Southampton. We have made it absolutely clear what is expected, how NICE should play it and what the Government's role is, and we will continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.0/1">That relates to the point that I raised when intervening on the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead about the unevenness of distribution of expertise on a disease that is not prolific. Many people will not encounter motor neurone disease more than once or twice in a clinical career. Partly for that reason, we must address it through a NICE process, but it is worth making the point that the Minister is making. The remedy lay in the hands of the NHS all along, as Southampton illustrates.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.4/1">I do not want to get into a partisan argument on this matter, and I accept that we have dragged our feet with new nuclear builds, but my constituency is now getting a second, new nuclear power station for which plans were first laid in the mid-80s. I accept what the right hon. Gentleman says about the anti-nuclear climate, but one reason why that power station did not go ahead earlier was that before 1996 the Government had nowhere to put the waste, and did not make a decision. Does he accept that that long-term problem has caused the industry to contract in many ways?</p>

	<p pid="a.199.2/1">I was going to come to that point, but I will give him the price comparator now, which comes from an official source. The consultation document on the Severn tidal power scheme was published by the Department in January. On page 18 of that document there is a comparator of the costs, which gives the pounds per megawatt hour for a number of generating sources. Tidal power is somewhere between &pound;104 to &pound;317, which is very expensive at this stage. Broadly speaking, the next most expensive is power from biomass. Wind-derived power is a little more economical as the figure varies between roughly &pound;70 to &pound;80 per megawatt hour. Much cheaper than that, at &pound;53, is energy from combined-cycle gas turbines and the cheapest source is nuclear at &pound;38 per megawatt hour. On that basis, nuclear is far and away the cheapest technology listed by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/2">The inescapable point is that we are in a weak position now because of a policy of neglect. One of the decisions made by the Government was, indeed, to sell off Westinghouse&mdash;our last remaining consortium capable of designing and building a nuclear reactor&mdash;to Toshiba. We now hear that the Government are selling off the commercial arm of the UK Atomic Energy Authority. Again, that is for all the wrong reasons and is to plug another gap&mdash;this time in the national finances. We are not in a position to take a lead anymore, even if we wanted to.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/3">The Government apparently want eight new reactors in this country. They will now all be built by foreign consortiums&mdash;probably Electricit&eacute; de France and Westinghouse. We are in a long queue now because the rest of the world also wants nuclear power. The population of the world is rising rapidly and will increase to at least 9 billion before the end of the century. Energy demand in developing countries is rising even faster, and the electricity component of that is rising fastest of all. The only hope of meeting that demand without having an enormous increase in CO2 emissions is nuclear power. Worldwide, about 40 nuclear stations are under construction and over 100 more are in the planning phase. We could have led this revolution and done so much for our manufacturing base and engineering skills. Instead of that, we are now an also-ran. We are clowns, spectators, supplicants. It is a very sad story.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/4">To give credit to the Minister, I think that he is personally aware of that. He knows that there have been policy mistakes and that we must do something about it. The Government have revised their cost estimates&mdash;I have already given them&mdash;which are highly favourable to nuclear power at the moment. In addition, nuclear power is secure. There is plenty of uranium left in the earth's crust and we have also stock-piled a lot of it. There is a great deal of uranium and plutonium at Sellafield, which can be used in future reactors, if they are adapted or built to take it. Fast reactors can make better use of uranium, and thorium is another element in the earth's crust that can be used for nuclear fuel. Thorium is even more abundant than uranium. We are not going to run out of nuclear fuel; it is stable and secure.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/5">In operation, nuclear power is virtually CO2 free. Of course, the reactors have to be built, and that absorbs a lot of energy, but exactly the same thing is true for every other power station. In operation, nuclear power is a highly effective, low-carbon source of power.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/6">None of that makes nuclear power easy. As I said, I have no illusions about the problems. In the past, certain expectations were not met. It is a demanding technology, project management of the sites is complex, and the industry has not always been good at explaining itself. We have to be open with people and engage them in debate about the costs and problems, as well as the benefits, of nuclear energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/7">There are hard choices to be made about energy, but often people do not want to face up to them. All forms of energy generation have an effect on the environment&mdash;that is inescapable. I agree with the point that has already been made that we have been slow to find a deep storage site for nuclear waste, but that vulnerability is a technical problem that can be solved.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/8">Meanwhile, public attitudes have changed in favour of nuclear energy&mdash;again, no thanks to the Government. I wish that the last Prime Minister had used just a fraction of his political authority to lead the debate on energy. In 2004, I asked him about it at Prime Minister's questions. I criticised wind power and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/9" class="indent">&quot;At the same time, nuclear power, which does make a positive contribution, will be allowed to wither away without replacement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/10">In reply, Prime Minister Blair stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/11" class="indent">&quot;We made it clear in the White Paper that we have not shut the door on nuclear power, but until the issues of cost and public concern about safety can be met there is simply not the consent to go ahead with it.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-09-15.1267"><i>Official Report</i>, 15 September 2004; Vol. 424, c. 1267-8</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/12">That was not leadership; it was totally supine. He did nothing to explain or meet people's concerns about safety. That was a missed opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.0/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his valid point. However, it raises two separate points: first, the extension of existing nuclear power stations is a decision for British Energy or whoever; and, secondly, new or replacement nuclear power stations should be decided on by Governments. The question is, therefore, should we build nuclear power stations to export electricity from Scotland? There is much talk of, and some argument for, generating electricity near the point of use, so, if the energy is right here, is it not better to use a local nuclear power station? For example, Battersea used to have a power station, and I am sure that it would make a very attractive site. If I can be assured that it is safe, I do not see why Battersea should not have a power station. Indeed, it would be an added tourist attraction for London.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/2">Clearly, Scotland has considerable reserves of oil and gas. There is at least as much left in the ground as has been extracted and, as I mentioned earlier, Scotland will be self-sufficient in gas until at least 2020. Sadly, however, we have not had the opportunity to build up an oil fund, as Norway, Alaska, and Alberta have, to invest more in renewables.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/3">The Scottish Government's target is for 31 per cent. of electricity to be produced from renewable sources by 2011, and that is well ahead of the EU target of 12 per cent. by 2010 and even further ahead of the UK target of 10 per cent. by 2010. Indeed, the Scottish target is 50 per cent. by 2050. Scotland is leading the way on renewables, as it is in so many areas, and the UK is lagging behind. In fact, if we add our installed renewable projects to our consented renewable projects, we have 5.5 GW, which is 35 per cent. of our needs, so it looks as if we will be ahead of the target in 2011. In comparison, nuclear capacity in Scotland generates 2.1 GW.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/4">It is clear that new nuclear power stations are neither necessary nor wanted in Scotland. Scotland can have a secure, low-carbon, non-nuclear energy future by combining a growing renewables sector with the exploitation of a range of technologies, including marine energy.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.2/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman again for his intervention. I have already tried to make it clear that we do not suggest stopping what is already happening; we are talking about not having any new nuclear power stations. On the point about what a university does, public finances are limited, and, if &pound;1 or &pound;1,000 is spent in a university on nuclear work and research, that is a choice not to make that money available for renewables research. We have a choice, which is either/or, and I would rather see the money and the academic skills going into renewables research.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.2/2">We can combine marine energy, micro-generation, cleaner energy from fossil fuels and improved energy efficiency. Scotland is the premier location for renewables in Europe, with 20 per cent. of Europe's wind energy potential and 25 per cent. of Europe's tidal power potential. The Scottish Government have introduced a &pound;10 million Saltire Prize, the world's biggest innovation award for marine renewables, and we have had 94 applications from 23 countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.2/3">The renewables industry creates jobs. The Danish wind industry employs 15,000 individuals&mdash;slightly more than the right hon. Gentleman mentioned. Some of those jobs could have been in Scotland, but our development has been held back because we are in the United Kingdom. The right hon. Member for Wells mentioned top-end jobs, but are they going to be in France, Germany, Japan or here? The Scottish Government certainly intend to use their limited resources through planning controls to block nuclear power stations, so can the Minister assure us that he will not impose the will of the UK Government on the people and Parliament of Scotland?</p>
	<p pid="a.204.2/4">We do not intend to close nuclear stations during their expected lifetimes, but, when they come to the end of their lives, they will be shut. The International Atomic Energy Agency says that worldwide nuclear output will fall from 15 per cent. to 13 per cent. by 2030. We must accept that nuclear is the fuel of the past and that wind, wave and tidal power are the fuels of future.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.0/1">I represent a halfway house between the last two speakers, because I am pro-nuclear and pro-renewables. I see no contradiction in that stance if we are to meet our two targets of a low-carbon economy and a secure supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/2">The next generation of new nuclear stations is starting a little too slowly for my liking, but there are good reasons for that. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase> on rightly saying in his opening remarks that we need to debate this matter openly and honestly; in the past the pre-nuclear lobby has had a tendency not to do so. The nuclear industry, in many ways, speaks in jargon that the public do not understand and we need to change that as well. When we talk about fast breeders and various other issues, the public do not engage and do not understand the benefits that new nuclear can bring to industry and the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/3">Nuclear energy in my part of the world provides an awful lot of highly skilled and well-paid jobs with transferable skills. I want that to continue, which is why I have been campaigning since becoming a Member of Parliament in 2001 for new nuclear to be on the agenda as part of a rich portfolio of energy sources. Under Conservative Governments&mdash;I mention this because the right hon. Member for Wells referred to it&mdash;in Wylfa, in my constituency of Ynys M&ocirc;n, land was set aside in the early to mid-1980s for the development of a second nuclear power station. That was put off for various reasons, in my opinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/4">First, in respect of public opinion, which the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, there were fears and perceptions of high risks in the nuclear industry. If we look at it rationally and consider other sources of energy, nuclear is a safe industry. In respect of fatalities, the number of workers killed in the nuclear industry is far smaller than in other industries, including hydro, coal and gas. The public's perception about nuclear being dangerous is now being put to one side when people have an open, honest debate about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/5">Secondly, successive Governments have not handled the waste issue well. I support the deep burial chambers, such as the ones that are going ahead in Finland, although those are late. We could have done that a lot sooner and gone ahead and had safe disposal of nuclear waste.</p>

	<p pid="a.207.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase> on securing this debate. He is right; we do not have enough of these kinds of debates in Parliament on a subject that is important for this country and its people's needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/2">I shall just get some of the innocuous stuff out of the way. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2035" name="John Mason">The hon. Member for Glasgow, East (John Mason)</phrase> gave his party's usual line of not understanding the facts, having done no investigation, and does not understand anything to do with the industry at all. In general, his party is run by dogma and has nothing to do with the needs of the people of Scotland. Having got that out of the way, let us talk about the subject we are here to talk about: nuclear energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/3">The right hon. Gentleman was good, although he slightly reinvented history. The Government have done well, not only in turning round my party from holding completely the opposite view&mdash;from not supporting nuclear to supporting it&mdash;but for taking the argument out to the people and letting them make the decision. We have listened and we have come to the conclusion that a balanced energy policy is required in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/4">I have a vested interest. As chairman of the all-party group on nuclear energy, I am obviously pro-nuclear, but I am also pro-coal, pro-gas and pro-renewables. There is a place for everyone. We should not put all our eggs in one basket. It is important that we serve the needs of the people of the United Kingdom. Energy is a reserved matter. We deal with the energy of the country. It is a bit disingenuous to say that people can have all the gas, oil, electricity, renewables and whatever that they like. At the end of the day, the people of this country have stood and fallen together. We have fought side by side in wars, we fight side by side in industry and we compete against a world that would be quite happy to have half the resources and people that we have. That is important, because it is where our future lies.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/5">The new build will cost this Government next to nothing. The companies will supply the money: that is part of the deal. If they want to build a new power station, they will supply the money&mdash;that also includes the decommissioning. We must also consider security of supply. The right hon. Gentleman mentioned Russia and the middle east, and there is a British Gas project in Nigeria to liquefy gas. We must look to gas to meet our needs into the middle of the next decade. The right hon. Gentleman also referred to the Select Committee on Energy and Climate Change and said that the gap can be filled. I hope that he is right.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/6">Questions were asked about gas storage, which will be important to cover the decommissioning of our old nuclear power stations. We have problems with coal, because a European Union directive requires power stations such as Cockenzie and Longannet to be closed by 2015, unless they can meet emissions requirements, which is doubtful as they are old. So we have an even bigger problem. If those coal-fired powered stations close down, and if our nuclear power stations are decommissioned and closed, we must consider where we are going. There will be a gap, and gas and renewables will have to fill it, but during the cold spell in the winter renewables provided 0.01 per cent. of our energy needs in Scotland. That is a long way from the 50 per cent. of renewable electricity that the hon. Member for Glasgow, East was talking about. We must have a base load that will run industry and keep the lights on.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/7">Where do we go next? Education has been mentioned, and I was at an all-party group meeting this morning when we talked about that very subject. British companies are lining up to work with universities&mdash;some are already doing so&mdash;to provide apprenticeships and university degrees for the nuclear industry. They know that there is a shortage in the work force, and they want to fill it as quickly as possible. The right hon. Gentleman said that for those young men and women the world will be their oyster, and it certainly will because the amount of work in the rest of the world will mean great prospects of highly paid jobs anywhere in the world. However, we also have a place there, because our education system is second to none, and with the right drive and support from the Government, we will get there.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/8">The safety of nuclear power stations in this country is also second to none. In all the major disasters, barring Chernobyl&mdash;we all know what happened there and the number of lives lost&mdash;no one was killed or poisoned by radiation. Although the power station at Three Mile Island was lost, the safety precautions worked. The safety record in nuclear power stations is great compared with the number of lives lost in the coal industry, which must amount to hundreds of thousands throughout the world. Tens of thousands are killed in China alone almost every year. Many people die on a regular basis in the coal industry, so the nuclear industry does well.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/9">My hon. and learned Friend the Minister will have to consider waste management. We know that there will be a report in the autumn and we hope that it will tell us exactly what we must do. Those of us who were lucky enough to go to Sweden last year and see its experimental project in Oskarshamn could not fail to be impressed by what is being done with the waste material. I do not agree with the adage that Scottish waste must stay in Scotland and Welsh waste must stay in Wales. It is British waste, and the United Kingdom Government must deal with it. That is the deal, that is how it is at the moment, that is how Parliament has set its store, and we must go along with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/10">The right hon. Gentleman said that he would come back to planning. I do not know whether he did, but if he did I missed it. The Government have bitten the bullet and introduced the Planning Act 2008 to ensure that what happens in Scotland will not happen elsewhere. If an area wants a new power station requiring billions of pounds of investment to provide jobs, if a company wants to supply the money to build that power station to provide that work, and if the Government want it to supply electricity to meet people's needs, that should not be stopped by an obscure planning rule, which is what happens in Scotland. We want to ensure that that does not happen in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.1/1">I am glad that the hon. Gentleman said that, because his party's investigations showed that 52 per cent. of the Scottish population wants nuclear energy, and only about 24 per cent. does not want it. The Scottish people would rather keep the lights on than use political dogma to turn them off as the hon. Gentleman's party would like to do.

	<p pid="a.211.1/1">The general position is that we need transitional technology over the coming decades to replace the contribution of nuclear and other industries, because it is true that renewables alone will not fill that gap. However, the obvious candidate is carbon capture and storage. That technology, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2035" name="John Mason">the hon. Member for Glasgow, East (John Mason)</phrase> pointed out, was being progressed in projects such as that at Peterhead, which have been truncated by the Government's rather measly and limited carbon capture competition. We could have put much more effort and initiative into becoming a world leader in carbon capture; instead, we are being overtaken left, right and centre on that technology. That is the technology that I see as the important transitional one over the coming decades.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.1/2">Then there is the question of whether UK plc will really benefit from what is proposed. In a recent report, Sir John Houghton, the former director general of the Met Office and former co-chair of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, highlighted the fact that the only working example of a new generation nuclear power station in Finland is already experiencing quite a lot of problems. He wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.211.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The delays and cost over-runs at Finland's new Olkiluoto 3 reactor (the first nuclear reactor to be built in Europe since 1991) cast doubt on the ability of nuclear to play a large role in the timeframes necessary to effectively deal with climate change&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.1/1">I really do not have time; I am sorry.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/2">Clearly, we need to find a way of disposing of waste that has already been created, but that is no justification for repeating the mistake, not least because the sites, even with low-level contamination, can take 100 years to be cleaned up and decommissioned fully. Most of them are coastal, so a sea level rise and an increased risk of flooding is clearly also a danger. There are so many dangers that it would be foolish to go down this road again when we have not solved the problems of the last generation of waste at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/3">Energy security is often mentioned. The idea is that somehow nuclear is a more reliable form of energy than something such as gas, and the spectre of Russian gas negotiations is often raised. In fact, a large proportion of our gas comes from that well known and unstable country, Norway. Very little of it comes from Russia. As for uranium, about 44 per cent. comes from very stable countries&mdash;Canada and Australia. After that, 16 per cent. comes from Kazakhstan and then the list includes Russia again, but also Niger, Namibia, Uzbekistan and other well-known stable countries. That suggests that the international supply of uranium is not quite as secure as we might think. Certainly if there are new generations of nuclear power stations worldwide, there will presumably be a price hike in uranium as well, which might threaten once again the economics of nuclear power.</p>

	<p pid="a.213.0/1">You have joined us for the end of an excellent debate, Mr. Gale. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" name="Martin Horwood">The hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase> mentioned the word &quot;mix&quot; and I think that a mix is the key to our energy policy. On both sides of the Chamber, we have recognised that we face a prospective energy crunch, to which the solution has to be one of diversity. There is broad, albeit not necessarily universal, agreement on both sides of the Chamber that we have been slow to come to the position in which we can send clear signals to the industry that we will have a stable framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/2">First, however, let me congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase> on giving us the opportunity to have the debate and on his contribution, which, as ever, was serious and analytical. He always demonstrates genuine personal concern for the future of our nation, bringing that to all our counsels. He has done so again today.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/3">I am delighted to see my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1495" name="Cheryl Gillan">the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)</phrase>, who is shadow Secretary of State for Wales, in her place. As the presence of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1952" name="Albert Owen">the hon. Member for Ynys M&ocirc;n (Albert Owen)</phrase> also indicates, nuclear policy is a great issue for the Principality.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/4">It is clear from the contributions that have been made that we face a parlous energy security situation in the years ahead, and three factors contribute to that. First, there is the predictable decline in North sea oil and gas output. Some estimate that we will be 80 per cent. dependent on gas imports by the end of the decade, which could have been foreseen many years ago, in the past decade. Secondly, we are likely to have to decommission nine of our most polluting coal-fired power stations by 2015. Finally, six of our 10 nuclear power stations are likely to reach the end of their life, unless it is extended, by 2018. Over the years ahead, therefore, we face a significant capacity problem in generating our future energy supplies.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/5">In 1912, Sir Winston Churchill said that security in oil depends on diversity and diversity alone, which extends to our discussion of energy today, because we need a diverse energy supply. Unless one has an objection in principle to nuclear on the grounds of safety, and my party does not, it is clear that the technology makes a low-carbon contribution to diversity of supply. Providing that it is economically viable and does not present a charge on the taxpayer, therefore, it will be one of our diverse sources of energy going forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/6">There is agreement that we need to be clear about such issues, because we are contemplating major investments. Providing that Government subsidy is not involved in construction, operation, decommissioning or the storage of waste, no regulatory obstacles should be put in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.5/1">I am grateful for that intervention, which takes us to an important part of the debate. We need to concentrate now on ensuring that we have rigorous arrangements in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.5/2">Yesterday, we had the announcement of the prospective sale of UKAEA Ltd, which raises similar issues. I have no problem in principle with a private company operating the contracts, but UKAEA Ltd will have the long-term contract for decommissioning nuclear power stations. How can we be satisfied that a delegation from a private company will not come to the Minister some years down the line, when the contract is with that company and work has proceeded, to demand more money than was provided for in the contract to finish the job? We need satisfaction on such issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.5/3">It is the Government's responsibility to remove excessive regulatory risk. There is enough risk involved in making major multibillion pound investments&mdash;not least the cost of capital and the anticipation of future energy prices and the cost of carbon. Public policy should not amplify those risks, but most people in the industry would say that the 10-year delay that we have seen and the inconsistency of energy policy&mdash;indeed, the lack of a credible policy&mdash;have amplified them. That is not the way forward if we want to take up our traditional role in the energy sector as a world leader in nuclear technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.5/4">On planning issues, it is important that the Conservative party supports the type approvals used by the nuclear installations inspectorate, because they allow safety standards, which are obviously crucial, to be applied consistently. On planning applications, it is important that there is genuine scrutiny, but not a review of national energy policy lasting for years on end for each application. The Government's role in ensuring that we have a long-term safe storage capability is also important.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.5/5">We have suffered the consequences of policy ambiguity and indecision on this issue, and there is no better example of that than the Isle of Anglesey. Anglesey Aluminium Metals Ltd is contemplating 500 job cuts&mdash;those are important jobs&mdash;because any prospective decision on a second Wylfa nuclear power station will come too late to avoid interrupting the energy supplies that are necessary for investment and production to carry on.</p>

Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase>, who has managed to secure a debate on an enormously important issue. Sadly, I found his contribution partisan and unfair. It is a shame that in a debate on energy, which should have been dealt with more seriously, I feel that I need to respond briefly in a similarly partisan way with reference to his complaint about our lack of purpose since Chernobyl and Three Mile Island. Since that time there has been public concern about nuclear. That is something that he had to deal with when he was the Energy Minister from 1992 to 1994. He talks about the period of decline after 1987&mdash;well, he was part of that period of decline, so taking the mote out of one's own eye is part of what he needs to accept. He needs to accept that when he was in office his Government failed to take the steps that were needed.</p>

	<p pid="a.216.2/1">I accept that during the right hon. Gentleman's period in government he was never anti-nuclear; indeed, his party was then strongly and resolutely nuclear. It just did nothing about it after Chernobyl and Three Mile Island&mdash;or very little. Nuclear power stations often take 12, 13 or 14 years to prepare. We will shorten that period with the new planning timetable. However, given the time scale, there was no preparation, when we came into government, for serious further development of nuclear power, and the Conservative Government of whom the right hon. Gentleman was a member, and he, as a Minister in that Government, need to accept some responsibility for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.2/2">The right hon. Gentleman talks about leadership. I remind him that Tony Blair and the current Prime Minister led a party that was anti-nuclear, by and large, and have turned it into one that is by and large pro-nuclear with a policy set out in a White Paper&mdash;an energy policy that is clearly looking to build new nuclear power stations and has revitalised the industry in a very short period. That is decisive leadership.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.2/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1884" name="Greg Clark">The hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark)</phrase> complains of vacillation and delay. Let us see what is meant by those words. When we put forward our White Paper, at a pretty decisive moment for nuclear, where was the Conservative party? Its members were with their new&mdash;their current&mdash;leader, and their current leader was, as has already been said, in his green phase, when he decided that the Conservative party would no longer be the pro-nuclear party it once was. He turned a nuclear party into not an anti-nuclear, but perhaps a non-nuclear party; it was the great big Tory nuclear wobble.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.0/1">I am disappointed that the Minister has turned the debate in the direction he has, but he will recognise that in 12 years of Government, in which there have been 10 Energy Ministers&mdash;in which sequence he has, I think, taken the role twice&mdash;the decisions that needed to be taken rested with the Government, not the Opposition. If he wants to look backwards he should reflect on the record of the Government over the past 12 years.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.217.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1910" speakername="Mike O'Brien" colnum="217"  time="012:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0007.htm#09033133000539">
	<p pid="a.217.1/1">I can also reflect on the fact that the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. Friend complain about leadership, yet the Government, unlike their current leader, have provided leadership on the issue. We have moved to a clear strategy. The country and the world face huge challenges in the face of climate change and energy security issues. We have set up a new Department whose key objectives are to create a sustainable energy policy, to deal with climate change&mdash;a policy that is secure, to deal with the problems facing this country in the long term and the decline of North Sea oil and gas, and affordable, to ensure that the people of this country get security and sustainability in a way they can afford; and to do that now, in the face of the problems associated with the credit crunch.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/2">We need to decarbonise our electricity supplies and ensure that we have nuclear alongside renewables in a low-carbon economy. Combating climate change must be our top priority. We need to change our energy mix, so that we are less reliant on heavily polluting fossil fuels. We need secure affordable energy and we must ensure that we diversify the roots from which we get our gas and other supplies. By the way, contrary to the comments made earlier by the right hon. Member for Wells when he raised concerns about Russia, we get about 2 per cent. of our gas from Russia and the recent dispute between Ukraine and Russia did not have a major impact on our gas supplies.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/3">We recognise as a party that nuclear is secure, affordable and low-carbon, and that without it achieving the climate change targets we have set ourselves would become difficult and costly. The cost of generating electricity would rise and we would be increasingly reliant on renewables, and although those are important technologies they cannot always provide the base load of electricity that is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/4">As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1952" name="Albert Owen">the Member for Ynys M&ocirc;n (Albert Owen)</phrase> said, we need not only a nuclear base load but renewables, because they are low-carbon and can supply electricity on a large scale; but they have a problem in relation to intermittency. Therefore we also need the flexibility in energy supply that involves coal, with carbon capture and storage in due course, we hope, and gas.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/5">As to talk of energy gaps, we believe that any gap that might in theory exist will quickly be supplied by the energy companies. That might be through gas or, we hope, coal with carbon capture and storage, but we believe that it will be supplied, because there is a lot of money to be made by energy companies in preventing such a gap. Anyone looking at their energy bill will know that there is a lot of money to be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/6">There are massive opportunities for the UK in creating new nuclear build in this country. There will, I believe, be new nuclear power stations pepper-potting the globe in years to come. If the UK can build up&mdash;as we want it to&mdash;a supply chain, there is potential for massive benefit for the economy of this country. That is why we have worked so hard with the industry in recent months to build up the supply chain and get interest in it, and ensure that we have the capacity not only for new build but to benefit the country in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/7">Westinghouse and Areva have announced initiatives to work with the UK supply chain. The Nuclear Industry Association is working closely with industry to highlight what companies need to do to get involved, and our nuclear White Paper has set out clearly the basis and the policy framework. We hope we are in the process of creating the right conditions to enable the UK to be a target for investment in the future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.219.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1597" speakername="Martin Caton" colnum="219"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0007.htm#09033133000540">
	<p pid="a.219.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. Most of us, certainly those who were around in the late 1960s and early 1970s, know something of what the drug thalidomide did to the human foetus if the pregnant woman had been using it for a number of years on prescription. However, before looking at the more recent and current health issues for thalidomiders, it will be useful briefly to recall some of that history and to consider the lives of those whose bodies have been affected by the drug.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/2">Thalidomide was developed by the German firm Chemie Grunenthal as an anti-convulsant. It did not work for that purpose, but trials showed that it had sedative properties, with the apparent added benefit that overdoses resulted not in death, but simply in prolonged sleep. It was first marketed in Germany in 1957 and in the United Kingdom in 1958. It was sometimes combined with other drugs to treat a variety of conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/3">The promotion of all those products laid great stress on the safety of thalidomide. Grunenthal also claimed that thalidomide was completely safe for pregnant women and could therefore be used to treat morning sickness and some of the other negative aspects of early pregnancy. Astonishingly, the company made that claim without testing the drug on pregnant animals or testing the science behind the claim that an overdose would not normally kill. The latter factor was the result of the fact that although thalidomide was a highly toxic drug, it had a low absorption rate. That, however, could be affected by other illnesses, the taking of other medicines and, crucially, pregnancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/4">Distillers, which manufactured thalidomide in the UK under licence, had to conduct its own tests on the drug, and commissioned researchers at Glasgow university to consider the effect of thalidomide on the body's hormone balance. The results, published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, showed a marked reduction in the activity of the thyroid gland. That should have set alarm bells ringing. It was known at the time that any drug that affected the thyroid was likely to be able to pass through the placenta, yet Distillers, like Grunenthal, did not test the drug on pregnant animals.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/5">Even more disturbing, however, is the fact that the body appointed by the Government to establish whether new drugs had been properly tested&mdash;the Cohen committee&mdash;failed to ask whether tests had been made on pregnant animals. Instead, it described thalidomide as a drug of proven value. As a result, it went on to the NHS prescription list and was exempted from purchase tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/6">We should contrast that with how the Food and Drug Administration dealt with the application by Richardson-Merrell to market the drug in America. There, Dr. Frances Kelly recognised that a variety of factors could affect the absorption rate. She required tests to be made on pregnant animals. Tests were carried out on pregnant rabbits, and deformed foetuses were born.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/7">If the Cohen committee, acting on behalf of the Government, had required similar tests to be done here, it would have seen similar deformities in baby rabbits&mdash;the sort that were later to be seen in human babies. It did not. Some 3,800 babies died, and 508 were born with disabilities to mothers who had been taking thalidomide, assured that it was perfectly safe to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/8">When we think of people affected by thalidomide, most of us think of people with rudimentary arms and/or legs, but the drug caused a far greater range of debilitating conditions. Many suffered damaged ears and hearing. In others, eyesight was affected. A few suffered brain damage, with associated sensory limitations. Some who have legs have no arms, and a large number have arms ranging from half or two-thirds of normal length to 2 or 3 in. Many of those with hands have fingers missing and no thumbs. Leg damage often resulted in one or both legs being short, and feet absent or significantly damaged. In addition, there could be extensive damage to the internal organs and the skeletal structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/9">Before the establishment of the Thalidomide Trust, which was later to protect the interests of those children, they were subject to well-meaning but questionable and certainly unwelcome professional attention. Some endured a series of operations intended to make them look &quot;more normal&quot;, such as constructing ears where they had none or removing vestigial digits. There was a drive to find functional artificial arms, but experience of them as children put the majority of thalidomiders off such prosthetics in adult life.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/10">What is truly remarkable is how those individuals affected by thalidomide have responded to the disadvantages dealt to them. In their teens, many refused to accept the limited lifestyle that some thought appropriate for people so badly disabled, and they determined to live as fulfilling a life as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/11">Sadly, 46 of the original 508 have died, but a large proportion of the survivors have taken life by the horns. A majority of them are married and between them have more than 500 children. Many have become highly qualified and have successful professional careers; others are running their own businesses. A large number of them have regular full-time jobs, and half are in some form of paid employment. Many of those not in paid jobs are bringing up their families. However, their very determination to get on with things has taken its toll.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/12">By the late 1990s, it was becoming clear that thalidomiders were facing a new set of health problems, which were brought about by their wholly admirable commitment to activity. They are entering their 40s and 50s, but have always had to use their limbs and other parts of their bodies in ways for which they were not designed. Many have needed hip replacements, or even shoulder replacements, at the age of about 40. Others have reluctantly been forced to give up work or are considering doing so, creating personal financial difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/13">One thalidomider, Paul, writes:</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/14" class="indent">&quot;My physical damage is manifested by the absence of arms and legs. In spite of the obvious difficulty caused by my impairments, I am proud to report that I have been in continual employment since I finished my education more than 20 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/15" class="indent">As a result of years of using my body in unorthodox ways to achieve everyday tasks, I am now experiencing increasing pain caused by osteo-arthritis and find it extremely difficult to continue my job, which necessitates me using a stick in my mouth to type on a computer keyboard for most of the working day. I have been advised by my GP that continuation of this activity is detrimental to my health and that I should consider terminating my job.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/16">Paul is not alone. The Thalidomide Trust recently carried out a study of 108 thalidomiders, which showed that, on average, each thalidomider has six or more complex and chronic health problems. They include ear, nose and throat problems; poor vision; palsy, kidney, heart and gastrointestinal problems; arthritis; osteoporosis; sciatica; epilepsy; and obesity.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/17">Another study, recently published as a paper by Summerside, Johnson and Newman, showed that those people can be helped, but that there are considerable obstacles to them gaining access to that help. The authors described those obstacles as a hierarchy of information gaps and network failures.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/18">The first gap is between the patient and information about their condition, the existence of those similarly affected, the trajectory of the condition, effective treatments, specialist help and the existence of centres of excellence. The next gap is in the knowledge of GPs and other primary-level carers, which means that patients are always referred to a specialist.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/19">Usually, however, it is just that&mdash;a specialist in only one of their half dozen or more complex and chronic health problems. That identifies another gap, which is that between the second-level specialist and the pool of expertise and specialisms relevant to the individual thalidomider. Most significant, however, is the lack of an effective network between patients and other patients with similar problems, and the primary, secondary and tertiary care providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/20">The Thalidomide Trust shows that networking is the key to improving the quality of life for thalidomiders as they face those new health problems&mdash;an approach that works equally well for those with other rare conditions. The trust initiated a pilot project to establish such a network service for its 108 referrals so far. That has proved successful for many, simply by homing in on the right expertise and sharing it. Indeed, the network does not stop at national borders.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/21">The Thalidomide Trust was aware of Swedish and German centres of excellence for assessing people with such a range of problems and for identifying the best treatments for individuals. It made use of those institutions, which are now important nodes in the new network, and intends to create further centres in France, Poland and the UK, all of which will be part of that network. That approach will provide a coherent care pathway for thalidomiders, instead of sending them from pillar to post to be dealt with by high-quality experts functioning only in their specialism bunkers.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/22">In this country, most of the expertise required to fit into those networks lies within the NHS. I hope that the Government will work with the Thalidomide Trust, and its partners in this country and abroad, to develop an improved network for delivering individual care and treatment to thalidomiders and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/23">I have deliberately concentrated on the health issues faced by thalidomiders and the best approach for delivering quality health care, but I have not focused on the financial problems that they face as a result of these new conditions in purchasing, in particular, the expensive equipment to permit them to maintain satisfactory mobility. The all-party group on thalidomide, which I chair, is concerned about that point. I would be very grateful if my right hon. Friend the Minister agreed to meet its members, as well as thalidomiders, after Easter to discuss that very issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.1/1">I shall certainly not deny the all-party group a meeting. However, if it expects me to take those issues forward, I need to know exactly what they are. The Secretary of State and I have received representations directly from the trust, and the chairman of the national advisory council has put a number of issues on the table for consideration. There has been no word from the trust or anyone else to indicate that those are not the issues of concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/2">My hon. Friend reiterated the issues today. The first relates to finance and the second relates to access to appropriate services. Government policy is designed to ensure that a person can live independently, with as much choice as possible in their care and greater opportunities to control their future. A number of policies deliver such goals, but as my hon. Friend rightly said, each individual has a number of specific and detailed personal issues, which need careful consideration. Such issues relate to access to social care and appropriate GP services and then referral to specialist services.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/3">I confirm to my hon. Friend that I should be more than pleased to receive details from the all-party group on the points that it expects me to cover in the meeting. I should also be grateful for an indication of how such information varies from the letter-writing campaign, the early-day motion and the work and campaigning of the national advisory council. That would help me to address the points that my hon. Friend has raised. I should be more than happy to facilitate such a meeting. However, what I cannot do, as I am sure that my hon. Friend appreciates, is discuss policies that might not necessarily be a matter for the Department of Health. They might, for example, be a matter for Diageo, or even the Treasury if the matter relates to tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/4">On that basis, I hope that my hon. Friend feels that we have a way forward. I want to do all that I can to facilitate a meeting with the all-party group, but to assist me in ensuring that the meeting has the focus that everyone wants, I should be grateful if my hon. Friend would provide me with the necessary detail. I am confident that all of us will ensure that we do the right thing with regard to the rights of these individuals. I thank my hon. Friend again for the opportunity of answering this Adjournment debate, and I look forward to receiving the points on which he wants us to reflect and then to facilitating the meeting with the all-party group.</p>

	<p pid="a.224.0/1">Has the Minister looked at the networking approach that the Thalidomide Trust and others have engaged in for dealing with the complex combination of problems? Referring a patient to one specialist and then to another does not deliver for them as a more holistic approach would do.</p>

	<p pid="a.224.1/1">I am aware of that, as are my officials. It was precisely because we wanted to focus on that area that we decided that the initial meeting should be with Department officials. We wanted to concentrate on that proposal and whether there was more that could be done. I refer to the point made about service delivery. Perhaps the trust interpreted our request of, &quot;Will you please meet with officials of the Department of Health initially to discuss this&quot; as a brush-off or a way of parking the issue rather than meeting the Minister. The opposite was the case. The initial request was to ensure that the matters raised by my hon. Friend were thoroughly considered so that we could see whether recommendations could be made to Ministers to take the matter forward. I accept that my hon. Friend is raising in this debate issues about how we can better improve and deliver services on a personalised and individualised basis, because that is necessary for all such groups&mdash;although urgently for thalidomide sufferers. I am trying to find a path to do that without a lot meetings that end with me saying, &quot;I am going to go away now and ask my officials to look at it and give me more detail before we take it forward.&quot; I hope that my hon. Friend will accept my suggestion on that basis. Perhaps we could do both: the trust could meet the officials, and I will meet the all-party group&mdash;as I am happy to do&mdash;to see how we can take the matter forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/2">I hope that my hon. Friend is now reassured. I look forward to meeting him in the not too distant future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.225.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" speakername="Bob Russell" colnum="225"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0008.htm#09033133000548">
	<p pid="a.225.2/1">I have been a Member of Parliament for nearly 12 years, and this is the first time that a Minister has not been in his or her place at the start of a debate in which I have been involved. I find that regrettable, to put it mildly, particularly because today is my birthday.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/2">Nothing would give me greater pleasure if, as a result of the debate, there is one less child fatality on our roads. I am grateful to the Baby Products Association, which provided an extensive briefing on this important subject, not only on the child safety aspect, but on the nonsense of the variables in the VAT system, whereby the base on which a car seat is fixed is levied at 15 per cent., but the car seat that sits on it is levied at 5 per cent. Clearly, the base and the seat are one and the same, because neither is any use without the other. The Government should address that and bring the levy to a universal 5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/3">I declare that I am chairman of the all-party road safety group, which is backed by Brake, the road safety charity. I am also chairman of the associate parliamentary justice for road traffic victims group, which is supported by another charity, RoadPeace. I make no apology for additionally declaring an interest as the grandfather of Joseph, Owen and Jessica, who are seven, four and six months respectively. I am anxious that they and all other children who travel in cars are as safe as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/4">Every year, 30 children up to the age of 16 are killed while travelling in cars, more often than not when sitting in a car seat alongside parents who thought they were safe. Each year, more than 16,000 children are injured, 300 seriously. At 30 mph, an unrestrained child can be thrown forward with a force of 30 to 60 times their body weight. They would be thrown around inside the vehicle, injuring or possibly killing themselves and anyone else who was in their trajectory. They are also likely to exit the car through one of the windows.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/5">Those deaths and injuries can be prevented. We all know that the safest way for children to travel in cars is in a car seat that is suitable for their age, height and weight. A properly fitted child restraint keeps the child static in their seat. It prevents them from being thrown about, which reduces the likelihood that they will be injured or killed in a crash. Not only does that make perfect sense; it is the law of the land.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/6">I am grateful to the Royal Automobile Club Foundation for its briefing. Its research has shown that as many as one in 10 children who should be restrained in appropriate car seats are not. With so many children being put at risk, it is not surprising that such a large number end up killed or injured.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/7">In these difficult economic times, some parents and carers could be putting babies and small children in danger because they are simply unable to afford the best available child seats and other in-car safety equipment. Any deterrent, including prohibitive VAT rates, to the purchase of child car seats needs to be eliminated. The RAC Foundation's Philip Gomm stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/8" class="indent">&quot;The Government might be in desperate need of revenue but raising it at the expense of road safety in general, and the safety of the nation's children in particular, is a false economy, and sends out the wrong message to all responsible motorists...The RAC Foundation would urge the Chancellor to reconsider his policy on VAT on these sorts of child car seats and so support the objectives of the DfT's Think! Campaign which is aimed at reducing child casualty rates.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/9">Since 2006, children must be placed in the correct restraint for their age until they reach the age of 12 or the height of 135 cm, which in old money is about 4 ft 6 in. However, neither cars nor car seats are universal. Standard restraints with no base, placed directly on the vehicle seat and employing the existing adult belt system, can be fitted with the wrong tension and with the belt fed through the wrong pathways. Indeed, the car seat may be wrong for the car. Research has shown that only 25 per cent. of belt-fitted child car seats are fitted correctly at any given time. I am advised that data published by Halfords go as far as predicting that four in every five seats is fitted incorrectly. There is a danger that parents are being lulled into a false sense of security, and are unaware that despite their best efforts their children are still at risk every time they do the school run, visit grandparents or take a day trip to the seaside.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/10">There is also a danger that improvements in child safety technology are outpacing road safety laws. I am now becoming something of an expert on car seats and their fixings. Since 2007, International Standards Organisation FIX points are fitted as standard on all new models of European car. ISOFIX points are the international standard for attachment points for child safety seats. They allow base systems to be plugged directly into the chassis of the vehicle. ISOFIX bases for child car seats are simple and effective. They are fitted correctly 96 per cent. of the time, which is a margin of error of only 4 per cent. That might be 4 per cent. too much, but 96 per cent. of the time, things are okay. We should, however, compare that to the statistics for older models.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/11">Additions to the family can be fantastically expensive&mdash;there are so many things to buy&mdash;but one piece of equipment on which we must never compromise is the restraint system for the car. There may be a temptation to buy second-hand products from eBay and the like, but parents simply must not do that if they value their child's safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/12">The Baby Products Association has warned that the trend to use sites such as eBay, and car boot sales, smalls ads in newspapers and shop window postcards, means that parents are unwittingly risking their children's safety by purchasing second-hand equipment without knowing whether it has been involved in an accident or whether it complies with UK safety standards. On just one day recently, 1,420 used child restraint products were up for auction on eBay, including 434 forward-facing car seats, 736 rear-facing seats and 104 booster cushions.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/13">The BPA has launched a national campaign entitled, &quot;Think Before You Sell&quot;, aimed at nursery retailers, doctors' surgeries, antenatal departments, social services, playgroups, carers and the general public. The campaign, which is supported by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, calls on online sites to refuse to let sellers auction baby equipment unless they can provide a record of purchase, proof that the item has not been involved in an accident, full fitting instructions and guarantees that the seat meets the United Nations standard regulation 44.03 or 44.04.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/14">Peter White, chief executive of the BPA said last month:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/15" class="indent">&quot;As the credit crunch bites it is all too easy for families to opt for the cheapest option and go online. We have to remove the element of doubt when it comes to safety equipment as the alternative does not bear thinking about&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/16">If people do not know the history of a car seat, or if they do not have the instruction manual, the seat can become lethal. It may not be compliant with the necessary safety regulation, which I am advised is UN Economic Commission for Europe regulation 44. What is more, such is the speed of technological development, a car seat from only a few years ago will definitely not afford the same level of protection as a new one that is designed and built to the latest safety requirements. ROSPA is clear that people should not reuse car seats that have been in accidents. However, the sad fact is that many parents who think they are doing the best thing simply do not know that they are putting their children in danger every time they go out in the car.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/17">In an ideal world, we would have Government support to ensure that everyone with a vehicle can afford the best and safest car seat. Such support would ensure that parents struggling in the credit crisis would be able to avoid second-hand or hand-me-down products. There are a number of simple ways in which to make a real difference to hundreds of families who risk having their lives shattered by ill-fitted car seats. Make no mistake, the threat of poorly fitted children's car seats is on our roads every day.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/18">The BPA, which represents safety seat manufacturers, has been working closely with retailers such as Halfords and fuel companies such as Total as part of GMTV's &quot;Check It Fits!&quot; campaign. Working with local authority safety officers and the emergency services, they have run a series of safety spot checks in garages and retail parks, providing a service for families on the school run. Some of the things they found in one week recently include:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/19" class="indent">&quot;Monday, Aston Clinton. One driver had a child in the front of the car when it should have been in the back, we tried to put it in the back but found the seat belt connectors broken, the car supposedly had an MOT.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/20" class="indent">Tuesday, Burnham. Two-year-old in the back of an old Mini on a booster cushion with adult seatbelt around its neck&mdash;parent and grandmother declined free safety check and advice on correct restraint to use.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/21" class="indent">Wednesday, High Wycombe. Taxi driver with a two-month-old baby in the back of the car slumped in an adult seat belt and a three-year-old loose in the back of the car jumping up and down. His excuse were the restraints were in the other car. He did take some leaflets before roaring off.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/22" class="indent">Estate car pulls in with eight people inside. Two children in the luggage area unrestrained and one baby stuffed between the front seats. No child restraints anywhere, their excuse...they were on holiday! Another car pulls in with a child in the back of the car sitting in the child seat but not secured by the harness or seatbelt. The excuse was 'He can undo it himself so it's not worth doing it up'.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/23" class="indent">Thursday, Buckingham. All seats we checked were fitted correctly. ISOFIX prevalent&mdash;well done Buckingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/24" class="indent">Friday, Chesham. Final day of first week. One gentleman came in and had a child unrestrained in the back. When we advised him of the child seat regulations he said he lived in Hungary so it did not affect him.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/25">The campaign continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/26">All I am asking for is a simple package of measures that will make a real difference. The Baby Products Association is calling for the proper enforcement of police stop and check procedures to cover car seat safety as a matter of course when stopping vehicles for traffic infringements. After all, an adult would be fined immediately if they were found not to be wearing a seat belt. The proper fitting of child car seats should become part of the MOT test, so that without a properly fitted adult seat belt, the vehicle would fail the test.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/27">Industry has a role to play working in partnership with retailers, manufacturers, local and central Government and the automotive industry to train motor mechanics to put child safety first. Finally&mdash;this is what today's debate is all about&mdash;the BPA is calling for a change in VAT rules to make ISOFIX bases more affordable for ordinary families. ISOFIX bases are not currently considered a baby product by the Treasury because the technology has changed since the Finance Act 2001, which first applied the reduced 5 per cent. VAT rate to baby products. The full 15 per cent. VAT rate still applies to each base sold. The Finance Act 2001 considers bases as a car accessory, like fluffy dice or go-faster stripes. I fail to see how an integral part of a safety system that can save children's lives can be treated as a mere accessory.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/28">The Government reduced the VAT rate on standard car seats for children to 5 per cent., which is to be applauded. I simply ask that the same logic be applied to ISOFIX technology. The consumer is being disadvantaged on cost, and possibly forced to choose inferior and less safe products, putting young lives at risk. That is clearly an anomaly, and I hope that it can be addressed in the Chancellor's Budget on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-22">22 April</phrase>. The industry has been discussing possible changes with officials. Let us hope for good news.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/29">As part of their response to the financial emergency, the Government decided to reduce the top-line VAT rate from 17.5 per cent. to 15 per cent. to stimulate the economy. It has been estimated that the change will cost the Treasury &pound;12.5 billion. The cost of reducing VAT on car seat bases would be just &pound;3 million. Let us hope that on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-31">31 December</phrase> this year, one fewer item will revert back to 17.5 per cent.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-31a.231.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1534" speakername="Natascha Engel" colnum="231"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090331/halltext/90331h0009.htm#09033133000552">
	<p pid="a.231.2/1">I am grateful for having secured this Westminster Hall debate on what is becoming an increasingly urgent issue&mdash;the implementation of renewable energy targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/2">In initiating the debate, my main aim is to make some constructive proposals to help us to move on from what I think is becoming an unsustainable situation. The main thrust of my argument is that we, as national Government, set UK-wide targets for renewable energy. However, the detail of those targets is left to each region's spatial strategy to determine, and the planning application and the political fallout from implementing those targets are left with local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/3">Local authorities have to deal with the local campaign groups, which are almost always against having a wind farm or a waste-to-energy gasification plant near where those people live. The process is massively time consuming, with local groups organising meetings, petitions and marches on town halls, and often results in planning applications being turned down. That suits no one and goes no way towards meeting our important renewable energy targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/4">Nationally, the Government have set themselves the ambitious target of having 15 per cent. of the UK's electricity produced from renewable sources by 2010 and 35 per cent. by 2020. Along with most other MPs, I support those targets. Most people now understand the urgent need to wean ourselves off environmentally damaging, unsustainable and dirty fossil fuels. In fact, when the targets were announced, many MPs had postbags full of letters from constituents demanding that the targets be set much higher, and, when we look at the current situation, it is easy to understand why.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/5">The Local Government Association says that the electricity generated by renewables accounts for less than 5 per cent. of the UK's total energy output. The Government have done much more to address the problem of global warming and CO2 emissions than any previous Government, but, in our hurry to implement those important policies, we are overlooking their impact on the people who live with the consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/6">For example, in and around North-East Derbyshire, two controversial planning applications are in the pipeline. The first is for a waste-to-energy gasification and incineration plant on the Sheepbridge industrial estate just outside Chesterfield. The second is for a wind farm on the edge of the Peak District national park. Those are two very different examples, but they illustrate how difficult implementation of our national targets is. I know that waste and recycling are not dealt with by the Minister's Department, but I hope he will indulge me, because the point I shall make towards the end of my comments will show why it is important to raise those issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/7">The developers for the gasification plant claim that energy generated from their scheme would provide enough electricity to supply 16,000 homes, which is not an insignificant number. The plant is planned for an ex-industrial site and would use new, and as yet unproven, technology to convert compostable materials, such as wood and food, to gas for heating and hot water. Those compostable materials would be extracted from noxious and non-compostable materials. Some 75,000 tonnes of commercial waste a year would be delivered to the site, 15,000 tonnes of which would be separated and made into energy. The rest would be incinerated on site.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/8">People, including me, support the development of new technologies to tackle our mounting waste problem. We need to stop sending so much waste to landfill and look more constructively at how we can reuse our waste to make energy. I absolutely support that. However, although the company planning the gasification plant at Sheepbridge says that any hazardous waste would be treated and would not escape into the atmosphere and surrounding towns and villages, people who live nearby do not want to take the risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/9">The site may well be ex-industrial, but it is staggeringly close to the heavily populated outskirts of Chesterfield, including the whole of Dunston, Cutthorpe, Barlow and Whittington Moor. More than 20,000 people and several schools are in very close proximity to the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/10">One 1,500-signature petition, several extremely well-attended public meetings and an expensive legal opinion later, the final decision on whether to grant planning permission has still not been made. The local authority will have to make that decision in the teeth of such opposition and local councillors will have to live with the political consequences. And now&mdash;this matter is dealt with by the Minister's Department&mdash;another planning application has been made, this time for five turbines at the Matlock wind farm, which is on the edge of the Peak District national park. Three of those turbines would be in my constituency of North-East Derbyshire and two in the Derbyshire dales, an area represented by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1536" name="Patrick McLoughlin">the right hon. Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/11">That area may not be as heavily populated as the outskirts of Chesterfield, but it is, without doubt, an area of outstanding natural beauty. People have moved to the area specifically for its peacefulness, tranquillity and stunning views. Tourists come in great numbers every year for exactly the same reason. The Peak District and other national parklands are Britain's backyard. People come from far and wide&mdash;especially from our cities&mdash;to enjoy the beautiful countryside. Right by the turbines is the Darwin Forest country park, with its lovely pine lodges. It is situated there because it is miles from anywhere and has some of the most lovely surroundings. Tourism is the local economy, and putting wind turbines in the middle of the scenery would destroy it. If we are talking about sustainability, we need to calculate how many tourists would stop coming to the Peak district, get on an aeroplane and fly abroad instead.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/12">I totally support wind farms. Although many people find them ugly and industrial, I absolutely love them. However, our national parks are not an appropriate place to put them. Again, the ultimate decision, along with the political consequences for it, rests with the local authority. A vocal local campaign group has sprung up, petitions have been signed and public meetings held. A lot of time and money have been spent, the local community has been divided and conflict fills the local press.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/13">Rural versus urban is also an issue that is relevant to the debate. It is unlikely that a similar five-turbine wind farm application would be made for central London. It therefore falls disproportionately on rural and semi-rural areas to deal with implementing these targets. However, serious tensions also occur in rural areas. Farming is, without doubt, suffering hard for all sorts of different reasons. Farmers need to be ever more creative in generating income to keep themselves afloat, and having a wind farm or a composter on their land can be a lucrative lifesaver for them at a time when conventional farming is less profitable.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/14">When we think rural and semi-rural, we usually imagine rolling countryside and landed gentry, but that is not always the reality. Places such as North-East Derbyshire are predominantly ex-mining and have been involved with other heavy industries. People in North-East Derbyshire have lived for generations with polluted landscapes and toxins. Many people just do not think it fair that many of these applications are made in their areas because they are classed as former industrial sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/15">I want to make a small point about nimbyism. Whenever I meet people from local campaign groups who want to prevent projects from being built close to where they live, they always start by saying, &quot;We're not nimbys, but...&quot; I am sure that people are being nimbys, but there is nothing wrong with that. We are asking them to live with the consequences of the decisions that we are taking nationally. There is strong evidence to suggest that incinerators, and perhaps even wind farms, adversely affect house prices. If we want people to have such schemes in their backyard, we should be willing to compensate them. That could be done at the point of designating land that we make available for renewables and recycling schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/16">Given that we set our renewables targets nationally, we should also take responsibility for implementing them. The planning decision must still be made at local authority level, but the &quot;small p&quot; political decisions should be made here in Westminster. We need to act quickly. According to <i>The Sunday Times</i> this week, renewable power companies have so far erected 2,390 wind turbines at 200 onshore sites. Another 4,800 are planned, with many more to follow. That is a lot of people's backyards.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/17">Clearly, something needs to be done about the implementation of our ambitious targets to avoid costly, time-consuming and divisive local campaigns. I have two proposals to which I would like the Minister to respond. First, we should consider designating certain areas within each region where planning applications for renewable energy projects could be actively encouraged. Those areas would be identified nationally and would take account not only of areas of outstanding natural beauty, but of proximity to dense populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/18">While we are still putting the finishing touches to the Infrastructure Planning Commission, which is a national body that will look at planning decisions of national significance, we should consider including projects for renewables and recycling, as well as sites for nuclear energy generation, large road-building projects and aviation schemes. A nationally led but locally determined system for managing those applications seems to be the only way ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/19">Secondly, I would like the Minister to look at the feasibility of 2-km buffer zones, which have been considered in Scotland and other European countries, most of which are far less heavily populated than England. The IPC could make recommendations on buffer zones, which would mean that any applications for renewables or waste-to-energy projects were ideally at least 2 km from cities, towns and villages, and certainly as far away from densely populated areas as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/20">The 2-km buffer zone would be a consideration when the IPC designated land for renewables and recycling use. The advantage would be the designation of areas, not the planning application itself, becoming the issue. That would mean that difficult arguments could be resolved before an application even went in, which would leave local authorities to make planning decisions on the merits of the scheme alone, rather than having to deal with the political fallout from applications for unpopular schemes. It would certainly be more time-efficient and far less costly.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/21">I appreciate that I am straying into the responsibilities of the Department for Communities and Local Government, but a 2-km buffer zone would mean applications such as the one for the gasification unit at Sheepbridge, which would be so close to a major town and surrounding villages, never being made.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/22">I am concerned that, unless we resolve the issue of how we implement our national targets, we may end up either entirely failing to meet them or forcing them on to unwilling communities. I hope that the Minister will take my suggestions in the helpful spirit in which they are intended. I look forward to hearing his response, although I will fully understand if he does not want to veer into areas covered by other Departments.</p>

	<p pid="a.234.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1534" name="Natascha Engel">the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase> on securing this debate, and on her erudite and constructive contribution to the crucial issues that it raises about renewable energy and ensuring that suitable sites are found for development. She raised a couple of cases that are currently in the planning process. She will understand that, as a result, I cannot comment on them, but she has, with her usual forcefulness, set out the case of her constituents and ensured that it is brought to the attention of Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/3">Combating climate change while ensuring that we have secure energy supplies is the biggest long-term challenge that this country and, indeed, the world faces. Energy efficiency, nuclear power, carbon capture and storage, and renewables all have a role to play in meeting our commitments to provide 15 per cent. of our overall energy from renewable sources by 2020, and to reduce greenhouse gases by 80 per cent. by 2050. As my hon. Friend said, we are looking for about 35 per cent. of our electricity to come from renewable sources by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/4">To have the best chance of meeting those challenges and ensuring that our actions are not just ambitious but fair to people and sustainable, we must consider all reasonable options. The UK is in the privileged position of having outstanding natural resources for renewable energy: hydropower, onshore and offshore wind, and wave and tidal stream energy. We are starting from a low base of deployment, but we have made significant progress in recent years, with a near tripling of our renewable electricity generation since 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/5">We have been successful in encouraging the market to deliver investment, and there is much more in the pipeline. As of October 2008, more than 2,000 MW of renewable electricity generating capacity was under construction, 6,300 MW has been consented to and 8,700 MW is in planning. The UK is now No. 1 in the world for offshore wind, overtaking Denmark in October last year. At the same time, we passed the 3 GW mark for installed wind, both on and offshore.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/6">However, if we are to meet the challenging targets that we have set ourselves for increasing the proportion of our energy that comes from renewables, we need a contribution from all renewables technologies, not just onshore and offshore wind; for example, from waste, biomass, microgeneration, and heat technologies. Notwithstanding the impacts of the current financial downturn, the Government are committed to meeting their targets for renewables, and we are looking at ways to help companies invest.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/7">To reach our target, we will need to increase deployment some eightfold in just 11 years, but we must be clear that meeting the challenge will require a more rapid deployment of new infrastructure across the UK, and that there will be local impacts from such deployment. Along with our plans for new nuclear power and energy efficiency, that represents a significant change in how this country will use and supply energy over the next decade. Delivering on that national change, our Big Energy Shift means getting the framework right to ensure that schemes are built in the right places, at the right times. It also means engaging with communities at all levels to ensure that not just national benefits but local and community benefits are delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/8">Planning will be key to getting the renewable energy infrastructure that must be built in time for 2020. The planning system is where we ask economic, social and environmental objectives to be integrated, and where potential conflicts between the interests of individuals or local communities and the needs of the nation as a whole are reconciled.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/9">Given the scale of the challenge that we face, each and every decision on a renewable energy project counts. We must be aware of the interests of local communities, listen to legitimate concerns about specific proposals and their location, and give industry as much certainty as possible on whether a project is likely to gain consent and, if so, when. If the risk of development is too great, investment will stop flowing and could move to other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/10">Where and when we get renewable energy developments is dependent on business wanting to invest and having the confidence to do so. Likewise, if local communities feel ignored, they will lose trust in the accountability of the decisions that are made on their behalf. The planning system must create an attractive environment for the private sector to invest in renewable technologies but balance that with local concerns. We need to tackle delays in planning and ensure that projects for renewable energy are refused planning permission only if there are sufficient reasons for doing so. That means getting good quality applications through the planning system and looking at ways to improve the system in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/11">We are gearing up the planning system to help make the move to a low-carbon economy with much higher use of renewable energy. The reforms that we introduced last November in the Planning Act 2008 will play a vital part in achieving that. The delivery of the reforms set out in the Act will be key to meeting our 2020 goals, and we are on track to produce national policy statements for consultation and parliamentary scrutiny later this year. They will set out for the first time the national importance of energy infrastructure and how the policy interacts with the planning process. National policy statements will be a material consideration for decisions made under Town and Country Planning Acts and will help to ensure that renewables decisions are taken consistently whether they are large or small.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/12">The planning policy statement on climate change already encourages regions and local planners actively to plan for and support renewable energy generation, including by allocating and safeguarding sites. That is an important part of encouraging a proactive approach to increasing the amount of renewable energy but also helps to ensure that there are more benefits for local communities. However, we need to do more.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/13">In our renewable energy consultation last summer, we set out a range of ideas for increasing local and regional ownership of planning applications for renewable energy, for increasing capability in the planning system, and for improving the quality of applications. The Government are committed to publishing our renewable energy strategy this summer, in which we will set out our views in light of consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/14">In our heat and energy saving strategy consultation published last month, we further explored how to engage with local communities and householders on energy use and supply, and in particular how we can ensure that consumers, businesses and communities are able to realise the benefit of lower energy bills and reduced carbon emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/15">My hon. Friend put forward a number of suggestions, and I shall deal with them now. She asked us to consider the idea of designating, within each region, certain areas where planning applications for renewable energy projects would be encouraged. There is already an expectation that regions will set some targets for renewable energy in line with national policy. Planning policy statement 1, in its supplement on climate change published in December 2007, asks regional and local authorities to identify broad areas that they consider appropriate for renewables development, and sites. We set out a range of possible measures in our renewable energy strategy consultation, which was published last summer, to ensure that regional and local authorities plan positively for renewable energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/16">Although we are not quite doing what my hon. Friend suggests, we can look at her ideas with great care, because they fit in with the broad strategy that is being adopted. We want local authorities to plan positively for renewable energy, and, in the renewable energy strategy this summer, we will set out our views on how that can be taken forward.</p>
