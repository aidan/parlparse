<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17a.190.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" speakername="Tobias Ellwood" colnum="190"  time="009:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061017/halltext/61017h0001.htm#06101743000468">
	<p pid="a.190.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase> on securing this debate and I thank the Secretary of State for making time to come and contribute to it. The subject is important and arguably one of the most important. I hope that in future we shall have opportunities to discuss it in the House rather than in this Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/2">I do not think that there is any disagreement that we need to be active in Afghanistan, because it certainly requires assistance to meet the objective of peace and self-sustainability. However, views differ throughout the Chamber on the strategy and size of our commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/3">I was fortunate to visit Afghanistan recently and it was good to see the steady progress that has been made in areas around Kabul and other areas to which my hon. Friend referred. The problems that we are facing came home to me when I met some newly elected Afghan MPs who do not go to their constituencies in places such as Helmand because it is too dangerous. That quickly summarises the state of affairs there. We need much more effective and coherent co-ordination of operations in Afghanistan if there is to be progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/4">I fully agreed with the decision to enter Afghanistan. The threat was real and the enemy was active. Al-Qaeda was present and the Taliban Government were sympathetic to its cause. However, five years on, I am left wondering how much more could have been achieved had the 230,000 allied forces been moved to Afghanistan instead of going to Iraq in 2002. Five years after we first went into Afghanistan, we have only just gone into the Helmand province, which is probably the heart of where the most focus is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/5">I praise 16th Air Assault Brigade, which has made a fantastic effort there, but there is an issue of strategy. As a military person, I question why 16th Air Assault Brigade was sent there alone. We have huge and valuable experience of peacekeeping and war-fighting operations in Bosnia, Kosovo and so on, yet we sent out a light infantry unit for a task that required more armour, more firepower and more mobility. I encourage the Secretary of State to do what he can to influence the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Defence to ensure that our troops are properly armoured. That includes sending out one of the seven remaining Warrior battalions in this country that are not on deployment. I do not believe that Snatch Land Rovers provide the necessary protection, and the matter needs to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/6">The debate focuses on reconstruction. I fully agree with the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes. My experience of the development teams was that they are in a competitive game. USAID has a different strategy from DFID. Embassies have different forms of income coming through and different ideas of where the money should be spent. A myriad of agencies are competing against each other for contracts and work. I have said before and I repeat that there needs to be a UN-mandated co-ordinator for all reconstruction activities. Otherwise there will be continued competition&mdash;not necessarily between agencies but between what the military are doing on one hand and reconstruction efforts on the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/7">South of Kandahar I saw a school that had been rebuilt with international money and that was fantastic. Unfortunately, three weeks after it was completed there was a crop-eradication programme around the school which removed the livelihood of the community, so everyone left and there is now an empty school building south of Kandahar which no one is using.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" name="Paul Flynn">The hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> touched on the biggest issue about which we are in complete denial: the poppy crop. We try to distinguish the military front from reconstruction and from poppy growth, but the three are intertwined, and we must come to terms with that, otherwise our policy has no long-term future. Our policy on poppy crops is failing. We have a policy of eradication and replacement, and we cannot separate it from long-term factors even if we intend to remove the terrorism link with Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/9">The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime opium survey shows that last year was the largest opium crop ever. It represented a 59 per cent. increase on the previous year's crop, which was also the largest crop up to that point. The amount of crop exported has risen from 4,100 tonnes to 6,100 tonnes, which means that Afghanistan produces 92 per cent. of the world's opium. Helmand province has increased its capacity by 162 per cent. right under our noses. That is where we are supposed to operate. To put it another way, Helmand province produces just under half the world's opium.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/10">Britain is responsible under the list of G8 tasks for counter-narcotics and the counter-narcotics programme. We are well placed to lead. Last year, the United States spent more than $780 million, the UK about $100 million and the EU about $150 million on poppy eradication and replacement programmes, but let us face facts: the money was wasted. Crops have increased, and we must find another strategy to deal with the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/11">I have mentioned to hon. Members before that a similar story took place in Turkey in 1969, when Turkey was identified as the main source of the heroin that was entering the United States. President Nixon declared a war on drugs, and he was about to impose military and economic sanctions on Turkey. There were four years of hostility between the two countries as they tried to work out how to deal with the huge amounts of heroin entering the United States from Turkey. Eventually, after trying to make the crop illegal, Turkey asked the UN, &quot;Can we legalise it? Can we have a poppy programme in which poppies are grown under licence and distributed to the international community? There it will be controlled, it will not leak out, and it will be turned not into heroin, but morphine and codeine&mdash;other products of which there is a world shortage.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/12">That was back in 1969 and the 1970s. We do not hear of an opium or heroin problem from Turkey anymore. Indeed, other countries throughout the world grow poppies under licence. There is a massive threat and challenge in Afghanistan, however. I stand to be corrected, but I believe that about 90 per cent. of the heroin on British streets comes from Afghanistan. Yet, we are in denial; we believe that we can somehow eliminate the crop. The poppies play into the hands of the terrorists. The saddest fact is that when we try to eliminate those crops we alienate the very people whose hearts and minds we are trying to win over. That is fundamental.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/13">In refugee camps around Lashkagar, there are 10,000 to 15,000 people, and the numbers are rising because people have lost their communities. If one visits the camps, one finds that every third or fourth person wears a black turban. It is the mark of the Taliban. They walk around freely and recruit people from the refugee camps. So, when we talk about the enemy, the Taliban, we must be specific, because &quot;Talibanisation&quot; is the process whereby such people are recruited. The recruits are not Taliban sympathisers in the sense that they have a cause; they just want to put bread on their tables, feed their families and get on.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/14">The recruits see that the international community has been in their country for five years, and that their communities have been ruined by the destruction of the crops that have kept them going. It is understandable why when someone from the Taliban gives them a rocket-propelled grenade and says, &quot;Take a pop at a Land Rover or an American vehicle, and we will give you two months' salary in exchange&quot; they would be happy to do so. We are losing the battle for hearts and minds because of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/15">Organisations in Afghanistan such as the Senlis council and others would be keen to run a pilot scheme. Let us test the water. I am not saying that it would work. I really do not know whether it would, but why not give it a try? We have discussed how long it takes to grow a peach tree, pomegranates and so on, so let us consider a five-year programme to wean farmers off poppy cultivation. Each year they could give their poppies to a UN-licensed scheme, and at the same time part of their crop could be replaced with other produce. We could tax it, so the Afghan nation benefited, too. Most importantly, however, we would deny the terrorists the chance to benefit from the money, which is exactly what happens now.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/16">My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes discussed the long term. We might be in Afghanistan for 15 years, and it might be worth looking at the map of Afghanistan again. With its Pashtuns, Tajiks and Baluchis, we might ask whether the territorial line that encircles the country is ideal. Alternatively, we might ask the Baluchis, &quot;Were you to recreate your own country, where would it be?&quot; I think their answer would be that they would take a nice chunk of Pakistan that Pakistan does not like to talk about, and into which it does not send anybody in a uniform. We might consider that idea in the long term if we asked those people what they wanted to do. They are loyal not to Kandahar, Kabul or President Karzai, but to their families and their ethnic grouping. Until we understand that, we will never win the battles that we are fighting in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.192.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase> on raising this important subject and on his sobering speech. I intend to travel down the same road on which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> journeyed, although not as far as his final remarks. His suggestion of redrawing the map in Afghanistan and Pakistan opens up a new can of worms, which might get us into further difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/2">I cannot claim any recent first-hand experience of Afghanistan, because it is more than 30 years since I travelled there. I recall a time before the earth changed places with the sky, when King Zahir Shah was in his palace, the Buddhas were in their place in Bamiyan, the markets in Kandahar and Kabul were overflowing with fresh produce and it was possible for any foreigner to travel almost anywhere on public transport&mdash;albeit on aged German buses that still had their German destinations, such as Munich railway station, on the front.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/3">Nevertheless, I have picked up from people with recent experience of Afghanistan that things are not going well. That is the flavour of the debate. In particular, they are not going well in the south of the country, where our troops appear to be besieged in their bases, venturing out only in heavily armed convoys and patrols. As hon. Members have said, there is no meaningful contact with the locals, and we are in danger of losing the south. If we do, it will mark the beginning of a new Taliban state that may spread north whether we like it or not.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/4">Local people are becoming increasingly desperate. They are squeezed between the Taliban and the international community. Incidentally, they believe that all the international community, whether Canadians or British, are Americans. They refer to them as Americans. Among refugee camps, which are within 10 minutes of our military bases, as hon. Members have remarked, there is hunger. Among children, there is starvation, and there is little or no sign of aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/5">The pursuit of the opium eradication policy without any viable alternative strategy merely drives people into the hands of the Taliban. We appear to be destroying the crops only of those people who cannot afford to pay bribes not to have them destroyed. They are the smaller and more vulnerable farmers. For the larger farmers, who can pay the bribes, it is business as usual. Anybody who sees the new houses of police chiefs being built in the area will see where some of those bribes have gone. As hon. Members have remarked, there is little or no development activity. The aid agencies, including DFID, have more or less withdrawn from the south, and foreigners are increasingly reluctant to venture out of their fortified compounds, for reasons that I understand perfectly. It is not for me, sitting here in the comfort of the United Kingdom, to lecture the people on the ground in Afghanistan on what they should do. However, we have not the slightest hope of winning hearts and minds in such a situation. As others have said, the time has come to contemplate alternatives, unless we believe&mdash;I do not know anybody who does&mdash;that things are going so well that we can afford to ignore those who suggest alternatives. New thinking is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/6">The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East, mentioned the Senlis Council, which has people on the ground in Afghanistan and appears to venture out where most foreigners fear to tread, including into Lashkagar. It recently published a report assessing the first five years of the international presence in Afghanistan, entitled &quot;Afghanistan Five Years Later&mdash;The Return of the Taliban&quot;. I have sent a copy to the Secretary of State, although he may not yet have received it as he has been away. I have also sent copies to the Secretary of State for Defence and to the Minister responsible at the Foreign Office, each covered by a personal note. I hope that somebody will examine the report, because it tells a somewhat different story to the one that Ministers appear to believe. Over the months in which I have tried to interest Ministers in the work of the Senlis Council, it has depressed me that it has been so difficult to engage their attention. That is particularly true, I am sorry to say, of those in my old Department, the Foreign Office, and in the Ministry of Defence. I have had more luck with DFID, as one might expect, and I took some people from the Senlis Council to meet the Under-Secretary of State for International Development.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/7">Any alternative strategy&mdash;the report presents the one proposed by the Senlis Council&mdash;must involve local people. I wish to impress upon Ministers that they should at least consider the proposal mentioned by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East, for opium to be grown under licence for the international medical market, although I know that there are practical difficulties. The alternative is more of the chaos that already exists in Afghanistan and is writ large in Colombia, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" name="Paul Flynn">the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase>, said. We are afraid to discuss the matter because the Americans do not approve, but we must push it up the agenda. Pilot projects must obviously take place before the scheme can be considered viable, and there are practical difficulties, but they are not all that large compared with those of carrying on down the present road. The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East, mentioned the experience of eastern Turkey. If a scheme can work there, it ought to be able to work in Afghanistan. I believe that India grows opium under licence, as do half a dozen other countries, but the Turkish experience is the best example.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/8">The Senlis Council, which as I have said has people on the ground in Afghanistan in places where others fear to go, is offering to run pilot schemes. If I were at DFID I would be talking to it about that offer. An impressive woman named Norine MacDonald, a Canadian, is in this country at the moment. She has been based in Afghanistan for 18 months, and has just come back after three months there. I urge the Secretary of State to meet her while she is here this week: he would hear a version of events different from that which he is likely to hear from his officials.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/9">It is clear from what has been said by anybody with even a small knowledge of situation in Afghanistan&mdash;my knowledge is small&mdash;that our military on the ground know that the present strategy is not working. Opposition Members have spoken to them, and they are frank about its failure. They are up for change: Ms MacDonald said to me last night that our military are among the most open-minded about doing things differently. The only hope for Afghanistan, particularly the south, is a sustained effort to win hearts and minds before it is too late. The present programme, based partly on the forcible eradication of the poppy crop, which leads to hunger and in some cases starvation, will not work.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.0/1">There is a distinction to be made between Afghanistan and Iraq, and I wish to return to what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" name="Paul Flynn">the hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase>, said. Although I voted against the war in Iraq because I believed that it was against international law, I certainly supported our intervention in Afghanistan. It was in support of international law and various UN resolutions and at the behest of the democratically elected Government of President Karzai. I am not sure why the hon. Gentleman accuses the Afghan Government of being corrupt. Those of us who have met President Karzai and his Ministers know that they are trying to do as good a job as they can in difficult circumstances, often with not many resources. Many of them have returned to Afghanistan having lived abroad and are intent on bringing security and development.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase>, whose remarks were most perceptive. I also thank my hon. and gallant Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase> for securing this debate in the first place. The recent cover of <i>The House Magazine </i>said it all. I looked on with not a little envy, and would like to congratulate him on the example that he has set to many of the rest of us.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/2">Three things have rather chilled me over the past couple of months, the first of which was my visit to Kiev. It is a little known fact but, for whatever reason, about 60 per cent. of the Soviet forces that fought in Afghanistan were Ukrainian. The beggars in Kiev are of a wholly different class from anything that we see even in London. Many of them wear their veteran's caps, desert camouflage and Soviet orders from their times in Afghanistan, and an awful lot of them are minus limbs. Many of them are scarred horribly from the effects of bullets and shrapnel. They are an eloquent testimony to getting it wrong in Afghanistan. I wonder how closely we have paid attention to the lessons that the Soviets learned.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/3">The second thing that worried me was a comment that was made by Mr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the second in command of al-Qaeda. He said, &quot;Don't bother bringing your troops home, there's no need&mdash;there'll be no more Dr. Brydons this time&quot;. I am looking around and wondering just how many people know who Dr. Brydon was. He was the single British survivor from the 1842 expedition. The fact that that name does not necessarily trip off our tongues, but that it does trip off the tongue of an important individual in al-Qaeda, alarms me.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/4">The third thing that worried me seriously was my conversation with some American special forces officers yesterday, who said, &quot;Do understand that the war in Afghanistan is all-out war. Your troops are going there to fight&mdash;nothing more, nothing less. You must understand that the only solution is the destruction and the death of the Taliban.&quot; I do not think that that is correct and, without wishing to criticise our American allies in any way, I think that they have essentially missed the point.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/5">We must remember that our forces&mdash;and by that I do not just mean our armed forces, but our officials, our NGOs, our effort, our treasure and our emotions&mdash;are all driven towards creating the conditions in which the Afghan authorities can govern their country properly and peacefully. We are not there as a force to invade. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes said that he had painted a bleak picture, but I am not sure that he painted as bleak a picture as he suggested. He painted a picture in which there is hope, but in which, above and beyond everything, we must maintain a sense of balance about the campaign, both military and civil.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/6">My big fear is that over the next few months we will allow winter to make us complacent. The fighting will die down. Very shortly we will have some wonderful stories of heroism, with serious awards for gallantry&mdash;possibly Victoria crosses&mdash;to gentlemen who have bravely fought tooth and nail. We may allow ourselves to be distracted and to think that the war, or at least the fighting along the border, is won and that things are probably back on an even footing.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/7">Winter is when things go quiet&mdash;ask Roberts, of the British punitive expedition mounted from 1878 to 1880, which was extremely successful for a punitive expedition, inasmuch as it killed a lot of people. Ask him what happened in the winter. Things go quiet. The farmers and the Taliban retire to their deep valleys, where the satellites and the B-52s cannot get at them, let alone the special forces patrols. The farmers prepare their crops for the next season. It will be easy for the western press to say, &quot;Yeah, things are fine, guys&mdash;let's not worry about it&quot;, but what happens next spring? What happens when we find ourselves without the troops, money or Government direction to take on the next phase of the campaign, both civil and military?</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/8">I am grateful for the presence of the Secretary of State, for whom I have a huge amount of respect, and I would like him to answer one or two questions. The first concerns the delivery of international aid straight to the Afghans via the Afghan reconstruction fund, which is administered by the World Bank. How cleverly are we delivering money into the hands of the Afghans? Forgive me for using that horrid phrase, but if we are to empower the Afghan politician, authority, policeman, soldier, hospital or whomever, surely they must have budgets that they can use and that they can direct right to the spot where the trouble is. We cannot empathise exactly with the problems that face the Afghans&mdash;only they can&mdash;but we can make those in power seem powerful and influential in the eyes of the Afghans only if the money goes to the right places at the right times and is administered by Afghans, not Americans, Brits or Canadians. Can the Secretary of State shed some light on that?</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/9">My hon. and gallant Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> made some interesting points about what motivates the Taliban. Are they still an ideological movement or have they become a pragmatic movement? What dialogue are we trying to establish with the Taliban? I appreciate that such dialogue is probably loathed by some of our allies, such as the Tajiks and others, but we must surely be clever in the same way that we were, at times, pretty clever in the 19th century on the north-west frontier. Will the Secretary of State make it clear how subtle and sophisticated we are being in talking to the people who oppose progress inside Afghanistan?</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/10">I shall end on that point, but I roundly condemned the Government's tactic of sending few troops and few guns to Afghanistan when I lead a similar debate in February this year. I hope that the Government have realised that we sent too few men, not to do killing and military tasks, but to enable security to reign, the NGOs to do their job and proper, sensible aid to be brought to the embattled people of Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.1/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the authority, knowledge and, above all, insight with which he spoke. His speech deserves to be widely read, and I shall return to some of his points in the course of my remarks. I am sure that we are all grateful to him and to all our troops for their service in Afghanistan and for their courage and professionalism in extremely challenging circumstances. That point was made by several hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/2">I welcomed the speeches of all those who contributed: my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" name="Paul Flynn">the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1856" name="Chris Mullin">the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin)</phrase>, the hon. Members for Banbury (Tony Baldry) and for Newark (Patrick Mercer), and the Opposition spokespeople, the hon. Members for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) and for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds).</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/3">I last visited Afghanistan in June and spent some time in Kabul and in Lashkar Gah. I was able to see the progress that has been made as well as how far there is yet to go and the obstacles faced by the people of Afghanistan. The hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes referred, as did others, to the tragic history of the Afghan people, who have been terrorised by 30 years of conflict, widespread poverty, a complete lack of essential services and&mdash;the thing that most forcefully strikes me and other hon. Members&mdash;an absence of capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/4">As has been said, Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world. The most chilling statistic is that one in four Afghan children do not live to see their fifth birthday. One third of those children do not celebrate even their first birthday&mdash;they die before they are one year old. Afghanistan, along with Sierra Leone, has the highest infant mortality rate in the world. Only 47 per cent. of men and 15 per cent. of women can read. The challenge is immense, and the first thing that we must do is be absolutely straight about the scale of it. What has characterised this debate has been the honesty and candour with which all hon. Members have spoken.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/5">The hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes also knows the history of British involvement, and that we are part of a wider endeavour with the United Nations and NATO and one of 36 countries contributing to the international security assistance force.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/6">I agree completely with the hon. Gentleman and others who spoke that this is a long-term commitment. The challenge that the Afghan people face in changing their country and therefore their lives will involve a long, hard slog, to use a technical term. That is what we are talking about, and it will not be easy for the Afghan people quickly to undo the effects of the conflict. That is why we must demonstrate a long-term commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/7">I was asked to sum up what we are trying to do. We are trying to help the Afghan Government and people to create a stable and secure country. That is in their interests above all, but it is also in our interests, not least because of the circumstances that led us and others into Afghanistan after September 2001. That is why I say in all honesty to my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West that I do not recognise parallels with Vietnam. I believe that the circumstances are different, not least because we are supporting an elected Government. However, that is not to say that there are not challenges, and I shall return to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/8">We must acknowledge that there has been some progress, and the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness just outlined some of it. A good indicator of whether things are moving in the right direction in a country where there has been a conflict is whether people who fled the country when fighting was going on have come back. The fact that more than 4.5 million refugees have returned to Afghanistan since 2001 is an indication that things are better than they were when those people fled the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/9">The presidential and parliamentary elections have taken place and 25 million people participated. One answer to the point raised by the hon. Member for Richmond Park is that, as she will know, 25 per cent. of Afghan parliamentarians are women. They are doing better than we are in that respect. Some 6 million children have returned to school and a third of them are girls&mdash;I shall come back to the important point about intimidation. Immunisation has saved the lives of 35,000 children and&mdash;this links to the point about jobs that was raised by the hon. Member for Banbury&mdash;in 2005 the legal economy was estimated to have grown by 14 per cent. Private investment has soared from $22 million in 2003 to more than $400 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/10">Road rehabilitation, which is now taking place, will help to connect the major urban centres. One of the most striking things about Afghanistan is how it is decentralised by its geography. It is quite hard to get around. The improvement of communications and road communications will help people to travel, to meet each other and, crucially, to do business so that the economy will have the chance to grow.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/11">The UK is the second largest bilateral donor after the United States of America. We have spent about &pound;390 million since 2001, and that is the fifth largest DFID programme. At the London conference, which was mentioned by a number of hon. Members, the Prime Minister committed us to a 10-year development partnership with Afghanistan, which is another sign of long-term commitment from the Government. That is intended to try to help the Government of Afghanistan to plan for the long term and to invest in schools, hospitals and infrastructure. We are also providing support through the European Commission, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/12">The hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes clearly set out&mdash;the point was also made by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East&mdash;the choice and tension between doing things quickly and building capacity for them to be done in the long term by the Afghans. The hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes used exactly the right word; there is a balance to be struck, and that is what we are trying to get right. The way in which we give our support has led to Britain being described by Finance Minister Ahady as a model donor.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/13">We give 70 per cent. of our assistance directly to the Government of Afghanistan and that is one of the ways in which we can avoid lots of donors doing their own thing, which was the point made by the hon. Gentleman. It is also the best thing that we can do to show that there is an Afghan face to redevelopment and reconstruction. It is about giving the Afghans the tools to do the job. We are the largest donor to the recurrent budget, which covers the central costs such as salaries for teachers and health workers. It is for that reason that the Afghan Government want donors to provide more support in that way. They have acknowledged Britain's contribution, and the point that came across most forcefully at the London conference was a request to other donors to do more of that. The Afghans recognise that that is the most effective way in which, over time, they can increase their capacity to build effective state institutions that will last. Directing funds through the Government of Afghanistan also enhances their accountability and authority. That directly responds to the point made by the hon. Member for Newark. We know that such an approach is the most effective way of ensuring sustainability in the long term. That is why it is a question of balance.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/14">The hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes twice talked about progress being painfully slow and, in some ways, he is absolutely right. We all share the frustration, but we have to accept that if the goal towards which the people of Afghanistan and the Government are working is to be realised&mdash;an Afghan Government, elected by their citizens, delivering health care to people who are sick, education to children, and security in every province of the country&mdash;it will take time.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/15">The hon. Member for Richmond Park asked about the Afghanistan compact. It covers benchmarks that have been jointly agreed between the international community and the Government of Afghanistan. The UN has a job in monitoring it. She raised good questions about the rate of progress and the honest answer is that we will not know whether those benchmarks will be achieved until we reach those dates, but they express a set of targets towards which we are working. The rate at which the Afghans will be able to make progress on meeting the benchmarks will depend in part on security. There are some significant hurdles to overcome; we must be straight about those, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/16">When I was in Lashkar Gah, I went down to the banks of the bright turquoise-blue Helmand river to look at some work that DFID has been supporting. The thing that I remember, apart from the young boys who were having a swim having taken their examinations in school earlier in the day, was that the interpreter who turned up so that I could have a conversation with them and others was wearing a black facemask that covered his face. He had a baseball cap pulled down over his head. Why? It is a risk, in Lashkar Gah, to be seen to be working with the British&mdash;the foreigners.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/17">On the same day, Governor Daud of Helmand and his director of education, who we met in the hotel there, explained that 60 of the 224 schools in Helmand province&mdash;those figures are imprinted on my brain&mdash;are currently shut because of intimidation. Some head teachers have been murdered, as have some students and school officials, because they continue to try to teach girls. When will they reopen? It depends on when they feel that it is safe and secure enough to do so. That is why bringing security is, in my view, the precondition to development.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.1/1">I shall come to that point in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/2">There are 18 DFID staff in Afghanistan overall&mdash;15 in Kabul, one in Kandahar and two in Helmand. The development adviser, subject to the final security review, will return. We have a quick-impact problem manager in the country. There is no turf war between Government Departments; I want to make that clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/3">I pay tribute to the bravery not only of our troops, to whom I have already referred, but of our staff, who we ask to work there. Let us not forget that two weeks ago a group of them were in two vehicles queuing outside Governor Daud's premises when someone set off a suicide bomb. They are not people who do not dare to leave the premises to go out and see what is going on. No one has said it today, although others have in some newspaper reports, but that is a monstrous calumny against the bravery of our people who are out there doing their work.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/4">We are trying to balance the quick-impact project money that we have made available, in response to the more difficult security situation, to help the engineers who are out there to deliver things quickly with initiatives such as the rural development programme, which we hope will bring clean water and new roads to 120,000 people in Helmand in 2007&mdash;not because DFID has started to dig wells but because it is finding partners with whom to do such work. We are considering the drought appeal and I undertake to look further into the point that the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes raised about the camp not far from the provincial reconstruction team.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/5">I turn finally to the question of poppies. I accept entirely that the challenge in overcoming the curse of the poppy is a long term one. The hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes was right that if a farmer has a choice between growing something and feeding their family and not growing it and their family starving, they will grow that crop. Those responsible should be arrested and the law enforced, but eradication must take place alongside the alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/6">I want to finish on the point about the Senlis council's report. I shall simply quote the Afghan Minister's comments on legalisation:</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/7" class="indent">&quot;The poor security situation in the country means there can simply be no guarantee that opium will not be smuggled out of the country for the illicit narcotics trade abroad...We could not accept this.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/8">The conversation needs to be had not with me or the Foreign Secretary but with the Government of Afghanistan&mdash;it is their country&mdash;and they have a clear view about the Senlis council's proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/9">This has been an extremely good debate, because people have spoken frankly, from their own experience, about the scale of the challenge. I am clear in my mind that what we are doing to support the people and Government of Afghanistan is the right thing for the long term. The scale of the challenge is enormous and we must stay with the Afghan people as they rise to it.</p>

	<p pid="a.208.3/1">The figures for housing completions are a matter of record, and we all know what they are. However, I draw from two experiences. The first was the leader of an inner London council having to house destitute people under a Conservative Government who were vicious in their determination to try to ignore the plight of the homeless. The other is having to deal with a Conservative-controlled council that is equally brutal in how it deals with a number of my homeless constituents. It is a matter of recognising housing need and of properly assessing and meeting it. The Labour party, in government and in local authorities, has a record that the Conservatives could never hope to match, much less beat.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.3/2">As I said, however, despite the Government's many achievements in tackling homelessness, I still see too much of it. Not only that, the homeless people that I see are often the most vulnerable and the most in need of support; the very people whom I would expect to be helped by the state. Homelessness may have reduced, but it has intensified in nature. I shall deal with four particular issues. I know that some of my hon. Friends wish to raise other concerns, so I shall not stray on to that territory.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.3/3">The first is the need to get families with children out of bed-and-breakfast accommodation; the current rules must be tightened. Another is to stop councils making the unacceptable decision that people intentionally have made themselves homeless, and especially to ensure that a proper assessment is made of vulnerability among adults. The third is to stop diverting the homeless into private sector accommodation that is often completely inappropriate to their needs. The last is to end the single room rent. Underlying all that is the need for more social housing to rent. I welcome the recommendations of the Select Committee, as well as the commitment by the Chancellor to increase spending, which he sees as a key part of the spending review.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.3/4">I start with getting families out of bed-and-breakfast accommodation. We have seen a welcome reduction of 80 per cent. in the overall numbers since March 2002. Government guidance is that bed-and-breakfast accommodation should be used to accommodate families with children only as a last resort and only for six weeks. Although it might be possible for some councils to interpret that in a reasonable fashion, that is not the case in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.3/5">My understanding of &quot;last resort&quot; or &quot;emergency&quot; is that someone's house has burned down, or that everything else has been tried and failed. Yet in Northampton, I find that the threat of bed and breakfast seems to be used routinely to deter people from applying for social housing, and it is still used routinely for families who face what might be termed predictable homelessness; families who have been served with notices to quit their private sector rented accommodation because the landlord wants to sell the property, or lone parents with children who are evicted by grandparents or friends who have given a month's notice of their impending homelessness and who have time to find a more acceptable alternative.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.3/6">I shall give some examples of what is meant by bed and breakfast. In one instance, a young lone parent in my constituency was placed in a bed-and-breakfast hostel where, as she complained to me, a relative of the owner rifled through her belongings. She felt unsafe and left, and was promptly branded as being intentionally homeless; she was therefore refused further help with housing. She had suffered a compound series of issues in her previous life, so by any reasonable standard she should have been regarded as vulnerable and in priority need. It would be hard to interpret what had happened to her as intentional.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.3/7">Another example was of someone being refused housing by a local authority but being helped by social services; there was a particular need to ensure parity of treatment between the two groups. A Muslim widow with seven children was placed in a bed-and-breakfast hostel that had no cooking facilities. Because of that restriction, she had to walk across town each day to a community centre in order to cook a meal for her children and then walk back with the cooked meal.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.3/8">Finally, only last weekend a woman with three children came to my advice surgery. She was being evicted by her landlord because he wanted to sell the property. She had nowhere to live and went to the local council, which said that she would have to come back on the day of the eviction and that they would probably put her in bed-and-breakfast accommodation in a town about 20 miles away. Not only would that have made it virtually impossible to sort out her accommodation needs, it would mean disruption for the children; they would not receive schooling and they would also lose their friends. When she was eventually placed in a single bed-and-breakfast room in a hostel in Northampton, she saw it as a real concession; never mind that that she was in a bed and breakfast, with all its attendant difficulties. Frankly, that is being bullied.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.3/9">The Government have to be much more specific about the circumstances in which families with children are placed in bed and breakfast, and about the facilities that they should have. They should ensure that the rules apply equally to families placed in accommodation by the housing authority under homelessness legislation and those placed in hostel accommodation by social services under the Children Act 1989. By whichever route they get there, the same standards should apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.3/10">If it is not possible to be more specific about the circumstances, the Government should take the bold step of completely ruling out bed-and-breakfast accommodation for families. I realise the difficulties that that would create, but we cannot have families with children being placed in unacceptable accommodation. That is unacceptable, as is the default route whereby, instead of being dealt with under homelessness legislation, those concerned are deal with by social services under the Children Act; that is because they do not have the same safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.3/11">Although the pressure on the numbers of families in bed and breakfasts is welcome, it is one of the causes of the dramatic increase in families in temporary accommodation. In my own region of the east midlands, the numbers have more than doubled since 1997, and the evidence from Shelter on the position of those families is acute. As some of my colleagues want to speak about that, I will leave further description of that problem to them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17a.212.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="212"  time="011:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061017/halltext/61017h0002.htm#06101743000486">
	<p pid="a.212.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase> on securing this important debate. While I respect her temptation to take a side swipe at the Tories&mdash;we can all respect that&mdash;I think that homeless people are better served by raising this debate above the tiresome, tribal debates and squabbles that often take place; homeless people deserve that.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/2">I also entirely agree with the hon. Lady's concluding remarks regarding the single room rent. From my own experience of my west Cornwall and Isles of Scilly constituency of St. Ives, I know that there is a significant problem with the setting of local reference rents generally. Because of the methodology used, they are often set significantly below the rate that the private sector charges for properties, certainly in my area. That leaves many people who are on low incomes, earning and non-earning, facing a significant shortfall between the housing benefit that they receive and the rent that they are charged, in an environment in which private rented accommodation especially is scarce and extortionately expensive compared with incomes, at least in my area, which has the lowest incomes in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/3">The debate is about homelessness and I want to deal with two matters. One relates to the gathering of the data&mdash;the basis on which we take decisions or Government policy is decided. I had an exchange of letters with the Minister for Housing and Planning a year ago, querying the figures given by the Government at that stage. The theme that I want to develop and the question that I want to ask is whether the Government believe that homelessness is the result of dysfunctional people who have simply failed themselves and that accommodation does exist, or whether there is a malfunctioning of the housing system and the housing market, which I argue is more likely, particularly in an area such as my own.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/4">The impression given, certainly in the exchange that I have had with Ministers, is that homelessness is a problem of data collection and definition. There is a rather patronising centralist view that somehow those stakeholders out in the sticks are not competent enough to establish and operate strategies to deal with the problems. All the correspondence and dialogue that I have had points to a failure of the Department, whether Ministers or officials, to accept that there might be a malfunctioning of the housing system and the housing market that might result in pressures throughout the system such that those who are dropping out at the end are in fact properly functioning people who simply cannot be housed because insufficient housing is available for them and their circumstances are not a result of a failure in themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/5">In commenting on this issue, especially with regard to my constituency, I should congratulate a large number of voluntary sector projects in particular. One in which I was involved from the very early stages is called Breadline; it is just up the road from me in Bread street in Penzance. Since 1986, that project has provided very significant help to homeless people and unemployed people in the Penwith area. The YMCA has some hostel accommodation, particularly for younger single people, in the Penwith area. Penwith Housing Concern provides support, advice and counselling, particularly for those who have suffered substance and alcohol misuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/6">The Salvation Army undertakes its own quarterly count and provides us with extremely helpful figures on the people with whom it makes contact and provides support for, and works with other agencies in a very professional manner in the Penwith area. It has recently secured another hostel to assist and relieve the problem locally. Of course, there is also Shelter, with which I was involved before I was elected as an MP, and many other organisations. There are also the local authority professionals in this sphere, for whom I have a very high regard as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/7">In setting the backdrop to my comments on this issue, I should say that I undertook a survey of estate agents in March/April last year, about 18 months ago. I asked very simple straightforward questions regarding how properties had been sold, to whom they had been sold and the prices and the estate agents' estimates, as they are in the best position to give estimates, of the change in house prices and the change in the nature of the market. I found that, in the whole of west Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, twice as many properties were sold to second-home buyers as to first-time buyers. People locally will be not surprised at that; in fact, they will be surprised that first-time buyers are able to buy and get that toehold in the market at all, given the house prices. I will not bore hon. Members with statistics&mdash;those can be trotted out on many occasions and I can supply them to people&mdash;but certainly the average house price in the area vastly outstrips local wages. According to one's source, the average house price is anything from seven to 10 or 12 times local wages. That is not a surprise and it is not a surprise that large numbers of properties are purchased for recreational and investment purposes by people who want to enjoy them as holiday accommodation and for their own leisure and investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/8">I am not involved and nor am I interested in the politics of envy. People are of course entitled to buy properties for recreational and investment purposes if that is their desire. However, we need to consider a range of policy issues relating to the impact that that is having and whether we need to change policy, particularly in the area of planning use class orders, to constrain the numbers of properties that can be purchased and converted from permanent to non-permanent residency.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/9">Hon. Members, including you, Mr. Taylor, may be asking yourselves, &quot;Well, what has second-home ownership to do with homelessness?&quot; This is the very point that I want to make. Second-home ownership is having a very direct effect in this regard. If the market is significantly influenced by extremely wealthy people&mdash;wealthy compared with locals&mdash;who can intervene in the market and in fact set the whole tone of it and if the price regime is largely generated or led by that development, it will inevitably have an impact on families who, 20 or 30 years ago, might have anticipated that they would have a chance of getting into the market. They now cannot and they are looking for the very scarce accommodation available through either the public or the private sector for rent. Particularly in the private sector, such accommodation is not only scarce but extortionate in price.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/10">Further to the survey that I undertook last year, I undertook a survey this summer and found that five times as many properties were sold to second-home buyers as to first-time buyers. That is just 18 months after my original survey. Again, the findings are not a surprise. In St. Ives, for example, an estate agent told me that 60 per cent. of properties were sold to second-home buyers and 0 per cent. to locals. Many people will not be surprised by that outcome, but perhaps it is a surprise and very disturbing to people here to hear that that is the dysfunctional way in which the housing market operates in my area.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/11">Down on the Lizard peninsula, an estate agent told me that 65 per cent. of properties were sold to second-home buyers and 0 per cent. to locals. <i>[Interruption.] </i>I do not know whether you can still hear me, Mr. Taylor, given the intervention from a phantom driller off to my right&mdash;that is not a political statement. I am trying to show a significant connection, relating to how the housing market works for thousands of people, who are unable to express their demand, desire and need for housing in the market place, as they might well have been able to a generation ago, even in an area as difficult as Cornwall.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17a.215.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="215"  time="011:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061017/halltext/61017h0002.htm#06101743000488">
	<p pid="a.215.1/1">Absolutely. I do not argue that the problem is a nationwide one. It is clearly localised to Cornwall, parts of south-west England and Norfolk, the Lake district, Somerset and some other places. It is not inconceivable, and it would certainly be acceptable in my view, for the Government to provide local authorities with the tools, if they wanted to use them. It would be appropriate only in areas such as those I have described, where second-home purchases have a detrimental impact not only on the housing market but on such matters as community infrastructure and the viability of schools. There is clearly an opportunity, as the Affordable Rural Housing Commission suggested in its report, not for the Government to intervene themselves but for them to provide local authorities with the tools to do so where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/2">In view of the time, I want to return to the issue of homelessness, and to provide a backdrop to show why, surprising as it may appear, homelessness, which is assumed to be an urban phenomenon affecting only metropolitan and inner city areas, has significantly affected an area such as mine in west Cornwall for the past 10 to 20 years. It has certainly not gone away. Our problem is, first, that the Government do not accept the level and seriousness of the problem in my area.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/3">In Penwith alone&mdash;my constituency covers most of Kerrier, Penwith and, of course, the Isles of Scilly&mdash;the count on 14 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March</phrase> last year demonstrated that there were six rough sleepers in Penwith district. It is the smallest by far of the six districts in Cornwall. The figure for Cornwall as a whole was 11. That is an absurd figure. Anyone who works in the relevant policy sphere will know that that does not at all reflect the seriousness of the problem in the area. The figures that the Salvation Army gave me for that period suggest that the number was in the region of 40. Some of the latest figures suggest that the number remains the same. The official figures that I have had most recently from Penwith district council, despite tremendous efforts by the district and by other stakeholders working together to bear down on the problem, show eight rough sleepers now in the district.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/4">Transient people coming to the end of the line are an issue. The district has the image of a place to which people can escape, and that is a theme that certainly has an effect in an area such as my own. However, we also generate a significant amount of indigenous homelessness, and the Government need to take that fact on board. The Ministerial response to me on this matter suggested that the reason for the relevant figure was a problem with the statistical measures that were used, or a problem with Penwith district council and its manner of addressing the problem. I was told that officers from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister came down and spoke to local stakeholders, and suggested ways to tackle the problem. All those measures were already in place in the area. There are also 65 people in bed and breakfast. Those are single people, not families. Alternative hostel accommodation is being provided for families in my area.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/5">There is a significant problem in the area, and the Government do not seem to want to accept that it is a problem. I believe that they view it as a matter of the statistical count, and of the homeless people themselves, rather than as the product of a dysfunctional, malfunctioning housing market in which pressure higher up leads inevitably to unbearable pressure further down the housing supply chain, so that large numbers of people are homeless in areas such as mine. Those areas need their problems addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/6">I hope that the Minister will accept that what I have outlined is not simply a statistical exercise, but is an issue that must be related to the working of the whole housing market.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17a.216.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" speakername="Ian Gibson" colnum="216"  time="011:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061017/halltext/61017h0002.htm#06101743000490">
	<p pid="a.216.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase> on raising this appropriate debate, at a time when we know Cathy coming home is still an issue. I am glad that she pointed out how much has changed and the improvements that have been made, although there is still much more that we can do. I want to discuss that in the brief time that I have.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/2">I took an interest in this issue because, after the 2005 general election, I was challenged, as I often am, by BBC Radio Norfolk, to say what I was doing about homelessness. I held my hand up and said, &quot;Well, not a lot, really,&quot; but I knew then that I had better do something about it, and my researcher and I set to work in the Norwich area to find out how homelessness was created. We visited rough sleepers, soup kitchens, drug counsellors, housing officers and charity chief executives, and managed to get them all together in a room. They were all very well at telling me individually how well they were behaving, but they did not seem to know each other or work together very creatively. That was the lesson that I came away with after my initial six months of study; they really ought to work together. We need a whole city programme in which that happens, and we need to be radical about looking after homeless people.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/3">There is a lot of confusion among the service users, who have been given little help or information by statutory bodies, and who are sent from one charity to another and one hostel to another. There is no standard process for them to follow, and it is no wonder that they fall through the net; in actuality there is no net. There is no way of tracking an individual's progress through the system and no uniform method of assessment and referral. It is difficult to get information about where to go. There is no uniform assessment of needs at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/4">My young researcher asked why there was not a website in the city of Norwich, which has had a proud record on housing for years. I know that not everyone uses websites, but that would at least be a slightly creative thing to do in this day and age to enable people to see which places were or were not full. I think that that will happen now.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/5">I have been through all the statistics and have found out that the number of households in temporary accommodation in the eastern region rose by 171 per cent. between 1997 and 2005. I always can be suspicious of statistics and figures, but that one is being heavily quoted, and perhaps the Minister would look into it.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/6">The issue of housing&mdash;the lack of affordable and social housing that affects families across the board, from the homeless to first time buyers and others&mdash;has already been covered in the debate. I know that the Government are making efforts to increase affordable housing, and I welcome that. The right to buy has crippled the housing stock in Norwich. Both the Norwich MPs get many visits on the subject. Nearly half of every surgery is taken up by people who cannot find a home and do not understand why there are empty homes in the city of Norwich that they cannot get into. Some of those people would be quite prepared to go into the houses and decorate them, but there is always some pathetic excuse as to why they cannot use houses that have been empty for a few months or so. That is one problem with the affordable housing issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/7">As an aside I ask this: when we do build houses, could we please think about the environment and climate change? Also, having a bit of photovoltaics around would not do any harm. We could combine the problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/8">The second prong of homelessness has not been touched on today, so I shall spend a minute on that. I want to lubricate the system by which people who are registered as being homeless can be helped. We cannot immediately put people into homes because the homes are not there; I want to address the issue of how assessments are made as to whether people have made themselves homeless. Under section 191 of the Housing Act 1996 the local authority must determine if an applicant is intentionally homeless. The DCLG guidelines on homelessness say that an applicant is intentionally homeless if they have deliberately done or failed to do something which has caused them to be homeless. That leaves little room for the interpretation of individual circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/9">My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North has illustrated one or two cases, and I will give another. She referred to &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot;; those were the days. Back then, everybody had to watch because there were only two channels, BBC and ITV. My goodness, those were the days; we had to watch political history unfolding in front of our eyes on television rather than skipping and floating around 50 different channels. I have a young male constituent who suffers from depression, which is common in people who are homeless. Mental health problems occur much more frequently than in the days of &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot;. My constituent lived in private rented accommodation and had problems managing his money, which is not particularly abnormal; it happens. He got into rent arrears and lost his tenancy, and he was classified as intentionally homeless. The stringent interpretation of the priority need legislation is leaving many vulnerable people homeless who really should not be and who need our help. The system has to help them. My constituent found it difficult to get local people to take his problem seriously. Legislation and the filling in of forms got in his way, as he found that incompatible with his particular problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/10">I went round and talked to people about the paper-based medical assessments, which people have to fill in. A general practitioner's word is not good enough; a medical assessment form has to be filled in. I met the Norfolk and Waveney mental health partnership homeless mentally ill outreach team&mdash;there's a mouthful&mdash;who told me that the council in the eastern region refused evidence of an applicant's doctor or support workers in favour of these paper-based medical reports. The council relies heavily on the type of medication and dosage in making a final assessment of a person's condition and, therefore, whether they are in priority need.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/11">There is a world-class agency in Norwich called Julian Housing Support, which gives amazing housing support for people with mental health problems. That organisation says that it is necessary to assess people as individuals rather than through a strict medical model that fails to take into account a person's choice to decline medication, and other factors. People with mental illnesses frequently do not take their medication or do what their doctors tell them. Gosh, does anybody in the Chamber do everything that their doctor tells them? I certainly hope not.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/12">I have tabled parliamentary questions on this issue, and was told that is for a local authority to decide which services to use, and the Department recommends certain agencies as being useful. In friendship, I say to the Minister that we need there to be high-quality initial decision making about individuals. Is the Department prepared to commission research into the quality of these paper-based assessments and withdraw support if they are found wanting? I believe that some of them will be found wanting, and that there may be other ways to get the necessary information.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/13">We know that because of the nature of homelessness, many people find themselves in the same situation on a regular basis. Drug and alcohol dependencies are much more frequent than they were 40 or so years ago. Mental health problems and drug and alcohol dependency mean that there is a whole new problem, which needs to be handled in a new way because of the vulnerability of the people concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/14">I am pleased that Norwich city council now has a full-time private sector facilitator to help people to get into private accommodation, and I congratulate the council on that. I also congratulate the landlords in Norwich on trying to help out. However, we should not spend all our time helping private landlords; we should find other solutions to help the weakest and most vulnerable in our society.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/15">I shall finish by talking about hostels and the problems with them. They are always full, there is no move-on accommodation, the individuals who stay in them become institutionalised, and rough sleepers cannot get a foot on the ladder of rehabilitation. I have talked to Norfolk Supporting People and Norwich city council, which has produced a marvellous document, &quot;A Review of Hostels and Supported Housing in the Greater Norwich Housing Sub Region&quot;, for which I have high hopes. We had a meeting, and somebody from the Department came and gave a presentation about the work being done by the Department's hostels capital improvement programme, which helps to create bright, vibrant, positive, modem hostels. Was not the PowerPoint presentation magnificent?</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/16">The scheme's mantra, quite rightly, is not more beds, but better beds. Its aim is to make hostels centres of excellence. We need more such programmes to help people, because hostels become full very quickly, and people become institutionalised and cannot move on. We need more of that kind of programme and we need hostels that are supportive and rehabilitative environments in which people can access to health and career services and counselling. While the Minister is at it, I wonder if she would give Norwich city council a bit more money. It has good ideas but its homelessness grant is very small.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I come to the debate from the perspective of a Member in the capital with all the housing problems we have here, particularly concerning the homeless, but I understand that there are other perspectives and problems. One theme of today's debate is the fact that homelessness is becoming a significant problem in all regions of the country and that we need to deal with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/2">I congratulate the Government on making homelessness a priority. Others have spoken at length about the rough sleeping initiative, which has been very successful, but no one mentioned the introduction of the strategy for local government on homelessness, which has focused local authorities' attention on the issue and some of the supply steps that they can take to deal with it. We have also had the extension of priority categories&mdash;16 and 17-year-olds who are vulnerable and people who come from institutional settings&mdash;which has done a great deal to stop people from falling through the safety net into rough sleeping.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.0/1">Something has not come out in the debate so far. As we have concentrated on families in bed and breakfast accommodation, we have missed the growing crisis in this country concerning hidden homelessness. Crisis estimates that there are at least 380,000 single homeless people. Will the Minister address not only those people who are in bed and breakfast accommodation but also those who are in squats and on sofas in the homes of friends and family, as many of our constituents are? There is a growing problem because we have an overly rigid system that is failing to deal with homelessness.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17a.223.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" speakername="Daniel Rogerson" colnum="223"  time="011:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061017/halltext/61017h0002.htm#06101743000497">
	<p pid="a.223.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a very valid point, to which I shall return. When we are considering how local authorities assess homelessness we want a consistent approach: one that consistently reflects the situations that people are experiencing rather than the strictures within which the local authority is working.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/2">I agree with the hon. Member for Northampton, North that there is pressure to go into the private rented sector, which undoubtedly has a contribution to make. However, I echo other hon. Members' comments: the approach is not necessarily the one that my party would support. Greater investment in social housing offers far better provision for people's housing needs. She also discussed the single room rent. I hope that the Government will return to that issue. Things have moved on considerably since its introduction, and her party and mine opposed it at that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">the Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> referred to the situation in our own region of Cornwall, particularly in respect of second homes. I hope that the Minister will update us on the response to the Affordable Rural Housing Commission's proposal, in line with that of my party, to examine planning use categories and to give local authorities in areas where that matter is a problem the chance to deal with it. I hope that there is a contrast with the approach taken by her colleague, the Minister for Housing and Planning, when she was interviewed in the <i>Financial Times</i> not long after the report came out. She basically said that this was not an issue that the Government were interested in tackling. I hope that the approach has moved on a little.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> referred to the lack of a thorough system of tracking, to be sure of how many people are involved and what the need is. He is right that that could be improved. He also referred to sustainability in housing. When there is investment in new social housing, the fact that sustainable housing in terms of energy efficiency would make such housing more affordable on an ongoing basis for the people who live in it should be reflected. I was glad that he raised that point. He also focused on some vulnerable groups, and that is useful.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/5">Other hon. Members highlighted the situation in the capital. It was useful to hear that there will be further opportunity for that to be discussed later in the week. We must be clear that homelessness is much more than rooflessness; my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" name="Greg Mulholland">the Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> made reference to rough sleeping. While my party welcomes the efforts that the Government have made in dealing with that, it is clear that there are disputes about the official statistics on people who are currently sleeping rough. As he was saying, we must also focus on the fact that many people live in temporary and inadequate accommodation. There are now twice as many families living in temporary accommodation as there were when the Government came to power. Council house waiting lists have risen by 50 per cent., and 100,000 are officially homeless. Shelter's powerful briefing on this issue said that the real figure is more like 500,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/6">We must address homelessness as the biggest blight on the quality of life of the citizens of this country. It is difficult to address health if people are living in inadequate housing. People cannot take educational opportunities that are presented to them if they have to live in intolerable conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/7">Families who are placed in temporary accommodation have the constant worry that they will be moved on somewhere else. That insecurity is found in the private rented sector, where people may be on housing benefit and do not have settled accommodation as they have shorthold tenancies of perhaps six months to a year. They do not have the security that allows them to plan further forward and to feel settled in a community. They feel that they are at risk in future of once again finding themselves homeless and having to return to the local authority for assistance. That means that children are unable to establish themselves in schools or to cement friendships, and that can adversely affect their education and wider social well-being.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/8">Current Government guidelines state that councils should avoid using bed and breakfast accommodation wherever possible, especially for families with children. However, they state that private landlords can be a source of high-quality, self-contained temporary accommodation. I hope that the Minister will deal with how we can get away from short-term accommodation in tackling this problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/9">Earlier this year, I tabled a question on Newham's local space initiative, Ealing's safe haven partnership and London and Quadrant housing trust's homeless initiative leasing scheme, all of which are initiatives aimed at bringing temporary accommodation into use as permanent homes and examining new ways of tackling the need for temporary accommodation. I did not get a comprehensive answer, and would welcome further information from the Minister on how many families have been provided with settled homes through those programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/10">Single people make up the majority of those living on friends' floors. They are the hidden homeless to whom my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-West referred, and they tend to be low down on councils' vulnerability criteria. We need to address, as a country, what these criteria are and come up with a better standard, so that councils have slightly less scope to come up with their own criteria on vulnerability.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/11">One would think that creating new social housing stock would be the obvious thing for the Government to do to tackle this problem, but only 170,000 new social homes have been built since 1997. Meanwhile, the social housing stock has been reduced by a net 500,000 homes and local authority waiting lists have also risen by that figure. We must invest more in social housing and we need to build it as quickly as possible. Some local authorities, such as Liberal Democrat-led South Shropshire district council, to which I have referred in previous debates, have used existing possibilities in respect of section 106 agreements to increase the amount of social housing that can be provided as a result of private development. I hope that other local authorities will take the chance to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/12">We must also tackle the issue of bringing empty property back into use, which several local authorities have been examining recently. I welcome the Government's initiatives on empty dwelling management orders, which give greater tools to local authorities to address that. The solutions are varied, but we must target resources more in the direction to which other hon. Members referred by providing social, rented accommodation which would offer a permanent, settled solution for people who find themselves homeless and would prevent them from having to return to the lack of security in the private rented sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.230.1/1">That is a concern, and I shall take it back to my Department. We need to address it with the Department for Education and Skills, and I shall to write to my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/2">The Government set up their homelessness system to prevent homelessness. I am sure every hon. Member agrees that it is better to prevent homelessness than to have to deal with it. Homelessness legislation was always intended to be a safety net, and not the main route to social housing. Good practice says that people should be given a choice, and that may include the private sector. Many people live quite reasonably in the private sector, and it is an option.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/3">It is also important that if families are at risk of homelessness, whether in the private sector or anywhere else, they talk to their councils early on, because measures exist to enable housing authority assistance. On the issue of the gap between the market rent and housing benefit, discretionary housing payments can be used temporarily to allow more suitable and affordable accommodation to be found. Single room rent is a matter for the Department for Work and Pensions, but we continue to work together.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">The hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase>, whose constituency I recently visited, raised the issue of the whole system. My Department, with the Government offices for the regions, supports local authorities so that they can improve their strategic housing role. They must consider not only the social market, but the whole market and how it works.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North raised the issue of hostels. They are funded through the supporting people programme, as he identified, which requires staff to assess support needs and construct support plans that supporting people commissioning groups then monitor. We are not complacent about hidden homelessness. We are considering other ways of identifying it, such as measuring overcrowding in concealed and shared housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/6">I do not have much time, but <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1858" name="Michael Gove">the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)</phrase> should not give me lessons on the problems of homelessness. I worked in social services for 16 years under a Conservative Government. The hon. Gentleman rightly identified the problematic issues and their causes, but for anybody who had to turn away 16 and 17-year-olds without accommodation or funding, or who at half-past 10 at night had to phone a housing officer to look for accommodation for a mother with three young children, there were no answers under the previous Conservative Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/7">Too many households live in temporary accommodation, but we have a strategy in place which I believe will succeed in meeting our target to halve the number by 2010. We are committed to delivering a wide range of preventative services, increasing homelessness grants to local authorities and voluntary sector agencies by 23 per cent. by 2007-08, helping 1.2 million vulnerable people sustain independent living through the &pound;5 billion supporting people programme over three years to 2007-08, providing 75,000 new social rented homes between 2005-06 and 2007-08, and building an extra 10,000 social homes a year by 2008. We will also invest &pound;90 million to improve hostels and their services, and help rough sleepers make a permanent move away from the streets.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.1/8">In conclusion, I thank all Members who have participated. This is an important area. The Government are not complacent, and we are doing more, including ensuring that a greater number of homes and affordable homes are built throughout our country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17a.232.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1402" speakername="Alasdair McDonnell" colnum="232"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061017/halltext/61017h0003.htm#06101743000506">
	<p pid="a.232.1/1">This is an issue close to my heart, and it is a privilege to be able to discuss it under your chairmanship, Mr. Williams.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/2">It is an unfortunate fact of life that for at least a generation, perhaps longer, the great city of Belfast, part of which I have the honour and privilege of representing, was known to most of my colleagues in the House and most of the public for one thing only; the violent and futile conflict between its people. I hope that that conflict is now resolved. Had I been making this speech 50 or 100 years ago, the city would have been known for something very different. It would have been recognised as one of the most vibrant and successful manufacturing and trading centres in these islands. Indeed, when the Harland and Wolff shipyard was at its peak, Belfast was known as a global centre of manufacturing and trade. We had not only that shipyard but a massive ropeworks and Mackie's foundry, to name but a couple, each employing more than 8,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/3">At the centre of all that success were Belfast lough and the port of Belfast. At that time the natural resource provided by the lough and the port, and our wise management of it, gave Belfast a strategic advantage over the rest of the region. That advantage has been the bedrock of the city's economic life since the earliest days of Belfast, when it was a small community founded at the mouth of the Farset river and known in Gaelic as B&eacute;al Feirste; the mouth of the Farset.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/4">Officialdom's attitude to the port down the years has often reflected closely the quality of life in Northern Ireland and the expectations of people living there. When things were bad throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the port was largely left to its own devices. The priorities of that time were different from today's, with a few notable exceptions; individual Ministers sent from this House to administer government in Northern Ireland focused largely on containing a deteriorating security situation and then, in their own interests, getting out of there as quickly as possible to a better job in government. Through that difficult period, the port of Belfast continued to do its job, giving the enduring businesses that still operated there a reliable, economical link to the outside, normal world of commerce. It was a commercial success at a time when we had few successes.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/5">In the 1990s, the peace process began to emerge. Life and business made their first faltering steps back to normality and the people of the region began to hope and expect that the quality of our lives would improve. As part of that process, the Belfast harbour commissioners examined the port's facilities carefully, and wisely began to invest heavily in improving them to ensure that the port could capitalise on the improved business environment around it. That the harbour commissioners continue to take seriously the role that they have taken on is reflected in the projection that between 1995 and 2010 they will have invested a massive &pound;250 million in developing the port and the harbour estate around it. Amazingly, and as an obvious benchmark of the port's success, that investment has been achieved without any direct expense from the public purse.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/6">I wish also to mention another organisation close to my heart; the Laganside Corporation. It was established in shadow form in about 1987 and went live under legislation passed early in 1989. It did some of the greatest work that our city has ever seen and was innovative and successful. It played a major role in reminding the people of our city of their connection with and reliance on Belfast lough and the River Lagan, which flows into it. The Laganside Corporation took over wasteland and waste docklands that people never dreamed would be of any use again. With appropriate infrastructure investments it turned hundreds of acres of worthless land into land for which anything up to &pound;1 million or &pound;2 million an acre is paid today. By bringing people back to the water and bringing the waterside of Belfast back to life, Laganside raised public awareness of the port's key role and reminded us all what an amazing resource it had been and continues to be for our future.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/7">It is a matter of deep regret to me and to many of those interested in the improvement of the welfare of Belfast that the Laganside Corporation is shortly to be wound up despite the fact that much of its work remains to be done. Yes, an exit strategy was designed all those years ago when the body was set up, and it was intended to survive for only 15 or 18 years, but it has done such an outstanding job and there is still so much more to do that it should not be wound up. I will continue to bring the need for an immediate and effective successor to the attention of the House in the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/8">The greater awareness created by the Laganside Corporation and the waterfront developments meant greater scrutiny of the work of the port and the challenges that it faced. In 1998 a report issued by the Department of Education, as it was then, covered some of the issues involved and concluded that Northern Ireland's trust ports, of which Belfast is one&mdash;there are others in Derry and Warrenpoint&mdash;should be granted greater financial freedom and more powers to do their work.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/9">In 2001, a Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly, chaired by my party colleague Alban Maginness, carried out a detailed assessment and came to a similar conclusion; that things should be loosened up and that the enormous potential of the port could be achieved, and the potential benefits to the people realised, only if it remained a fully accountable trust port but with greatly extended powers to give it the financial and managerial flexibility to compete successfully with its competitors in Britain and the Republic of Ireland. I regret to say that the bulk of the recommendations in that Assembly report have been ignored. None of the necessary extended powers recommended was ever implemented. Instead, in 2001 the Office for National Statistics required that trust boards be classified as public corporations. That regulation eventually came into effect in 2005. The already restricted regulatory environment in which the port operated was further tightened and the clearly expressed will of the Assembly and the devolved Government ignored.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/10">Against that background, four months ago the Department for Regional Development published a public consultation document on the powers, status and governance of public trust ports in Northern Ireland. The Department has considered ports policy in parallel with a UK-wide consultation, and the report follows a lengthy period of debate. Unsurprisingly, the debate and uncertainty do nothing to improve our facilities or give the trust ports the freedom that they need to develop the appropriate infrastructure and help us to compete.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/11">Before I briefly consider what I would like to come out of the exercise, I want to look at the current state of the port of Belfast. By any financial measure, Belfast is one of the most successful and efficiently run ports in these islands. Only last month the port of Belfast was named Irish port of the year at the transport and logistics awards. It is by far Northern Ireland's largest port and a strategic asset for the entire island of Ireland. It handles 60 per cent. by volume of Northern Ireland's seaborne trade and 20 per cent. by volume of the trade of the island as a whole. The port of Belfast handles &pound;19 billion of trade annually, in which is contained 25 per cent. by value of the goods coming from and going to the whole island of Ireland. The port is a significant gateway for trade and the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/12">Apart from being Northern Ireland's most important gateway for trade, the port is an economic catalyst and contributes significantly to its principal stakeholders, namely the Government, port users and the wider economy. Any failure of the port to develop to meet the demands that are placed on it would directly impact on thousands of businesses, big and small, and tens of thousands of workers who rely on it directly and indirectly for their jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/13">The port of Belfast is also one of Northern Ireland's key infrastructure developers. It has facilitated some of Northern Ireland's most important economic urban regeneration projects, including the Odyssey complex, the Northern Ireland Science Park, Clarendon docks, Sydenham business park, Belfast city airport, which was built on port land, Hollywood exchange and, last but not least, Titanic quarter, where 25,000 homes will be built over the next 25 to 30 years. The total gross development value of Belfast harbour estate projects since 1991 is &pound;700 million. The Federation of Small Businesses made something of understatement when it said in a recent submission that it was questionable whether those sums and those projects could have been achieved under a totally public sector model of governance.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/14">As the port of Belfast has succeeded, so too has the Exchequer. I understand that in the past 10 years around &pound;34 million has been paid by the port in corporation tax and that &pound;10 million has been paid in rates by the port and the port's tenants&mdash;that is, people who have leased land off the port. I am told that, all in all, the port supports somewhere in the region of 175,000 jobs in industries not only right across Northern Ireland, but in a big slice of southern Irish territory as well. However, to deliver the regional economic growth that I and others in Belfast want, it is estimated that 69 per cent. more capacity is required in the next 19 to 20 years, to 2025.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/15">It is essential, not only for Belfast and Northern Ireland, but for the island of Ireland&mdash;particularly the northern half, within the Belfast port catchment area&mdash;that we move to achieve the capacity required to do the business. I see a major opportunity in the review for Belfast, Northern Ireland and the northern half of the island of Ireland finally to implement the Assembly's recommendations of five years ago and to allow the port to develop into a major strategic asset that can take the city of Belfast to a new level strategically and economically.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/16">One example of the strategic opportunity that exists is the potential for transatlantic freight. Ireland does not currently have a transatlantic freight terminal. However, as the economy continues to race ahead and the north finds it feet for the economic boom that can and will follow the restoration of devolution, the case for a transatlantic freight terminal on the island becomes more and more compelling. Realistically, there are only two sites for such a development, Belfast or Cork. I believe that the choice should be Belfast; there is no surprise in that. With the investment in the roads network between Belfast and Dublin, the port of Belfast can come genuinely to compete with the port of Dublin in both revenue and Ireland-wide importance. In many ways the port of Dublin is choked, and serious discussions are taking place about relocating it away from the city centre, because the large vehicles trying to access the port are in conflict with a city that is bursting with all sorts of new technology projects and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/17">That brings me back to the review. We must do whatever is necessary to ensure that the potential success is realised. The first and most obvious answer is that the port of Belfast and more generally all Northern Ireland trust ports require the end of public corporation status and the long-awaited granting of fuller commercial powers. It is widely recognised that public corporation status is incompatible with the commercial realities of running of a modern port, because it subjects organisations that are run in the commercial world to a public sector regime and the inherent Government controls that that entails. I am all in favour of transparency and openness, but it is vital that the ports should be freed up to do the job quickly and efficiently.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/18">Ports trade commercially, and they generate their incomes and finance capital expenditure commercially. They have no preferential access to public sector spending. Commercial operations are required to be flexible and agile, and ports need decision-making processes that are at odds with much of public sector control. Trust ports need to be fully accountable to the public, but that is achievable without labelling them with the wholly inappropriate title of public corporation. All the trust ports in Northern Ireland share that view, and I understand that they have provided detailed proposals to the Department for Transport on getting the balance right between accountability and financial flexibility. I call for those proposals to be adopted. It is vital that any conclusion drawn from the review should finally give the port of Belfast the commercial, managerial and financial freedoms that it requires to address the needs of the Northern Ireland economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/19">That is only half the story, however. I am concerned that the recent review also reopened a debate about what appears to be the privatisation of the port of Belfast land bank, creating the possibility of the port being stripped of its assets. However, free land in and around the port appears to be limited. Most if not all the land is tied up in leases lasting for 100 to 150 years from now. The concerns and anxiety about the implied threat has destabilised our situation. Access to that land is essential in the public interest. The port is a public organisation, and the public interest has to be kept at a high level.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/20">To those who wonder why the port of Belfast should be the city's largest land holder, I would say that the public interest in the harbour estate is protected by legislation enshrined in the previous Assembly. Again, much of the harbour estate was created at the port's own expense as the harbour extended. The port started small in the heart of the city, but as it needed deeper and deeper water it moved out and developed reclaimed land from Belfast lough. My figures suggest that 97 per cent. of the non-port land supports various forms of useful economic activity. Some 2 per cent. of the land was released for other uses in April 2006, and 1 per cent. is unusable. It would be wrong to interfere unnecessarily with the activities of the port and the success that it has been. Indeed, my opinion on that seems reflected and supported by no less an expert than the Minister with responsibility for shipping, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" name="Stephen Ladyman">the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)</phrase>, who said this to the ports policy review conference:</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/21" class="indent">&quot;We're not in the business of 'fixing things that ain't broke'. Any future policy will be grounded on the evidence of what does or doesn't work in practice.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/22">I say to that Minister, and his colleagues in the Northern Ireland Department of Regional Development, that the port of Belfast is not &quot;broke&quot;. It needs to be retuned and given more flexibility, freedom and scope to act commercially. It is delivering substantial benefits to the Northern Ireland economy and is well placed to gear up for future challenges. All Belfast wants is for the sentiment expressed by the Minister at the conference to apply equally to all UK ports. If that does not happen, the ability of Belfast port to prepare for and service the substantial anticipated economic growth will be hindered. In the short term, breaking up the port would yield some financial benefits but it would create obstacles in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/23">Massive investment will be required to build new quays, berths and deeper channels to accommodate growing international trade and a new generation of larger ships that, I hope, will use the port. The required investment will come relatively easily if the port has greater commercial agility and the ownership of the harbour estate is protected.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/24">At the beginning of my contribution, I remarked that until 50 years ago, Belfast was known as a centre for manufacturing and trade. If we make the correct decisions for the port now, Belfast will be able to resurrect itself as a centre for manufacturing and trade. Some 95 per cent. of all our trade is seaborne; I repeat that, by volume, Belfast handles 60 per cent. of Northern Ireland's trade and 20 per cent. of the whole island's trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/25">If time were available, I would add much more, but I shall leave the issue here. I call on the Minister to state whether he shares my vision of the potential of the port of Belfast. I welcome his views on the issue, whether he agrees with me or not, because we must have a serious debate on the port before any decisions are made that could put a positive and successful economic future at risk.</p>

	<p pid="a.237.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Williams. This is the first such occasion since you were elevated to the Chairmen's Panel. It is a pleasure to see you ensconced at the heart of the British establishment, where you definitely belong.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/2">It is also a pleasure to respond to the debate secured by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1402" name="Alasdair McDonnell">the Member for Belfast, South (Dr. McDonnell)</phrase>. I say right off the bat that I entirely share his vision of a thriving, prosperous and successful Belfast port and harbour. I entirely get the message that the harbour is important&mdash;and not only in its own economic terms, nor only for the economic development of south Belfast and the city of Belfast. It is vital to the economic development and future prosperity of the whole of Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/3">As my hon. Friend knows, we are now looking at the responses that came in as part of the ports review. I am bit constrained in outlining the way forward, because we need to consider what people have said as part of the consultation process. My hon. Friend's contribution today is an important part of that process and we shall take his points seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/4">At the beginning of his remarks, my hon. Friend spoke movingly about Belfast's proud industrial heritage and past and the centrality of the docks and port in building the city's prosperity in the last century. From my conversations with him on this subject here and in Belfast, my hon. Friend knows that I entirely share that vision of the importance of the port in the industrial present, not only the industrial past.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/5">Like my hon. Friend, I come from a port town&mdash;much smaller than Belfast&mdash;that has a proud shipbuilding history, now sadly almost gone. However, it continues to thrive as a port. People who, unlike me and my hon. Friend, do not have day-to-day dealings with ports and harbours simply do not understand their enormous commercial potential in this day and age. More and more freight is travelling the world on larger and larger vessels and more and more people are going on cruises and so on. The potential of ports is greater today than it has been for a long time. People who do not have many dealings with them do not understand that; they think that ports belong to the 19th century. My hon. Friend and I know that that is not the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/6">I should like to pay tribute to Frank Cushnahan, the outgoing chairman of the Belfast harbour commissioners, who has worked very hard during many years of involvement with Belfast. He is retiring, but only in the sense that he will not be chairman for much longer&mdash;he is certainly not &quot;retiring&quot; otherwise, but comes forward to express his views on what should happen in Belfast. He has done a great deal to advance the cause of the port of Belfast and I wish him a long and happy retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/7">I do not want to go over every bit of ground covered by my hon. Friend, but it is important to understand the scale of Belfast port and harbour to understand the seriousness of the decisions that the Government will have to make on its future and that of others in Northern Ireland. The eight miles of Belfast port's quays occupy 2,000 acres. The port has 1.2 million sq ft of warehousing and 100 acres of terminals. As my hon. Friend rightly reminded us, two thirds of Northern Ireland's seaborne trade and a quarter of that for Ireland as a whole is handled by the port. It is doing very well and going from strength to strength. It is the busiest ferry port in Northern Ireland, ferrying 1.2 million passengers, many of them lucky enough to be going to Scotland. I join my hon. Friend in paying tribute to the port for garnering the title of Irish port of the year at the recent awards ceremony.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/8">My hon. Friend is right to highlight the fact that standing still is not an option for the port of Belfast; this era of globalisation, developing trade, changing ship design and changing business processes means that the port has to evolve and change. My hon. Friend highlighted one model that he thinks would serve that change process, but there is no difference between us&mdash;we both believe that the port of Belfast, although currently successful, has great potential into which it can grow. We must find the right mechanism to unlock some of that potential and allow the port to flourish to an even greater extent.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/9">I am happy to acknowledge the Belfast harbour commissioners' response: their five-year, &pound;140 million capital expenditure programme, delivering new terminals, new logistics facilities and new container capacity. I look forward to seeing those developments emerge, albeit from this side of the water.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/10">Belfast port is successful, thriving and crucial to the well-being of Northern Ireland. In that context and as part of the review, we are giving consideration to the power, status and governance of the public trust ports such as Belfast to ensure that they are appropriate for their crucial role.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/11">Time is short, so I shall cut to the model raised by my hon. Friend: giving extended commercial powers to the port, as recommended by the Assembly and the Executive. My hon. Friend was fair enough to acknowledge that that was part of a package on tighter public accountability. He knows that all that was caught up in and affected by the ruling by the Office for National Statistics that certain trust ports should be considered as public corporations for public expenditure purposes. There is a dilemma at the heart of that: if ports are to remain public corporations, how do we give them greater commercial freedom while ensuring that there are public lines of accountability? That is one of the options outlined in the ports review and it is under consideration. It is not the only one; on this side of the water, there are many examples of privatised ports that do an excellent job of developing their facilities&mdash;and, in a sensitive way, the associated land bank&mdash;for the economic benefit of people who live around them. There is not simply one available model. We have to look at the special circumstances of Belfast port. We also have to ensure that we design a model that is appropriate to all the trust ports in Northern Ireland. Of course, the specific circumstances of Belfast port would automatically read across to the other trust ports, but it is the largest one and is absolutely central to this discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/12">The Government take seriously my hon. Friend's advice. We will reflect on the model that he proposed and in due course introduce plans that will unlock the greater potential of Belfast port, as we entirely share his vision for it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17a.241.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" speakername="Sally Keeble" colnum="241"  time="013:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061017/halltext/61017h0003.htm#06101743000509">
	<p pid="a.241.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" name="Paddy Tipping">the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase> for allowing me to speak in his Adjournment debate. In Northamptonshire, as he said, the decision was made by the Conservative-controlled county council to shut down the statutory youth service and outsource it to the independent and voluntary sector. The CYWU campaigned strongly against that and won a wide level of support from the general public, the churches, for example, and other organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.0/2">In principle I am not one of those who have a huge objection to outsourcing to the independent and voluntary sector. However, the CYWU's arguments in this case have all proved to be absolutely accurate. If something is to be outsourced and contracted to the independent and voluntary sector, there has to be a voluntary sector to contract with. In this instance, there simply was not. The areas that most need youth services are often those where the voluntary sector is least active. For example, in the Goldings and Overstone Lodge estates in my constituency, a door-to-door survey that I carried out with local residents showed that their highest need was for some youth facilities. It also showed a startling lack of access to services elsewhere in the town and constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.0/3">In Southfields estate, the one person who did all the youth work was unfortunately very elderly and died, and was profoundly missed by all of the young people. Some of the mothers and I held a mini-fun day on the estate during the school holidays to give the children something to do. I would rather do five night sittings on the trot than do one fun day on a difficult estate, because of the difficulty of the work. The mothers are determined to carry on and set up something, and all credit to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.0/4">I applaud the voluntary sector and the other parts of the statutory service for the work they do for young people. For example, the county's music and performing arts service, which my daughter has gone to since she was two years old, is astounding. Fantastic work is done for youth sports and an amazing job is done through the supplementary schools. However, there is a bit missing. We have to ensure that we target the areas of disadvantage. There is no point in hugging hoodies if we do not even have them in a room to hug.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.0/5">It is important that we have a youth service with a clear commitment to dealing with the issues of social disadvantage, which is given real guidance to ensure that that happens. That is what I fear is now sadly missing in my constituency. It is really important as things move forward, particularly as we get integrated budgets, that the need to tackle social disadvantage among young people and to reach difficult, excluded young people is clearly carried out in the interests of our communities. I am grateful to have had the chance to make this point.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17a.246.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" speakername="Anne Main" colnum="246"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061017/halltext/61017h0004.htm#06101743000511">
	<p pid="a.246.1/1">This is not a debate about the desirability of getting freight off our roads, hence the formation of the title. It is a debate about the necessity of ensuring that rail freight locations are correctly located in areas well served by direct transport, road and rail links, and with minimum impact on local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/2">This is not about nimbyism. I want to stress the need for a truly critical appraisal of the merits of locating a large industrial facility in the green belt accessed off local roads in areas of acknowledged traffic congestion, poor air quality and noise pollution. In fact the Department of Health's own 2006 health profile for St. Albans accepts that our local air quality rating is below the accepted England average. The Radlett area is a particular hot spot that contributes significantly to that poor rating. I am seeking to outline to the Minister why this particular proposal is an inappropriate development. It is at an early stage, but I feel that I ought to make the case for our communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/3">The district council has already allocated &pound;500,000 of taxpayers' money to fight this proposal and given my concerns, the views of the county council and the regional planning committee, which I will seek to highlight later in my speech, I am asking the Minister to call this decision in at the earliest possible stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/4">I am sure that the Minister agrees that this proposal must be robustly scrutinised in terms of strict planning criteria and not pushed through as a result of a desire by the Government to locate up to four new interchange sites around a London hub. We must move away from the positive rhetoric of the developer Helioslough as its proposals seek to gloss over the real impact of this development and do not adequately address concerns over the impact of increased traffic and green belt requirements. The proposals also fail to fulfil locational requirements of the Strategic Rail Authority's rail freight interchange policy document, paragraph 4.2 of which states:</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Strategic RFIs tend to be large commercial operations which...may not be considered suitable adjacent to uses such as residential which may be sensitive to the impact of noise and movements&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/6">Park Street is a village and access from the site will be directly adjacent to residential homes and along village roads. I, like many people, am in favour of getting freight off our roads, but strategic rail freight interchanges must be appropriately located. This former gravel working is a metropolitan green belt site that ought to be returned to an acceptable amenity for local residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/7">The Minister said in response to my question of <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-11">11 October</phrase> about maintaining the integrity of the green belt that</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/8" class="indent">&quot;it should be altered only in exceptional circumstances.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/9">She went on to say that</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/10" class="indent">&quot;the Government are currently considering the report of the independent Panel...The Panel recommends that the general extent of the Metropolitan Green Belt in Hertfordshire and Essex...should be maintained.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-10-11.743"><i>Official Report</i>, 11 October 2006; Vol. 450, c. 743W</phrase>.]</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-17a.247.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" speakername="Anne Main" colnum="247"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061017/halltext/61017h0004.htm#06101743000513">
	<p pid="a.247.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. One of the important aspects of the green belt is to stop the coalescing of smaller communities and that facility will indeed be lost should the site be developed in that particular way.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/2">Helioslough&mdash;the proposed developer&mdash;maintains that its study on the site shows that Radlett is an optimum site with regard to location. That may be its opinion as a result of its own study, but a county development control report released on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-16">Monday 16 October</phrase> profoundly disagrees with that assertion. It states that the developers' study is not robust and that</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/3" class="indent">&quot;officers are also of the view that a location North of London is not that preferred to handle anticipated demand for rail freight which is forecast to arise largely from Haven and Thames ports and Southampton and the Channel Tunnel&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/4">It concludes that</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/5" class="indent">&quot;for these reasons the very special circumstances that would be necessary to warrant the release of this Green Belt site are considered not to have been adequately demonstrated by the applicant.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/6">It is not just local people who believe that this green belt site is strategically important. The report says that the site has not demonstrated any real reasons to show it should be treated as an exceptional circumstance. The regional planning sub-committee report also agrees with that conclusion on the green belt, adding that</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/7" class="indent">&quot;the application is therefore not consistent with Policies SS7 and LA1 of the Draft east of England Plan&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/8">The Radlett site proposes a large 3.5 million sq ft strategic rail interchange, warehousing ancillary office developments served by the rail sidings linked to the slow up-line&mdash;the midland main line&mdash;with no direct motorway access. I do not wish to go on about access on the rail line because it has not actually been demonstrated that the site will get the additional capacity or access to it: that is a transport issue, not the issue I am dealing with at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/9">There is no direct motorway access and all road access from the new signalised roundabout on the north orbital will be off the A414. A direct road access link for the proposal has already been refused and deemed unacceptable by the highways authority, so all new and existing traffic must still use local roads.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/10">County development control's view in a report to the director for the environment is that the A414, which will provide the access point,</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/11" class="indent">&quot;is already an extremely busy road with flows on this section some of the highest non motorway flows in the county. The applicant shows that a fully operational SRFI would add around 12% to existing flows. Typically a traffic increase of 5% is considered to be a material increase and therefore this development is likely to have a significant impact on the road network.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/12">That would have a huge and detrimental impact on local road networks.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/13">A report from the regional planning sub-committee dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-06">6 October</phrase> said that</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/14" class="indent">&quot;on the evidence presented so far it is not clear that sufficient capacity could be released on the strategic highway network and hence is not consistent to the policy T3 for access.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/15">Again, an excellent planning reason to turn the proposal down.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/16">The impact on the local roundabouts is less well defined in the developer's proposals, but the county report says, from the scanty recommendations that are in the developer's proposals, that</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/17" class="indent">&quot;officers are not satisfied that the solutions offered will prove acceptable in either congestion capacity or safety terms.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/18">It is also worth noting that in the health outcomes for St. Albans, we have some of the highest road traffic incidents, which is above the national average.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/19">Work by the Highways Agency for the regional spatial strategy examination in public showed that specific congestion issues were anticipated for this part of Hertfordshire. Without the proposal, we are still anticipating a massive impact on congestion, and the proposal will only add to that in a detrimental way. The A414 in particular, which will provide the access point, was highlighted as creating congestion issues. Any highways problems that already occur on the M25, and they are numerous, cause rat running and severe additional congestion. The addition of thousands of extra lorries trying to access the site would cause mayhem beyond comprehension.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/20">The traffic implications beyond the two roundabouts that feature heavily in the developer's application are also important. The developer seems to conveniently forget that this will impact on the whole of St. Albans and my hon. Friend's constituency as well. It is not just a Park Street and Radlett proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/21">The Highways Agency does look further afield and is concerned about the junctions where traffic joins the trunk road networks: junction 21A and 22 on the M25 and junction 3 of the A1(M). As a result of those concerns, the Highways Agency has already issued a holding objection to the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/22">The proposed Park Street bypass, which has long been argued for by local residents, is a key part of this scheme. Unfortunately, that will not deliver the bypass scheme the residents wanted in order to get the lorries that are already there out of Park Street and eliminate the traffic that clogs the village. It will have no impact on the traffic concerns of the Highways Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/23">With regard to alleviating traffic within the village, it could be possible, for example, to exclude heavy goods vehicle traffic from Park Street and Frogmore, but the impact on HGVs that currently use Harper lane, the B556, to access junction 22 of the M25 and on all related local car movements will not be addressed by any bypass proposed for this application and therefore it does not address current traffic concerns and will only add to them. That remains a valid concern and was accepted by the highways authority in its report.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/24">Point 17.9 of the county development report, that</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/25" class="indent">&quot;the level of benefit in traffic reduction has not been proven&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/26">fully supports the residents' views of the application. According to point 17.10, the county council is not convinced at this stage that the proposed mitigation measures are adequate to address the problem. Nor are the environmental implications for Radlett and Elstree fully addressed. Overall, the report recommends refusal of the application.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/27">The employment forecast to do with strategic rail freight interchanges is usually heralded as a good thing. The forecast for this proposal is 3,500 employees, but more than 50 per cent. of the staff are expected to live outside Hertfordshire. The employment gains will be greater than the level of supply in the local area, which is not a priority area for regeneration. There will be little economic benefit to the local area, merely increases in traffic congestion as people try to get to work on already congested roads. In fact, the site is deemed to be poorly located to attract necessary staff. Many of them will be unable to live locally due to the constraints of the village and the fact that house prices are extremely high, and many will be low-paid workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/28">Point 5.6 of the regional report concludes:</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/29" class="indent">&quot;Other locations may fit better with the regional policies on regeneration and not require the length of commuting of this site.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/30">This is vital. If the Government truly wish to get traffic off our roads, they must ensure that they are not busing and ferrying in people from other areas just because they say that they want to get freight off the roads.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/31">Contrary to the developers' proposals, the county believes that for the developers to suggest that existing or improved local transport services will serve 67 per cent. of potential employee catchment areas is not credible in practical terms. There has been an attempt to advance a case as to how bicycle and bus services could be improved, but none of the proposals has been deemed credible. The document also states:</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/32" class="indent">&quot;The target non car mode share for journeys to work of 35 per cent. is considered unachievable on the evidence presented...With no evidence that practical difficulties can be overcome.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/33">All that means that the proposal does not, cannot and probably never will meet planning policy guidance note 13 requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/34">Again, I question the developers' proposals, which I know the Minister will have on her desk in the not-too-distant future. The highly selective theoretical noise projection tables included in the proposal include no actual noise readings from the seven existing rail freight interchange sites. I myself have stood in Park Street with a monitor and I can tell the Minister that noise levels already well exceed the European decibel levels. Supporting data for traffic generation were helpfully gleaned from the Daventry site, but noise readings were not included. I feel that that was possibly because they would do little to bolster the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/35">The noise calculations are based on the questionable theoretical premise that there will be an 89 per cent. decrease in traffic flow through Park Street. I dealt with that earlier. In fact, the majority of traffic that currently goes through Park Street will not be tempted to use the bypass. The bypass will merely serve as a link road into the site for people working on the site. The figures for decreased traffic flow through Park Street and Frogmore are questioned by both county and region in their reports. I know that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1634" name="James Clappison">the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison)</phrase> has massive concerns, as do many Radlett residents, who feel that the traffic impacts may well be much greater.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/36">How can it be possible to direct not only HGV traffic but all traffic going east on the M25 or north via the M10/Ml through the strategic rail freight interchange and then make it turn left on to the A414 and come all the way back to the Park Street roundabout? Logic suggests that local roads will see a massive increase in rat-running to avoid the detours.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/37">I seek assurances from the Minister today that she will not take at face value the blithe assurances on the part of the developer that the scheme will benefit the area. In fact, it will have a catastrophic impact. It is completely contrary to green belt policy. It fails on many transport accounts, and the residents are looking to the Minister to take an objective planning decision on the proposal where it fails on all accounts. I would welcome assurances from her on how much weight she will place on the views of local people, the local district and county councils&mdash;the district has yet to express a view on this; it has a hearing on it on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-01">1 November</phrase>&mdash;and the regional planning committee, which I have quoted extensively. I trust that when she has examined all their evidence, she will robustly reject the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.1/38">May I add a footnote to that? It has cost so much money to fight these large developers. Local authorities feel totally disadvantaged in their fight against massive, inappropriate development that they believe the Government wish to sanction or rubber-stamp. I am looking to the Minister to give us absolute assurances that that will not be the case in this matter.</p>
