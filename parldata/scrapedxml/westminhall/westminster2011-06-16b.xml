	<p pid="b.328.2/1">I very much agree with my right hon. Friend&#8217;s point. There is concern across the sector, in higher and further education, in language schools, and, indeed, across the whole country. Judging by hon. Members present today, I am sure that will be reflected in the contributions to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.328.2/2">I do not believe that the Government are deliberately seeking to damage the economy through these measures, but, by their own assessment, that will be the effect. Over the past few weeks, Ministers have told us that good government is about listening, pausing the legislative process and making changes to get things right. Student visas are another issue where changes are needed to get things right, so let me move to the areas that I believe need attention. First, on English language requirements, my point is not about fundamental change to the Government&#8217;s proposals, but about getting implementation right. Let me start with universities. The UK Border Agency&#8217;s statement of intent for the new system, which was published in March, stated that:</p>
	<p pid="b.328.2/3">&#8220;We will allow higher education institutions to choose their own method of assessing the English language competence at B2 level.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.328.2/4">However, the subsequent UKBA clarification document, which was issued in April, requires higher education institutions to demonstrate B2 levels of competence in all four components. It also says that, if there is any</p>
	<p pid="b.328.2/5">doubt about a student&#8217;s language, UKBA is likely to ask them to undertake their own approved tests&#8212;it is a crucial point&#8212;even if the institution has made an unconditional offer. That clearly conflicts with UKBA&#8217;s own statement of intent. In my constituency, Sheffield&#8217;s universities accept only students with good English, but they do not currently require students to meet the specific subset scores now demanded by UKBA; they do not need to.</p>
	<p pid="b.328.2/6">Only this week I was talking to the vice-chancellor of the university of Sheffield. He gave me the example of what he described as a brilliant physics PhD student who had contributed enormously to one of his research groups, but who probably would not have passed the language requirements.</p>

	<p pid="b.329.2/1">My hon. Friend is making an excellent speech. He talks about the offers that universities have made that may now have to be withdrawn. The vice-chancellor of the Manchester metropolitan university, whose views will be very similar to those of people up and down the land, said to me that he is now in the difficult position of having</p>
	<p pid="b.329.2/2">&#8220;to notify students who have accepted offers that they must now meet new conditions. We are also concerned about the legal ramifications of altering the terms of offers already accepted.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.331.5/1">That is a helpful observation from my hon. Friend. Will the Minister cover that point in his later remarks?</p>
	<p pid="b.331.5/2">May I raise another transitional problem that was mentioned to me by the academic director of Sheffield international college regarding its preparatory programmes for the university? Sheffield international college provides pathways programmes. About 600 of its students each year go on to one of our universities in Sheffield. These</p>
	<p pid="b.331.5/3">students came to the UK with a conditional offer to proceed to the university of Sheffield if they succeeded with their language course at Sheffield international college.</p>
	<p pid="b.331.5/4">They arrived in good faith but now face a change that has required a small number of them to sit additional English exams in their final term so that they can renew their visa. The new regulations require minimum levels of achievement in elements of the English language test that were not required on the students&#8217; entry to the UK. Consequently, they find themselves in the final term of their programme working hard to try to stay in the UK to complete it rather than working hard to achieve their conditional requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.331.5/5">In addition, the new requirements came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-21">21 April</phrase>, during the Easter break, and that has reduced the amount of time that some students have had to fulfil them. Earlier this week, I was contacted by Sheffield international college about four Chinese students in my constituency whose visas expired yesterday. For the past seven weeks, the college has been trying frantically to arrange for the students to sit the new tests, in different places across the country, before their visas expired. The students understand that they have to pass these new tests so that they can apply to extend their visas, but it has not been possible for them to sit the tests because the UKBA testing system has been unable to offer a sufficient number of tests. The system simply cannot match the demand that has been created by the chaos caused by the revisions of the visa requirements. In turn, that has led to three of the students at the college deciding to return to China this weekend. They have been unable to complete their course, their year of study has been wasted and potentially they will be unable to progress on their degree programmes. How many other students are there across the country in a similar situation and what reputational damage does all that do to UK education internationally?</p>

	<p pid="b.333.1/1">My hon. Friend is making a very good case, assisted by the fact that there are about 25 Members here to support him and also by the fact that the Minister has had to intervene regularly to try to clarify the Government&#8217;s position.</p>
	<p pid="b.333.1/2">My hon. Friend has identified two specific problems. First, I have several language schools and other schools in my constituency that are suffering, so I know that there is great competition internationally in this field. We were ahead of the game and now we are behind it. That is causing not only reputational damage but genuine economic damage to very good schools, which may go under because the Government are sending out all the wrong signals.</p>
	<p pid="b.333.1/3">Secondly, I received an email from Leiths cookery school, which is in my constituency. It was told two months ago that instead of 20 places for non-EU residents, it would have only three. That makes not only a big business difference but a big culinary difference to that school. <i>[</i> <i>Laughter.</i> <i>]</i> We are now becoming a bit of a laughing stock in the international market because the Government are constantly chopping and changing in accordance with a political agenda, which is undermining education in this country.</p>

	<p pid="b.334.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. That view has certainly been expressed to me on many occasions by many vice-chancellors. It also reflects my own experience of working with international students. As I said earlier, this is a market in which we have been spectacularly successful, growing our world share of it from 1% to 11% at the same time as the USA&#8217;s world share of it dropped. One of the contributory factors in that decline in the USA&#8217;s world share was the way in which the USA messed around with its own visa requirements during that time.</p>

	<p pid="b.335.1/1">I very much agree with my right hon. Friend. I have talked to companies in Sheffield, and they say that the opportunity to have some of the best intellectual talent in the world working with them in product development and improving manufacturing processes is a startling benefit that our city gets from its two universities.</p>
	<p pid="b.335.1/2">I will move on to the specifics of an area that the Government have seen as problematic: the post-study work route. I understand, unless there are more changes that the Minister wants to share, that under the new proposals international graduates of UK universities will, from April 2012, need a confirmed job offer for a graduate level role&#8212;that is fair enough&#8212;but which pays at least &#163;20,000, and they will need to apply for a tier 2 visa for the job before their tier 4 visa expires. There is nothing wrong with limiting work to that of a graduate level, but the imposition of a &#163;20,000 salary threshold is too restrictive for some sectors and regions. Sheffield university tells me that its average graduate starting salary falls below &#163;20,000: in arts and humanities it is &#163;16,600, in pure science it is &#163;16,100 and in social sciences it is &#163;18,000. According to the graduate employer survey 2011, graduates in Yorkshire should generally expect a starting salary of between &#163;15,000 and &#163;18,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.335.1/3">One of Sheffield university&#8217;s strengths is architecture. The students&#8217; union international students&#8217; officer, Mina Kasherova, in written evidence to the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee, highlighted the problems facing architects: they need to gain work experience after graduation to obtain their professional qualification, but they will not be able to get such a post with a salary of more than &#163;20,000 through tier 2.</p>

	<p pid="b.339.1/1">The Chairman of the Select Committee makes his point in his normal charming and intelligent way. My wider point, which he anticipates, is that the former Government made no effort to anticipate EU and non-EU immigration. Indeed, it has recently come to light that they suppressed research commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government, which looked at some, although not all, of the negative consequences of large-scale migration.</p>
	<p pid="b.339.1/2">All I am asking in considering the specific and narrow point about tier 4 student visas is that we genuinely look at the cost-benefit analysis for the wider community. Yes, we can argue about nuances and value judgments made by individual higher education institutions, but at the same time we must concede that within the wider policy framework, these decisions, which are essentially about large-scale migration, have wider ramifications. That is consistent with the Government&#8217;s view that we must move away from the inexorable conveyor belt towards a population that will be significantly greater within 25 years than the population of Germany or France, for example.</p>
	<p pid="b.339.1/3">The policy has been flexible and there has been appropriate consultation. It is aimed principally at bogus students and overstayers. I would like to see the evidence that HE institutions will be adversely affected, because the level of graduate unemployment across all disciplines in the UK stands at something like 20%, which is pertinent when considering public policy on the recruitment of international students who might stay to work after the conclusion of their studies. That is fair. If we look the fees regime and at how financial arrangements for universities will progress over the next few years and measure that against demand, we see that because of our reputation and because we have the kudos of being a principal centre of superb higher education in the world, the demand for people across the world will remain high, whether for chemical engineering, languages, dentistry or humanities.</p>

	<p pid="b.343.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The Home Affairs Committee held a big meeting in Brighton with local MPs from various parties, including the Green party, the Conservative party and the Liberal Democrats, and they were all against the Government&#8217;s proposals due to the damage that they will cause to English language colleges. In many cases, such colleges are the pathway to full-time degrees. It is extremely important that we focus on them as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.343.1/2">However, we must be absolutely tough on bogus colleges. We have suggested two ways for that to happen. Unannounced inspections by the UK Border Agency are necessary. In the past, the UK Border Agency rang up colleges and told them that inspectors were coming. By the time they arrived, all of a sudden&#8212;like &#8220;Mission: Impossible&#8221;, for those who are old enough to remember it&#8212;a whole lot of students and teachers had been brought in for the inspectors to see. How crazy is it to tell a bogus college that it is about to be inspected?</p>
	<p pid="b.343.1/3">I had a call from a Conservative councillor in a London borough who preferred to ring up the Home Affairs Committee rather than the UK Border Agency to tell us that there was a new bogus college operating in</p>
	<p pid="b.343.1/4">her ward. On Monday, I sent my research assistant to the college. She rang up and said that she was a student and wished to enrol on the course. They said, &#8220;Right, come along at 10 o&#8217;clock and we&#8217;ll give you a brochure.&#8221; She arrived, and there was absolutely nobody in the college. She stood outside and rang them again. They said that they were not open yet, but would be in September, and that they had applied to the Home Office. I have a letter for the Minister. I hope that he will check whether that is in fact the case, so that I can tell the hard-working local councillor whether that college is bogus.</p>
	<p pid="b.343.1/5">We need proper inspections. Nobody in the Chamber has a tolerance of bogus colleges. We want to ensure that they are closed down, because they are bad for the students who go there. The second point on bogus colleges and abuse relates to the points-based system that the previous Government introduced. The system gives no discretion to entry clearance officers and immigration officers at Heathrow airport. It is left to whistleblowers to go to the <i>Daily Mail</i> and say that we let in all these people who had student visas who do not actually speak any English, but are doing computer courses&#8212;I think that was the last claim that we saw in one of the newspapers. We need to give discretion to our professionals. The points-based system is absolute and clear, but that extra bit of discretion is necessary to enable the entry clearance officers to say yes and no, even if people qualify under the points-based system, and to give immigration officers the authority to make those decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.343.1/6">My final point is one that I raised with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40525" name="Paul Blomfield">the hon. Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield)</phrase>, and I join other hon. Members in congratulating him on securing the debate. I know that he has been trying to do so for many months. He was offered a shorter slot. He said that many people were interested in the issue, hung on and we can see the number of hon. Members who are here today. I congratulate my hon. Friend on hanging on long enough to secure a good three hour debate. I will not speak for long because other hon. Members wish to speak.</p>
	<p pid="b.343.1/7">The Home Affairs Committee report concluded that students were not migrants, and should not be part of the figures. They are not migrants because they come to study, not to settle. Of course, the Minister will come out with his figures and say that he finds that some settle in the end, because they keep applying to change their courses. Well, I for one have no problem with non-switching. I am not a great fan of people who come on the basis of one set of visas and want to switch to another.</p>
	<p pid="b.343.1/8">I do not know whether it happened during the term of office of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40527" name="David Blunkett">the Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough (Mr Blunkett)</phrase>, but the previous Labour Government stopped the switching from visitors to spouses. I therefore have to tell my constituents that, if people come here on holiday and fall in love with a British citizen, I am afraid that they have to go back and apply again. The previous Labour Government provided for that. I have no major problem with switching, but we need to be very clear. It is more of a systemic problem than one of intention. If there is a problem of intention, we can deal with it by preventing switching.</p>
	<p pid="b.343.1/9">We should not, however, damage our university and English language sector by accusing all students of wanting to come here, study and stay. That is why what my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield Central said about post-work study is so important. When they choose to come here, they also choose to work for that year, and that is essential to their studies. If they do not come here, they will go to the United States of America, Australia or France.</p>
	<p pid="b.343.1/10">The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40600" name="Jeremy Browne">the hon. Member for Taunton Deane (Mr Browne)</phrase>, gave evidence to us, as I think he did to the Committee chaired by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40647" name="Adrian Bailey">the Member for West Bromwich West (Mr Bailey)</phrase>. He talked about Britain being the centre of world for education. He told us about Nottingham university and how he personally, because of his interest in Malaysia, had gone to Malaysia and got thousands of Malaysian students to study in Nottingham. Indeed, there is a campus just for Malaysian students. He was very proud of that. We cannot have one Minister saying that we are open to the world and then have other Ministers trying to prevent that from happening.</p>
	<p pid="b.343.1/11">I hope that the Minister will not say that the UN tells him that the students are migrants, and so they have to be migrants. If they are not migrants and they wish just to study and then leave, they should not be counted as migrants. If they are working illegally or there is any abuse, I say to the Minister for Immigration&#8212;I know that he will take this seriously, and has taken this seriously&#8212;out they go. There is no tolerance of people who abuse the system. I have just come back from a visit to the Greek-Turkish border, where I saw people who are trying to come into this country, crossing over at an enormous rate. I, for one, am very happy to work with the Government and others to try to stop illegal immigration.</p>
	<p pid="b.343.1/12">When we are dealing with people who genuinely want to come to study, the Government should stop, consider and reflect, because of the potential damage to our reputation as the greatest country in the world for education. That reputation was the reason why my family chose to come here when I was nine years of age. They chose to come here because of this country&#8217;s reputation for valuing education. Let us not damage our reputation. Let us make sure that our rules and policies are clear and transparent, but fair.</p>

	<p pid="b.345.0/1">It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Benton, and to speak in the debate secured by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40525" name="Paul Blomfield">the hon. Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield)</phrase>. He made an articulate speech which raised a number of points, which I am sure the Minister will consider. I think that he will find support across the House on some points. Other points might be a little more contentious, but we look forward to hearing his comments.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/2">Mr Benton, I must ask for your forgiveness and that of other hon. Members, as I will not be able to stay for the closing remarks from the Minister. I have a good reason, which allows me to highlight what is perhaps a contrarian point. I am meeting representatives from the Taiwanese embassy equivalent to talk about a visit by Taiwanese students to the university of Bedfordshire in</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/3">my constituency of Bedford, which includes Kempston. Some Opposition Members talked about the importance of having people come from mainland China. We all have to make our choice of Chinas. I tend to prefer those that have elections and do not lock up Nobel prize winners. The issue with Taiwan that is important to mention is that we have simplified immigration rules for Taiwanese students to come to study here. It is precisely because the controls and understandings that Taiwan has in sending students overseas are so well administered that we have confidence in the country that is sending, as well as the country&#8212;the UK&#8212;that is receiving. It will be a great pleasure to welcome them.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/4">We have a responsibility to weigh up two major factors, which have come through the different contributions: restoring people&#8217;s confidence in our immigration system and controls; and ensuring that we are optimising and maximising the opportunity to enhance the economic well-being of our universities, and the role that our open educational system can play to spread freedom, democracy, belief in the rule of law, understanding of free markets, and the belief that every citizen&#8217;s rights have to be recognised in all parts of the world. That is an important and critical role that our universities play. As I am leaving shortly, I will address those two areas quickly.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40479" name="Stewart Jackson">the Member for Peterborough (Mr Jackson)</phrase> mentioned that immigration control is a significant responsibility for the Government. If we do not believe that, then I do not think that any of us knocked on doors at the general election. It was raised as a concern by many residents. There was exasperation at how the system had got out of control under the previous Government. Both the previous Government and this Government sought to bring in controls. We are still dealing with an issue where people&#8217;s confidence has not yet been restored. I urge the Minister, in response to all the hon. Members he will hear from today, not to lose sight of the fact that he has a significant responsibility to ensure that people&#8217;s confidence in our immigration system is restored. He and his colleagues in the Home Office have made a very good start, but he has to see it through to the end. That sometimes requires very tough decisions. I urge him strongly to continue all the way through this period of office, and I congratulate him on the steps that he has taken.</p>

	<p pid="b.347.1/1">The hon. Lady makes a good point about the transitional arrangements this year. She has heard an answer from the Minister on that and I am sure that he will address the matter again when dealing</p>
	<p pid="b.347.1/2">with some of the follow-up concerns raised by the hon. Member for Sheffield Central. That is a particular issue on which I am looking forward to hearing the Minister&#8217;s comments.</p>
	<p pid="b.347.1/3">More generally, on Opposition Members&#8217; calls for caution, when we are looking for change, caution is not always the best way to proceed. It is important to deal with the matter clearly and cleanly, so that the people who are responsible for building business models do not have to anticipate future changes. Such an approach is helpful to them when setting their strategy. Being cautious is not always the best approach. In this instance, given my and other hon. Members&#8217; concerns about the importance of getting peoples&#8217; confidence back in immigration, obtaining clarity quickly will be of benefit to the long-term strategy of our higher education institutions and our universities. They need to have an integrated strategy, so that they know the Government&#8217;s direction of travel. They need an understanding between the Home Office and BIS to make that happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.347.1/4">My message to the Minister is, first, that he has a responsibility to fix immigration. That is what the British people asked for at the last general election and that is what they are looking to the Home Secretary and the Minister to accomplish. I urge him to put everything he does through that lens, rather than through the particular lens of each issue. Secondly, he has heard from hon. Members on the issue of whether students are migrants or not. It may be worth considering what happens in the United States and the United Nations. Some of us prefer the approach of the United States to that of the United Nations. Will the Minister look at that as part of setting an overall strategy, as it would be interesting and worth while to do so?</p>
	<p pid="b.347.1/5">On the transitional arrangements that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40557" name="Andrew Selous">the Member for South West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> and others mentioned, again, the Minister has given an answer and I look forward to him expanding on that in his closing comments. I urge the Government to have an integrated, international higher education policy. We have a fantastic country. We have to bring people here, so that we can spread a message of freedom and spread understanding of the English language. We must give people Shakespeare and give people an understanding of the Magna Carta. If we do those things, we will have a country that can not only interact, but sell to the rest of the world.</p>

	<p pid="b.348.0/1">For the avoidance of doubt, I had better declare an interest. From time to time, I receive remuneration from the higher education sector for work I do with it. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40525" name="Paul Blomfield">the Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield)</phrase> on securing the debate.

	<p pid="b.348.0/3">to those colleges and institutions that either do not exist or, if they do, do not provide what they say on the can they offer. In addition, such institutions do not offer courses of sufficient quality to students of sufficient quality.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/4">Those two aspects are getting slightly mixed up, although that is not because the first matter is not important. To coin a phrase from the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, I certainly have scars on my back from the near four years I was Home Secretary in terms of the two major pieces of legislation that we introduced and the changes we made. That included the two-thirds reduction in asylum, the security and immigration provisions on French soil, the measures regarding liaison officers at airports across the world and a substantial tightening up of how we operated visas. Such policies provided a foundation on which my Government subsequently built and this Government have been building. The issue is incremental. If we take a step in one direction, we find that the plastic bottle has bulged out in another. I suggest to the Minister, who is deeply committed to this matter, that immigration will affect this Government, as it did previous ones.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/5">As the issue has been mentioned, I would like to say how much I agree with my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">the Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase> about embarkation and e-Borders. I was responsible for kick-starting e-Borders, but I claim no credit or discredit whatsoever for the contract that was let. In fact, when the 20-year rule comes in, there will be letters on file from me as a Back Bencher advising against what was done. The speed of operation to get this right is critical because, if we do not know who is leaving, we really cannot make a judgment about whether the system is working. That applies directly to students who have fulfilled their courses and/or their term afterwards for permission to work. If the system is working properly, much of what we are debating would be seen in that broader context, and we would not be so obsessed with artificial targets for future migrants. We would be able to deal with the issue of what a migrant actually is and provide a proper definition in a way that removes the harder edge of politics.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/6">It is inevitable that there will be politics involved in discussions on immigration. We might then debate issues and not end up with policies that damage the country, rather than enhance its well-being. I do not intend to repeat what has already been expressed, because time is pushing on and extremely good points have been made. Even those points that I have doubts about have been enlightening. I would, however, like to reinforce some of the key points that have emerged.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/7">First, the economic value to this country is not just the money that comes into the universities or the local community, but the way in which those who have benefited from both the study in and the experience of our country add to our potential economic value in years to come, as they become the advocates for Britain and part of global institutions and enterprises, whose connection with and alumni from our institutions make an enormous difference to Britain in this global economy and international trading world.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/8">Secondly, to take up the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40479" name="Stewart Jackson">the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr Jackson)</phrase>, our universities are able to offer that social responsibility much better if</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/9">they have a higher level of agreed income. The income that is coming in from overseas, free as it is from issues of debt repayment and the difficulties that we have debated over recent months, adds to a university&#8217;s ability to contribute to the wider community and the social well-being of our country. The issue is much broader than whether the university itself has an enhanced income, important as that is.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/10">Thirdly, there is an issue about whether we really want numbers of legitimate, verified students, with the right qualifications in the right quality of institution, in this country. If we listen carefully to the debate, we will hear that everyone pays lip service to the importance of legitimate students coming here, but we then hear a different nuance, namely, &#8220;But they are foreigners and that is dangerous, because our electorate do not really like foreigners.&#8221; We need to get off that and on to where migration policy has not worked properly&#8212;even the measures for which I was responsible did not always work&#8212;and the importance of enforcement. We need proper inspection and enforcement, including clamping down on those colleges that do not really exist or are just an excuse for people to get into the country. Moreover, if our legitimate university and higher education institutions, both in the public and the embryo private sector, are not checking whether students are taking up their courses, enforcement is the crucial element. That is the end at which we need to ensure that we get this right, rather than trying to reduce, per se, the number of legitimate students coming into the country. That is critical.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/11">In 2000, I led a delegation, which included the Higher Education Funding Council and this country&#8217;s leading universities, to China. The Chinese welcomed us and were very pleased to have a two-way arrangement with us that includes students coming on a temporary basis to learn our language and to learn about our systems. That was a good thing to do, and anything that damages it would be a major mistake.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/12">That brings me to my central point. It is the message we send that is absolutely critical, and the message that has been received outside this country is the wrong one. It is not that we want to avoid the illegitimate, the unacceptable and the fraudulent, either in terms of the provision in our country or of those coming in for reasons other than to study properly. The message that is being received outside this country, as has already been said, is, &#8220;You will not be welcome.&#8221; Will the Minister do everything possible, along with our embassies and high commissions, to change the message, so that it is received properly and understood by students and industry? Sponsored students are very important, and major enterprises across the world need to know that their potential employees, or those who are sponsored by them, are welcome in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/13">I want to touch briefly on the complications that we face. Many of them could be overcome if there was greater flexibility in the transition period&#8212;there is no question about that. It is no good for the Minister, who intervened on my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield Central, to say that, if firm offers were made before <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-21">21 April</phrase>, certificates would be honoured. As was pointed out almost immediately, many of those offers are conditional and do not therefore apply. In some sectors, including professional bodies and professional courses, the number of certificates has been capped arbitrarily, sometimes at levels including those that have been taken on from institutions that no longer exist or have been</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/14">deregulated. They have, therefore, been punished for picking up students who were badly treated by those that did not come up to standard.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/15">I would like us to address why we do not use highly trusted sponsor status and the oversight mechanisms of professional and private sector operators, which will now be operated by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education&#8212;I congratulate it on the speed with which it has moved&#8212;rather than a complicated system that does not rely on enforcement and inspection, but on the front end rather than the back end. To complicate matters, it is crucial&#8212;this has been said by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" name="Richard Fuller">the hon. Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase>&#8212;that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills gets its act together with the Home Office, so that they speak the same language and that those with expertise share it. For instance, on professional qualifications for accountancy, why suddenly drop in, as the statement and assessment did on Monday, that there has to be approval at gold or platinum level by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, when it has preferred providers of its own? These professional qualifications are a bit like the guild system in mediaeval England.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/16">I counsel the Minister to be very careful not to get involved in what is corporatism. For somebody who is a declared libertarian, that is a dangerous position to be in. We should not put into the hands of those who have a specific interest in particular providers the ability to exclude other providers. That is a dangerous game in terms of the kind of oversight that we would expect.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/17">In brief, I do not think that any Member present does not think that it is a good idea to progress on the road of tightening up in relation to those who have been fraudulently operating the system or those who come here and are not legitimate students. Let us all agree on that. We might even agree that those of us who tried in the past did not come up to scratch in achieving the goals that we set ourselves. A little humility from all of us on that might not be amiss. It is important that the lessons of history are learnt: sometimes, speed leads to the obverse of the objective that is sought, and a little give and take&#8212;sensibly, openly and without criticism when people are flexible, so that we give the Minister a bit of leeway&#8212;might achieve the overall goal that he and, I believe, BIS seek, namely a system that works and welcomes people into this country, because it is good for our economy, good for our social life and good for the future of Britain.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-06-16b.352.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40239" speakername="Mark Lazarowicz" colnum="352"  time="016:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110616/halltext/110616h0001.htm#11061633000295">
	<p pid="b.352.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship today, Mr Benton. I am glad to have the opportunity to</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/2">speak in this debate on student visas, which is an issue of importance not only to the ancient university of Edinburgh but to the other three universities in my city, Heriot-Watt, Napier and Queen Margaret. There are also implications for many of the city&#8217;s colleges, in particular Telford college with its new headquarters, which has a long history of welcoming international students and, indeed, only recently received an award as the best college in the UK for international student support. For the record, I congratulate the college on that award. Student visas are also of concern to many of the high-quality and reputable language schools in my constituency and elsewhere in Edinburgh.</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/3">As other Opposition Members have said, no one disputes that it is important to crack down on bogus students and colleges and on low-quality colleges. In common with many other Members, at my surgery I have had people who have been the victims of applying to colleges that then did not come up to standard. No one is under any illusion that we must tackle that issue, or the wider one of immigration, but they must be discussed in the right place and at the right time. We must not, however, allow the pursuits of a Government wanting to fulfil an arguably unfulfillable promise on immigration to have a detrimental effect on bona fide students and bona fide universities and colleges, which make a vital contribution to the economy of the UK and of many of our communities. I take issue with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40479" name="Stewart Jackson">the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr Jackson)</phrase> who talked about the &#8220;vested interest&#8221; being defended by Members; we are not only talking about the professors, principals and numerous staff of universities but about institutions that affect the wider economy. Universities and colleges are important in themselves and for the wider economic benefits in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/4">Many Members, in all parts of the Chamber, made points with which I associate myself, but I will concentrate on a number of specific issues, raised directly with me by some of the universities and colleges in Edinburgh. First, as mentioned by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40525" name="Paul Blomfield">the Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield)</phrase>, who commenced the debate, in many Scottish universities it is still the norm for the undergraduate degree to be over four years and not three. Clearly, the five-year limit will have consequences for those who wish to study at postgraduate level as part of the wider education offer in England, but it will have much more serious consequences for someone who might have only one year after the completion of the undergraduate course in which to consider taking a postgraduate course.</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/5">The implications are wider still. Professor Steve Chapman, the principal of Heriot-Watt university, has pointed out to me that a number of degrees include an integrated year abroad or industrial placement as part of the undergraduate course, so people will use up their five years even without going to postgraduate level. The five-year limit also means that there is absolutely no flexibility at the end of the course, for resits possibly or for delays caused by other legitimate extensions. I hope that the Government will reconsider and change the proposal to take account of the four-year undergraduate course still being standard in much of Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/6">In addition, Professor Chapman said that five-year integrated undergraduate and masters programmes are common, again allowing for no flexibility at the end of</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/7">the five years. He points out that the school of engineering at Edinburgh university has 19 separate master of engineering, five-year, integrated undergraduate and masters degree programmes, with other courses available elsewhere in Scotland. I hope that the Minister will consider the consequences of the five-year limit for the Scottish education system, in which a four-year undergraduate degree is the norm.</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/8">My second point was made by a number of colleagues: the shortness of the notice given to universities about the changes. As I indicated in my earlier intervention, I received a copy of a letter that the principal of Edinburgh university, Professor Sir Tim O&#8217;Shea, sent to the Minister at the beginning of May:</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/9">&#8220;I write to express alarm at the changes to English language requirements as part of the Tier 4 student migration system. The changes will impact on a third of our expected international intake this year and present a serious impediment to the successful recruitment of high quality international students.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/10">He goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/11">&#8220;The changes to English language requirements for Highly Trusted Sponsors have been introduced without any dialogue, part way through our admissions cycle and with no transition phase to enable effective planning. The changes will almost certainly result in legal challenges to our admissions process given that it will necessitate amendments to offers of admission already made to over 800 international applicants seeking to enter the University of Edinburgh this year.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/12">He then makes an important point:</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/13">&#8220;The benefits of having &#8216;Highly Trusted Sponsor&#8217; status remain unclear if sponsors who achieve the highest levels of compliance are to be obstructed from admitting the highest calibre of international students.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/14">Professor O&#8217;Shea urges the Government to postpone changing the English language requirement in this admissions cycle, and asks the UK Border Agency to consult on changes for the next cycle. I endorse his comments, and I hope that the Minister will take on board the concerns expressed by Professor O&#8217;Shea and many other university principals and organisations with an interest in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/15">There may be some misunderstandings about the implications. As my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40527" name="David Blunkett">the Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough (Mr Blunkett)</phrase> said, there are particular issues for those who have received conditional offers or have not completed the process of accepting a firm offer by <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-21">21 April</phrase>. The fact that clarification is needed is a reason for, at least, postponing the changes to the next cycle so that universities can fully take on board the changes that the Government are introducing.</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/16">I could make many other points about issues that my hon. Friends have raised, including the effect on language schools, which I mentioned briefly, and restrictions on dependants, which will have an effect on some students. Concern about the post-study period was raised at length by colleagues. I will not raise those matters again today.</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/17">In statements elsewhere, the Government have recognised the need for the UK to maintain its position with our global competitors in many respects. The ability of high-quality, qualified students to come to the UK is one way of ensuring that we are globally competitive. As my right hon. Friends the Members for Leicester East (Keith Vaz) and for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough said, the consequences for our reputation and standing abroad will be long standing. If the message</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/18">gets out that Britain is not open for business and is not welcoming to international students, it will have an effect not only on students who do not come here but go elsewhere, but on future business contacts if students do not have a positive experience in the UK, on future cultural contacts, and on general good will towards the UK. There will be short-term and long-term economic consequences.</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/19">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" name="Richard Fuller">the hon. Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase> made clear, there are many other reasons for welcoming international students to this country. It is not a question just of a narrow economic interest; there is the wider interest of Britain&#8217;s standing as a whole. However, the economic interest is important. In Scotland alone, the income raised from international student fees in 2009-10 was worth some &#163;260 million. Of every &#163;100 earned by Scottish universities from teaching grants and contracts, international students accounted for &#163;16. Economic interest is not the only reason why the changes should be reconsidered, but it is important, and I hope that the Minister recognises that. Those of us who raise the concerns of universities in our constituencies are raising immediate concerns, but also concerns about our ability to compete on the world stage. I urge the Government to reconsider the way in which these proposals are being introduced, particularly with reference to the implications for those who want to come to Scotland to take a four-year degree course and thereafter to consider postgraduate study as part of the overall package that attracts them to our country.</p>

	<p pid="b.355.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Benton. Like other hon. Members, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40525" name="Paul Blomfield">the hon. Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield)</phrase> on securing the debate, and on the excellent and measured speech with which he introduced it. I pay tribute to my hon. Friends who have spoken today, particularly my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40479" name="Stewart Jackson">the Member for Peterborough (Mr Jackson)</phrase> who explained the background and the wider issues at stake. We have had some excellent contributions from both sides of the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.1/2">I want to follow up some of the points made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40492" name="Rob Wilson">the Member for Reading East (Mr Wilson)</phrase>. In Woking, I have several private colleges with a good reputation&#8212;I do not have a publicly funded university&#8212;which make a real contribution to the life of the constituency and to their students. The Tante Marie cookery school is the largest independent cordon bleu cookery school in the UK. It was founded in 1954 by Iris Syrett, the distinguished cookery writer, and is now part-owned by Gordon Ramsay. It is an internationally renowned establishment and wants to be competitive with the world&#8217;s best cookery schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.1/3">Like my hon. Friend the Member for Reading East, I have received feedback from legitimate private sector colleges, which believe that things are stacked against them. The rules are constantly changing, and that costs each college a lot of time and money. As my hon.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.1/4">Friend said, they must meet an extremely high bar to gain highly trusted sponsor status, and that includes proving that less than 2% of their overseas students drop out in the first third of the course. Most publicly funded colleges or universities would not meet that test, but they are not asked to fulfil any such criteria.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.1/5">The bar is high, but my understanding and that of colleges is that, if they gain highly trusted sponsor status, their overseas students will not now be allowed to work while they are at the college, although a student studying almost exactly the same course at a publicly funded university or college would be allowed to work. That will make it very difficult for private colleges to compete with publicly funded universities, both internationally and in the UK, and to attract foreign students. A student&#8217;s ability to work during their studies has no effect on net migration, but removal of the right to work will have an impact on the number of genuine students who are interested in coming to the UK to study. If they cannot work while they are here, the UK is a much less attractive and much more unaffordable place for them to come to study, especially as most other countries will allow them to work as well as study.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.1/6">The Government&#8217;s intention is to reduce net migration and, as we have heard from my hon. Friends today, that is a laudable objective, which most people want their MPs to support and get a grip on. The best way to do that in the context of education, as we have heard from throughout the Chamber, is to crack down on the bogus colleges and to ensure that students leave when their course has finished. There is a clear difference between a student coming to the UK for the duration of a course, and someone migrating to the UK to live here. The former is undoubtedly beneficial to the UK, the student and our economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.1/7">As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" name="Richard Fuller">the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase> said, what better way of spreading British values and the values of democracy, the rule of law and our cultural heritage with the rest of the world than through having genuine students come here to learn and live alongside British students in this wonderful country of ours.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.1/8">I have long been an admirer of the Minister, whom, I believe, has one of the most difficult briefs in government. He approaches his task with customary tact, intelligence and verve. However, I must say that the potential unfairness of the new rules, and the way they discriminate against private colleges, even after they have achieved every level of quality assessment, will make life difficult for them. In my view, private colleges that meet all the quality criteria should have equal treatment with educational establishments in the public sector, and more equal treatment with similar colleges in other western democracies.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-06-16b.357.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40520" speakername="Nicholas Dakin" colnum="357"  time="016:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110616/halltext/110616h0001.htm#11061633000300">
	<p pid="b.357.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Benton. First, may I declare an interest? This time last year I was principal of a sixth-form college that educated 120 fee-paying international students. International students are a competitive business. As we have heard, it is effectively an export industry; non-EU students buy a UK education in a fiercely competitive global market. Students who come to the UK are often from influential families in their home country and region. They will return and become leaders of their cities, regions and countries. That they have been educated in the UK disposes them positively towards all things British, and can only assist in the UK&#8217;s future global influence and economic prosperity.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/2">I want to focus on the further education sector. More than 20,000 fee-paying international students study at sixth-form and further education colleges. College fee income from international students is more than &#163;42 million a year, and there is additional income from books, food, accommodation and other things. UK plc benefits by at least &#163;80 million a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/3">Let me draw on the concerns raised by John Leggott college in my constituency where, as I said, I was principal. The college has excellent results for international students, and has won many awards for its work with them. It has worked with the British Council and others to develop strong relationships in key markets across the world. It has an excellent reputation but&#8212;here is the &#8220;but&#8221;&#8212;the British Government&#8217;s treatment of visa regulations, the interpretation of those regulations by the UK Border Agency, and their implementation by particular consulates, seriously threatens the college&#8217;s international business.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/4">The head of the international centre, Maggie Williamson told me:</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/5">&#8220;Feedback from agents in China is that the UK visa system is so complicated, daunting and a real obstruction, that most students now don&#8217;t even bother thinking about the UK. They just go to the United States without considering the UK, so this has made applications drop dramatically.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/6">There is a lack of a level playing field between FE and sixth-form colleges, and those independent schools that&#8212;quite properly&#8212;are also active in the market. Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40666" name="Jonathan Lord">the hon. Member for Woking (Jonathan Lord)</phrase>, I call only for a level playing field and for fair treatment for different providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/7">Independent schools automatically get highly trusted sponsor status and do not have to pay the &#163;400 registration fee&#8212;the relevant information states that they will not have to pay the full burden of highly trusted status. Will the Minister consider whether that is fair and proper in the current market? It sends an unfortunate message to the key markets in which the different bodies are operating.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/8">Independent schools can hold pre-sessional courses for students on the same confirmation of acceptance of study&#8212;the CAS form&#8212;that is required when students finally join the school. That is not the case for the FE and sixth-form college sector. Having said that, there are practical issues about whether the CAS system is effective, and its operation is worth further scrutiny. The secure English test does not have the same power of insistence for independent schools as it does for the FE and sixth-form college sector. Students who wish to come to the UK have to take a particular exam, such as IELTS&#8212;the International English Language Testing System&#8212;and the cost of taking it abroad is a disincentive to students who wish to enrol on courses in the UK. There is an uneven, unequal market, and I hope that the Minister will look at that.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/9">I am grateful to the Secretary of State for Education for enabling and encouraging the UK Border Agency to meet me and representatives from my local college to discuss the issue. The UK Border Agency recognises the absurdity of the situation, but it later said in a letter that it would not change anything. I hope that the Minister can focus on the matter and bring about fair treatment for different types of institution within the market. That would be of great assistance and importance.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/10">Prospective students are currently putting money into banks to come to the UK. They do so in good faith that those banks or financial institutions will be on the list of trusted financial institutions. That list, however, has not yet been published, and students may put money into a bank only to find out later that it is not on the list. I hope that the Minister will ensure protection for students and institutions in such an eventuality. It would be helpful if the Minister to considered that practical issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/11">Much of the aspiration behind the policy is correct, but I hope that the Minister will look at and respond to concerns about the way in which it is applied, so that it can apply equally and fairly across different types of institution in a way that is practical and allows business to proceed.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/12">Britain needs to be open for business in the student export market. In my opinion, politicians and the Government should be strong enough to shout up for British business, British students and British education. We should not pander to the sometimes hysterical argument and atmosphere around the subject. If we do that, we will export British jobs, the British reputation and future British influence to the more politically savvy parts of the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/13">I hope that this excellent debate, in which hon. Members from both sides of the Chamber have engaged in a sensible articulation of concern, brings about a practical</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/14">way forward that says that Britain is the best place in the world to come to for an international education, and that we will ensure a level playing field for institutions in Britain. We are open for business. Do come and help us to prosper into the future. That is what I hope will happen as a result of the debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-06-16b.360.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40386" speakername="Tony Lloyd" colnum="360"  time="016:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110616/halltext/110616h0001.htm#11061634000074">
	<p pid="b.360.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40525" name="Paul Blomfield">the Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield)</phrase> not simply on obtaining the debate, but on the way in which he introduced it. Despite some of the speeches that have been made, this is not an attempt to make a frontal assault on the whole of the Government&#8217;s immigration policy. All of us who have taken part in the debate and, I think, every Member of the House of Commons would accept that the bogus college has no place in British society. We should close such colleges</p>
	<p pid="b.360.1/2">down, prosecute those involved in running them and kick out those who have obtained bogus visas. That should be a statement of obvious fact.</p>
	<p pid="b.360.1/3">What we are talking about here, though, is a recognition that, in the introduction of a relatively new system, haste may have been involved and there may be a need to fine-tune and adjust what already exists. I think that that is what my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield Central concentrated on and I hope that we can get the Minister to address those issues. Rather unkindly, I will be complimentary to the Minister, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40666" name="Jonathan Lord">the hon. Member for Woking (Jonathan Lord)</phrase> was. The Minister is a thoughtful man, and I hope that he will think about the issues that have been raised, because they are important.</p>
	<p pid="b.360.1/4">Our higher and further education system is a precious national asset economically, but also culturally and in the wider realm of public diplomacy, so it does matter. It matters to all our constituencies. A city such as mine, with a huge educational infrastructure, both in higher education and in further education, depends on it for employment and for the very nature of modern Manchester. Within that context, I will concentrate on three particular aspects of the rules as they are now beginning to apply. These points have been brought to me by individual establishments. I will begin by raising, as other hon. Members have, the issue of a level playing field with respect to private institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.360.1/5">The Nazarene theological college, which obviously trains students in areas of theology, has made the point to me that the majority of its students are not visa holders&#8212;they do not need to be. It has a limited number of very high level students, mainly PhD students. However, PhD students attending private colleges such as the Nazarene college are treated differently from those who attend our public universities, in that only postgraduate students at universities and Government-sponsored students are able to bring in their dependants&#8212;their spouses and children. Often, those studying for doctorates at theological colleges are mature students. Frankly, saying that they must spend three or four years away from their families means that colleges will not be able to attract that kind of high-level student. I hope that the Minister will reconsider, because that college believed that there might be movement in that area. Perhaps that is something that warrants reconsideration.</p>
	<p pid="b.360.1/6">A couple of institutions, both operating at a high level,have raised with me an issue that I have previously raised with the Minister&#8212;the post-study work route. One is the Northern Ballet school, which says that its graduates often do not get the regular paid work that they need; they need work experience if they are to pursue their careers. They will often take on freelance or part-time work, but at the moment that would take them outside the provisions of the post-study work route. Similarly, SSR college, which trains people to degree level, works in conjunction with universities on sound recording, a vital part of modern education. It, too, says that its students, after graduation, often have to look for part-time work, but again that would prevent them from taking the post-study work route.</p>
	<p pid="b.360.1/7">The next point that I wish to raise in the brief time available has already been put to the Minister&#8212;the capacity to revise the impact of the new regime this year. INTO Manchester, which provides a route into higher education, and Manchester metropolitan university</p>
	<p pid="b.360.1/8">have both raised similar issues with me about existing offers of places. The Minister said that unconditional offers would be honoured but there is the question of conditional offers.</p>
	<p pid="b.360.1/9">More narrowly, questions have been asked about those people coming on to foundation courses where the language qualification is lower. Students often come to the university over the summer months to begin a part of their language course before going on to the foundation course. The summer is nearly with us, and the problem for these institutions is that they are having to correspond with students at a very late stage to say that they must now get the B1 English qualification, which they are finding too difficult.</p>
	<p pid="b.360.1/10">My appeal to the Minister is whether, even at this late stage, we can modify the impact of the rules, make them a little more flexible, and recognise that in the longer run we do not want to damage this vital part of our economy and culture; I am sure that the Minister, too, does not want that. We need to refine that process in a way that suits everybody and makes no serious assault on the Government&#8217;s immigration policies.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-06-16b.362.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40334" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="362"  time="016:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110616/halltext/110616h0001.htm#11061634000075">
	<p pid="b.362.0/1">I shall be brief so that the Minister has sufficient time to reply to the debate. I apologise to the House for missing part of the debate. It was the Government&#8217;s fault. I was forced to go to the Ministry of Justice to hand in a petition about legal aid; if the Government had not cut legal aid, I would have been here for the entire debate. The Minister may care to mention that to his colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="b.362.0/2">I welcome the debate. I also welcome the introduction by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40525" name="Paul Blomfield">the Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield)</phrase>, and the spirit in which the debate has been conducted. All of us represent private sector institutions, which have now fulfilled the requirements put upon them by the previous Government, and that is welcome, or publicly funded universities&#8212;in my case, London Metropolitan university. I agree with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40386" name="Tony Lloyd">the Member for Manchester Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> that none of us is in favour of bogus colleges.</p>
	<p pid="b.362.0/3">I was often deeply concerned about the way in which overseas students would come to this country and be hoodwinked into going to crumby colleges that did nothing for them, but which certainly exploited them. That did this country more damage than anything else, because those students felt that they had been brought here under false pretences&#8212;as indeed they had. They did not succeed in learning much and were often relieved of a great deal of money, only to be disappointed with the performance of the educational institutions. I do not have a problem with the fact that we have a tough regime for the private sector and language schools; we should be clear that they are genuinely offering an education for overseas students. However, what is proposed seems to be a knee-jerk reaction to what is being said about immigration, and it conflates immigration issues with issues about people&#8217;s right and need to study. It is damaging the reputation of this country and it is damaging the aspirations of students from other countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.362.0/4">At some point, most MPs have been on delegations abroad on behalf of Parliament or other organisations. Everywhere we go, we come across people saying, &#8220;I studied in Newcastle&#8221;&#8212;or in Manchester, Birmingham or London&#8212;and that they benefited from it and enjoyed</p>
	<p pid="b.362.0/5">it. They are well disposed towards many things about our country&#8212;literature, science, engineering, transport systems or whatever it happens to be&#8212;and good will is built up as a result. We cannot calculate that good will, but we all know that it exists.</p>
	<p pid="b.362.0/6">Now, when I go to other countries and talk to younger people about the possibility of studying in Britain, they say, &#8220;It&#8217;s expensive&#8221;&#8212;it is expensive&#8212;&#8220;it&#8217;s difficult to get a visa, and the immigration service and the entry system to this country have a very bad reputation.&#8221; People do not enjoy the experience, as non-EU nationals, of trying to come through Heathrow, Gatwick, or anywhere else, particularly if they come from Bangladesh, Africa or Latin American countries. They do not like the way in which they are interviewed, or the intrusive questioning that goes with it. A balance has to be drawn, and I am not convinced that we have it correct. I know that this is not related to education, but many tourists that visit Europe leave out Britain. They do not wish to go through the visa business of coming here, so they restrict their tour to France, Germany and the Netherlands.</p>
	<p pid="b.362.0/7">I represent a constituency that includes London Metropolitan university. It has a huge diversity of students and a great diversity of courses, which I hope it will be able to maintain, but that is for another day. It needs overseas students. The student body needs overseas students. The university has built commendably close relationships with higher education institutions in Russia and Ukraine, as well as in other parts of the world, and it has many overseas students. The overseas students benefit from the quality of the education that they receive and from the experience of being in London, but our students at London Met&#8212;mainly local adult students&#8212;benefit enormously from their interaction with students from entirely different backgrounds. It is not a one-way street; it is very much a two-way street that is of enormous benefit to our students and to our economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.362.0/8">I hope that in his response to the debate the Minister will recognise the economic value, the social value and the educational value of overseas students, and not stick with the arbitrary date of <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-21">21 April</phrase> for the application of any new requirements. I hope, too, that he will recognise that there is a huge body of united opinion among private sector institutions as well as the publicly funded universities, and among Members across the House, that this country should be a centre for higher education. We all want our universities to benefit from overseas students. Our country has benefited greatly from them&#8212;in research, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40419" name="Chi Onwurah">the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (Chi Onwurah)</phrase> pointed out, and also in their good will towards this country when they return home. That is something that we can change quickly and I hope that we will.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-06-16b.363.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40109" speakername="Gerry Sutcliffe" colnum="363"  time="016:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110616/halltext/110616h0001.htm#11061634000076">
	<p pid="b.363.0/1">It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Benton. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40525" name="Paul Blomfield">the Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield)</phrase> on securing the debate. It is a subject that is important to us all, and contributions to the debate from all sides reflected the need to consider the matter seriously. We heard from Back Benchers, members and Chairs of Select Committees, and a former Home Secretary, which shows the importance of the issues that we face.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.0/2">It is my job to reflect on the issues that have been raised in this debate. There have been a number of recurring themes to which the Minister will want to respond. If he is not able to do so today, I am sure that he will write to hon. Members with detailed answers. Some of the concerns may fall under the responsibility of other Departments.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.0/3">I was struck by the contributions from the hon. Members for Peterborough (Mr Jackson) and for Bedford (Richard Fuller) because they reminded the Minister of his obligation to deliver the Conservative manifesto commitment to reduce net immigration from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands. That commitment may have been watered down slightly in the coalition agreement, but it is, none the less, a millstone around the Government&#8217;s neck because it is so difficult to achieve. I understand the debates and discussions around immigration, but I reflect also on the words of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40527" name="David Blunkett">the Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough (Mr Blunkett)</phrase>. He said that when he was Home Secretary, there were issues that needed to be faced, but the goalposts kept changing. As he said, we tried to do all sorts of things to try to improve the situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.0/4">The recurring themes in this debate on student visas have come from both sides of the House. I hope that we can get away from the partisan approach to immigration and the feeling that anything the previous Government did was completely bad and that the present Government will deliver their target. If we continue in that vein, we will not achieve our joint aim of balanced migration. We all want to ensure that we have in our country the people whom we want, require and need. We must reflect on the fact that the previous Government introduced the UK Border Agency and a whole series of initiatives to try to deal with migration.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.0/5">I was struck by a point made by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">the Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>, the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee. He said that part of the problem with migration and immigration issues is the counting in and the counting out of people; it is hard to understand what the facts and figures really are. We have accepted that the previous Government failed to deliver in that regard and we look to support the present Government in their attempts to try to reach a solution to that difficult problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.0/6">Let us put to one side the issue of net migration and how we achieve that and reflect on the issues that we have here today. Student visas and the whole issue around students became a problem when the Home Secretary made a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-21">21 March</phrase>, saying that we were going to reduce the number of students by 400,000 by 2015. The reality is that that will not be achieved. We have already heard that that figure will be reduced by 50%. That is part of the reason for this millstone around the Government&#8217;s neck.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.0/7">We then move on to the issue, which my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield Central put so passionately, of the impact that we are having on our higher education sector. The message has gone out to the wider world that Britain is not open for business. We heard about the concerns that the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee had to deal with on its visit to China and the 40% reduction in applications to the UK from India. On a recent all-party visit to Azerbaijan, I was told that the Azerbaijanis wanted to work and be</p>
	<p pid="b.363.0/8">involved with the UK, but thought that there problems in relation to how we saw the situation in further and higher education.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.0/9">I hope that the Minister will reflect on the points that have been raised today about the transitional arrangements, the time that the institutions will need to put in place the scheme and the problems relating to the offers that have been made to individual students. He should reflect, too, on the cost to the country. The hon. Member for Peterborough said that there was no empirical evidence on the financial impact of such a change, and yet the Home Office&#8217;s own impact assessment says that the cost to the country will be &#163;2.6 billion or even &#163;3.6 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.0/10">Foreign students benefit our university and college system in the UK. Hon. Members have talked about how they develop people intellectually, socially and culturally. We are also seeing a higher number of UK students going to universities in America. Our competitors, such as the US and Australia, are taking advantage of our current situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.0/11">In conclusion, the problem of student visas needs to be addressed. We do not view it in a partisan way. We do not want to attack the Government&#8217;s immigration policy. We recognise that there must be managed migration and we want to work with the Government in a consensual way to achieve those things. The student visa issue is impacting in a negative way on the private sector and on public colleges and universities and we need to do something about that pretty speedily. If we do not, we throw away something that is a boost to our economy. I am talking about the benefits that foreign students bring to our universities and to our many cities and towns.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.0/12">I hope that the Minister will reflect on this excellent debate, recognise that there are serious problems that need to be faced and come up with some solutions in the short term that will prevent any further damage to this sector. We need to have more debates on migration and immigration to decide what we can do collectively to resolve the issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.0/13">I have some sympathy with what the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee said. He asked whether we should go down the route that the US has determined. I hope that the Minister will reflect on an important debate that has had no partisan input, and I look forward to hearing what he has to say.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-06-16b.365.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40049" speakername="Damian Green" speakeroffice="The Minister for Immigration"  colnum="365"  time="017:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110616/halltext/110616h0001.htm#11061634000077">
	<p pid="b.365.0/1">I echo the remarks of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40109" name="Gerry Sutcliffe">the hon. Member for Bradford South (Mr Sutcliffe)</phrase> about the thoughtful and passionate nature of the debate. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40525" name="Paul Blomfield">The hon. Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield)</phrase> introduced this important debate in a thoughtful way.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.0/2">I will follow the good examples of my hon. Friends the Members for Peterborough (Mr Jackson) and for Bedford (Richard Fuller) and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40527" name="David Blunkett">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough (Mr Blunkett)</phrase>, the former Home Secretary, in saying that there are clearly macro and micro aspects to this and it is important that we conduct the debate about student visas and tier 4 within the overall context of the Government&#8217;s immigration policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.0/3">I should say at the outset that Britain is quite rightly internationally renowned for its top-quality education</p>
	<p pid="b.365.0/4">institutions. Many hon. Members have rightly made that point. The students who choose to study here from across the globe bring numerous cultural, social and economic benefits to the UK and to their own countries when they return. We all acknowledge that and it is certainly acknowledged across Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.0/5">We must recognise that the student visa system had become a broken instrument. It has failed to control immigration and, in many cases, to protect legitimate students&#8212;a point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40334" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> made. He said that severe damage has been caused. He said that people come here honestly hoping to study and then find that they have been scammed. Bogus colleges are scamming not just the British immigration system but the students who come here.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.0/6">Student immigration has more than trebled in the past 10 years and is now far larger than the other two main routes of immigration&#8212;the work route and the family route. Too many of the people who come here calling themselves students have a primary motivation of working here, and not of receiving a high quality education. Too many institutions are providing a service that is not about education but immigration. Addressing that issue is at the heart of what we are seeking to do. Many Members from all parties have agreed that it is worth driving out that abuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.0/7">There are endless examples of institutions and &#8220;students&#8221; working the system to get round language requirements and rights to work, and to bring in dependants. That is not just a small problem; too many colleges provide minimal or no tuition or classroom study. We have students barely able to hold a conversation in English turning up to &#8220;study&#8221; degree-level courses.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.0/8">Last year, both Governments&#8212;the Labour Government and the coalition Government&#8212;were in power. So I hope that I will respond to the point made by the hon. Member for Bradford South about being non-partisan by saying that in 2010 tier 4 visas represented 14% of visas that were issued, but tier 4 visa-holders were responsible for 41% of refusals at ports, in other words actually being turned down by immigration officers. The equivalent figures for tiers 1, 2 and 5 visa-holders were all less than 1%.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.0/9">We want genuine students coming to Britain to attend courses of high educational value at legitimate and responsible institutions. We need to maintain our international reputation for providing top-quality education, and we want the very best students to stay on in the UK to complete their studies. That is exactly what our proposals are designed to deliver and that is why the Home Secretary announced a comprehensive programme of reform on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-22">22 March</phrase>. I want to set out what those changes mean in practice and how they will contribute to meeting our wider objective of reducing net migration to the tens of thousands. I also want to address the many specific points made by individual Members during the debate. I will try to deal with them all in the next few minutes.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.0/10">Many contributors to the debate have talked about flexibility, including the hon. Member for Sheffield Central. Indeed, to minimise disruption to education providers and students, we are implementing the changes in three stages. The rules for the first stage came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-21">21 April</phrase>. Last Monday&#8212;<phrase class="date" code="2011-06-13">13 June</phrase>&#8212;we laid the</p>
	<p pid="b.365.0/11">second set of changes to the rules before Parliament. They will come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-04">4 July</phrase>. We will complete our changes by the end of 2012.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.0/12">We continue to have extensive dialogue with the sector about the changes that we are making. I can assure right hon. and hon. Members who are concerned about that that there are numerous and constant contacts at official level and, where necessary, between myself and Universities UK and selected vice-chancellors about these changes, because we want to introduce them in the most practical way possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.0/13">I want to respond to a specific point that was made about the timing of the changes. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40239" name="Mark Lazarowicz">The hon. Member for Edinburgh North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase> read out the letter from the vice-chancellor of a university in his constituency asking if all the changes could be delayed for a year. I should say that when we began to have discussions on them last autumn, we were urged by the universities themselves to get on with them, because we all know that the longer there is any uncertainty in a system, the more people are wary of that system. Various Members have said that the uncertainty that exists is deterring people from making applications and so on. If we allow the uncertainty to continue for another year, I suspect that the results would be worse. So that was wise advice that I received from the universities last autumn.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.0/14">I must repeat the basic point that there are so many abuses of the system that we need radical reform. Many colleges seem happy to accept students who do not even meet their own admissions criteria and who speak very little English. In one college, we found that there were two lecturers for 940 students. In another, we found that students were attending classes for just one day a month and working excessive hours for the rest of the time. UK Border Agency enforcement teams recently picked up students who were supposed to be studying at a college in London, but were actually living and working in west Wales; indeed, every student whom we found from that college was doing that.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.0/15">We are targeting the least compliant students and institutions, and of course that is what we should do. For too long, institutions in parts of the privately funded education sector have been essentially unregulated, yet all the evidence suggests that those institutions pose the biggest risk to immigration control. In a sample of tier 4 students studying at private institutions about which the UKBA had concerns, up to 26% could not be accounted for.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.0/16">The UKBA has revoked the sponsorship licences of 64 colleges. I hope that that meets the reasonable request of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">the right hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>, who is Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, that the inspection regime should be robust. He said that the UKBA used to phone up institutions in advance to say that its inspectors were coming. As is evident from the number of licenses that have been revoked, the enforcement regime is getting better.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.0/17">I want to turn to the current points-based system. Again in the spirit of non-partisanship, I must say that this Government did not arrive and tear up that system. We said that we could build on it and we accepted the point of having objective ways of measuring who comes to the UK, and that is what we are seeking to do. Under that objective system, a sponsor assesses the intentions and ability of the student; UKBA staff no longer have the power to refuse a migrant entry to the UK on those</p>
	<p pid="b.365.0/18">grounds. We therefore need to make absolutely sure that sponsors are exercising their powers responsibly, and that is one of the things that these reforms are designed to achieve.</p>

	<p pid="b.371.1/1">It was set as a graduate-level salary, and it still is. We have kept that threshold. We have not inflation-linked it, and we have increased the skill level, so, if anything, there is a stronger case for it now.</p>
	<p pid="b.371.1/2">I have a fascinating answer about accountancy qualifications for the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough, but given that there are only three minutes to go I hope that he can hold his interest on that topic and bear to have my reply in writing.</p>
	<p pid="b.371.1/3">In response to a point made by the hon. Member for Edinburgh North and Leith, it is true that initially universities were automatically granted highly trusted sponsor status, but they were all required to apply for the status by the end of June 2010. All applications were considered against the published criteria. I was puzzled that someone said they were confused about the criteria,</p>
	<p pid="b.371.1/4">because they were published. Universities retained highly trusted sponsor status after June 2010 only if they had met all the criteria.</p>
	<p pid="b.371.1/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40520" name="Nicholas Dakin">The hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin)</phrase> made a point about independent schools. Independent schools have been afforded greater flexibility simply because of their extremely low levels of non-compliance. The have earned that privilege because they are practically 100% compliant. The requirement for a secure English language test applies to all users of tier 4 general. Independent schools largely use the tier 4 child route, for which there is no English language requirement. That route is also available to sixth-form colleges that recruit 16 and 17 year olds.</p>
	<p pid="b.371.1/6">There was a question about the list of financial institutions, and I can say that that list will be available on the UKBA website shortly. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40419" name="Chi Onwurah">The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (Chi Onwurah)</phrase> asked about quotas, and I am happy to assure her that there are no quotas for UKBA officials to grant or refuse applications.</p>
	<p pid="b.371.1/7">Once all the rules have been implemented, I expect the reforms to reduce the number of student visas by about 70,000 a year, and I estimate that at the end of this Parliament there will be about 260,000 fewer student visas and about 100,000 fewer dependants&#8217; visas. Members have raised many practical issues that I have not had time to address, but I will take them away and think about them hard, particularly the individual cases mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40386" name="Tony Lloyd">the hon. Member for Manchester Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> .</p>
	<p pid="b.371.1/8">I am of course aware of the importance of international students for British educational institutions and for the UK economy, but I believe that the measures strike the necessary balance.</p>
	<p pid="b.371.1/9" class="italic">Sitting adjourned without Question put (<phrase class="standing-order" code="10(11)">Standing Order No. 10(11)</phrase>).</p>
