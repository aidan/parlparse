	<p pid="b.383.4/1">It is a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase>, who was making a powerful point relating to large-scale developments. It is something that I was not aware of, and I am glad that he has brought it to the House's attention. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> on securing yet another debate important to north Northamptonshire, and on explaining so eloquently in half an hour the problem that we face. I welcome the Minister, who is highly respected and is known to be a caring Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.4/2">One of the problems with consultation is that it is just not being done in north Northamptonshire&mdash;at least, not by the Government. I run a tracking survey called &quot;Listening to Wellingborough and Rushton&quot;, which goes out continuously to different parts of the constituency so that we can gauge public opinion in snapshots, as well as tracking changes in opinion over time. Two years ago, overdevelopment was not an issue. It is now among the top three. There are eight different protest groups protesting against individual developments that will form part of the 52,000 new homes that must be built in Wellingborough. What those groups object to individually refers in total to a lack of infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.4/3">In one development, 1,000 homes are to be built on a brownfield site. Most people would say, &quot;Well, that's a great idea. Let's build the homes on a brownfield site. It won't take up any green belt, as it's an urban area.&quot; The problem is that no infrastructure increase will accompany that development. The road leading to it is already far too busy. There are some airy-fairy plans to build a relief road some time in the future, but there are no concrete plans&mdash;pardon the pun. What we want is concrete first. We want new roads. I understand entirely where the Government are coming from. They recognise that there is a housing problem, and their solution is to get large areas and to tell the rotten Tory councils to get off their backsides and build some homes. I understand that the Government want the homes, but they are forgetting about the infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.4/4">In Wellingborough, we have an extraordinary situation. The last time that the Labour party controlled the county council, it knocked down the secondary school. We have lost our secondary school, we do not have a hospital, we lost six post offices during the first round of closures and we have just lost another five. The A45 is a huge problem at the moment, especially the interchanges in my constituency. The Chowns Mill roundabout is always clogged up, but there is nothing in the regional programme&mdash;even in the 15-year programme&mdash;to say that anything will be done about it. The council, the county council and the Highways Agency all say that it needs to be improved. Thousands of homes are coming, but it seems that local people are not being consulted and cannot influence decisions in any way. It is causing real hardship in many parts of my constituency. Schools are overcrowded, people cannot get a GP and it is impossible to find an NHS dentist. People are saying to me, &quot;If local councillors can't decide this, what is the point of voting in local elections? What is the point of supporting political parties if decisions are dictated from Whitehall?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.383.4/5">The biggest problem at the moment is the Redwell north development. Wellingborough is a well-established market town, Rushton is a town in itself and there are a lot of villages between them on the way to Kettering&mdash;Little Harrowden, Great Harrowden and Isham&mdash;with clear countryside in between. The local plan agreed by the political parties in Wellingborough says that that is open space and not for housing, but a developer has taken options on all the land around that area. If that developer puts in a planning application and the councillors are bold enough to turn it down, they know that it will be overturned on appeal. That is destroying local democracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.4/6">Last Friday I met the chief executive of Wellingborough council, who is concerned about the development process. She is concerned that Wellingborough's rail services have been cut, as have Kettering's, and she asked me to arrange a meeting with East Midlands Trains. I have spoken with Wellingborough Homes, which is responsible for the development of social housing and has concerns. The leader of Wellingborough council, not knowing about this debate, rang me to request a meeting to discuss development policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.4/7">This argument may be regarded in some quarters as academic. The Government have decided. They will push through the homes, and tough luck to the people of Wellingborough. That is wrong and unfair, and there should be proper consultation, but my point is that it is more serious than that. Two or three weeks ago, we held a local council by-election in Redwell. The Conservatives won by a country mile. That is nothing new; we always win by a country mile. The problem was which party finished second. It was not the traditional party&mdash;Labour, which ruled Wellingborough and controlled the council for a considerable number of years&mdash;but the British National party. It was the first time that the BNP had stood in Wellingborough, and it scored more than 15 per cent. of the votes, pushing Labour into third place.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.4/8">The BNP did not come into the area screaming racist chants; it put a reasoned case about the overdevelopment and concentrated on that. People said, &quot;It's no good voting Labour or Tory. They're not listening. They're not going to do anything about it. They've been in power all this time, and all these houses are coming.&quot; That is what I want to convey to the Minister. If proper consultation is not held and the views of local people are not taken into account, extreme parties will come in, which is something that I do not think any of us want.</p>

	<p pid="b.387.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> who made a passionate speech on behalf of his constituents. As ever, I am sure that he will be proved right. I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> on raising this incredibly important debate, which affects our broad region a great deal. It is the key issue on which I have been campaigning for the past few years.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.0/2">For us at least, the situation began in 2004 when the then Deputy Prime Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1646" name="John Prescott">the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott)</phrase>, announced that the Government intended to expand Milton Keynes over the following few years by some 70,000 houses&mdash;up to 370,000 by 2031. Ever since, I have campaigned for &quot;I before E&quot;&mdash;infrastructure before expansion, which I am sure that the Minister will assure me will come to Milton Keynes. We had a consultation of sorts in Milton Keynes, between July and September 2006, but just 1,600 replies were received. Ubiqus, which produced a report on the consultation, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.387.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Most general comments on the consultation were from respondents who questioned whether their input would make any difference, and criticised the involvement of the unelected Milton Keynes Partnership. Others said that people who lived in MK and not 'so-called experts' should determine growth.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.387.0/4">In the short time available to me, I want to make some quick points. If the Minister takes nothing else away from this debate, he must understand that the Opposition wants a bottom-up approach, not a top-down one. Certainly in Milton Keynes, in 2004, there was a belief that the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East was rather like a world war one general with a very small map and big hands saying, &quot;I want houses there, there and there&quot;, without any genuine feeling about the impact on local communities. That is further demonstrated by the fact that English Partnerships, which is charged with delivering those houses, and Milton Keynes Partnerships, our local delivery agent, have become the planning authority for the eastern and western flanks. While Milton Keynes council maintains control of central Milton Keynes, the planning authority for the new expansion areas in the east and west of the city is an unelected, unaccountable quango that is responsible only to central Government, and not to the local people. Does the Minister understand why people feel so strongly about the decision being taken out of their hands and imposed from above?</p>
	<p pid="b.387.0/5">The density in Milton Keynes is increasing rapidly. New developments such as Oakgrove are far denser than previous developments in the city. When it was first developed some 40 years ago, Milton Keynes was flagged up as great city to which to move because it had vast areas of open space. Housing density was not high. People were encouraged to move out of London and into Milton Keynes. However, that is changing as housing densities continue to increase. People feel very strongly that their city motto of &quot;By knowledge, design and understanding&quot; will be lost, because they are no longer in charge of their destiny. Central Government are dictating how local people should lead their lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.0/6">I want to return briefly to &quot;I before E&quot;, or infrastructure before expansion. I am sure that when the Minister replies, he will assure us that all the infrastructure that we need will be delivered. However, I want to give two examples to show how we are failing. This year, we have a &pound;65 million deficit in the basic needs allocation for our new schools. To match new housing levels, we have to build or extend 12 new primary or secondary schools. However, the deficit means that we may not be able to build many of those new schools, so can the Minister suggest where all the children from the new housing will go to school? We have put in an application for the safety valve mechanism to get some of the money back, and we should have heard three weeks ago whether or not we would get some &pound;15 million back. Surprise, surprise, it appears that the decision, or the announcement of this money, will be delayed until after <phrase class="date" code="">1 May</phrase>. I have no idea why that should be&mdash;perhaps the Minister can enlighten me. He will be aware that in Milton Keynes, we pay the Milton Keynes tariff, which is known locally as the roof tax. Some &pound;18,500 for each property will be delivered&mdash;not directly, but indirectly&mdash;back to the community to build infrastructure, but I must tell the Minister that that represents only 10 or 15 per cent. of what we need.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.0/7">When I spoke to John Lewis, the new chief executive of the Milton Keynes Partnership, he told me that 50 per cent of his budget for infrastructure is a direct grant from central Government and that 50 per cent. comes from the Milton Keynes tariff. The problem is that because of the economic downturn, we are not building the expected number of houses. There has not been a major land deal in the area for more than seven months. When it comes to infrastructure, the one thing that is probably saving us is the fact that we are failing to deliver the quantity of houses that the Government want. We have therefore had to reduce our projected income from the Milton Keynes tariff, because we are not building the houses and will not receive any money. That 50 per cent. of budget that John Lewis expected to use to build new multi-storey car parks around the city has had to be downsized, and all the projects are being moved to the right. Although the Minister promised us that infrastructure would be delivered, that will not happen because of the failure to deliver the money from the Milton Keynes tariff as a result of the economic downturn.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.0/8">I have one final question for the Minister. Given that his Government have constantly promised the people of Milton Keynes that the infrastructure will be in place before the houses are built, and given that it is clear that the money will not be delivered to the extent that he was hoping from the Milton Keynes tariff, how exactly will he replace that money to ensure that we secure the infrastructure that he promised?</p>
