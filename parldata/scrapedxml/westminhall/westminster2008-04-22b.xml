<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-22b.383.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" speakername="Peter Bone" colnum="383"  time="011:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080422/halltext/80422h0005.htm#08042258000430">
	<p pid="b.383.4/1">It is a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase>, who was making a powerful point relating to large-scale developments. It is something that I was not aware of, and I am glad that he has brought it to the House's attention. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> on securing yet another debate important to north Northamptonshire, and on explaining so eloquently in half an hour the problem that we face. I welcome the Minister, who is highly respected and is known to be a caring Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.4/2">One of the problems with consultation is that it is just not being done in north Northamptonshire&mdash;at least, not by the Government. I run a tracking survey called &quot;Listening to Wellingborough and Rushton&quot;, which goes out continuously to different parts of the constituency so that we can gauge public opinion in snapshots, as well as tracking changes in opinion over time. Two years ago, overdevelopment was not an issue. It is now among the top three. There are eight different protest groups protesting against individual developments that will form part of the 52,000 new homes that must be built in Wellingborough. What those groups object to individually refers in total to a lack of infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.4/3">In one development, 1,000 homes are to be built on a brownfield site. Most people would say, &quot;Well, that's a great idea. Let's build the homes on a brownfield site. It won't take up any green belt, as it's an urban area.&quot; The problem is that no infrastructure increase will accompany that development. The road leading to it is already far too busy. There are some airy-fairy plans to build a relief road some time in the future, but there are no concrete plans&mdash;pardon the pun. What we want is concrete first. We want new roads. I understand entirely where the Government are coming from. They recognise that there is a housing problem, and their solution is to get large areas and to tell the rotten Tory councils to get off their backsides and build some homes. I understand that the Government want the homes, but they are forgetting about the infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.4/4">In Wellingborough, we have an extraordinary situation. The last time that the Labour party controlled the county council, it knocked down the secondary school. We have lost our secondary school, we do not have a hospital, we lost six post offices during the first round of closures and we have just lost another five. The A45 is a huge problem at the moment, especially the interchanges in my constituency. The Chowns Mill roundabout is always clogged up, but there is nothing in the regional programme&mdash;even in the 15-year programme&mdash;to say that anything will be done about it. The council, the county council and the Highways Agency all say that it needs to be improved. Thousands of homes are coming, but it seems that local people are not being consulted and cannot influence decisions in any way. It is causing real hardship in many parts of my constituency. Schools are overcrowded, people cannot get a GP and it is impossible to find an NHS dentist. People are saying to me, &quot;If local councillors can't decide this, what is the point of voting in local elections? What is the point of supporting political parties if decisions are dictated from Whitehall?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.383.4/5">The biggest problem at the moment is the Redwell north development. Wellingborough is a well-established market town, Rushton is a town in itself and there are a lot of villages between them on the way to Kettering&mdash;Little Harrowden, Great Harrowden and Isham&mdash;with clear countryside in between. The local plan agreed by the political parties in Wellingborough says that that is open space and not for housing, but a developer has taken options on all the land around that area. If that developer puts in a planning application and the councillors are bold enough to turn it down, they know that it will be overturned on appeal. That is destroying local democracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.4/6">Last Friday I met the chief executive of Wellingborough council, who is concerned about the development process. She is concerned that Wellingborough's rail services have been cut, as have Kettering's, and she asked me to arrange a meeting with East Midlands Trains. I have spoken with Wellingborough Homes, which is responsible for the development of social housing and has concerns. The leader of Wellingborough council, not knowing about this debate, rang me to request a meeting to discuss development policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.4/7">This argument may be regarded in some quarters as academic. The Government have decided. They will push through the homes, and tough luck to the people of Wellingborough. That is wrong and unfair, and there should be proper consultation, but my point is that it is more serious than that. Two or three weeks ago, we held a local council by-election in Redwell. The Conservatives won by a country mile. That is nothing new; we always win by a country mile. The problem was which party finished second. It was not the traditional party&mdash;Labour, which ruled Wellingborough and controlled the council for a considerable number of years&mdash;but the British National party. It was the first time that the BNP had stood in Wellingborough, and it scored more than 15 per cent. of the votes, pushing Labour into third place.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.4/8">The BNP did not come into the area screaming racist chants; it put a reasoned case about the overdevelopment and concentrated on that. People said, &quot;It's no good voting Labour or Tory. They're not listening. They're not going to do anything about it. They've been in power all this time, and all these houses are coming.&quot; That is what I want to convey to the Minister. If proper consultation is not held and the views of local people are not taken into account, extreme parties will come in, which is something that I do not think any of us want.</p>
