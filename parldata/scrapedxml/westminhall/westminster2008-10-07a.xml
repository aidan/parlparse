<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-07a.6.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="6"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081007/halltext/81007h0001.htm#08100731000490">
	<p pid="a.6.0/1">There is a limit to what can be covered in one debate, and I do not wish to run over time. However, I should like to reassure my hon. Friend that in pursuing an early-intervention package, One Nottingham funds several anti-tobacco initiatives, including efforts to prevent people from smoking. I have some notes on the alcohol part of the drug and alcohol awareness strategy, but I have had to skip over them rather quickly. However, both those addictive substances are definitely on the agenda, and they are being covered.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/2">Another issue that others could learn about from Nottingham is collaborative working. Partnership is a much abused word, but I hope that we in Nottingham have proved that community involvement, partnerships and collaborative working&mdash;whichever phrase one likes to use&mdash;are not just add-ons that are nice to have, but are essential. Just as we have said that crime is too important to be left to the police, so drug education and the tackling of drug problems are too important to be left to enforcement or to the health services. This issue is everyone's problem, and I hope that we show that in what we do locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/3">We need to ensure that substance misuse training is embedded in all mainstream services, so that everyone has the right set of skills. The Drug Aware award is a fine example of something encompassing all our local partners&mdash;the local NHS, the city council, criminal justice agencies, the alcohol industry, trading standards, children's services, the fire service, both of Nottingham's universities and the Nottingham business improvement district. A vast array of people is committed to making this policy work.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/4">Data tracking is another important issue that One Nottingham and the Drug Aware effort will highlight. We need more localised and up-to-date data collection if the early intervention package is to be effective, not least on drug misuse and teenage pregnancy. Drug misuse trends, patterns and hotspots are identified through data collection and fed back to partner agencies through the crime and drugs partnership's tackling violent crime group. In addition, a new data collection system has been introduced at our hospital's accident and emergency department to collect data on attendances for assault to help the CDP and police to identify hotspots for alcohol-related violent crime in particular and to enhance the intelligence base for enforcement action.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/5">However, the CDP has encountered data-tracking obstacles in its work at a local level. We have repeatedly had to make do with national statistics from general household and national alcohol consumption surveys, for example. That gap in local data sources means that it is more difficult to develop a localised, let alone personalised, solution to the problem. Of course, there must be safeguards, but there must also be a greater commitment to putting data to work at regional and local levels. I have asked the Minister to consider establishing a troubleshooting unit at national level to cut through some of the unintended consequences, misapplication and mythology around data protection, which might become every bureaucracy's favourite excuse if we are not careful.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/6">We must develop 11 to 16-year-olds' key social and emotional capabilities as a backdrop to tackling symptoms such as drug and alcohol abuse, low educational attainment and high levels of antisocial behaviour and teenage pregnancy. The Home Office must reach out to the Department for Children, Schools and Families and make a strong case for a statutory requirement on all schools to provide Life Skills 11-16, including modules on drug abuse and teenage pregnancy, and that should be covered in Ofsted assessments of schools' performance. I am committed to trying that in my constituency, and I hope that the local strategic partnership, One Nottingham, will consider funding such a proposal throughout our city.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/7">Local entrepreneurship, however, is no substitute for national policy led by a committed Minister. In addition, there must be a clear Government commitment to building drug education into mainstream teacher training, through both initial teacher training and continuing professional development. Finally, there must be consistent resources for universal drug education. Locally, One Nottingham is funding the Drug Aware award for three years; when it has proved itself, it will be taken over by mainstream providers. Nationally, Government must insist that every locality does something similar. Local agencies could easily fund this if a Minister made a case to the Treasury proposing that they keep half the proceeds of every drug rehab place saved. Treasury rules and civilisation as we know it might fall apart at such a suggestion, but let us incentivise people to invest in education, rather than pay the massive continuing costs of rehabilitating a smaller number of individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/8">In conclusion, we in Nottingham have worked with the grain of Government thinking in bringing forward our Drug Aware policy, which we believe is a state-of-the-art effort within the United Kingdom. The Government now need to look at the plethora of schemes nationwide and promote a model drug education scheme that can be adapted for use in every part of the UK. Nottingham's Drug Aware programme might be the forerunner of such a scheme. If the Minister, my friend, sets that guidance rolling in his last act as a junior Minister, he will save billions of pounds and thousands of wasted lives, and will have the understanding and thanks of every parent in the land.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.0/1">I am following the hon. Gentleman's arguments very closely. I would just like to go back, if I may, to the issues of assessment and evaluation. They take place at two levels. First, there is evaluation of what is done locally, and it is even more important that that evaluation is scientific and clear when there is a plethora of schemes operating in lots of different localities. I therefore hope that the Home Office might consider finding a way it could help people to evaluate effectively how the schemes are being implemented. In particular, if people are pioneering a scheme, as we are in Nottingham, I hope that the Home Office will consider helping at that local level.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/2">Secondly, there is assessment of what policies are effective. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider joining those of us who feel that the situation here is rather like that which existed in the United States, where there were more than 600 different policies on drug education, bullying, early intervention and so on. The US Department of Justice then asked a university to rank those policies order so that there would be a small group of policies, so that people who wished to pick up on those policies and do something effective could go to one source and have a national policy assessment centre to find which policies were most effective. I think that all parties could agree on having a similar source of information at the national level here&mdash;one which recommended the best of all the policies being experimented with.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-07a.13.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1640" speakername="James Brokenshire" colnum="13"  time="010:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081007/halltext/81007h0003.htm#08100731000495">
	<p pid="a.13.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> on securing this informative and important debate on anti-drug awareness. I also congratulate him on the publication, &quot;Early Intervention: Good Parents, Great Kids, Better Citizens&quot;, which he co-authored with my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> and which makes some provocative points about the direction of policy. It has certainly provided me with interesting bed-time reading and some thoughts and ideas on the emphasis that might, and should, be made, and on where things are going wrong regarding the direction of policy from the centre. We must look at the importance of local initiatives, and how the arrangement between the two could be more effectively structured. I shall deal with that in further detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/2">I congratulate the Minister on his promotion to the new challenges of policing and security. In all my dealings with him, he has always been prepared to listen to, if not agree with, the points that I have made to him. I have always found the way in which he has conducted ministerial business fair-minded and honourable. I wish him well, as I suspect that those qualities will be well tested in his new role and function.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/3">The emphasis of today's debate is very much on prevention and the need to address intergenerational issues, which are important, as is the stress on partnership working, however we define it. Much good work is taking place in communities up and down the country. It is important to recognise and appreciate that, but the hon. Member for Nottingham, North made an important point about the need for informed choices and better assessment so that local communities and authorities that seek to commission services or assess their policies have a much better toolkit, framework and guide for assessing their existing approaches and approaches have proved successful elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/4">We cannot prescribe some top-down solution. We cannot say, &quot;We prescribe from the centre that this will happen, and therefore it will work in your community.&quot; It is perhaps that emphasis that has been the mistake in recent years. We must recognise that the effectiveness of a solution in one community may not necessarily and automatically be replicated in other communities. There is a need for localisation. At the same time, we must recognise the things that are working and consider why and how they are working and the lessons and messages from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/5">This is a difficult area, and the cost is great, not just to the individual but to society. The illicit drug market is estimated at between &pound;4 billion and &pound;6.6 billion. The use of class A drugs alone generates an estimated &pound;15 billion in economic and social costs, which is why the emphasis of today's debate on prevention is important. However, one cannot look at it in isolation. The emphasis should not be just on prevention but on enforcement and rehabilitation as well. The question is the balance to be struck between each of those strands.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/6">I have some sympathy with what the hon. Member for Nottingham, North said about reorienting things towards earlier intervention to try to break some of the challenging problems perpetuated from one generation to the next, and about supporting parents in their role. Parents are key if we are to address the issues that we have debated and discussed today. We must support them properly and give them the information that they need, but, equally, there must be a focus on rehabilitation. It is unacceptable that, on the latest figures, the Government's drug treatment programmes result in only 3 per cent. of people leaving those treatment programmes drug-free. Drug users who seek treatment and services say that they want to be drug-free: they want to be able to abstain and to get support, which is why the emphasis of policy must move in that direction and not simply be badged as harm reduction, which in many ways merely means holding people in addiction by switching them from an illegal substance to a legal one to modify or control their behaviour. It simply cannot be right to hold people in addiction by, for example, keeping them on methadone. The cost of such prescriptions is rising every year.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/7">Early intervention is important, because the age at which young children now use alcohol and illicit drugs is shocking. It is getting lower and lower, and that is one of the most disturbing trends that we see. Seventeen per cent. of schoolchildren aged between 11 and 15 have used an illegal drug in the past year. We are seeing an increase in prescriptions for anti-psychotic drugs among teenagers, and class A drug use has not really budged at all in the 16-to-24 age group. Another important issue is binge drinking and alcohol. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North, my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green, and the Centre for Social Justice highlighted the effects of binge drinking among 10 and 11-year-olds, who admit going out and getting drunk on a regular basis. Younger and younger children are doing so, which is why messaging is so important. I heard what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" name="Tom Brake">the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase> said about the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, but we cannot simply delegate responsibility to the ACMD.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/8">There is a wider perspective on all this, which is why it was right to seek the reclassification of cannabis. I hope that the Minister will update us on what progress has been made on implementation. I disagree with the potential reclassification of ecstasy, which would downgrade it, because that would send out strong messages suggesting that it is somehow a more acceptable drug, whatever evidence the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs may bring to bear on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/9">I draw the Minister's attention to FRANK, which is a key part of the Government's 10-year prevention strategy, which was launched in 2003. FRANK provides information, advice and guidance to young people in relation to drugs. However, I question some of the approaches that are being taken. For example, the FRANK website says some things about the effects of cannabis, but there is no mention of psychotic episodes, paranoia and all those mental health issues that are attached to cannabis. The information that is provided therefore needs to be clearer and much more robust. Prevention has to be the watchword in all of this. I appreciate that early intervention goes much further than prevention, but prevention must still be at the forefront in the approaches taken on information and education. We bandy around the words, &quot;harm reduction&quot;, but I am entirely unconvinced that people understand what that term means. Prevention is a much more understandable concept in respect of what we are trying to achieve in all this and it is a better form of road-marking to signpost the direction of preventive policy on drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/10">Will the Minister spell out how he sees FRANK's development as a resource? He will be aware that the budget for FRANK has been cut by about one third in the current financial year and is due to be reduced by a further &pound;1 million in the next financial year. The Government say that they are committed to the initiative, but how is that commitment represented when funding has been being significantly reduced in the current year and in the year ahead?</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/11">I am pleased that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" name="Brian Iddon">the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon)</phrase> is in the Chamber, because I paid an interesting visit to the Bolton drug treatment service in his constituency. I was interested to hear about the approach adopted by that service, particularly its use of outcome-based measures: in other words, looking at the results of things, rather than simply measuring inputs and box ticking, which, sadly, has been the approach taken by many services, not just those dealing with drugs, but other public services around the country. One of the things that struck me&mdash;the people working there were rightly proud of it&mdash;was that information on cocaine use was being putting across to provide better signposts to treatment for people addicted to it. I am sure that the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East is aware of the problems locally in respect of mixing cocaine and alcohol, and knows about some of the tragic deaths resulting from polyaddiction&mdash;the mixture of those two substances together&mdash;and what that has meant for so many people. He will also be aware of the question of how to get people into treatment. The Bolton drug treatment service has effectively set up its own website, because those involved thought that the information was not out there on the effects of cocaine and what might happen if cocaine is combined with alcohol. I congratulate those involved on that initiative.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.0/1">I am aware of the hon. Gentleman's visit to Bolton, and I thank him for informing me that he was coming. I have had a full report of his visit. However, while he was there, did the Bolton drug and alcohol team explain Project 360, which is seeks early intervention for children from broken families, and tries to weld those families back together again and do something about the young person's abuse of substances?</p>

	<p pid="a.17.1/1">I think that the hon. Gentleman has made a valid point. I visited the south west last year and talked to some youth workers. I asked them why parents do not support their youngsters in getting treatment or better education. Sadly, one worker said&mdash;their reply summed it up for me&mdash;&quot;Well, doing that and seeing their children doing better would make their lives even worse.&quot; That was a stark statement about how some communities, whatever the debate may be about, are quite broken. We need to look at early intervention and consider how we can break the intergenerational problems that have been highlighted this morning. However, that does not detract from the essential need to give support and information to parents who want to be good parents and want to see their children do better, while recognising that there is a small cohort who take the more negative view that has, sadly, been relayed to me and to the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/2">We have to put education in a wider perspective. I had the pleasure of visiting the St. Neots community alcohol partnership earlier this year, where I heard how education was being bound into the process. Talking to the kids who had been through the educational programmes, I saw how the process built links and brought together retailers, the police, trading standards agencies and drug awareness charities in a whole approach. That was a good lesson to learn. Certainly, I will monitor closely how that programme is rolled out. I hear that it is being expanded into other counties and other areas of the country. It is an interesting and important project to follow, enabling us to see how a community and partnership-based approach can be effective in reducing alcohol consumption and antisocial behaviour and the crime that goes with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/3">In conclusion, anti-drug awareness approaches may be summed up in three words: prevention, in terms of focus; partnership, as an essential element of delivery in communities; and perspective, in terms of the wider social context in which they may sit and the other policies that they are intended to supplement as an overarching approach to reduce the harm of drugs and the crime that may lead from that. I was struck by a quote from the pamphlet by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North, which states that the early intervention objective is nothing less than an effort</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/4" class="indent">&quot;to replace a vicious cycle with a virtuous circle; to help every child become a capable and responsible parent who in turn will raise better children who themselves will learn, attain and raise functional families of their own.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/5">That is a powerful message, which the hon. Gentleman expressed very well this morning. We shall certainly focus on implementation and the approaches that might give effect to the themes that he rightly identified as important in making a difference in this serious issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.3/1">The hon. Gentleman knows that there are other governance arrangements for such schools, but if we get the review under way and it changes the statutory core for PSHE, it will influence all schools. He knows the different governance arrangements for different types of school.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/2">My hon. Friend and other hon. Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1640" name="James Brokenshire">the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire)</phrase>, raised issues of treatment, education and rehabilitation. All are important. Of course, education and early intervention treatment are fundamental, but treatment is also essential for people who have difficulties now, and we must deal with that. It is important in the treatment agenda that we have brought more people into treatment. However, when people are brought into treatment, the question changes; it is not why have people not been brought into treatment, but what is effective treatment. That question cannot be easily asked until people are brought into treatment. The Government are currently asking that question: what do we mean by effective treatment and what will actually work.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/3">To some extent, I accept the point made by hon. Member for Hornchurch: rehabilitation and treatment must include abstinence as one of the options available. It is not good enough for treatment to simply move people off illegal substances on to legal substances, such as methadone. I know that the hon. Gentleman has met lots of people and will have heard that, for many, methadone is a first, important step in stabilising their chaotic lives. However, we should not be saying that one particular course of action is appropriate for every individual. Treatment should be based on medical and health grounds, and health professionals should make a judgment about what treatment is effective for each individual. I agree with the hon. Gentleman: there must be greater recognition that abstinence and residential rehab needs to play a more important part in treatment. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2031" name="Bob Spink">The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> also said that.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.1/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman's intervention. The problem of drugs can be more effectively dealt with by people who have been on the other side of the fence, as it were&mdash;and that is the case in relation to a range of social problems, not just substance misuse. It is important to remember that.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/2">On the points about prisons that the hon. Gentleman and a number of other hon. Members made, we are increasing the amount of money spent on prison education during the next three years by &pound;70 million. That is a considerable and welcomed increase in investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/3">On the points raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" name="Tom Brake">the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase>, I have talked about the balance between early intervention, education and enforcement, but it is not a matter of making a choice between those; we need to consider a menu of options. A health decision needs to be made about what is most appropriate for an individual.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/4">On national tackling drugs week, as with all the work we do, we are continually evaluating what is effective and what works best. The hon. Gentleman will know that the research project Blueprint is looking into the effectiveness of drugs education and he might be interested to know that we expect to publish those findings in the next month. That research will be helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/5">We greatly value the advice that the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs gives the Government, but if the hon. Gentleman was in my place and was the Minister with responsibility for the issue he would, in the end, with his colleagues in Government, be charged with the responsibility of making a decision. We get advice&mdash;all Governments get advice all the time&mdash;but in the end we have to make the decision. The hon. Member for Hornchurch was right about the advice that we received from the ACMD, but we received other advice, not least from the police and service users themselves who said other things. We reflected on and balanced that advice, and in the end made the decision that we have.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/6">The hon. Gentleman asked for an update on cannabis. In the near future, we will introduce legislation on cannabis and we are trying to ensure that the reclassification takes place as quickly as possible. We hope that legislation&mdash;a statutory instrument&mdash;will be introduced in due course and in the not too distant future.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/7">We are considering the status of head shops and, if necessary, will introduce legislation on that. I absolutely agree with the hon. Gentleman's points. I am told that, legally, action is difficult, but we are considering the matter to try to find a way forward. We have funded police guidance and have considered the policing of head shops. Work is ongoing in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/8">I think I have dealt with most of the points raised by the hon. Gentleman, apart from those relating to the lack of information. Sometimes there has been an issue concerning a lack of information and how the information about the help available gets to people. We need to ensure that we tackle that. In some areas that is not a problem, but in others it is. We are trying to ensure that information is made available to people across the country and where it is needed, so that they can access the necessary help and treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/9">The involvement of parents is clearly crucial to dealing with drugs. I would like to dispel one myth&mdash;again, my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North taught me this. There is an issue with parents who simply do not care and we need to take action on that, but there is also an issue with parents who care very much, but who sometimes themselves struggle to know what they should be doing with their children. We need to ensure that we recognise their needs and help those parents too.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/10">On the national picture, the principles adopted in Nottingham that have been outlined by my hon. Friend in the excellent debate he has initiated are very much the principles that we want to adopt nationally. Let me put the matter in context: overall drug use by people in England and Wales, including by young people, has fallen to its lowest level since the British crime survey began measurement of self-reported drug misuse. The number of people in contact with drug treatment has increased by 130 per cent. and since the start of the drug intervention programme, acquisitive crime has fallen by 22 per cent. There are, no doubt, issues that we have to discuss, but changes and improvements are being made.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.3/1">My hon. Friend is right. We have held five public meetings in my constituency about the issue, and 700-plus people have come to them. At the start of every one, I have had to say, &quot;I know what you're thinking&mdash;responding to a consultation is a waste of time because nobody is listening.&quot; I hope that the Minister will assure us that the comments that we make today and that go on the website do have a chance of changing something. If he simply comes up with 3 million, or whatever the number is, and just tells us all to get on with it, I wonder whether we would be able to change anything. Frankly, however, if we were all to give up, it would be a recipe for cynicism. That is why I have been determined to fight it.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/2">I shall focus on the specific issue of housing numbers. The document covers much more, but that is the principal concern. I considered what the last but one Housing Minister, now Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said in response to our debate in January. If I were to summarise her 10-minute speech, it would be, &quot;You are all a bunch of nimbys: go away.&quot; That, essentially, was the line she took. That, however, may be in the Minister's draft speech, so I shall suggest a slightly more refined version.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/3">We are not saying&mdash;I am not saying&mdash;no to more houses. South Gloucestershire is not an area of nimbys: over the past 20 years, it has taken 27,000 extra houses, including the biggest housing estate in Europe&mdash;Bradley Stoke. In the used currency, we are now being asked for another four Bradley Stokes. That is on top of what we already have.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/4">In 2006, the then all-party cabinet of South Gloucestershire council asked, &quot;What do we need? What can we cope with? What is sustainable? What will the infrastructure bear?&quot; The council came up with 21,000 for the next 20 years. It was not nought. The council was not denying the need for affordable housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/5">If the Minister's officials have been busy, they will know that twice in this Chamber I have demanded more affordable housing to meet local needs in South Gloucestershire. It is not no to new housing; it is yes to sustainable, affordable housing to meet local needs. However, what is proposed goes way beyond that. South Gloucestershire council said yes to 21,000, on top of the 27,000 over the previous 20 years. The draft regional spatial strategy agreed by the regional assembly came up with 23,000, which encroached on the green belt. We objected to that, but it was in the same ballpark. The panel suggested 30,800; and the Secretary of State said 32,8000, which was half as many again. The issue is the margin between what the local people believe is sustainable&mdash;a number that would meet local needs&mdash;and a vast extra development.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.1/1">That is exactly right. People ask me how the need for these houses arises. The report shows that they are needed not only for local people. It supposes a massive influx, principally from other parts of the United Kingdom. It is not about immigration from outside the UK; it is overwhelmingly immigration from the rest of the county. In some parts of the country, some houses are being demolished because no one wants to live on certain estates. In our area, there is an attempt to cram in houses. Authorities see a field and think &quot;Housing estate.&quot; That is the state of the unbalanced economic growth taking place in our country.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/2">People sometimes ask me where I believe the jobs and the houses should go. I certainly believe that 21,000 should go in South Gloucestershire, but what about the excess? If the economy was not so unbalanced&mdash;if the United Kingdom was not like a big see-saw, tilting towards the bottom&mdash;we might have a more measured housing policy. At present, it is about trying to cram extra people in and not about local need. It seems like predict and provide&mdash;just as with the roads and the airports. We have had more houses and more jobs: let us have more houses and more jobs&mdash;and more houses, and more jobs: in 2026, another 20,000 for the next 20 years. Is there any limit? Will we have reached it when we hit another 21,000?</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/3">I shall focus on only two or three specific issues, as I know that many other hon. Members wish to speak. The first is that of the green belt.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/4">Last year, the Prime Minister was very reassuring&mdash;honestly. He said that he would &quot;robustly defend&quot; the green belt. We all sleep better in our beds at night knowing that the Prime Minister will robustly defend the green belt. Sure enough, on page 75 of the document we read:</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/5" class="indent">&quot;The general extent of the Bristol and Bath Green Belt will be maintained&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/6">We are greatly reassured by that&mdash;until we read the next phrase, which contains the words:</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/7" class="indent">&quot;subject to the following alterations: Removal of the green belt to accommodate urban extensions at Areas of Search 1A, IB, 1C, ID, IF and 1G&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/8">The only reason that 1E is not in the list is because it is not in the green belt. The document says that the green belt will be kept except when it gets in the way: the green belt is fine except that we want to get rid of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/9">Many of my constituents say that the green belt is vital, especially in areas that have seen rapid development and urbanisation. Once that principle is breached, however, the area will never be the same again. It is vital for quality of life&mdash;for mental, physical and spiritual well-being&mdash;and not only for those who live in the countryside. It is particularly important for those who live in the towns and cities. It is not about country dwellers throwing up the barriers and saying, &quot;Leave our green spaces alone.&quot; People who live in Bristol want to keep the Bristol green belt; it is not only those who live in the countryside. If the proposal goes ahead, communities such as the village of Shortwood in my constituency, which is in the green belt, would simply be wiped off the map by a sprawling housing estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/10">I discovered this morning&mdash;in a document of this size, there is always something new to discover&mdash;that the housing density for what are called urban extensions, which we know as fields, is 50 dwellings per hectare. That means going up, and not only sideways. There is obviously a trade-off. We do not want completely to cover all the fields. However, the document means high density housing going up, which will have an even more conspicuous impact on the landscape, and specifically so in the green belt areas. The green belt is a fundamental issue of principle.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/11">I ask the Minister a key question, of which I have given him notice. If any of our local authorities zone all those areas for housing, which will be expected of them, will the developers be able to say, &quot;You have created space for 32,000 houses. The first house we build will be put on the prime bit of green belt, which we have never been allowed to touch before&quot;? Or will they be able to say, &quot;Hang on a minute. There are lots of other brownfield sites and urban areas that you should use first&quot;? I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us at least that once the areas are zoned a local authority will not lose on appeal if it says no to a green belt development simply because of a failure to apply a sequential approach.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right&mdash;the area is already incredibly congested.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/2">I am sure that the Minister will respond by saying that somebody will improve public transport. The company was not sure whether it could provide extra trains in the morning. I asked whether it could double the number of morning peak journeys from Yate to Bristol and how many people it could actually get into Bristol. The company said it could carry only 140 more people. There will be 3,000 houses, but only 140 more people could be accommodated on journeys. The other 3,000 or so commuters&mdash;there will be some jobs in the area, but most people will commute&mdash;will not be going on trains, and buses are infrequent and expensive. Of course the Minister could do more, but has anybody really done the math, as Americans would say, to match the two numbers? It is not good enough to say, &quot;We will build 3,000 houses and improve public transport.&quot; The roads out of Yate cannot be widened without knocking down houses. It is not a question of doing something that one is determined to do&mdash;physically, there simply is no room. Who is going to listen when we say no? Infrastructure is critical.</p>

	<p pid="a.34.1/1">I welcome the common ground that is being found today among all parties and from all parts of the region. There is good reason for the Minister to listen, and I accept the hon. Gentleman's point.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.1/2">The overall number of houses proposed is going up, up, up, and it is debatable. The growth premise of the regional spatial strategy must surely be reviewed in light of what is happening. I appreciate that it is a 20-year prediction, but the predicted growth rate of 3.2 per cent. appears to be totally out of line. I endorse the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon that there is uncertainty about exactly what the report of the examination in public says. It certainly seems to me that it implies that there is now no necessity to look for brown field sites first. We must have clarification on that point today.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.1/3">I endorse my hon. Friend's point about infrastructure. The change that the Secretary of State has brought to my area would remove any infrastructure requirements. In some ways, there is some practicality about that because, for example, the roads cannot be greatly improved without their impinging on the heathland. However, given the congestion during the tourism season, the provision of all the proposed extra housing without any extra roads is absolutely impossible to comprehend.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.1/4">Purbeck's target has been increased during the process, from what the local councils agreed, by 145 per cent. Purbeck is one of the most constrained areas for development in the country, so it is an impossible proposal. In addition to the Purbeck housing, there are proposals with which some local councils originally agreed, but not at local community level, such as those for 700 new homes in Corfe Mullen, and a further 1,000 in east Dorset, at Wimborne and Colehill, which are located in beautiful green belt areas. I think that everyone believes that if the proposals go ahead they will represent the destruction of beautiful areas for ever. We do not have faith in the process by which we have reached this point. I urgently ask the Minister to reconsider, and to listen to the many representations that are being made. Let us get back to making our decisions at local community level.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.0/1">Because of the time constraints and the fact that so many hon. Members want to speak I shall keep my remarks very brief.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.0/2">I was at a meeting of Unite activists last week, many of whom came from the constituency of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" name="Laurence Robertson">the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase>. I thought I was there to answer questions on the economy, employment and trade union rights, but we spent half an hour talking about how unfair they thought the proposals were to impose housing development on the flood plain, particularly in the Tewkesbury area. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister realises that this is not an issue that will go into the long grass; it is a burning problem in our area, because people feel very strongly. <i>[Interruption.]</i> We get those as well, with the floods. The issue will not go away and we must face up to the fact that housing development in Gloucestershire&mdash;but obviously the whole RSS&mdash;is highly controversial.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.0/3">I want to make some very specific points, the first of which is quite critical of local government. I understand where the South West of England Regional Development Agency and the Government office for the south-west are coming from in relation to the RSS, but there are local government representatives on the RSS and I want to know why their voices were not heard, apparently, until the plan came back with everyone against it. I should like to know who was on the RSS, and what they had to say. Were they were part of the proposals? Did they walk out? Did they not turn up? Did they express their anger? If they did not, I want to know why not, because either local government is part of the process or it might as well give up completely. That is my criticism of local government, but it does not enable us to escape from the fact that we have a problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.0/4">Principally&mdash;I know that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1595" name="Parmjit Dhanda">the Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda)</phrase> will say something on this point if he is called to speak&mdash;we were very angry about the way in which a site-specific recommendation was brought forward, in relation to the RSS, for Whaddon, which is in my constituency but happens to abut Gloucester city. I could make the point that that is entirely the responsibility of Stroud district council, because it has been obsessed with pushing the Hunts Grove development, which, again, is concentrating development on the southern rim of Gloucester, but it should not be making site-specific recommendations in connection with the RSS.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-07a.58.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="58"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081007/halltext/81007h0009.htm#08100731000582">
	<p pid="a.58.1/1">You will be aware, Mr. Key, that I applied for this debate before the recess, so I had a chance to prepare a Castro-like peroration, which I have had to condense to a mere 20 minutes or so.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/2">How we handle complaints about councillors&mdash;their reputation and integrity&mdash;is a big subject. I think we all agree that there was probably never a time when there were no complaints, every elected representative was considered to be a pillar of the community and integrity was presupposed, but there have been eras with less scrutiny and transparency than today. In Southport, we had our own council for many decades, but even that council had unfortunate episodes featuring a certain Mr. Poulson and prominent councillors, some of whom I am sad to say were Liberals and got themselves into trouble. Some of them went to jail.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/3">I was a councillor for 13 years, party leader and eventually council leader. I can honestly say that during my time on Sefton council, which now covers Southport, I detected no corruption and was genuinely impressed by the rigorous checks and balances, particularly when finance and contracts were involved. During that period there were plenty of development and contestable planning applications, but that may not have been the pattern elsewhere, although I believe that it was the general pattern throughout the UK. It was probably less obviously the pattern where councils were a one-party state, and decisions were not necessarily made in the open, and transfers of political power were not seriously contested or were a foregone conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/4">I do not deny that during that period there was a litany of sad cases in journals such as <i>Private Eye</i>, which detailed some of the things that went wrong, but my view was that councillors are genuinely people of integrity by and large, and that councils are generally free of corruption. Notwithstanding that, I have encountered&mdash;and still encounter&mdash;members of the public who assure me that corruption is the norm and seem not to think it insulting to say so volubly, even in the presence of public servants who administer public affairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/5">The reality for most councillors is that there is not much glory or respect at the moment, but a lot of hard work, many complaints and sometimes little recognition for addressing those complaints and dealing with them. They accept, by and large, that the ultimate judge of their worth is the electorate, who hire and fire them. For years, that assessment has been thought to be sufficient. Councillors have been subject to criminal, constitutional, civil and administrative law, and ultimately the electorate's verdict. For many years, that recipe stood councillors in good stead and ensured that they were good citizens and that councils were run openly, transparently and legitimately. However, it was thought, as much by the Labour Government as anyone else, not to work too well when elections were uncontested or a foregone conclusion. Some people believed that the Labour Government did not do enough in such circumstances to raise the standards and calibre of councillors. Without being too blunt about it, it was thought that drunks, thugs and venial people were sometimes elected notwithstanding the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/6">The idea of a standards board moved up the agenda and eventually became law. An alternative might have been to make the electoral system more vital and elections more contested in areas where corruption had set in or was more apparent. The basic idea of a standards board is to have a code of conduct and a set of desirable principles and qualities for public life that can be modestly stated, agreed and observed by all. That was accepted, at least initially, as a rational solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/7">When I first became an MP, I was surprised to receive, as I am sure did other hon. Members, a huge bundle of forms for my surgery from the Standards Board for England inciting people to lodge formal complaints. I could not imagine their all being used legitimately or being required. That annoyed me a little because my observation is that very few councillors merit a formal complaint, although I can think of a few members of the public who could use the whole package and still ask for more.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/8">I raised that experience at the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1752" name="Phil Woolas">the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas)</phrase> was the Minister in charge. By and large, he agreed that such touting for custom was not the way to proceed because it was a heavy-handed approach and led to complaints being used as an electoral and political tool, with complaints often being made just prior to or during elections, and so on. It also led to overload of the Standards Board and had a lack of clarity, particularly about whether complaints were legitimate because they involved a councillor's public role, or were simply applied to a councillor as a person. Councillors do not have to be saints, but there was lack of clarity about whether they should be judged on their public performance as a councillor or their behaviour as a private individual, and those two aspects of their lives were not always significantly differentiated.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/9">I supported the change in law that suggested that local determination and local committees provided a better process for the less serious complaints. The reasons struck me as persuasive at the time. First, local committees had a better understanding of local government issues, and some of the original members of the Standards Board had an almost unworldly character. Secondly, politically motivated complaints were likely to be scented out fairly early and seen for what they were.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/10">I am questioning now whether local determination is leading to an unacceptable variation in practice, whether the rules, legislation and statutory instruments circumscribing it allow for that, and whether the Government and the Standards Board, which still has an overall watching brief, recognise that and are prepared to tolerate it or wish to redress the balance and deal with the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/11">The best way to illustrate that is to refer again to my local borough, Sefton, as an example. Its references to the local standards committee have reached almost epidemic proportions. Having served on that council, I regard that with bemusement because the vast majority of councillors are decent and some are almost saintly, although I must add that an ex-mayor recently went to jail for a criminal offence, but that is not typical in Sefton.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/12">The worst Standards Board case that I recall in Sefton in recent times is of one councillor threatening to &quot;get&quot; another after a meeting. During the poll tax period when the atmosphere on many councils could be fairly abrasive, I remember a senior councillor threatening to rip the arm from a colleague of mine during a policy and resources meeting, which continued unfazed with no one commenting because the event was not imminent.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/13">The stricture in this case and the Standards Board's activities may be a sign of genuine progress if it persuades councillors to behave more politely and rationally. However, most cases in Sefton never get as far as having a verdict determined or a positive finding reached, usually on the permitted ground that complaints as stated do not justify the expense of investigating them. That is a kind of catch-all clause because it can apply irrespective of the complexity of the case. In other words, a complaint might be quite trivial and easy to bottom out, but because it is quite trivial it might be discarded on the grounds that the expense simply is not worth it, even though the expense might be relatively trivial.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/14">Complaints have sometimes been rejected on the grounds that defamatory comment is robust debate, which leaves councillors genuinely uncertain about what the limitations of robust debate are. Occasionally, a formal complaint has been dismissed simply on the grounds that it is political, without mentioning the substance of the complaint itself. The common thread through many of these cases is the avoidance of a finding of fact, which is a crucial element of the decisions to be made. That leaves a twofold level of uncertainty for members: whether the conduct as described took place or whether it is simply an allegation, and even if the allegation took place, if such a verdict is arrived at, whether it would be a breach of the code. I find that somewhat unsatisfactory. At the end of the day, if the rulings do not leave councillors more certain about where they stand and what to do, the system is not working as well as it could.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/15">This situation has not stopped decision notices failing to make it clear that no finding of fact has taken place. I would like to mention one case. A charge or allegation was made against an experienced and respected councillor, for which there was no finding of fact. In effect, the complaint was thrown out, but the offences that he might have been guilty of, if he had been guilty, were listed at length. In addition, there was a suggestion that he went on a course that might or might not have been appropriate to the issue. There was no verdict or finding of fact, but the person concerned found he could not appeal against what was obviously an acquittal and the political opposition had a feast day in the press at his expense. That is a grotesque failure of natural justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/16">I suspect that all that case illustrates is that the local standards committees in Sefton and other places are under pressure, and that is not helped if frivolous complaints emerge or a tit-for-tat culture prevails. I suspect that the experiences of those in Sefton are not particularly unique and that such problems are occurring elsewhere. The foibles of the local committees can be as various and arbitrary as premier league referees are considered to be by football teams, in relation to which the same uncertainty and difficulties prevail. However, there is one important difference, and this is a very serious thing: the reputation of councillors is at stake. That is very important to councillors, not just because of their electoral prospects, but because of how they feel about themselves and how their families feel about them.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/17">My plea is essentially that the Government should assess, monitor and record this demonstrably imperfect quasi-judicial system. My suspicion is that the standards boards are not setting the clear standards in performance, practice or outcome that we all desire.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-07a.61.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" speakername="Sadiq Khan" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government"  colnum="61"  time="013:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081007/halltext/81007h0010.htm#08100731000583">
	<p pid="a.61.0/1">It is a pleasure, Mr. Key, to speak with you in the Chair the first time that I respond to a debate in my new role. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> on securing this debate. He and I served on the Public Accounts Committee, on which he still sits, and I am grateful to have the opportunity to discuss the conduct regime for members of local authorities in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/2">I am aware that the hon. Gentleman takes a keen interest in this matter, not only because of his 13 years as a councillor in Sefton, but as a member of the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government. This is the first Adjournment debate on the important issue of standards since the new regime, and it is particularly welcome as it gives me the opportunity not only to get off the mark, but to reassert the Government's support for the conduct regime for local authority members. I would also like to mention the Government's gratitude for the hard work of the Standards Board for England and the work of local authority standards committees. In the same way that premiership referees are not thanked enough, local authority standards committees are not thanked enough, and therefore I would like to thank them this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/3">It is now almost six months since the Government devolved responsibility for dealing with the conduct of local authority members to local authorities themselves, so it is an apt time to hold this debate. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on the tenor and spirit in which his comments were made. To be blunt, there is only one thing in the history he articulated with which I would disagree. As someone who was a councillor for only 12 years, I can say that the events in Wandsworth were nowhere near as flowery and colourful as they appear to have been in Sefton. I cannot think of one occasion on which anyone was threatened with having their arms ripped off, but I will check with other colleagues about whether that happened in Wandsworth.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/4">This debate gives me the opportunity to mention the extremely effective alternative action procedures, which are a fundamental aspect of the conduct regime and generally work well. The vast majority of people elected to serve as local authority members observe the highest standards of conduct, as do the officials who support them. I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman addressed that in his speech and made the point that there might be problems with only a minority of councillors or officials. Trust in our local authority members is one of the cornerstones of healthy local democracy. Voters expect the local authority members for whom they voted to represent their interests and to behave with honesty and integrity, which is why actively promoting high standards of behaviour among local authority members is an important Government objective, and it is not a duty we take lightly.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/5">The strength of local democracy and the delivery of effective services depend very much on an elected members' willingness to serve and on their commitment. It would be awful if hurdles and barriers were put in the way to stop people or deter them from coming forward to stand for local government and become local councillors. Many men and women devote their time and energy to the service of their communities as local authority members and, as stated in the recent White Paper, &quot;Communities in Control: real people, real power&quot;, we want more people to take on civic roles and to stand for office in their local authority. We also want to ensure that local authority members are an able, enthusiastic and diverse group and that local representatives reflect the communities they serve.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/6">In this country, we have high standards of probity, accountability and objectivity. That is part of the natural expectations of those we vote for, and it is enshrined in the conduct regime. However, we cannot ignore the fact that failings do occur from time to time, and there have been cases, albeit rare, where the conduct of local authority members has fallen short of the expectations placed upon them. When such misconduct occurs, it damages both the community that the local authority members were elected to serve and the wider reputation of local government. The public's trust and confidence in the democratic system as a whole is undermined.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/7">The hon. Gentleman alluded to the conduct regime, which was introduced in the Local Government Act 2000 to promote high standards of ethical behaviour by local authority members. The regime gives a clear ethical framework for local authority members to work within and makes clear to the electorate the standards of behaviour they can expect from those they vote into office. The regime also clarifies what constitutes acceptable standards of behaviour and has introduced an independent, robust and fair means of investigating allegations of misconduct. A regime was set up for dealing with those who have fallen short of acceptable standards of behaviour, and that regime is evolving.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/8">Last year, a revised code of conduct for local authority members was issued to provide a clearer, simpler and more proportionate code&mdash;I emphasise the word &quot;proportionate&quot;. That code removed barriers to members being able to speak up for those they represent, for example on planning and licensing issues, and it has been well received by the local government world. All local authority members must abide by that code of conduct, which has been in place for over a year now, and my Department&mdash;I say that on just my second day in this role&mdash;has just gone out to consultation on it. We are asking for views on how it is functioning and how it might be improved. In May this year, the Government fulfilled their White Paper commitment to introduce a more locally based conduct regime for members that co-opted members of local authorities in England. The devolution of responsibility for conduct issues to local authorities provides them with greater ownership of the conduct regime and local conduct issues, and boosts their role in promoting and maintaining a culture of high standards of behaviour in local authorities.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-07a.70.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" speakername="Linda Gilroy" colnum="70"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081007/halltext/81007h0011.htm#08100731000592">
	<p pid="a.70.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. That is the only way in which to bring quality into that sector of housing in Plymouth, and I support it.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/2">There are some excellent private landlords in the city, and the city council has worked well alongside them to transform the landscape of the traditional private rented sector. Plymouth's award-winning empty homes team have a variety of projects, including the HouseLet programme, and since 2003 they have secured private sector houses for 505 families through a highly successful leasing scheme. That is a model of exceptionally good practice and merits support for growth in the present climate.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/3">I was prompted to look into housing in Plymouth by, among other things, a Saturday morning roving surgery that brought me face to face with a woman who had moved, with her children, five times in five years in the private rented sector. Shorthold tenancies can run counter to the good work that is being done to support families, so I hope that the Government are serious about reviewing them.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/4">Support for voluntary downsizing could also release a lot of family-sized homes. I do not want the forced removal of tenants to smaller homes, and would fight against any such move, but some home owners and tenants who want to live in smaller, lower-cost, better-maintained homes are often prevented from doing so by bureaucracy, petty rules, petty sums of finance, or simply the lack of someone to offer advice and practical help. There are better ways to manage such demand to the benefit of both the tenant who moves and the tenant who is waiting for a larger home. It would be a big help if support services could free up even a third of what I believe to be around 1,000 two to three-bedroomed houses in Plymouth.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/5">The turbulence in the world markets and the credit crunch do not take away the need for more homes in the UK. It is vital that the Government face up to the challenge of maintaining their programme of house building in such difficult circumstances. More than anything, my report brought home to those involved in its drafting that if we do not get things right now, we will condemn a generation to a housing market with limited, and sometimes no, choice. By restoring the rungs on the bottom of the house ownership ladder, we would facilitate both things. By enabling house purchase and shared equity, especially of the CLT variety, the pressure on renting, particularly in the social sector, is relieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/6">I know that the Minister will continue to engage with and champion these issues. There is a need for a step change in the pace and urgency with which some things that I have mentioned happen, particularly ensuring that the potential of CLTs is released. I am pleased that the Government stepped up and defined CLTs legally, and now is the time to ensure that they happen, which requires further work and commitment from all of us.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.0/1">I appreciate the position that my hon. Friend is in, but given that we are not quite as mob-handed as those in the earlier debate, may I impress upon him how incredibly important the matter is to a city that is ready and willing to build new houses, and needs them to make the city work?</p>
