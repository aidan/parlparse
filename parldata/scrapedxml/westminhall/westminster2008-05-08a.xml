<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-05-08a.311.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1789" speakername="Kevin Barron" colnum="311"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080508/halltext/80508h0001.htm#08050854000254">
	<p pid="a.311.2/1">To preface the debate, I thank the secretariat of the Select Committee on Health, whose seven members have worked hard for us. I also thank our three advisers on the report&mdash;Professor Joe Collier, Professor Alan Maynard and Dr. Hilary Pickles&mdash;who gave us excellent advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/2">The report took some time to gather. We had some 124 memorandums and 31 witnesses, and we visited Scotland, France and Canada&mdash;I am not sure whether it was in that order. On our visit to Canada to see similar organisations, their representatives spoke in glowing terms about the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, saying not only that NICE co-operates well with Canada but that it is leading large areas of the world in assessment and the use of drugs in the health care system. I ought to put on record that NICE's international co-operation does it and the United Kingdom proud.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/3">I will make some general comments about the report&mdash;what we were considering, and what we found&mdash;and the Government's response, and then I will probably pose a few questions that my right hon. Friend the Minister may wish to reply to, either during this debate or later. We examined the work of NICE. Members will know that NICE was established in 1999. We found that in the eight years since it was established, in response to internal and external review, NICE has shown itself ready to change. Initially, it appraised technologies, mainly medicines, and produced clinical guidelines. Its remit was soon expanded to cover interventional procedures. Subsequently, technology appraisals were made mandatory and the single technology appraisal was established to speed up the evaluation process. Since 2004, it has also examined public health issues. It is in no way an organisation that has been static since it was set up. Indeed, it has responded positively to many issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/4">During our inquiry, we received a good deal of evidence that NICE is carrying out many of its functions effectively. However, NICE also has its critics, which is one of the reasons why we undertook the inquiry. We examined three main areas of relevant concern&mdash;the evaluation process, the affordability of guidance and implementation. In addition, after the Office of Fair Trading report on the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme, we decided to consider NICE's potential role in such a new system, although I must say that at the time, I believed that if the PPRS were to be renegotiated and not removed, we would not necessarily have to spend much time on that. I will say something about that later.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/5">We identified several problems with the evaluation process. The first is topic selection. Only a few selected medical technologies are chosen as suitable for assessment as technology appraisals. There is also far too little emphasis on disinvestment. I think that we trod on one or two toes when we commented on that in our report, but the Health Committee has previously considered NICE and commented on disinvestment. A few older treatments do no good at all, and many of them are not cost-effective. Because NICE selects what it assesses, we might be able to disinvest more than we do.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/6">The wider benefits of treatment to society&mdash;for example, issues involving the cost of carers&mdash;are not included in NICE's cost-benefit analyses. I could go on from there. We used the specific example of carers, but in taking evidence, we often asked questions about employment, and whether that would be taken into account in determining the cost-effectiveness of keeping somebody, maybe a family member, in work. It was a bit difficult, but we did not draw up a shopping list. There are probably wider issues that could also be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/7">NICE often does not have all the information that it needs to make a full assessment. It does not have access to all the information used by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, and clinical trials are usually designed without NICE's work on cost-effectiveness in mind. We made some specific recommendations on that point that have not gone down particularly well, and I may return to that later.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/8">Experts are not used well. That is not a criticism of the experts involved in NICE. Members will remember that in challenges in the courts, clinicians who advise NICE have often been criticised by other clinicians. We thought that that was unfair, because it is a trap for someone advising NICE on a particular issue. We heard that criticism, which also came out in the media. Some of us have been to lobbies in this place and heard people say that the right people had not given NICE evidence during its assessment procedures. I have mentioned the names of three people who advised us on the report. They were with us all the time, and they helped us to gather witnesses and put the report together, but in the end, they took no part in the final decision. However, our advisers were constant. We wondered whether NICE ought to consider using experts in that way, instead of asking them to give an opinion as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/9">Publication of guidance is slow. Licensed medicines are often not prescribed while primary care trusts and clinicians wait for NICE to make a decision. Again, some of the challenges involve that issue. The industry calls that NICE blight, because it takes so long for decisions to be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/10">We made a number of recommendations to address the problems. Key among them was that a system is needed under which all medicines are assessed at launch. A shorter, less in-depth evaluation should be made between licensing authorisation and marketing, so that clinicians can prescribe useful and cost-effective drugs as soon as they are launched. A lower cost per quality adjusted life year threshold should be employed during early assessment to ensure that only the most cost-effective and clinically effective products are available straight away. A full appraisal should be made thereafter, so that the threshold can be increased, if that is warranted.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/11">In order to ensure that NICE has the information that it needs, it should have access to the same material used by the licensing body, clinical trials should be registered and NICE and the pharmaceutical industry should work more closely. That is particularly important to the effective assessment of drugs in time for launch. I recognise that that could involve major problems. Pharmaceutical companies are not all based here, and their way of doing research and development might not be easily read over, but discussions could be held with them to see whether some international consensus is possible, so that assessors&mdash;not only NICE but people doing the same job in other parts of the world&mdash;could use a measurable framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/12">We recommended that more be done to encourage disinvestment. No evaluation of older, possibly cost-ineffective therapies has taken place to date, although two are under way. As I have mentioned, our predecessors on the Committee made the same recommendation. We would like to be convinced that NICE is moving a bit quicker.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/13">In our last report on NICE, we also recommended that the legislation be changed to accommodate the need to ensure that assessments of products take account of the wider benefits to society. We have made that recommendation again. The affordability of NICE guidance and the threshold that NICE uses to decide whether a treatment is cost-effective are of serious concern. It has been in the headlines practically throughout NICE's life. The threshold is not based on empirical research and is not directly related to the national health service budget. It seems to be higher than the threshold used by PCTs for treatment not assessed by NICE.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/14">We heard from witnesses, including those from patients' organisations and pharmaceutical companies, who thought that NICE should be more generous with its cost per quality threshold and approve more products. On the other hand, some PCTs struggle to implement NICE guidance at the current threshold, and other witnesses argued that a lower one should be used. We recommend that the threshold used by NICE in its full assessment should be reviewed. Further research comparing PCT thresholds with those used by NICE should also be undertaken. That is denied in the response, but we believe that we have found enough evidence&mdash;although perhaps not concrete evidence&mdash;that NICE uses levels that are different from some PCTs. We also believe that an independent body should determine the threshold used when making judgments on the value of technologies to the NHS. I shall return to that subject at the end of my opening remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/15">The implementation of non-mandatory guidance is variable, owing to a variety of causes, including the threshold used by NICE for determining cost-effectiveness, a lack of clarity about the status of guidance, a lack of involvement by PCTs in the development of guidance and disagreements between clinicians about the worth of some of NICE's guidelines. I have no doubt that that has been the case for the eight years that NICE has existed. However, there is a glimmer of hope that people will start to concentrate on implementation a little more. NICE is not the only body that needs to act, and the entire health care community should take part as well. I do not know whether the Darzi review of the NHS will consider that, but some of the Committees that Lord Darzi is using are obviously made up of clinicians. Lessons should be learned from that about ensuring that PCTs are engaged and have ownership of some of NICE's procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/16">To improve the implementation of NICE guidance, we have recommended more help for PCTs, better assessment of the level of uptake, a larger role for PCTs in development, the better use of experts in development and a change in the terminology used by NICE to clarify to patients what they can expect by right from their local NHS organisation. We also recommend that elements of clinical guidelines be made mandatory. A suitable example is risk assessment for all patients at risk of developing venous thromboembolism.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/17">Some of the problems with affordability and the implementation of NICE guidance relate to the price of medicines. As I have mentioned, the OFT recently recommended that a new system of value-based medicine prices replace the PPRS. We found support for that, but there were concerns about how it would work in practice. We understand that discussions between the Government and the pharmaceutical industry are under way, so our report makes no large-scale recommendations for the new scheme. However, we agree with the Government that better mechanisms are needed to ensure that the NHS pays a fair and affordable price for medicines. We also recommend that NICE should be involved in any new system and that any change to its remit should be adequately resourced. I shall ask a few questions about that at the end of my remarks, but I want to say now that although we did not consider that in great detail, we believe that NICE ought to assist in any major changes, if there are to be any.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/18">We concluded that NICE does a vital job in difficult circumstances. The development of more and more health technologies and procedures, alongside rising patient expectations and the ageing population, will make it even more difficult in the future. Health care budgets in England, as in other countries, are limited. Patients cannot expect to receive every possible treatment, and demand outstrips resources and priorities have to be determined. In other words, rationing is essential, and NICE has a key role to play. In the past, NICE has changed in response to new challenges, and we are sure that it can do so again. Given the difficult environment, NICE requires the backing of the Government. It also needs Ministers to support it&mdash;not to seek to undermine it. It must not be left to fight a lone battle to support cost-effectiveness and clinical effectiveness in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/19">The Government's response was generally supportive, certainly in tone, but it was non-committal about some of the details. Of course, much depends on the Government's decision about the PPRS. The response to our recommendation about quality adjusted life years is not untypical:</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/20" class="indent">&quot;The government will consider with NICE the need for further research&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/21">That is fine, but we are unlikely to look again at the pharmaceutical industry or NICE in the near future. Furthermore, the Care Quality Commission will consider inspection of the implementation of NICE guidance. This morning, we actually interviewed the Government's nominee to take over the chair of the CQC.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/22">The Government rejected a number of our recommendations, such as the recommendation that a separate mechanism be put in place to advise on the cost per quality adjusted life year range and that NICE be given the right to see all the evidence used by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The Government pointed out that several of the Committee's recommendations are matters for NICE, including the use of experts, information for consultees and the use of implementation consultants. We accept that.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/23">It was unusual and pleasing that NICE itself submitted a response to our report, for which I thank those responsible&mdash;I see that at least one of them is within earshot. We decided this morning that we will publish its response, in the same way that the Government publish their response&mdash;although, probably not with a crown on it. The NICE response accepts some of our recommendations, but stresses that it is already doing much that the Committee urged it to do. For example, on topic selection, it does not focus excessively on expensive drugs. Furthermore, it is looking at disinvestment, the issue of experts and information about processes to consultees. Like the Government, however, it also rejects a number of what we believe to be key recommendations, notably on early &quot;rough and ready&quot;&mdash;I think that that is what it called it&mdash;appraisal of all drugs at launch.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/24">As I said, we visited Scotland and the Scottish Medicines Consortium&mdash;this is probably more a matter for the Department than for NICE. People often tell those of us who represent English constituencies about how quickly drugs are available in Scotland, as opposed to those appraised by NICE. We effectively, without mirroring it exactly, made recommendations that would introduce in England something not dissimilar to the system in Scotland. That recommendation was knocked back not only by those who responded statutorily to our report, but by the pharmaceutical industry itself. If the latter is listening, I say to it that we cannot have NICE blight here when everything is better in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/25">When we make recommendations that are not too dissimilar from what is happening in Scotland, we do not want the kind of response that we got from its trade body, which opposed the recommendation on the grounds that it looked &quot;quick and dirty&quot;&mdash;I think that those were the words that it used. Quite frankly, however, we can only do the assessments that we did, and the matter will probably need to be looked at further by the Government, the pharmaceutical industry and NICE, because something needs to be done. There is a constant clamour, not necessarily from the pharmaceutical industry, but from patients groups and constituents asking, &quot;Why are we waiting so long for a drug that is available in Glasgow or Edinburgh?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/26">NICE also rejected our recommendation on the threshold. It suggests that its threshold is not out of line with those used by PCTs. I said earlier, &quot;some PCTs&quot;, but I still believe that we saw evidence for that in our inquiry. Recommendations 2 and 25 refer to NICE's role and use the R-word&mdash;rationing. They deal with rationing arrangements and essentially ask the Government to work with NICE to make those arrangements clear to the public. In neither of her responses, does the Minister use the word &quot;rationing&quot;. Effectively, she has dodged the issue in this very big public debate. The Government's response avoids using the word, and one or two members of the Committee&mdash;I will not look round&mdash;found it difficult to accept that we should use that word in the report and in the conclusion, but rationing is what NICE does.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/27">Rationing has been around inside the national health service for nearly 60 years, and we all recognise that fact. It would be better if we were to have an open debate about rationing inside the national health service, instead of talking about &quot;postcode prescribing.&quot; Some people think, &quot;If I moved across the road or down the way, I would be able to get this drug.&quot; We should have an open and honest debate about why people contact us and say, &quot;Why can I not have a drug in this particular PCT, but I can have one next door?&quot; If we take on the issue, we will better serve the public. The Minister may ration her response when she speaks later, but I personally think that we should have such a debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/28">In the response to recommendations 15 and 16, in which we asked for a more rapid and non-selective appraisal of all known drugs and for guidance on each drug to be made available at its launch, the Government said:</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/29" class="indent">&quot;The Government continues to work with NICE to ensure that the STA process works as it should.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/30">That is fine. I am very happy with that, but will the Minister tell us exactly what she means when she says that the Government will work with NICE in considering this area? Has she any specific ideas about what they will be looking at?</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/31">The Government's position on NICE's work on disinvestment is not too clear, but the Minister said that she was keen for NICE to give a high priority to that activity. In view of the history, I wonder whether there is a mechanism by which the Government can consider the question of disinvestment.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/32">In recommendation 36, we asked for a separate independent body to review the threshold that NICE uses when it decides whether to make a medicine available to the NHS. Effectively, we wanted a one-off review of thresholds. We wanted to know how those thresholds fit with the NHS budget as a whole and with non-NICE-related purchasing decisions made by trusts, and to assess on what grounds the thresholds might vary. We believe very strongly in that proposal, but the Government dismissed it:</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/33" class="indent">&quot;The Government is not convinced that any potential benefits of establishing a separate mechanism of the kind envisaged by the committee outweigh the likely disadvantages.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/34">The recommendation may have been badly worded. It was not our intention to have a separate body for ever, but we wanted some independent tests of the thresholds. The question whether our constituents are being treated fairly by the national health service goes round and round in the media. If the Government do not think that there is a need for a standing mechanism to consider thresholds, could we assess them and get them independently tested, so that there is another voice in the debate?</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/35">In recommendation 30, we argued that there is public confusion about the status of the various types of advice published by NICE. The Government's response says that they will</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/36" class="indent">&quot;consider further whether there is more appropriate terminology.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/37">The Government do not say that they disagree with us about the public confusion. If they do not disagree, then there must be some better terminology that we can use&mdash;that sounds a bit taut, so perhaps I will revisit that later. I say to my right hon. Friend the Minister that unless the Government say that there is no public confusion, there must be something there. We think that the public would be better served by better terminology.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/38">Last but not least, I want to revisit our old friend, the PPRS, and consider what is happening at the moment. As I have said twice, we did not look at the matter in any great depth. We had one evidence session on the likely outcome of the Government's reaction to the OFT report. If we had thought that they were going to implement the OFT report, we would probably still be taking evidence now.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/39">As a distraction from the other things that were going on last Thursday, I read this headline in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, &quot;Drug makers hit out at new pricing deal&quot;. It has since come to my notice that in March, a letter was sent out to 180 companies, which had participated in the PPRS, officially terminating the present scheme from September 2008. That was not my understanding of the situation when we were taking evidence. I did not know that the PPRS was to be terminated, and I would have accepted its renegotiation. I do not have the Government's press statement on the issue, but I was very surprised to read that headline. I must say to my right hon. Friend that I recently met the new president of the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industries. I was not prompted by him to bring up the matter; I was prompted by what the retiring president said in the press. We are ripping up the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme, which has stood the test of time&mdash;some 50 years now. The scheme has loosely held together the pharmaceutical industry, which is a credit to this country and a great arm of ours when it comes to manufacturing and selling abroad. The Minister will have seen some of the first-class research and development that is done in this small nation of ours&mdash;in many areas, it is world class. I was surprised to see that, effectively, the PPRS had ended, and I assume that some sort of voluntary agreement will replace it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-05-08a.320.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" speakername="Richard Taylor" colnum="320"  time="014:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080508/halltext/80508h0002.htm#08050854000267">
	<p pid="a.320.3/1">Oh! I have no information about how much those people get paid. No doubt some of guests in the Public Gallery might tell us afterwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.3/2">I understand that NICE has an implementation directorate and an interactive costing tool. I do not know&mdash;perhaps the Minister does&mdash;whether that applies just to mandatory technology appraisals, to voluntary guidelines, or both.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.3/3">Recommendation 27 deals with the better measurement of guidance implementation. At the moment, the Healthcare Commission relies on those involved declaring that they have implemented NICE guidance, and I wonder how the care quality commission will deal with that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.3/4">I was delighted that our Chairman took the bull by the horns and used the word &quot;rationing&quot;. Some people might remember that I tried some time ago to secure an Adjournment debate about rationing in the NHS, but somebody&mdash;I still do not know who&mdash;changed the title to prioritisation, so my debate was about that, rather than rationing. We must face up to the issue of rationing. In one of its responses, NICE stressed the importance of disinvestment and of looking at investment and disinvestment opportunities, which really comes down to rationing.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.3/5">To finish, my one regret about the report is that we shied away from QALYs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios&mdash;we were probably scared of delving into the unfathomable mathematics of calculating them. After we completed our inquiry, I received a piece of paper that had fallen off the back of a lorry, but it confused me even more. It gave figures from the Southampton university health technology assessment for the cost per QALY of three anti-dementia or Alzheimer's drugs. I can understand why the cost of all three was pretty high&mdash;when people are not convinced that a drug works or that it has much benefit, the cost per QALY will be high&mdash;but I could not understand why it was so extraordinarily different for all three. As we have recently learned, the Appeal Court has ruled in favour of the makers of the one of the drugs for Alzheimer's. I hope that that will bring into the open a little more about how the cost per QALY is worked out, because unless we know that, a little of the transparency that we want, and which NICE is aiming for, will be missing.</p>

	<p pid="a.321.0/1">I shall start by paraphrasing Kryten from the TV series &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. There are two problems facing every health care system in the world: first, it is impossible to meet every need and, secondly, it is impossible to meet every need. I realise that, technically, that is only one point, but it is such a good one that it is worth making twice. The fact is that no system in the world can ever meet every competing need; indeed, if it did, that would prove that it was failing. One of the drivers of change in the health service is the constant striving for improvement, for better value for money and for better patient care. That automatically implies that one must keep pressing for change and improvement. Always having to look over one's shoulder to see what one can afford is one of the major drivers in that respect. That sounds a bit harsh, but it is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> talked about rationing. One reason why I am not happy with the word &quot;rationing&quot; is that rationing is actually very easy, whereas health care apportionment is very difficult. Those in the room who are old enough to remember rationing&mdash;that does not include me, of course&mdash;will know that it is relatively easy to tell somebody that they can have one egg or one ounce of butter a week or that they can have a British standard loaf ever two days&mdash;that makes sense. It is easy to do that because the one thing that everybody in the world does that has a cost to society is eat. What makes rationing even simpler is that everyone has broadly the same nutritional needs, so the parameters are quite narrow. It is easy to say, &quot;I have 1,000 kg of rice and 1,000 people, so they can have a kilo each.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/3">Unfortunately, it does not work that way with health care. Let us imagine that I have 1,000 people in the room and I have six replacement hips, 20 doses of penicillin and 30 doses of Aricept. First, those replacement hips might be completely inappropriate for those 1,000 people because none of them might need a hip replacement; alternatively, by luck, 100 of them might need one. In other words, it is far more difficult to work out who should get what. Furthermore, how do we compare a hip replacement and Aricept to decide which does the greater good? That is an extremely complex and delicate decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/4">I agree with those who have said that we need a much wider public debate about how we make such decisions. Such things are not news to society; the concept of distributive justice has been with us for thousands of years, although we have not always called it that. If we talk about distributive justice or competing claims for resources, rather than simply about rationing, that will make it easier for the public to join the debate. They will begin to understand the complexities of how people make some of these extraordinarily difficult decisions about distributing resources.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-05-08a.322.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1528" speakername="Howard Stoate" colnum="322"  time="015:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080508/halltext/80508h0002.htm#08050854000272">
	<p pid="a.322.3/1">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend, who does a huge amount of work for cancer patients and who has quite an international reputation for standing firm, helping cancer patients through difficult times and helping to make rational decisions. It is difficult for the public to understand what an ultra-orphan drug is. It is also difficult for the Government to deal with them, because they sometimes have such a skewing effect on overall health budgets, particularly in a relatively small health economy. The problem therefore needs special attention, and I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for raising it.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.3/2">In this country, we have settled on the idea of measuring health benefits and deciding how to distribute resources using the QALY. As everyone knows, the QALY is a cost-utility index that combines the duration and quality of life. In some ways, it can be used as a comparative index. Perfect health is the equivalent to a QALY of 1, death is a QALY of zero and the various health states in the middle can be worked out on a fractional basis. In many cases, therefore, estimates of cost per QALY can be used to devise an indication of the relative value of different treatments and interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.3/3">That method certainly has the merit of being extensively researched in Europe, north America and Asia, but a number of people have expressed quite a few reservations about the manner in which NICE has used QALYs. For instance, John Harris, the joint editor-in-chief of the <i>Journal of Medical Ethics</i>, argues:</p>
	<p pid="a.322.3/4" class="indent">&quot;There are two ways in which QALYS can be used...to determine which of rival therapies to give to a particular patient or which procedure to use to treat a particular condition, in short which of two different treatments is the more cost-effective, better for patients, better for society.... QALYS are also used, however, to determine not which of rival treatments to give to a particular patient or group of patients, but whether or not to offer any treatment at all to some patients, or whether to offer a particular treatment to some patients even when no alternatives are preferred.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.322.3/5">It is that latter approach which Professor Harris understandably objects to on moral grounds, and he exemplifies that by reference to the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease. He claims that</p>
	<p pid="a.322.3/6" class="indent">&quot;it is not the drugs that have been judged not to be cost-effective when compared with rival treatments, it is the patients who are being condemned as not cost-effective to society.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.322.3/7">Meanwhile, Maurice McGregor of McGill university in Canada has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.322.3/8" class="indent">&quot;The assumption of distributive neutrality (ie individual considerations are not taken into account) that underlies the QALY frequently violates societal concerns for fairness in the allocation of healthcare resources. For example, in general, society does not consider a unit of health gained by a severely ill individual to be of equal value to a unit of health gained by an individual who is less severely ill.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.322.3/9">That is a complex concept, but it makes the point that QALYs can be applied in different ways and can mean different things to different groups of patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.3/10">In evidence to the Select Committee inquiry, Dr. David Anderson, from the faculty of old age in the Royal College of Psychiatrists, told us that experts often did not understand how some QALY-based decisions were made, and that they believed the process to be somewhat arbitrary. He told us:</p>
	<p pid="a.322.3/11" class="indent">&quot;When clinicians hear about health economic analyses many of them see it as made-up stuff. You just take some data and create an equation that is based on assumption after assumption... You fiddle about with an equation and come out with a number. If you want you can fiddle about with it some more and come out with a different number.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.322.3/12">Other witnesses argued that the use of QALYs could lead to bias against treatments for long-term chronic conditions. Lower cost per QALY and therefore greater likelihood of NICE approval were claimed to be associated with treatments for acute conditions. Steve Winyard of the Royal National Institute of Blind People told the Committee:</p>
	<p pid="a.322.3/13" class="indent">&quot;Drugs that extend life will always achieve higher values...The use of QALY values puts people with long-term conditions at a disadvantage over people with life-threatening conditions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.3/14">NICE's cost-effectiveness threshold has also attracted much controversy. For instance, an article in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> last year by Professors Appleby, Devlin and Parker strongly criticised the way in which the threshold operates. It said that the threshold that it has used since its inception of &pound;20,000 to &pound;30,000 per QALY</p>
	<p pid="a.322.3/15" class="indent">&quot;has no particular basis in either theory or evidence&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.3/16">It suggested that the threshold may be too generous and that, as consequence, NICE may have recommended too many new technologies. That would also mean that when primary care trusts implement NICE'S guidance, resources may be diverted from other health care services that give better value for money. Indeed, it points to evidence suggesting that there is a mismatch between NICE'S threshold range and that apparent elsewhere in the NHS. The average primary care trust spends about &pound;12,000 to gain an extra QALY in circulatory disease and about &pound;19,000 in cancer. In contrast, an analysis of NICE'S decisions suggests that its threshold is in practice even more generous than it admits, being closer to &pound;45,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.3/17">The article posits two possible approaches for setting a cost-effectiveness threshold. The first is to decide the worth or value of a QALY and set the NHS budget so that all health care is provided at a cost at or below that value. The second is to decide how much we wish to spend on the NHS, and let the value of a QALY emerge from the decisions made by NHS purchasers. It also asks why NICE should be required to set and defend what is an NHS-wide cost-effectiveness threshold. That is of course something that the Committee itself has questioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.3/18">The BMA article suggests that the NHS should have a threshold committee with a similar structure to that of the Monetary Policy Committee; and NICE, primary care trusts, and other NHS purchasers should be required to adopt a common NHS threshold. I question whether simply creating another bureaucratic arm is necessarily the way forward.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-05-08a.327.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" speakername="Maria Miller" colnum="327"  time="015:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080508/halltext/80508h0003.htm#08050854000279">
	<p pid="a.327.0/1">The Minister has raised an important point. Presumably, what she as a Minister in the Department of Health wants to see is some consistency in the way in which our health care system deals with people. Many of the problems involve PCTs being put in a position where they have to make choices, and different PCTs obviously have very different financial arrangements, depending on the way in which the budgeting process hits them. I fear that many people in my constituency, and indeed in other parts of the country, feel that that situation does not always result in an equitable response, which is my response to the Minister's question.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/2">On obtaining a shorter period of evaluation, the Committee's report suggests adopting shorter and less in-depth evaluation at an earlier point, followed by a larger-scale appraisal, perhaps similar to the approach of the SMC. I have some concerns about that approach, although I applaud the Committee's desire to try to truncate the all-too-lengthy process.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/3">Using a lower cost-effectiveness threshold, as proposed in the report, could result in medicines being rejected by NICE at launch, which would leave no clinical practice on which to develop cost-effectiveness evidence, with patients also perhaps being denied new treatments altogether. I do not know whether the Select Committee Chairman has any thoughts about that, but it would certainly concern me that, if we were to follow that approach, we might be in a perverse situation in which the uptake of new medicines would be slower than it is today rather than quicker.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase>, the shadow Secretary of State for Health, has put forward another possible approach, which is that NICE should conduct its appraisal of new drugs and treatments at the same time as such drugs and treatments are licensed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. That approach would help to speed up the assessment process without undermining in any way the quality of that process, which the hon. Member for Norwich, North expressed reservations about when he intervened on me earlier. As the Committee also suggested, there could perhaps be more collaboration between the SMC and NICE. That would seem to make common sense, in terms of the work that both bodies do.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/5">It is difficult to believe that the current situation is what was intended when the system was set up. I am sure that the Minister, in her response today, will pick up on that point, because I am also sure that it cannot be her intention that families, such as those whom I have met in my constituency, should be in a state of distress because of the present situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/6">My second point concerns the implementation of non-statutory guidelines. The Select Committee report noted widespread dissatisfaction with the sometimes limited implementation of some clinical guidelines and that health care authorities respond to guidance at different rates. Indeed, the Audit Commission has highlighted the problems of financial planning around NICE guidelines, and the Government response highlights the point that additional support is in place to help local authorities with implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/7">I am grappling with the realities of the way in which the system works on the ground in my constituency. Taking the issue of in vitro fertilisation, the Government made a proud statement just before the last general election that everybody in the country would be allowed to have three cycles of IVF treatment within a certain age period. I must say that many people in my constituency were glad to hear that announcement. However, they were less glad to hear how it was to be implemented in our part of the world by what was then North Hampshire PCT and what is now Hampshire PCT. People were only able to get one cycle of IVF treatment, and that was only when they reached the age of 35, which, as anyone who has been in that situation knows, is obviously not an ideal way to go forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/8">Although the Government have clearly put a lot of thought into the issue and procedures and processes have been put in place, when it comes to the practical realities for constituents on the ground, those constituents are still finding it difficult to get the non-statutory guidelines realised in practice. Again, I would be interested if the Minister were to clarify how the situation will improve in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/9">My third and final point concerns NICE and the pharmaceutical industry. The report refers to involving NICE in developing the new system of &quot;value-based pricing&quot; for medicine. In the evidence that it received, the Committee uncovered concerns about how the new system, which will replace the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme, will work.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/10">Obviously, we need to keep pressure on costs in the sector&mdash;I fully endorse that&mdash;and the evidence suggests that the Government have been successful in driving down costs. However, the pharmaceutical industry is a complex and international industry, and by its very nature it requires long-term stability. It also keeps a keen eye on the broader international situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/11">The Select Committee Chairman raised the issue, which the media recently covered, about the decision to scrap the current pricing agreements halfway through the five-year period. I fear that that decision did little to foster good relations between the Government and the pharmaceutical industry. I was interested in the Minister's intervention on the right hon. Gentleman, when she tried to imply that that decision was some kind of negotiation technique. I want to highlight to the Minister the fact that the pharmaceutical industry can choose to locate in many different countries in the world. We must foster a good relationship with it, if it is to continue to invest in research and development, as well as manufacturing, in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/12">There is already evidence of a brain drain from this country in respect of pharmaceuticals. The Minister will be aware of recent research undertaken by the Confederation of British Industry, which suggests that the UK is becoming an unfavourable place for the pharmaceutical industry to do business. If she has not seen the research, I would be happy to forward it to her. I hope that she will comment on the implications for employment and the future of that important sector in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.329.2/1">It is fair to point out in my opening remarks that the Committee has looked at the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the past. We first looked at it in 2001-02, and the atmosphere of this inquiry was very different. Going back six or seven years, Mr. David Hinchliffe, the then Chairman of the Select Committee, commented that there had never been so much positive interest in an inquiry, or so many stakeholders writing to say how wonderful an organisation was. To be fair, many of the recommendations that we made then have been acted on, so this inquiry was set against a much more positive background.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/2">The simple truth is that any organisation that is perceived as denying treatment to patients will be controversial. The other general simple truth, which has been alluded to, is that there is not an unlimited pot of money. Politicians need a trusted body to make decisions on cost-effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" name="Maria Miller">The hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller)</phrase> said that it was right that such decisions were made by clinicians. I would not want to rearrange her diary, but she might find it interesting to sit in on a NICE appraisal. When I did&mdash;I am not allowed to say too much about it&mdash;one thing that surprised me was that many of the people sitting around the committee were not clinicians. They were finance people from primary care trusts and chief executives of strategic health authorities&mdash;that sort of person. The balance is more heavily weighted than many people think towards financial considerations. There are, of course, clinical considerations, and experts give evidence, but the background of the speakers was obvious because of the nature of the questions that were asked. The exercise was fascinating. I understand that NICE might open up to the public even more, and that would be only to the greater benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/4">The Committee's inquiry was prompted by issues surrounding Herceptin, and Alzheimer's drugs had received a great deal of public and political attention. The only unfortunate aspect of our inquiry was that we were not allowed to raise any issues relating to the Alzheimer's drugs, which were involved in an ongoing court case.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/5">The Chairman highlighted the fact that social care costs are perceived as not being fully factored in. That was very much the argument that was raised at length when beta interferon was making its somewhat rocky passage through the process in the early days of NICE. The Committee made certain recommendations about quality adjusted life years, or QALYs, and suggested that perhaps the wider cost to society should be factored in. The Government's response to that was interesting. They stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/6" class="indent">&quot;The suggestion that NICE take into account wider costs and benefits has instinctive appeal, but closer examination reveals a number of complexities and potential perverse effects which warrant further exploration.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/7">Nobody would suggest that we rush headlong into that without more analysis. The response goes on:</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/8" class="indent">&quot;For example, attaching a greater weight to impacts on economic productivity would have the effect of prioritising interventions for adults of working age, effectively deprioritising interventions for older people or for people who are too ill to return to work even with treatment. The impact on the consistency, manageability and timeliness of NICE's appraisal process also needs to be considered.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/9">Deprioritising interventions for older people was precisely what those who were lobbying for the take-up of the Alzheimer's drugs were suggesting was happening. One problem was that there was not complete clarity about the model. It is good that there will be discussions to explore the matter further, but the fundamental problem appears to be the lack of complete clarity.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/10">NICE could complain that it is transparent, and that the information that it provides would give a company, or whoever was looking into the costings, the ability to work out how it arrived at its figures, but many people have commented that they do not have access to the precise financial model. Conspiracy theories abound as to why that could be the case. The most popular seems to be that if drug companies understood the system completely, they would learn how to manipulate it.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/11">That might be a little unfair, but many patient groups feel that they are treated unfairly and that wider benefits are not fully taken into account. It would help the public accept some of the decisions more readily if they were reassured that such factors had been taken into account. The then Minister of State, Department of Health, who is now Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, came before us at the time and said that he was satisfied with the situation. Sadly, such is the reputation of politicians that the public do not regard that as quite enough evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/12">That aspect came up again yesterday when I was at a reception that was hosted partly by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People. NICE is looking into cochlear implants. One of the concerns raised&mdash;it might be a false concern&mdash;was that while there would be savings for the education system because children with cochlear implants could engage in mainstream schooling, that might not be fully factored into the equation. It is clear that a one-size-fits-all solution is difficult to arrive at when examining wider impacts.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/13">The calculation of QALYs appears, to some eyes at least, to be an art rather than a science. A practical example is that when we visited the Scottish Medicines Consortium, we were presented with a list of recently approved drugs, each of which had a cost per QALY at the side. At that time, I was interested in Lucentis, which is used to treat age-related macular degeneration. The cost per QALY that the SMC had arrived at was considerably less than the figure that NICE was bandying around in its appraisals at that time. The good news is that many of the costings have been reviewed and the drug has now been approved, but why was the SMC able to come up with a figure that was about a third of the price that NICE arrived at? Unfortunately, when such examples get into the public domain, they undermine confidence in what is generally a good process.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/14">Scotland has been mentioned a few times. It is worth saying that although we always read stories about drugs being available in Scotland but not here in England, the SMC told us that it had occasionally turned down drugs that were available in England. Surprisingly, we do not read about such cases the <i>Daily Mail</i>. Perhaps it would help to have more clarity on that issue, but I am not sure whose job it is to provide such clarity.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/15">There seems to be a slightly more collaborative approach in Scotland. If there is disagreement about a company's figures, the parties get together to discuss it. NICE's procedures seem to be rather more formal and a little distant. If NICE disagrees with a company, it is up to the company to come back to it, so there does not seem to be such an active dialogue. There is a place for such discussions in the process of reaching understanding and agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/16">I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1528" name="Howard Stoate">the hon. Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate)</phrase> that baseline QALYs have not changed much in eight years, as they have not been inflation-proofed. Seven years ago, we were talking about a threshold of about &pound;30,000, and we are still talking about the same amount.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/17">We made strong recommendations on the thorny issue of implementation in our report. Some improvements have been made, but there is still a problem. Let me give a local example. I received letters from a number of patients at the same time about a drug that benefits arthritis sufferers. They had been put up to writing the letters by their consultant, and they told me that they could not get the drug, which had been approved by NICE and should have been available. I did what any MP would do and wrote to the PCT, which told me that it was funding the drug. However, it was funding only six of that consultant's patients, and the consultant had a dozen patients who could benefit from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/18">In despair, I wrote to the Department, which said, &quot;It's nothing to do with us. It is up to the PCT, but the SHA is supposed to be performance-managing them.&quot; It was only after I wrote to Sir Ian Carruthers, who was quite good at working out such matters, and pointed out that the PCT could not possibly be providing enough funding to meet full demands for the drug, and that it was disingenuous of it to say that it was, that more funding suddenly became available. Similar games are being played with patients' lives all over the country. Not every patient will write to their MP, and not every consultant will encourage a number of their patients to write to their MP.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/19">There is a need for proper investigation of whether recommendations are being implemented. Recommendation 27 of the report was that the Healthcare Commission should</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/20" class="indent">&quot;conduct more in-depth inspections&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/21">I was disappointed that the Government's response kicked that recommendation into the long grass. It said that it would ask the care quality commission to reflect on the Committee's recommendation, but the commission is only just getting around to appointing its chair and will have other priorities. It is not set up yet. In the first year of its operation it will have a hard job melding the Commission for Social Care Inspection, the Healthcare Commission and the Mental Health Act Commission together. The implementation of NICE guidance will not be foremost on its list of priorities. I am concerned that the recommendation will be kicked into the long grass and that it will be three or four years before there is any action. In the meantime, patients are being deprived of drugs.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-05-08a.332.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="332"  time="015:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080508/halltext/80508h0004.htm#08050854000284">
	<p pid="a.332.1/1">Yes, but the matter is not being dealt with at the moment. The CQC will have enough problems trying to meld organisations together and to carry on with its day job without taking on any new responsibilities. The formation of the new body will effectively mean that the recommendation dies. That is a shame, because NICE supported the recommendation in its response to the Committee. It must be frustrating to work for an organisation that does the work and makes the recommendations but does not see patients benefiting from that. It then gets all the flak when it makes a recommendation that is a bit more controversial. We should help with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.332.1/2">I completely support the comments of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> about disinvestment. However, we have heard evidence that the matter is not as straightforward as might be assumed and that not so many issues can be considered. He made a good point, but what he suggested would not be easy to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="a.332.1/3">Risk sharing has not been mentioned and the issue is fairly opaque. We took evidence from Professor Nicholl, from the university of Sheffield, who was involved in writing a report on assessing the multiple sclerosis risk-sharing scheme. The Sheffield researchers wrote the report over three years, and it was submitted last year. Interestingly, the next seven years of the contract then went to tender, and Sheffield decided not to bid. More worryingly, details of the scheme have not been publicised. The report is still not in the public domain and there are indications that the study will not yield reliable information about the beneficial effects of the drugs involved. Will the Minister tell us when the report will be available and how the Government intend to move forward on various risk-sharing schemes?</p>
	<p pid="a.332.1/4">In conclusion, we all signed up in the report to the idea that NICE does a good job in difficult circumstances, but what we have heard today indicates that it could probably do so quicker and that implementation could be better. Those problems are not necessarily with NICE, however, and might be with the systems that surround it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-05-08a.334.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" speakername="Mark Simmonds" colnum="334"  time="015:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080508/halltext/80508h0004.htm#08050854000287">
	<p pid="a.334.1/1">I agree with the first part of the hon. Lady's intervention that this is an extremely important matter which should be examined, but I am afraid that today I do not have a simplistic solution to improve the situation. There is tension for all main political parties in wanting to provide consistent provision of healthcare while ensuring that decisions are made locally if they are relevant to the local communities which the primary care trusts and clinicians serve. That tension is difficult to resolve.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/2">The hon. Lady was right to highlight in her speech the QALY threshold and constituency concerns. She made a good point about the new social care body that will be set up. I suspect that the Government are using that as a way of kicking into the very long grass the other complex issues that she eloquently articulated.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/3">Conservative Members support NICE and believe that it plays a vital role in assessing the cost-effectiveness and clinical effectiveness of treatments, as well as producing clinical and public health guidance. Rising patient expectations, an ageing population, and the development of more costly procedures, drugs and technologies will make the context in which the NHS and NICE must operate far more challenging in future. It is absolutely right, as other hon. Members have said, that the body that analyses the cost-effectiveness of treatment is made up of clinicians, rather than politicians. We agree with the Committee that it was unwise of the previous Secretary of State to become involved in the debate about Herceptin.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/4">The Committee was right to highlight and praise NICE's work nationally and its international reputation. It was also right to shine a light into those areas where there are problems in NICE's existing structures and procedures. I know from discussions with executives and people working at NICE that they are the first to acknowledge that the situation is not perfect.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/5">The Committee made a large number of recommendations. I do not want to go through all of them&mdash;there is not the time to do so&mdash;but I want to highlight three or four key areas that deserve further discussion, including topic selection, QALYs, disinvestment, clinical trials, societal costs, the membership of the appraisal committee, consultation and implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/6">The Committee was correct to highlight public concern about the speed of assessment, which can take up to two years. That results in enormous uncertainty and a period of variation that is often euphemistically called &quot;NICE blight&quot;, during which primary care trusts set their own prescribing criteria almost at will, without transparency or consistency. All hon. Members know from their postbags that that leads to anger among patients and their families, and reinforces concern about postcode lottery and the public's view that NICE is a hinderer and not an enabler of access to drugs and technologies. Somehow, we must turn that perception round. Hon. Members rightly highlighted the swifter procedures in Scotland and France, but it is clear that the processes there are less rigorous as there is no scoping phase, and public consultation is limited, which would create issues if we tried to replicate that in England through the NICE procedure. I will come to that in a moment. We welcome single technology appraisals, which are obviously quicker, but we also believe that there is a role for multiple technology appraisals, particularly when there is more than one drug or technology in a particular area of health care.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/7">The Committee recommended that drugs should begin their NICE assessment concurrently with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's licensing procedure. The Chairman and members of the Committee know that Conservative Members have been saying that for a considerable time, so I was pleased to read that the Committee agrees with the our recommendations. I was also pleased to see that in the cancer reform strategy, the Government, too, now agree with that policy in that all new cancer drugs will begin NICE and MRHA assessments simultaneously.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/8">The Committee also recommended that NICE develop a shorter, less in-depth evaluation of medicines at an early stage. That would obviously have benefits, but I suspect that there are also drawbacks, which must be highlighted. It is widely accepted that a faster process will just result in a faster yes decision for drugs. That seems unlikely. The NICE appraisal that I observed ended in refusal because there was no clinical evidence to support approval. If NICE simply goes through the process faster without other things being put in place, there is likely to be more judicial reviews of decisions. There will also be a potential public backlash if the initial assessment of a drug or technology says yes, but a later more rigorous one changes the guidance and deems a drug not to be cost-effective. That would lead to the drug being withdrawn from patients already using it, so there would be serious problems in relation to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/9">We welcome the pilot of the national public health commissioning network, which has the potential to offer quicker assessments of newly licensed drugs while also taking account of the wider benefits to the community. I certainly urge primary care trusts to engage with that pilot. I look forward to hearing whether that is effective. The Committee criticised NICE for its topic selection, which tends to focus on a small number of new and often expensive products. However, the majority of medicines in routine use in the NHS have never been assessed by NICE. I certainly would not suggest that all drugs and technologies should be assessed by NICE, as that would be a bureaucratic nightmare. However, there must be a system whereby drugs and technologies historically prevalent in the NHS that have been overtaken by other drugs and technologies can be looked at through the eyes of the QALY threshold. I have had numerous conversations with the executive and others at NICE and I understand that it would be difficult to do that without massive bureaucracy and a significant increase in the burden on NICE. However, that still needs to be borne in mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/10">I would like to say a few words about the QALY. I do not want to repeat what other hon. Members have said, but criticism of the QALY is not new. Most people recognise that the system has flaws. For example, QALY does not take into account that a change in quality of life from&mdash;if I may use fractions&mdash;0.2 to 0.4 may be more valuable for a patient than a change from 0.8 to 1. Those things are difficult to assess consistently over a range of clinical requirements. A comparable system of measurement is needed. The Committee was concerned that the QALY threshold had never been debated or approved by Parliament. There is no reason why it should not be debated in Parliament&mdash;indeed, we have had such a debate today&mdash;but Parliament is not the right place to set the QALY threshold. That should be done by an independent NHS board in consultation with clinicians, Parliament and NICE itself. The QALY threshold needs to be continuously reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/11">On socio-economic costs and benefits, when NICE was first established, the Department made it clear that it should not take into account economic benefits, the treatment of carers, savings related to benefits, tax allowances, or productivity, as the right hon. Member for Rother Valley rightly said. However, we must make sure that we do not create perverse incentives to focus on treatments that would be beneficial to adults of working age as that would be to the detriment of drugs to treat diseases more commonly found in older people. Of course, we recognise that any change would have to be made through Parliament via a statutory instrument, but that issue still needs to be looked at. In our policy papers, we have said that we should allow NICE to take account of wider societal costs where it is appropriate for it to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/12">I made a point about the pharmaceutical industry and experts, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Wyre Forest. There are issues that need to be considered in relation to that. I do not agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase>, who seemed to suggest that the appraisal committees were primarily full of people who only had financial considerations in mind. That certainly was not my experience when I went to watch the process. Detailed presentations were made and there were debates about the clinical effectiveness of drugs. It is inevitable that if there is a financial threshold, which the QALY ultimately is, there must be financial input into the decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.337.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for clarifying that. The final point I shall make is about the implementation, to which other hon. Members have referred. It is widely acknowledged that primary care trusts often struggle to finance NICE appraisals and guidance. It has been estimated that the cost of funding NICE technology appraisals is up to &pound;1.2 billion a year. In our capacity as Members of Parliament, we regularly hear reports of patchy implementation of NICE appraisals, and about the disparity of speed in the uptake of NICE appraisals. The best example is the one that my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke gave about IVF treatments. There is a risk that treatments that NICE has not examined or other areas of health care could be crowded out as primary care trusts are forced to prioritise NICE-evaluated appraisals. Patients with conditions not yet covered by NICE may therefore receive cheaper and less up to date therapies then patients who receive treatments that have been the subject of NICE appraisals.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.1/2">In addition to the comments that I have made supporting some of the Committee's recommendations, there are three or four other areas that we in the Conservative party think that NICE needs to consider to improve its current service provision. We want to use the NHS autonomy and accountability Bill to enshrine NICE's duties and responsibilities on a statutory basis, rather than as a special health authority, as is currently the case. Such a change would provide NICE with a transparent structure for its duties and responsibilities. We also want to give NICE the power to develop evidence-based commissioning guidelines, which would encourage best practice and the achievement of outcome objectives. That would be particularly beneficial in developing a gold standard in areas such as elderly care and long-term conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.1/3">Other matters to which hon. Members have alluded also need to be considered. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> quite correctly mentioned orphan drugs, which need to be considered in more detail. There is also the matter of post-approval appraisal effectiveness and analysis, and of ensuring that once a drug has been improved, it meets the quality threshold, as was originally envisaged. Again, with the exception of some pharmaceutical companies who analyse the impact and effect of their own drugs, there is little done in that area at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.1/4">There is also the problem of &quot;NICE blight&quot;&mdash;the inconsistency of primary care trust decision and take-up. There needs to be greater transparency and greater consistency in decision-making criteria issued by primary care trusts and a larger role for NICE in the evaluation of public health services around the country. Such services are not fulfilling their role or functioning as well as they should. Finally, the public perception of NICE is that it hinders rather than enables access to treatments, and all hon. Members need to work together alongside NICE and everyone in the national health service to turn around that perception.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.1/5">From 1998 to 1999, NICE has done a good job and it is here to stay. However, we must ensure that it is as effective as possible. The Committee report is a significant contribution to that debate and aims to improve the effectiveness of NICE for the benefit of patients.</p>
