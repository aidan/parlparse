	<p pid="a.517.4/1">There was a debate just yesterday in this Room about the Post Office cash card, and the issue also came up in Trade and Industry questions today. Will my right hon. Friend refer later to the section of the Committee's excellent report that deals with the role of the Post Office in tackling financial exclusion and to the fact that three quarters of the cash machines in post offices charge a fee? Surely, that was not envisaged when the Government made the present arrangements?</p>

	<p pid="a.520.0/1">Is my right hon. Friend surprised to hear that in one of the largest&mdash;and probably least well off&mdash;former mining villages in North-West Leicestershire, there is a cash point near the local parish office that charges, but no one would know unless they had extremely good eyesight? Written at the top left of the machine in microscopic letters is &quot;&pound;1.50 per charge&quot;. That is written in biro on the wall of the office. That is the sort of thing that needs to be tackled, is it not?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-16a.521.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1972" speakername="John McFall" colnum="521"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060216/halltext/60216h01.htm#60216h01_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.521.1/1">Yes. At our hearings, we asked that question, and that information came out. If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me, I will later refer to the votes taken by Link, and that might provide him with further information.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/2">The Committee said:</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/3" class="indent">&quot;A larger minimum font size should be set for these warnings so the sign is visible from a distance.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/4">Many charging machines prominently advertise the ability to make free balance inquiries. The Committee concluded that that practice should not be permitted on any machine that levies a surcharge on the consumer. We also concluded that</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/5" class="indent">&quot;When a machine is converted from free to charging it is important to give consumers advance notice of the change.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/6">We noted that the banking code requires banks to notify customers when it closes the last branch within a specified distance, and it called on banks to examine whether a similar requirement should be introduced when removing the last free cash machine within a specified distance.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/7">Many witnesses thought that it would be useful if consumers could see at a glance whether a machine was free-to-use or levying. It has been suggested by Nationwide and HBOS that that could take the form of red signs for charging machines and green signs for free machines. That proposal attracted support from some major banks, but was rejected by the majority of Link members last December. Unless the industry engages, and collectively tries to secure further improvements in transparency, it will give the public the impression that it is happy to make money out of the veil of secrecy surrounding cash machine charges.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/8">On regulation and enforcement, to be effective it is essential that compliance with voluntary regulation is adequately monitored and effectively enforced. During the inquiry it became clear that Link's approach to enforcement was ad hoc and ineffective. Surveys indicated that up to 50 per cent. of cash machines were not compliant with the Link requirements. The Committee concluded that that degree of non-compliance was totally and utterly unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/9">We welcomed moves by Link to strengthen its enforcement procedures. A survey conducted in late 2005 found that 1.6 per cent. of machines still did not have the required on-screen warnings, and a disappointing 13.2 per cent. did not comply with all Link's surcharging rules. Fines totalling some &pound;20,000 had been levied on those operators, but Link needs to publish details of which companies it has fined, so we can put pressure on repeat offenders to improve their practices. To date, that information has not been forthcoming.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/10">The Committee recommended that charging cash machines be brought within the banking code. The Banking Code Standards Board wrote to me in January to say that as Link was now taking its enforcement responsibilities more seriously, the board did</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/11" class="indent">&quot;not intend actively to recruit Independent charging machine operators as subscribers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/12">However, the board was</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/13" class="indent">&quot;hopeful that one major operator that is a subsidiary of a banking group may decide to join&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/14">soon, and informed me that it will be reviewing the situation at six-monthly intervals. I continue to believe that in the longer run there would be considerable benefit in extending the code to include all cash machine operators.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/15">The Committee was particularly concerned about the impact that the spread of charging cash machines could have on financial exclusion. We concluded that</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/16" class="indent">&quot;As part of an agenda tackling financial exclusion, it is very important that those on low incomes have access to free cash withdrawals. We note evidence that the cash machines most likely to be converted to charging are those away from existing bank branches in low footfall locations. If there were to be a substantial reduction in the availability of free cash machines then that could exacerbate existing financial exclusion&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/17">The Treasury document entitled &quot;Promoting financial inclusion&quot;, published alongside the pre-Budget report 2004, contained some analysis indicating the concentration of financial exclusion in certain areas of the country and concluded that 68 per cent. of the financially excluded live in the 10 per cent. most financially excluded postcodes and 25 per cent. of the financially excluded live in the 3 per cent. of postcodes with the highest concentration of financial exclusion. The Treasury initially told the Committee that it was unable to send a list of the postcodes as the terms of the contract with the company that provided the information meant that it was unable to provide the raw data to any third party. The Committee concluded:</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/18" class="indent">&quot;If the Treasury is going to spend public money identifying areas of concentrated financial exclusion, it seems unhelpful not to share this information with those organisations that might be able to make improvements in those areas.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/19">After much cajoling, the Economic Secretary, God bless him, kindly agreed to share the postcodes with the Committee, but on the understanding that we did not give them to anyone else. But it would be far more helpful if the Minister shared this information with the Post Office and other banks so that they can review the provision of free cash machines in those areas. I understand why the Minister said what he did, but there is still an urgent need for that to happen. Low-income and financially excluded areas that lacked access to free cash withdrawals included Speke in Merseyside, Aston in Birmingham and Grangetown in Redcar and Cleveland.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/20">The Post Office, which gave evidence in the Committee's inquiry, has a large network of branches, giving it a unique opportunity to be at the forefront of tackling financial exclusion and providing a method of free cash withdrawal where many people would otherwise have to use charging cash machines. The Post Office told us that more than 93 per cent. of the population lives within 1 mile of a Post Office branch, with this figure rising to 99 per cent. in urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/21">In March 2000, the Prime Minister announced that the Government would work with the Post Office to install some 3,000 cash machines in post offices. However, when the Committee examined the issue in December 2004, it found that there were 2,493 cash machines within Post Office branches, of which 1,856 charged a fee direct to the consumer. That meant that more than 75 per cent. of cash machines in post offices, including many of those in low-income areas, charged a fee to consumers. Witnesses, including Citizens Advice and the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, expressed concern over this trend, telling the Committee:</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/22" class="indent">&quot;Since most benefit claimants and a significant proportion of all Post Office customers are people on low incomes, charges on Post Office based cash machines are likely to hit those using them particularly hard&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/23">Sub-postmasters were also unhappy as they were given little or no choice as to whether they had a charging or free ATM installed. The Post Office told us that it was not making a profit from charging ATMs. Post Office customers were paying more than &pound;10 million a year in cash machine charges, thereby threatening efforts to address financial exclusion, with apparently little contribution being made to the viability of individual sub-post offices or the Post Office network. The consumer was spending &pound;10 million a year and nobody was making any money.</p>

	<p pid="a.524.3/1">My hon. Friend needs a little bit of patience. There has been some progress and I will talk about that in my speech. He is a member of the Treasury Committee, so he will have the privilege, in a month or two, of questioning the Post Office personally to see what progress has been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.3/2">The Committee noted that</p>
	<p pid="a.524.3/3" class="indent">&quot;the large network of the Post Office and its presence in many locations without a bank branch gives it a unique opportunity to tackle financial exclusion. The Post Office needs fundamentally to re-examine its policy concerning charging cash machines&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.3/4">I am pleased to note, as I mentioned to the hon. Gentleman, the Post Office's positive response to the Committee's report; it has withdrawn from its over-arching contractual arrangements with existing ATM suppliers and, going forward, will introduce only free-to-use ATMs. The Post Office has also reached an agreement with the Bank of Ireland to provide approximately 1,000 Post Office-branded free-to-use machines across the network. There will be at least 300 new free-to-use machines located in the network over the next three years. I am pleased to say that the Post Office has advised me that the surcharging machine in the Speke area, on which the Committee focused in its inquiry, will be removed as soon as it can install a free cash machine. Overall the Post Office is moving in the right direction, although it is not off the hook, and the Committee will continue to monitor progress and press it to do more to provide more free cash machines across its network.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.3/5">On access to cash over Post Office counters, under the arrangement that set up universal banking services in 2003, the public can gain access to cash withdrawals over the post office counter if they have a basic bank account, or have a current account with a number of banks, including Barclays and Lloyds TSB. However, there is evidence that that provision was being poorly communicated to customers. Data that the Committee obtained concerning the post office in Speke found that more than 38 per cent. of people using the charging cash machine could have made their cash withdrawal over the counter, free of charge. We concluded that the Post Office needed to make additional efforts to promote the ability to make free cash withdrawals at the post office counter. However, as we all know, more than 40 per cent. of the current account market, including customers of HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS, are not able to access cash for free over post office counters. We need to extend post office access to ensure that all current account holders are able to withdraw cash for free over the counter.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-16a.535.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" speakername="Kerry McCarthy" colnum="535"  time="015:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060216/halltext/60216h01.htm#60216h01_spnew29">
	<p pid="a.535.0/1">I agree that that is the case in some instances. A huge amount of bank branches have closed. The Select Committee Chairman gave some interesting figures on the number of cash machines that have been sold off by the banks to companies that charge. I think that HBOS has sold 816 machines, Abbey has sold 50 and the Alliance and Leicester is looking to sell its cash machines. While I am on the topic of the Alliance and Leicester, it is interesting to note that its machine in the Lobby of the House does not charge, whereas elsewhere its machines do. It is clear who it is trying to impress.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.0/2">I have been looking into the situation in the United States of America to search for an example of what could happen here if we do not take steps to address the growing phenomenon of fee-charging machines. In 2005, customers in the USA were estimated to have paid $4.3 billion on withdrawal fees from ATMs. Double-charging is still prevalent there: 96 per cent. of banks hit non-customers for withdrawing money from their machines, but 87 per cent. of banks also charge their own customers for doing the same thing. I am pleased that the UK Link agreements have now outlawed double-charging.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.0/3">I shall conclude by picking up on some of the points that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary made in an Adjournment debate on this topic that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West secured last autumn, and in doing so I will return to the issue of choice. In that debate the Economic Secretary said:</p>
	<p pid="a.535.0/4" class="indent">&quot;it is hugely important that vulnerable and low-income consumers in all communities can access their cash for free.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.535.0/5">He also said that</p>
	<p pid="a.535.0/6" class="indent">&quot;we would&mdash;and should&mdash;be concerned if people on low incomes incurred a disproportionate cost in accessing their money.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.535.0/7">He stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.535.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The financial inclusion task force will explore . . . the extent to which fee-charging ATMs are disproportionately used by the financially excluded.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.535.0/9">I welcome that move. He also talked about achieving &quot;the maximum possible transparency&quot; and said that people</p>
	<p pid="a.535.0/10" class="indent">&quot;must be able to make informed choices&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-29">29 November 2005</phrase>; Vol. 440, c. 73&ndash;76WH.]</p>
	<p pid="a.535.0/11">Transparency is undoubtedly important for people who have a choice about whether to use a certain machine, but I dispute the contention that for some people the choice can always be facilitated by greater transparency. I simply do not believe that the majority of my constituents who use fee-paying machines have simply been caught unawares by a fee being levied. They know they have to pay the charge, but their personal circumstances all too often mean they have no choice but to pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.0/12">The Economic Secretary also talked of the level playing field that our citizens deserve. We are far from achieving that level playing field at present, and I hope to hear from him today about what more can be done to ensure that we do.</p>

	<p pid="a.536.0/1">I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Martlew, and I apologise for arriving a second or two late for the start of the debate. I also wish to say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" name="John Robertson">my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson)</phrase> that I well remember Byres road, but, sadly, before cash machines ever arrived there.</p>
	<p pid="a.536.0/2">I also congratulate the Treasury Committee on undertaking its report, and I am grateful that, as a new member of the Committee, I now have an opportunity to speak in this debate&mdash;and, hopefully, to be able to follow matters up in various future Committee hearings and investigations.</p>
	<p pid="a.536.0/3">I shall begin by making a general comment that has not been made so far in our debate by reaffirming one of the principles that the Committee set out in its report, which is that charging machines are a valid and appropriate business model. In certain circumstances, they can offer the convenience that many people wish to have. However, we must look carefully at a number of issues. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1972" name="John McFall">My right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (Mr. McFall)</phrase> mentioned competition; I would also mention transparency and access. Competition has been at the centre of our discussion, and we must take into account all aspects of that principle.</p>
	<p pid="a.536.0/4">It is perhaps understandable that so few Members are present, but that saddens me. I was a little surprised about that because accessing cash machines affects a large majority of our constituents, and it is therefore important to them. I looked up some of the figures in the material I was sent: 33 million people use cash machines every year, which is 84 per cent. of the adult population. There were about 58,000 cash machines as of the end of last year and, as several hon. Members have mentioned, 43 per cent. of those machines now charge people to access their money. Last year, &pound;161 billion was withdrawn, and about &pound;200 million was made from access charges. It is estimated that that figure will probably rise to &pound;250 million this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.536.0/5">It is important to take recent developments into account, and one worrying recent development is that while the number of machines charging a fee has increased by 16 per cent., there has been a reduction, albeit a very modest one&mdash;0.3 per cent. last year&mdash;in the number of free machines. Although that trend has levelled out, one of the big worries is that, in future, there will be a further decline in the number of free machines. That would cause quite a few alarm bells to ring.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-16a.537.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" speakername="Andrew Love" colnum="537"  time="015:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060216/halltext/60216h01.htm#60216h01_spnew32">
	<p pid="a.537.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend. I was not aware of that fact. It just shows how important it is that we monitor effectively what is happening in the marketplace, so that we understand what action needs to be taken to ensure that people can access the type of machine that they want, with the convenience that they expect in this day and age.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/2">Let me return to those wonderful statistics that we love to cite. It is important to place cash machine charges in context. About 96 per cent. of all transactions are still free. I think that everyone recognises that we want that to continue to be the figure in future. However, the Treasury Committee suggests in its evidence&mdash;this figure appears to be accepted fairly broadly&mdash;that the growth in ATMs that charge will level off when the figure reaches about 5 to 10 per cent. We need to consider what the consequences will be if that phenomenon takes place, and how we can ensure a proper market for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/3">Interestingly, according to the industry, ATMs owned by banks and building societies&mdash;which are generally but not always free, as other hon. Members have mentioned&mdash;have, on average, &pound;13,000 withdrawn daily. The independent sector, which generally charges although not always, has, on average, about &pound;800 withdrawn per day. That has consequences for the balance between free ATMs and charging ATMs.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/4">One great concern, which other hon. Members have mentioned, is whether there will be a significant shift from banks and building societies holding ATMs to the independent sector holding ATMs. Of course, that would entail a move from free provision to charging provision. HBOS has been mentioned in that regard. I shall not go into the figures&mdash;they have already been cited&mdash;but there is that worry. We cannot know as yet that the balance will change significantly but, again, we must monitor the situation. I welcome the role that the Treasury has played in this and other matters by recognising the critical importance of monitoring all developments at present to ensure that we maintain an adequate marketplace, in which everyone can receive their money at a cost appropriate to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/5">I would like to discuss a number of issues, the first of which is transparency. The second issue is affordability and financial exclusion, which several hon. Members have touched on. I shall then say a few words about the Post Office, because it will begin to come into its own if some of the changes that we are discussing do take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/6">Let me first of all, as others have done, welcome the progress that Link has made on greater transparency. It has taken action to ensure both that a message now appears on the screen of its ATMs telling people that a charge may be made, and that there is an external sign to tell people before they get to the machine that a charge may be made. Link has also reviewed its compliance with those conditions. We are told that the figure for compliance is 98 per cent. and that penalties have ensued for those who have failed to comply. I accept all that. However, from my reading of comments from interested individuals and organisations and those affected, I believe that a number of outstanding issues remain.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/7">The first issue relates to clarity. There are concerns that the minimum point size for the message that appears on the screen might not be appropriate for all members of the community. There is still quite a lot of confusion. For example, ATMs often state that balance inquiries are free, which might confuse someone into thinking that all <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the services are free. As my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> said, the position of the signage that goes along with a machine is often not appropriate to inform the individual. It might be very small or placed in an awkward spot. We need consistency of provision. Nationwide and <i>Which? </i>have suggested the red and green signage about which many have spoken. That suggestion seems appropriate for various reasons, in terms of clarity and of being widely understood. If it is not accepted across the board, it will be incumbent on all the organisations to suggest ways in which we can be reassured that there is clarity and that the provision is easily understood by all members of the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/8">Associated with that is the concern raised by several hon. Members about non-financial transactions&mdash;people wanting to find out how much money is in their account. This issue particularly affects the less well-off, who may be worried about how much money is in their account. Reassurance needs to be given that charges will not be introduced for that service.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/9">Secondly, let me consider affordability. It has to be said straight away that 25 per cent. of all withdrawals from ATMs that charge are for &pound;20 or less, so there is very significant use of such ATMs by the less well-off. Those on low incomes might even withdraw smaller amounts. It has already been mentioned that sometimes people can withdraw only &pound;10 at a time. Some people will choose to withdraw only &pound;10 or perhaps &pound;20. We are told that the average charge made at an ATM is &pound;1.50. In Glasgow, it is &pound;1.75. The figure will vary, and if we are monitoring the situation, we should be becoming aware of whether a differential charge impacts adversely on lower-income communities. However, just to take the average charge for a moment, if someone withdraws &pound;20, the charge is 7.5 per cent. of the amount that they have withdrawn. If they withdraw &pound;10, the figure is 15 per cent. That is for low-income households. I am not sure how we should deal with that issue. I would be interested to hear what my hon. Friend the Minister has to say about making charges proportionate to the income of the person withdrawing the money. I am not suggesting a cap, but the situation that I have described needs to be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/10">Thirdly, as several hon. Members have mentioned, more than 6,000 branches of banks and building societies&mdash;it is banks in the main&mdash;have closed since 1990, 1,000 of which were in rural areas. The Building Societies Association and others have carried out studies that show that generally&mdash;I do not want to go too far with this point&mdash;those bank branches have been withdrawn from less well-off areas. In addition, we are all acutely aware, because there have been many Adjournment debates on the subject, that post offices have been closing in many areas. Some have closed in rural areas, although that has slowed significantly. When there was a review of the post offices in my constituency, five of the nine local branches closed, but not all of those were in what one would term deprived areas. However, there have certainly been closures.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/11">Regarding the concerns about the fact that areas where there are neither branches of banks nor post offices&mdash;or even ATMs&mdash;may develop, I remind the Minister of his letter to the Chairman of the Committee on <phrase class="date" code="">26 October</phrase> where he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The Government would be concerned if it were found that people on low incomes incurred a disproportionate cost in accessing their money.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/13">We all agree with that. In the case of my constituency, one in three of the ATMs available to my constituents are free, so two in three charge, and my constituency is in a relatively deprived, low-income area. Last year, we lost one of our free machines and added one to the total of charging machines. The largest single employer in my constituency is the local hospital. Many people are employed there and many patients pass through it. It has only one cash machine, which charges &pound;1.50 and people have to walk half a mile to withdraw money from a free machine. That hospital is in one of the most deprived areas of Edmonton and Tottenham and I say without fear or favour that it represents probably the most deprived community in the whole of Greater London.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/14">We need to consider carefully the distribution of free and charging machines. I listened carefully to the Chairman and read the letter from the Minister that provided the figures on financial exclusion. Those figures need to be matched up to the location of ATMs as soon as possible, with regard to those that charge and those that are free. As has been said, gaps in provision, such as those in my constituency, are critically important, and if we are to maintain competition and the ability to access funds, we must ensure that those gaps do not occur.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/15">I welcome the work of the Treasury Committee and, more importantly, the Treasury on the matter, as well as the work of organisations, such as Citizens Advice, which consider the issues carefully. That all adds to our knowledge and leads to the drawing up of a comprehensive picture to ensure that our constituents and people nationwide are able to access their money.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/16">I shall just say a few words about the role of the Post Office and a couple of issues that have already been touched upon. In its report, the Treasury Committee said that 75 per cent. of ATMs in post offices carried a charge. Indeed, the figure suggested that &pound;10 million was raised in fees last year. The first thing we should do is strongly welcome the decision of the Post Office to convert 1,000 of its ATMs from charging to free machines. The Chairman went into detail about the way in which the Post Office is addressing that issue and I strongly welcome the critical consideration of the services that it provides. I suggest that if it can move to an entirely free network in post offices, it will add significantly to the need to maintain that branch network in rural areas and low-income communities throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/17">There are 14,500 post office branches nationwide, roughly 8,000 of which are in rural areas. As was mentioned earlier, almost everyone is within a mile of a post office branch so access is reasonable, although I am sure there are areas in Members' constituencies where access may not be as good as it should be, and we need to consider that.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/18">I was pleased that the Post Office entered an agreement to allow free withdrawals from its branches for those who held basic bank accounts. That service was much needed and addressed a gap that existed in the marketplace; I strongly welcome it. As I mentioned in an earlier question to the Chairman, we must ensure that customers who use the post office are aware of that service, especially when they may be using machines that charge in the village or the post office. They must be made aware of those choices.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/19">Concern has been expressed at the announcement that the Post Office card account will be discontinued in a few years' time. I fully understand the different cost structure of accessing funds through a Post Office card account compared with accessing them through a bank. It is a sensible move, if we ensure that those who have Post Office card accounts can, do and want to access the alternatives available. The latter point is critically important: people must have trust and confidence that the alternative system is one that they want to undertake.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/20">To achieve that the Post Office needs to do two things. First, it should seek membership of Link. I understand that this will open up doors for the Post Office; it will be able to allow people with any bank account to access their funds&mdash;not just those with basic ones. That would give the Post Office a credibility in the banking structure that will be enormously helpful and may well encourage the national banks that currently resist the temptation to make agreements with the Post Office to do so. That should be urgently considered, not just in the context of the withdrawal of the Post Office card account.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/21">Secondly, there is a role for the Post Office in relation to basic bank accounts. We know that there has been a massive increase in the number of people holding those accounts, but, to be honest, that is not particularly due to the work that the banks have done. Indeed, some banks are hesitant regarding basic bank accounts and there is more that the Post Office network could do. If it did so in relation to the card account, there would be a much smoother transfer than some of us currently believe might happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/22">I strongly welcome the report overall. I am incredibly impressed with the thoroughness with which the Treasury Committee undertook the inquiry and the strength of the recommendations, many of which have been implemented, but many of which have not. This matter affects all of our constituents: all of them have a vested interest in it, not just those on a low income. People have come to my surgery to complain about being charged &pound;1.75 or &pound;2, even though they may be relatively high-income earners, because they were not aware that they were going to be charged.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/23">There are many issues to consider, but with good will on all sides, the continuing work of the Treasury Committee and the help and support not just of the Nationwides of this world, which are already on board, but all financial institutions, I hope that we can achieve the sort of marketplace that gives people real choice with regard to how they withdraw funds.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-16a.541.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" speakername="Susan Kramer" colnum="541"  time="015:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060216/halltext/60216h01.htm#60216h01_spnew33">
	<p pid="a.541.0/1">I am very conscious that a number of people have planes to catch; they do not have the luxury of going home on the tube, as I do. Therefore, I shall try to be brief and not reiterate many of the points already made, but I want very much to associate myself with the speeches that have been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.0/2">I reiterate how much I appreciate the excellence of this report. I was not a member of the Treasury Committee at the time, so I can take no credit for a really superb piece of work, or its recommendations. However, I also read the Government's response, which I thought was weak and disappointing. I hope that today the Government will redeem themselves on a matter about which they have made a number of policy statements that ought to mean taking a more active and forceful interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.0/3">I suspect that none of us objects to charging for ATM use where it is genuinely just a matter of convenience. There is a wine shop at the top of my street, and as far as I am concerned, if anyone wants to pay to use the cash machine there, that is their problem; there is a free machine two minutes round the corner, if they can be bothered to walk. However, even in the area where I live, which is an affluent area of Barnes in my constituency, there are two free machines within five minutes' walk of my house.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.0/4">If I were to live on the North Barnes estate, which is one of the most deprived in south London, the only machine in reasonable distance would be in a convenience store, and the machine charges. It would be even worse if I were a pensioner, or, as others have said, a mother with small children, dragging a buggy and whatever else. It is not in the interests of the site owner to put in a machine other than a charging machine, because of the basis on which the fee works. At the heart of this debate is charging within areas of financial exclusion where people are on low incomes, deprived and do not have any other reasonable options for obtaining cash without paying.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.0/5">I hope that the Government's work to identify the postcodes of exclusion will be used as creatively as possible to understand the areas in which people are effectively shut out of using a free ATM. The Government say that they have been unable to make the information available, because it came from a private company and there were commercial constraints. The information is now available to the Treasury Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.0/6">My goodness sake, paying the small additional fee to get wider use of that material has to be a small price to pay for opening up the opportunity to work with the voluntary and private sectors and others to tackle financial exclusion. The benefits of dealing with that underlying problem must be so much greater than the cost that would have to be paid to use the data. Frankly, it ought to be a no-brainer for the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.0/7">The Government responded to the report, saying that they would be worried if people on low incomes genuinely had to pay to obtain cash, but that they were confident that that was not true, because people could go to post offices. In this debate, we have discussed charging at post office machines. I hope that it is fading and that it will end. However, the reality for many people is that there is no local post office, and there will be fewer post offices in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.0/8">There is not one single post office in Ham and Petersham&mdash;probably the poorest ward in my constituency. There is a post office within a mile&mdash;provided that one can fly across the Thames&mdash;which meets the criterion established for the Post Office on the number of branches that it has to have.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.0/9">We are now looking at the withdrawal of the Post Office card account. There is a set of issues about that product, but I am worried about the predictions made by the Post Office and the sub-postmasters that the withdrawal of the account will force yet more branches to close. That will be as true in urban areas of deprivation as in rural areas. Adam Crozier himself said that he could meet the criteria set down for a full distribution of post offices with roughly 4,000 sub-post offices, of which there are presently in excess of 14,0000. A loss of even 1,000 or 2,000 post offices would be devastating for many communities, especially if that meant that we would lose&mdash;again&mdash;the avenue down which the Government were going to provide people with free access to their cash.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.0/10">We must consider the dynamic, and I hope that the Government will do so and recognise that the situation is getting worse, not better. The issue must be considered in the context of financial exclusion more broadly. I believe that we are starting to realise what an impact financial exclusion has. It is not just a matter of convenience; it is the gateway for people to change their lives and achieve their personal goals. That issue is wrapped up at the heart of the debate; it is neither a side nor a minor issue. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1904" name="Dan Norris">The hon. Member for Wansdyke (Dan Norris)</phrase> made the point that for banks, the move to ATMs was a cost-saving measure. It is three times more expensive to serve someone at a counter than it is at an ATM. The banks withdraw counter capacity, shift to the ATM and then move on to close the branch. There is a lingering social obligation to serve the community, and it must be part of negotiations with the various providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.0/11">The issue was raised of ATMs at public service sites. I reiterate the problem of fee-paying cash machines in hospitals. When that issue was put to the Government, they basically said, &quot;Not our problem, guv; it is for the trust.&quot; An issue as fundamental as that cannot be for a trust. West Middlesex university hospital is just one example in my neighbouring constituency of Twickenham, where if someone has to pay for a prescription, they have to pay cash. It is probably not a poverty issue if the person is paying, but they still have to pay cash. Someone feels ill, is not at their best and needs medication. They go to draw cash and the only ATM charges. In addition&mdash;as others have said&mdash;for low-wage employees such as nurses, medical staff, cleaners and whoever else is dependent on that machine, it makes no sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.0/12">I cannot believe that the differential between the cost of a free machine and a charging machine could wreck the viability of a trust, but it sure can be problematic for individuals who are attempting to deal with all the minor problems that one has obtaining cash in a hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.0/13">The issue of transparency is utterly fundamental. I am in a state of shock about the out-of-hand rejection of the proposals for the traffic light, red and green sticker system. It seems such a simple and obvious mechanism, and the Government must use all their ability to advocate it and to apply pressure for it. I support those who say that if necessary, we should legislate. However, we should go a step further: each paying machine ought to state clearly where one can find a free machine. People stand at the paying machine, and they have no idea where to go. Having additional information would be salutary and make it evident quickly if they were in an area where free machines were not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.0/14">I find disturbing the direction in which some of the industry is going. I am sure that the Royal Bank of Scotland's purchase of Hanco was an appropriate corporate strategy, but it begins to underscore the conflict of interest between different parts of the community in supporting free machines versus fee-paying machines. We are all concerned about an underlying tendency to shift in the charging direction, except where there is an articulate and affluent population. When one sees such activity, a warning flag is raised, indicating that we are moving in the wrong direction.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-16a.545.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" speakername="Paul Goodman" colnum="545"  time="016:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060216/halltext/60216h01.htm#60216h01_spnew38">
	<p pid="a.545.1/1">That is exactly so, and it brings me to my next point, which follows on from the remarks made by the hon. Member for Richmond Park, who said that the Government's response was weak and disappointing. It was certainly confusing in one way. The response states on one page:</p>
	<p pid="a.545.1/2" class="indent">&quot;The Government does not believe that free ATMs in the UK are under threat.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.545.1/3">That seems pretty flat. On the next page it states:</p>
	<p pid="a.545.1/4" class="indent">&quot;The Government would be concerned if evidence were found of a significant reduction in the number of free ATMs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.545.1/5">That comment was made despite having, a page earlier, apparently dismissed the possibility that that would happen. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that when he winds up.</p>
	<p pid="a.545.1/6">A great deal has been said about post offices and there was a lively and well- attended debate in Westminster Hall yesterday. The Chairman of the Select Committee produced some good news on free machines earlier. His report set out clearly some of the impasses between the postmasters, who would like to introduce free machines, the Post Office, which is apparently not taking that into account, and the operators, who are getting the money from them. That is good news, but the Government must give a fuller response on what will happen after 2010 when the Post Office card account contract ends. The Economic Secretary will know that early-day motion 1531 on the pilots that are running now has been signed by about 25 of his hon. Friends who are extremely concerned about the matter. I look forward to hearing what he has to say in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.545.1/7">Citizens Advice has said that it has serious concerns about the lack of clarity on the future of the Post Office card account when the current contract runs out in 2010. It is frustrated by the lack of clear information from the Department for Work and Pensions about its plans for the account. The Chamber will be interested to hear what the Economic Secretary says about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.545.1/8">On transparency, it seemed to me that the report was right to push the operators in the direction of clearer signage, larger font sizes and so on. I note that the industry's argument in the report was that it would take a great deal of effort to alter all the machines and that there would be a resulting cost, but the report pointed out that the operators must service the machines anyway, so surely it should be possible to improve transparency.</p>
	<p pid="a.545.1/9">This has been a useful debate. I am aware, as the hon. Member for Richmond Park said, that some hon. Members and perhaps even Ministers have planes to catch, so I will not inconvenience them further and I wait to hear what the Economic Secretary has to say.</p>

	<p pid="a.549.0/1">I thank my right hon. and hon. Friends who have participated in the debate, and also the hon. Members for Wycombe (Mr. Paul Goodman) and for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) for their contributions. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Select Committee report. Throughout the last Parliament, almost all our reports were unanimous&mdash;unanimity is important if reports are to have credibility. I am grateful to all the members of the Treasury Committee, from all parties, who produced the report. They worked as one and their unanimity was its strength.</p>
	<p pid="a.549.0/2">I agree with the Minister on total transparency. I mentioned earlier the veil of secrecy surrounding cash machines. If that can be lifted, that will be a step forward. I can tell the Minister that in the past few years I have had regular meetings with people who have come into my office&mdash;I have a nice office now, because I am Chairman of the Committee&mdash;to give me their point of view. However, there is a disparate element to that, so the suggestion that the Minister has just made is excellent.</p>
	<p pid="a.549.0/3">May I also say that since the Minister has been in post, he has met me on every occasion on which I have wanted to meet him, and we have always had constructive debates. Today's statement could lead to a significant leap forward, and I think that I am speaking for all members of the Select Committee when I say that we will enter into the negotiations in a positive way so that we can realise the aims and objectives of the Committee, the Government and the Opposition. I thank the Minister, and wish him every success in getting to Heathrow in time for his plane.</p>
	<p pid="a.549.0/4" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.549.0/5" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at twenty-eight minutes to Five o'clock.</p>
