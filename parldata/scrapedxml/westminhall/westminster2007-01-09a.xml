<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-09a.1.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1920" speakername="Adrian Bailey" colnum="1"  time="unknown" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070109/halltext/70109h0001.htm#07010948000463">
	<p pid="a.1.2/1">I applied for the debate because a number of developments made it particularly appropriate to discuss the European Union trading scheme for manufacturing industry now. Before dealing with the substance of the debate, I welcome the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" name="Barry Gardiner">the Member for Brent, North (Barry Gardiner)</phrase>, who I understand is deputising at the last moment for the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment. Having to respond to a debate on emissions trading at such short notice will be a supreme test of his ministerial multi-tasking ability, but I am sure that he is capable of dealing with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">As secretary of the all-party group on steel and metal, I speak essentially from the steel producers' perspective. I used the title words &quot;manufacturing industry&quot; in the debate title because there are common issues with other manufacturing sectors; other Members with other specific manufacturing interests will thus be able to join in. My constituency has more foundries than steel companies, but although foundries are not covered by the emissions trading scheme, the issues are still relevant. In the black country, a significant number of jobs still depend on the survival and success of the steel industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3">The Stern report highlighted the potentially catastrophic consequences for the climate if carbon emissions continue unabated. The climate change Bill, the energy White Paper and the EU review of the emissions trading scheme post-2012 provide the United Kingdom with the opportunity to develop a clear climate change policy framework in which industry can plan its future carbon-reducing investments. Central to that is the development of technologies that will lead to reductions in carbon emissions, which will enable manufacturing industry to meet the demands of consumers in developing economies without leading to the consequences outlined in the Stem report. The challenge for the Government is to provide the correct regulatory framework to promote that change.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/4">The UK produces only 2 per cent. of total world emissions, and the greatest challenge is in leading the rest of the world in developing low-carbon economies. The EU emissions trading scheme&mdash;the ETS&mdash;is a worthy first attempt at providing an international industry and environment regulatory structure designed to reduce carbon emissions. The first phase runs from 2005 to 2007, so it is appropriate now to examine the deficiencies of that phase and to look for improvements in the next phase, which is to run until 2012. During the second phase, we will have the opportunity to research and develop new provisions, not only to reduce emissions in Europe but to provide an example and a model that could be developed for non-EU countries. Not only would that make a significantly greater impact on climate change, but it would offer European industry the opportunity to develop technologies that can be adopted by other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/5">In order to demonstrate the flaws in the first phase of the scheme, it is important to understand its structure and methodology. Companies are allocated a certain number of carbon allowances, based partly on their historical record of carbon emissions and partly on their projected use of carbon in the years to 2012. Any carbon consumption over and above those allowances will mean that companies have to buy carbon credits from other companies that have underused their allocations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/6">The first flaw in that approach is that companies with a history of less energy-efficient means of steel production receive more credits. The second is that companies seeking to expand production beyond their original projections, to meet rising world demand, will have to buy extra credits to do so, thereby incurring costs in addition to those associated with new investment. In effect, that is an extra financial penalty for companies that want to invest in newer and potentially cleaner processes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-09a.6.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1692" speakername="Nia Griffith" colnum="6"  time="009:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070109/halltext/70109h0001.htm#07010948000475">
	<p pid="a.6.2/1">We have to recognise that we are at least talking about these issues. Whatever people's views of the EU, at least a number of member states are coming together to discuss the issues and saying, &quot;This is more than something that just one country can solve.&quot; Obviously, the more we can push that out to include a larger number of nations, through initiatives such as the Kyoto agreement and some of the things happening in individual states in the US to influence their Government to come on board, the better. It is very important that we do all that, but we have to start somewhere. We are well aware of the imperfections of the current scheme, which is why we are having this debate and why we want to ensure that, for 2013, we are going in the right direction. It is no good thinking that we can just clear away the dirt from here and have something produced elsewhere, because emissions do not work in that way. Wherever they come from, they affect the whole world.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/2">We need an effective ETS that protects the environment but is pragmatic and does not become just a commercial liability for the UK and the EU. We have a lot to learn. We need to work out how the ETS works and what effect it creates. There have been widely differing interpretations of the scheme from one EU member state to another. Put simply, some Governments have been much more lenient in allocating allowances than others. The UK has been particularly strict. Governments have also used different criteria to set allowances. That is leading to a situation in which companies are tempted to shop around and switch production according to which Government's criteria will afford them the best advantage. It is frightening enough for us to face the fact of companies switching production across the globe where labour prices are cheaper than anything we could ever replicate in the EU, but when companies are tempted to move production to countries such as the Netherlands, with its comparable costs and high environmental standards, simply because the Dutch Government interpret the ETS differently from the UK Government, clearly we need to re-examine the ETS.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/3">Before I move on to the detail of the ETS, it is important that we stress the need to support research initiatives aimed at developing less polluting technologies. The European steel industry is already working towards that end: 48 European companies and organisations, led by a core group of steel producers including Corus, have entered a major research project with the aim of achieving a significant reduction in CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. The project iscalled ULCOS&mdash;ultra-low CO2 steel making. It is a&euro;44 million, part EU-funded, multi-partner research and development initiative to investigate new steel production processes that would significantly reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions compared with current production methods. The consortium is further composed of suppliers to the steel industry, research institutes, small and medium-sized businesses, and universities. A 50 per cent. reduction in atmospheric CO2 emissions has been set as the target. We need to commend the members of the consortium on the initiative and support them even more.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/4">The financial support from the EU via framework 6 and the research fund for coal and steel programmes is a laudable first step, but we need to go further. The British steel industry in particular has expressed concerns that as the EU ETS is currently devised&mdash;a regional cap and trade system with an underlying allocation process that shifts with each successive phase&mdash;there is no real incentive to invest in new, less polluting technologies. In fact, the system as it stands in its initial 2005 to 2007 phase encourages output reduction instead of investment in operational efficiency. In that framework, there is every likelihood that if a new technology such as carbon capture and storage were to be fully developed and subsequently deployed, the future allocation would be reduced, thus negating the value of the investment in generating CO2 credits that can be sold to cover the significant research costs, and leading to a lack of incentive to improve. Instead, we should be trying to increase production at the most energy-efficient plants and ensuring that companies have incentives to invest in the best technology and thus drive down emissions in the long term.</p>

	<p pid="a.13.1/1">I start by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1920" name="Adrian Bailey">the Member for West Bromwich, West (Mr. Bailey)</phrase> on his eloquent testimony in defence of the steel industry. It is a great credit to him that he articulated the case for the steel industry so well. I worked in research and development in that industry for 15 years, when I tried to solve some of the problems that we are discussing. I praise my hon. Friend for securing this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/2">I agree with my hon. Friends about the importance of the steel industry, which we in this country have worked hard to make a success. We have gone through tough times, such as some of the times when I worked in the industry, and now the good times have emerged. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister not to jeopardise all the success and the jobs of people who work in the industry. As someone who represents the Teesside steel industry, where many of my constituents work, I ask him to bear it in mind that several thousand jobs are at stake. He is familiar with the area because he has visited my constituency. However, I want to focus not on the steel industry but on the chemical industry, which is certainly an issue on Teesside. Emissions trading is important for our area and the chemical industry plays an important part in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/3">The energy requirement of the UK chemical industry is responsible for only about 4 per cent. of total UK carbon dioxide emissions. Through its trade association, the Chemical Industries Association, the chemical industry has been measuring and improving energy efficiency for many years. In 1997, the CIA was the first trade association to enter into a voluntary agreement with the Government, and it has negotiated a climate change agreement with them. The chemical sector has a target of a revised energy efficiency improvement of 19 per cent. by 2010 from the levels in the base year of 1998, which will bring the total energy efficiency improvement between 1990 and 2010 to34 per cent. That target is achievable given that the chemical sector has improved its energy efficiency by 19.5 per cent. since 1998. As an engineer, I know the importance of emissions. Given their effect on plant efficiency and product cost, we have to have a technology-led programme for the reduction of emissions because it makes good business sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/4">I want to raise two issues with the Minister about the chemical industry in my area. The first is a plea from a chemical company called Terra Nitrogen UK regarding something called joint implementation, which comes under the emissions trading arrangements of the Kyoto protocol. Joint implementation enables companies to undertake projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and allows Governments to use the credits against their Kyoto targets or for the company to use them itself within the EU emissions trading scheme. Terra wants our Government to support a domestic joint implementation project, but I am told that they are against that idea. Other EU countries such as Germany and France support such schemes&mdash;indeed, France is already developing a regulatory framework for such a scheme&mdash;and I ask the Minister to consider the pleas of companies in my area and take this matter up seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/5">The second issue that I want to discuss concerns Centrica, which is committed to participating in the UK's first complete clean-coal power generation project at a cost of &pound;7.15 million. With its technology development company, Progressive Energy, it has agreed to set up a new energy undertaking called Coastal Energy Ltd, which will seek full consent for the right to construct a new clean-coal power station in Teesside. The project would be the first to combine integrated gasification combined cycle with carbon capture and storage capabilities. That would mean the development of a clean-coal power station to supply electricity for British Gas customers, together with a pipeline and storage project to capture CO2 emissions for under-sea sequestration in the North sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/6">Emissions trading is crucial to the financial viability of the project because it will provide a basis for the selling price of captured CO2. Long-term economic certainty over the payback period of the &pound;1 billion investment project is important. Crucially, the project's CO2 pipeline is likely to be oversized so that it can carry captured CO2 from other large emitters in Tees valley. It is certain that the construction of the power plant, the commissioning of its equipment and the development of the associated offshore pipelines would bring many construction jobs at a difficult time for such jobs in Teesside. Of course, it would also enhance our manufacturing bases in Teesside and the north-east. I hope that the Minister will look at the consents for the scheme which will be coming his way and consider the concerns of the chemical industry in my area that I have mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/7">I would like to reinforce what my hon. Friends have said about the steel industry and its future. I could have gone on for hours about the importance of the steel industry&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.21.2/1">I am delighted to respond under your chairmanship, Mrs. Humble, to this important debate. First, I apologise on behalf of my hon. Friend the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment, who cannot be with us this morning because he is attending a Cabinet Sub-Committee meeting about the Climate Change Bill and what it should contain. I hope that for all Members present, it is a reasonable excuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/2">I am always proud of my colleagues, but not for a long time have I been quite so proud of a group of them as I have been during this morning's debate. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1920" name="Adrian Bailey">the Member for West Bromwich, West (Mr. Bailey)</phrase> on the way in which he introduced the debate, on the extraordinary way in which he has championed his constituency and its interests, and on the responsible way in which he has done so by setting the issue within the context of climate change as a whole. My hon. Friends the Members for Llanelli (Nia Griffith), for Aberavon(Dr. Francis), for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Ms Smith), for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland(Dr. Kumar) and for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman) all replicated that when they spoke. It has been a good debate, and the speeches from Opposition Members contributed to the way in which the debate was conducted.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/3">I shall make some general remarks about emissions trading, and then I want to focus on the questions that have been raised. I shall try not to take interventions in the hope that I will get through my remarks and answer all those questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/4">Last year there were many positive developments in the EU emissions trading scheme. Phase 1 was always a learning-by-doing phase, recognising that emissions trading had not been tried before on that scale, and that it was likely that there would be lessons to learn. We have heard this morning that that was very much the case. The first significant and positive lesson of phase 1 is that it is possible to take multilateral action to tackle climate change. The EU ETS has been developed and implemented against a tight timetable. Although not all member states were able to meet the challenging timetable, the scheme was operational throughout the majority of the EU by early 2005, demonstrating that it is possible to take swift and decisive action to implement measures to combat climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/5">The first year's results have reinforced that positive message. They show that the mechanism is viable and that the scheme is functioning as expected. Throughout Europe, operators monitored and reported their verified emissions and surrendered allowances for 2005. Compliance in the UK has been excellent; almost all operators surrendered sufficient allowances within the deadline. The first year of the scheme has shown that there is a solid base on which to build for the future&mdash;but by golly we have to build.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/6">Last year was also important for the development of phase 2, in which a key aim was to create as level a playing field as possible for businesses throughout Europe. A key UK priority for phase 2 was to work towards more consistent coverage of emissions sources throughout the EU's 25 countries in order to reduce the potential for competitive distortions. The UK, in conjunction with industry and other member states, developed consistent definitions of the expansion activities to help ensure consistent coverage of the new activities. The Commission has shown that it is using those definitions when assessing member states' phase 2 national allocation plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/7">In addition to those lessons, the operation of the scheme to date has highlighted many other issues about which member states and the Commission should be aware. Some, such as the handling of market sensitive information, can be and are being carried out now; others such as the scheme's impact on smaller emitters, however, must be addressed through legislative changes. The Commission's review of the EU ETS directive is considering them.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/8">Smaller emitters make up the majority of installations covered by the scheme, but they account for only a small proportion of emissions. In 2005 about 60 per cent. of installations in the UK emitted less than 5 per cent. of the UK's total emissions covered by the EU ETS. That raises questions about whether the associated regulatory burden is appropriate for those installations. The UK has scaled administrative charges and established tiered monitoring and reporting requirements to reduce the regulatory burden on the installations, and we have suggested means to exclude some of the smallest emitters from phase 2. The Commission's review must consider whether the scheme should capture smaller emitters.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/9">Another lesson learned was the need for a scarcity of emissions allowances. Our debate has touched on the issue, which is vital to the scheme if it is to deliver real emissions reductions and help to deliver the EU's Kyoto commitments. The first year's results showed that throughout Europe, emissions were lower than had been anticipated when member states set their emissions cap and allocated their allowances. However, it is evident from emissions results in 2005 that more allowances were available than were required for compliance with the scheme, deflating the value of allowances and, consequently, diminishing the financial incentive to reduce emissions over buying allowances.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/10">Although it is too early to draw firm conclusions with just one year's data, the results highlight the fact that for future phases it is crucial to set consistently realistic but tough caps throughout the EU. Since scarcity drives the carbon price, it should incentivise industry to deliver real emissions reductions. The Commission has recognised that, and in an announcement in November last year on 10 member states' plans for phase 2 of the scheme, it asked for further work from a number of them. It is looking for significant further reductions in emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/11">The Commission set out clearly the framework under which it has taken decisions, which the UK welcomes. It has set a standard for the plans that have yet to be submitted and assessed, and it has made clear the importance of using the emissions trading scheme to achieve Kyoto targets and to make good use of the potential for emissions reductions.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/12">Pressures for emissions reductions will increase over the next decade and beyond. It is vital for EU competitiveness that we meet those pressures through mechanisms that do not generate unnecessary regulatory burdens, that allow businesses to make their own choices on priorities, and that minimise the costs of reducing emissions. Trading does that, and it is important to ensure that trading continues to work. In addition, the UK will benefit from being at the forefront of the growing global market for carbon technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/13">During the development of phase 2, several sectors and companies raised the issue of competitiveness. The steel sector is one sector in which international competition is intense. We have consulted extensively with industry throughout the development of our policy, and we take seriously its concerns, which have been so articulately presented in the debate. To date, the signs are that the EU ETS has a promising future.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/14">I shall now try to respond to the questions posed during the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, West asked one key question, which my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli also articulated. It was about global warming being global and needing a global solution, and about the danger of exporting emissions rather than reducing them. It is part of the reason why almost full business-as-usual allocations were given to industry. We recognise the concerns: they are about finding the correct balance and about the need to take sufficient but not excessive action. We are working closely with the Commission and third countries such as the USA and Australia to develop that global carbon market, and the Commission is considering the issue in its review.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/15">Within our debate hon. Members asked questions about the need for sector-specific targets. I agree that different sectors face different competition issues, and phases 1 and 2 recognise that through the almost full allocation to all sectors other than the large electricity producers' sector. The ETS review is also considering the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/16">The UK must play its part in the global effort to tackle climate change, and I was grateful for the consensual spirit adopted by Opposition Members, who noted how, in the circumstances, the Government have responded appropriately through our national allocation plan. The UK has worked to harmonise where possible, and to create as level a playing field as possible for industry. We will continue to do so, targeting and balancing the impact on business with our environmental concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/17">My hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland also asked me a question. On carbon capture and storage, we take seriously the issues that he raised with Transco and Centrica in his constituency. I am sure that my colleague the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment will take considerable note of the project as it develops, and that he will work with the Commission to ensure that carbon capture and storage is recognised in phase 2 of the ETS and beyond. We hope that it will provide the necessary clarity for business when pursuing the schemes that my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland outlined.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/18">My hon. Friend also asked about joint implementation projects receiving domestic support.In the time available, I cannot go into that, but Ishall ensure that my ministerial colleague is in touch with him.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-09a.30.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" speakername="Paul Flynn" colnum="30"  time="011:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070109/halltext/70109h0005.htm#07010948000513">
	<p pid="a.30.2/1">We are all grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1877" name="John Stanley">the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)</phrase>&mdash;I can call him my friend, because I have known him for a long time&mdash;for the wealth of his experience on the Foreign Affairs Committee and for all that he has learned on his visit to Afghanistan. He gave a sobering report. What came through some of his suggestions was the pessimism that must be the proper reaction to the situation there, particularly after our incursion in Helmand province.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/2">To return to the beginning of our involvement, it is important that we have a Minister here who played a crucial part in the early days of the invasion and its aftermath. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said in October 2001:</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/3" class="indent">&quot;We act because the al-Qaeda network and the Taliban regime are funded in large parts on the drugs trade. Ninety per cent. of all heroin sold on the streets of Britain originates from Afghanistan. Stopping that trade is directly in our interests.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/4">The hope that was shared by the Government andthe Opposition, almost unanimously throughout the House, was that there could be a twin battle against the threat of terrorism and, rightly, against the Taliban and their mediaeval cruelty, to which the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling referred, while also destroying the refuge that al-Qaeda had enjoyed in that country. They were seen to be worthwhile objectives and were supported almost unanimously throughout the House. We would have a twin campaign&mdash;a double war and a double victory.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/5">We see now, however, that we have not secured a double victory but, if anything, a double catastrophe. We have been reminded of the drugs situation. Not only has Britain taken the lead, but the spending will increase to more than &pound;200 million&mdash;we have spent more than &pound;100 million already, &pound;21 million of which has disappeared without trace and greatly antagonised the Taliban farmers. It was meant to be paid to them in compensation, but it disappeared in what for the past two centuries has been the endemically corrupt system of government in Afghanistan&mdash;there is a long history of that. Freedom of information investigations have turned up some of the documents that were needed for the Taliban farmers whose crops were destroyed in 2003 to receive the compensation due to them. They have not received that compensation and they rightly feel cheated. In fact, the efforts that we made in destroying those crops gave a further inducement to those farmers to plant more crops. We find ourselves in the ridiculous situation where our actions there have not reduced the crops&mdash;production fell by 2 per cent. in the year before last, but it is now up by 60 per cent., to the highest it has ever been.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/6">The idea was to stop the heroin on the streets of Britain, but if we go a few hundreds yards from this place, we can buy heroin more cheaply in real terms than at any time. That is utter, abject failure. As I said in my intervention on the right hon. Gentleman, even if we had successfully destroyed the entire crop, the supply of the heroin would not be affected&mdash;it might be affected temporarily, but that would only increase the price and thereby the crime on our streets. The reaction would be an immediate increase in cultivation in Laos, Myanmar and elsewhere in that string of countries, exactly as has happened in Colombia. We should have learned the lesson: America spent billions of dollars trying to destroy the crops in Colombia. It had some success in that it reduced Colombian production, but production greatly increased in Peru and Bolivia in keeping with the &quot;squeezed balloon&quot; principle.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/7">A splendid report by Lord Birt and the strategy unit, published under freedom of information legislation, clearly makes the point: we cannot destroy the drugs problem on the supply side. We can do it only in other ways. The situation is one of abject, utter failure. The lives of British troops are being sacrificed to an impossible cause. As always, I praise the heroism and professionalism of our soldiers in Afghanistan; I have met some from my constituency. Given the combat that they face, they are doing a splendid job in circumstances as difficult as anything faced by soldiers for many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/8">I turn to what has been happening recently. A short while ago in the House, I raised a question with the Secretary of State for Defence about the endemic corruption of the Karzai Government&mdash;not so much of Karzai himself. I am sure that he is a good and idealistic man, but he is running the country in the only way possible: by doing dirty deals, through bribery and by using an army of provincial governors and police chiefs. I asked the Secretary of State:</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/9" class="indent">&quot;With Karzai increasingly appointing warlords, ex-Taliban leaders, criminals and drug dealers as police chiefs and provincial governors, is not the likelihood that oppression by these provincial governors and police chiefs will greatly increase the danger to our soldiers?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/10">We are associated with that rotten Government. There was an election, so they are a democratic Government, but as a western democracy we would not recognise them as a fair Government. The Secretary of State gave me an interesting answer. In a bit of a cheap shot, about which I later wrote to him, he decided that I was attacking one man. I was not; I was attacking the generality. He referred to the only star, the only provincial governor about whom we could talk with pride. The Secretary of State said:</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/11" class="indent">&quot;My hon. Friend should be careful in what he says...The description he has given of the governance of Helmand is far from the truth.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/12">I did not mention Helmand in the question, but that is what he said. He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/13" class="indent">&quot;Governor Engineer Mohammad Daud is a very brave, committed and non-corrupt individual, which is why we want to support him so much. He is a force for good in Helmand province.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-10-10.189"><i>Official Report</i>, 10 October 2006; Vol. 450, c. 189</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/14">The Secretary of State was absolutely right and entirely fair, but last month Mohammad Daud was sacked. He is no longer the provincial governor of Helmand province; clearly, in that province there is no place, certainly in the Karzai Government, for someone with idealism who is non-corrupt. Mr. Daud could not survive there. Not only was Mr. Daud non-corrupt, but he achieved what has probably been the most promising success in Afghanistan by negotiating the deal that has brought temporary peace in Musa Qala. There is an interesting set-up there, which I think gives hope for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/15">Yes, we agree that there have been great gains in Afghanistan as far as women and education are concerned. However, it would be a mistake to believe that women are educated on the finer points of Plato's &quot;Republic&quot; or the writings of Voltaire. They are educated in sharia law. There is no way of altering that; it is part of the culture of Afghanistan. The Taliban attacks on the schools and their murder of teachers and others involved is wickedness on a terrible scale. Of course we have to fight to try to stop that happening. However, do we have an attainable aim? Can we really do it? I believe that we can defend the gains that we have made around Kabul. For all the control that he has, Karzai is really the mayor of Kabul. The rest of Afghanistan is farmed out to warlords and provincial governors who still run the bulk of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/16">Since our February Westminster Hall debate on Afghanistan, we have been arguing about our going into Helmand province and trying to extend there. That was mission impossible; we cannot take control in that area. We can defend the gains around Kabul and use Karzai's influence on the warlords, but that is the maximum that we can gain. That is not just my opinion. In our February debate, I gave a very pessimistic assessment of the situation and suggested that we were heading towards a British or NATO Vietnam.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/17">Having heard suggestions that we should escalate the number of troops in the country, I am extremely worried that such a situation will come about, in which we are fighting not a traditional war between nations but an insurgency. We know the result of that from Chinese, US and French involvement in Vietnam and the humiliation of various other western nations with great sophisticated armies. I do not want to make too close a comparison with the Russians on this issue, but what is happening now was exactly forecast to me by a member of the Duma when we invaded in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/18">At the moment, the hope of getting out with some dignity is the Musa Qala deal. I wrote to and asked the Secretary of State for Defence about that. I suggested to him that we had withdrawn British troops from Musa Qala, and that that had seemed a sensible thing to do. He said that we had not withdrawn the troops, but redeployed them. There is a subtle difference, perhaps; I do not know.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/19">The Taliban are still in Musa Qala; they are inactive but present. We are not there, and a deal was done by the people who run the place so that they could recruit their own army, which I understand we are helping to finance. All that has resulted in a period of calm, without hostility. There is hope, although there is some nervousness in the Government about whether the situation will break down. Questions have been raised about the loyalty of the army, given that many of its members are certainly former members of the Taliban. However, in the context of looking for an optimistic solution, the Musa Qala deal has been good. We should certainly try to extend it to Sangin province.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/20">After February, when we went in, we had lost seven troops in Afghanistan, most as a result of accidents. Since then, I believe that we have lost another 35, mostly in combat. That is a sad and bitter price for their families to pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/21">There is an answer. I was disappointed to hear what the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling said about the serious suggestion of using poppies for medicinal purposes as morphine. He said that the market was flooded, but it is not flooded as far as the developing world is concerned. The chance of a person in the developing world with a terminal illness or in terrible pain getting morphine is very small&mdash;only 6 per cent. Following the suggestion might well reduce the price of morphine.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/22">In the western world, we know that if we face terminal pain we will almost certainly be supplied with morphine, that greatest of painkillers. However, there is certainly a market in the world that needs to be supplied. M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res says that it has great difficulty in getting supplies and providing people with the boon of morphine and codeine. Yes, there is a great legal market supplied by Turkey, India and Tasmania, but it is not saturated. The suggestion in respect of poppies is practical. There are ways of growing them so that they go down the medical route rather than that of drugs of abuse. We should take up the proposals made by the Senlis council. There is support from Afghan farmers, who are either bribed from one side or attacked from the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/23">The new governor of Helmand province, Mr. Wafa&mdash;a bit of an unknown quantity&mdash;has a plan to spray the poppies with herbicide. We can only pause to recall past experience of spraying crops. I do not know whether Mr. Wafa intends to spray them from the air, but the Karzai Government oppose the plan. However, we know that in most such cases, the decisions are taken by the United States as it exercises its influence over Karzai. Another catastrophe could take place; the people will certainly be further antagonised.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/24">We can congratulate our troops, who recently achieved a significant military victory. Their reconstruction work has been virtually frozen for some months now. They were virtually confined to their barracks because of the ferocity of opposition from the Taliban and some of the civilian populations. Adding crop spraying to the list of what are perceived to be our crimes as the farangi in that area will further add to the difficulty of ever winning hearts and minds there.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/25">You rightly asked us to be reasonably brief so that everyone can speak, Mrs. Humble, so I shall wind up now. There is no quick fix, but neither is there a slow fix. We must recognise that our mission in Helmand province is unattainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/26">There is another danger. As a member of the Western European Union Defence Committee, I speak to people from more than 40 European countries. I know the views of fellow members of NATO such as France, Germany and Italy. Their views are different from those of this country, Canada and the Netherlands. I do not believe that there is any situation in which they would go into Kandahar or Helmand province. They regard that as a step too far and something that would be a suicidal mission for their soldiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/27">Canada, Britain and the Netherlands have lost a great many troops. One questions whether they died in vain. It would be an act of criminal folly for us to send more troops on a mission for which there is no possible victory. Our best course of action would be to consolidate the gains that we have made around Kabul and to use our influence with the Karzai Government for benign ends. We should not continue with what we are doing in Helmand but seek a dignified retreat from the province. We will not call it a retreat, of course&mdash;we will dress it up as a deal&mdash;but we must get out of there. We can work with warlords who could use their influence to bring peace, but we will not achieve some kind of Scandinavian democracy in the area, as many here claim is possible. It is unattainable.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-09a.39.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" speakername="Jeremy Browne" colnum="39"  time="011:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070109/halltext/70109h0006.htm#07010948000526">
	<p pid="a.39.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1877" name="John Stanley">the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling(Sir John Stanley)</phrase> on a characteristically thorough and impressive introduction to our debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/2">The backdrop, of course, is the attacks by al-Qaeda on the United States on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase> and the subsequent response by the US and others, including the United Kingdom. The Liberal Democrats supported the intervention by British armed forces in Afghanistan in the wake of 9/11, partly because the country was evidently a base for al-Qaeda and could form a platform for exporting militancy around the world. It was difficult to have much sympathy for the Taliban regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/3">Considerable progress has been made, and I am sure others would echo the sentiment that the tales coming out of Afghanistan are not all bleak. For a start the Taliban Government have been removed; the Taliban has residual influence but it no longer controls the country as it did. Anyone who is of a liberal disposition will see huge merit in the fact that the Taliban is no longer running the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/4">Many basic measures of attainment are pointing in the right direction. There is greater access to health care and an increasing number of children are being educated. We have seen progress, and I would not wish anyone to leave here with the impression that my party does not regard that as worthy of support, just as we remain supportive of the troops and the British presence in Afghanistan. However, there is much to reflect upon given the difference between the objectives and ambitions that the country had when we first sent troops there and the position today.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/5">From the beginning, it is fair to say that there has been confusion about the purpose of the mission in Afghanistan. We were told that troops were intended to enhance stability and to spread the authority of the Afghan Government, but what was billed as a stability mission has rapidly become a full-blown counter-insurgency operation. One can see that in the disparity between the present position and the statements made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" name="John Reid">the right hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid)</phrase> when he was Secretary of State for Defence. He allowed the British to believe that there may be no need for British forces to engage in substantial fighting in southern Afghanistan. That is evidently not the case, and the news on our television screens and radios and in our newspapers nearly every day makes that clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/6">We are trying to fight in two countries in the middle east&mdash;Afghanistan and Iraq. It is worth repeating that if the armed forces are overstretched it is due in large part to the fact that the Labour and Conservatives parties voted for us to go to war simultaneously in both countries. Many people in the Liberal Democrat party and beyond regard the invasion of Iraq as a distraction from the work being done in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/7">We supposedly invaded Iraq because of the link between Saddam Hussein and the appalling events of <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>&mdash;a link that has never been established; or because, according to the Prime Minister's account, weapons of mass destruction posed an imminent threat to the security of the United Kingdom. Some said that that threat could be realised in 45 minutes. That, too, proved not to be the case. I leave those arguments to one side&mdash;they have been rehearsed again and again, and I wish to consider only the effect on Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/8">I keep hearing about overstretch, a lack of equipment for British forces and the difficulties of retention and recruitment in the armed forces because of problems with morale and the time that soldiers and others have to spend away from home. Our presence in Iraq was the result of a conscious decision by the vast majority of Labour and Conservative Members in the House that we would commit our forces to the war in Iraq, despite the absence of al-Qaeda links in Iraq and the evident links in Afghanistan. That war has been a distraction from some of the work being undertaken in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/9">Drugs were mentioned earlier. If that is a measure of our success, it is lamentable. The Prime Minister gave the country the impression that the British presence in Afghanistan would reduce the amount of drugs coming to the UK and being used here illegally. I refer to a written answer to the Conservative spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase>&mdash;I give credit where it is due&mdash;from the Foreign Office. It confirmed that in Afghanistan in 2005 4,100 metric tonnes of opium poppies were cultivated; that by 2006 the figure was up to 6,100 tonnes&mdash;an increase of about 50 per cent. year on year&mdash;and that Helmand province saw an increase of 162 per cent. in the amount of opium poppy cultivation in 2006. If that was the Prime Minister's objective, as we were led to believe, our efforts have not been conspicuously successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/10">I wish to give others more time to speak, particularly the Minister, so I finish by saying that, although our presence in Afghanistan is necessary to continue to ensure that it does not act as a base for exporting violent militancy, extremism and terrorism around the world, good things are being done there. However, there is confusion about our objectives. I hope that the Minister will be able to deal with these three questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/11">First, what is our goal? In summary, is our aim to make the country sufficiently stable that people do not daily go in fear of their lives and that the aid agencies can go about their business reasonably unmolested, or are we instead trying to achieve the far more ambitious goal of exporting western-style liberal democracy to Afghanistan? If it is the second, laudable though it may be, the Government will have a big struggle on their hands.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/12">The only time in my memory that power has changed hands between political parties was at the 1997 general election. That shows how infrequently it happens in Britain&mdash;or how young I am, or a combination of the two. I remember being struck by how painless the process was. One party and one Prime Minister were in charge of one of the most powerful countries in the world&mdash;a member of the United Nations Security Council, a member of NATO, a nuclear power and all that goes with that&mdash;but after the people had voted, they exited office and a newer regime, a newer Administration, came in with a new Prime Minister. We take such things for granted, assuming that they can be exported to other countries, and that others can pick them up and take things from there, but the process that took place in the UK in 1997 and which happens in other mature and established democracies takes a long time to establish. The Government are showing an element of naivet&eacute; if they think that they can export our liberal democratic systems and values as a package to other countries. Indeed, we have heard a lot about the corruption in Afghanistan that undermines those intentions.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/13">The second question is what is the Government's envisaged timetable in Afghanistan? They may not have one, but I would be interested to know whether the Minister thinks that we will be there months, years or decades. At the moment, it is unclear. He may say, as the Prime Minister does about Iraq, that we will be there for as long as the job takes, but that is an extremely vague basis on which to plan defence expenditure and British foreign policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/14">The third question summarises all that I have said. What would the Government regard as constituting success in Afghanistan? Whether we take it from when the Prime Minister leaves office in a few months, or whether we take a longer view and consider what might have happened in 10 years' time, what would the Minister regard as a successful outcome to our venture in Afghanistan? It would be extremely interesting to know, as it would be a basis on which to measure the Government's policy and the achievements that had been made in the meantime.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-09a.57.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="57"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070109/halltext/70109h0009.htm#07010948000551">
	<p pid="a.57.1/1">It is a pleasure to be able to discuss rural policing in Gloucestershire. I am glad to be flanked by two Conservative colleagues from the county, my hon. Friends the Members for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) and for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson), although I should not forget <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>, who has remained in his place from the previous Adjournment debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/2">I shall focus on two points. First, I should remind everyone that both the rural and the urban parts of our county need their fair share of policing resources. Secondly, I should draw attention to the financial squeeze that is likely to come from Government funding pressures over the next couple of years. I want to know whether the Minister can help and whether we can start that dialogue and process now.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/3">My starting point is my constituents' feeling that there is an imbalance between the policing in the urban and the rural parts of the county. The Forest and Gloucester basic command unit has the most officers in the county&mdash;336&mdash;but the bulk of them are based in Gloucester rather than in the Forest. One thing that irks my constituents and local officers is that those officers are extracted from the Forest of Dean to deal with public order policing in the city of Gloucester, particularly on Friday and Saturday evenings. I have been out on patrol with the police, and I have seen how stretched they are when dealing with incidents at those times. They then have a difficult balance in respect of prioritising calls from members of the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/4">It is reasonable to expect the deployment of police to be focused, to some extent, on the areas that have the highest levels of crime. Forest's population is three quarters that of Gloucester, but its crime level is only a quarter of Gloucester's. I do not expect the level of policing to reflect only the level of population, as to do so would be unreasonable, but to have it entirely determined by the crime level is also not reasonable. People in rural parts of the county and the Forest of Dean pay their fair share of local tax, through the council tax police precept, and of national taxation. They should expect a reasonable level of coverage by the police in terms of response times, beat patrolling and all the things that they should be able to take for granted, as their neighbours who live in Gloucester and Cheltenham are able to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/5">We need to examine how this area is managed. Recent parliamentary questions, albeit not ones broken down on a county or constituency basis, have shown that rural crime is rising. Rural parts of the country are not peaceful idylls. Instances of violence against the person rose from slightly fewer than 70,000 crimes in 1998 to slightly fewer than 160,000 in 2005. The rise was more than 100 per cent., which is large even when one takes into account changes in recording methods.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/6">Surveys in my constituency, and I am sure that the same applies in other areas, show that crime, law and order and policing are a key concern&mdash;second only to the national health service. People expect those issues to be addressed, and about 60 per cent. of constituents who responded to surveys considered that having more police officers out on the beat patrolling our towns and villages was the best way of addressing them. Such an approach not only deals with crime when it occurs but acts as a deterrent.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/7">I tabled some questions to Ministers on this issue. A recent parliamentary answer by the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety showed that the number of police on the street in Gloucestershire had declined from 593 in 2003 to 456 in 2006. I immediately had an irate chief constable on the phone to me pointing out that those numbers were inaccurate, that the Home Office had changed the basis on which they were calculated and that I was not making a like-for-like comparison between the two years. I hope that the relevant Minister will correct the record and issue accurate figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/8">Despite that, only about a third of police officers are out on the streets, as the Home Secretary puts it. The situation makes me wonder what the rest are up to.The increasing bureaucratic requirements are tying up the police and not giving them the chance to do the job that my constituents and the public more generally expect them to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/9">I recommend to the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase> the book by police constable David Copperfield&mdash;it is a pseudonym&mdash;&quot;Wasting Police Time&quot;. The writer is a serving police officer who spends a great deal of his time</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/10" class="indent">&quot;filing, stapling, and writing forms, reports, statements, e-mails and exhibits.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/11">He deals with a sea of paperwork, and spends far too little time doing the part of the job that he loves, the bit where he gets to chase criminals and arrest them, which was the reason why he joined the police force and is also what the majority of our constituents want the police to be doing.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.1/1">If <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" name="Laurence Robertson">the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase> wants to make a point, I shall allow him to intervene.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/2">I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Pope. I am pleased to be here this afternoon. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> on securing this important debate and the way in which he presented his case. I am also pleased to see his hon. Friends the Members the Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) and for Tewkesbury, as well as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>. I know that for all of them, whatever our differences, this is an important and serious debate. I welcome the constructive and thoughtful way in which the hon. Member for Forest of Dean made his points, even if there are differences between us. If I fail to answer any of his points, it will not be a deliberate omission. He is at liberty to intervene and I shall respond appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/3">The point to make at the beginning is that although I shall respond to some of the issues about police funding, the deployment of officers in the local area is of course an operational matter for the chief constable in liaison with the police authority. I guess that part of the reason for raising the matter is to raise those issues and I am sure that he has been in correspondence and had discussions with the chief constable.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/4">I know something about Gloucestershire because I visited Cheltenham and Tewkesbury basic command unit a few months ago and went to Whaddon police station on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-19">19 September</phrase>. I had the opportunity to see at first hand the neighbourhood policing there and was impressed by the commitment of the local police officers. I have met the chief constable of Gloucestershire and was impressed. I am also impressed by the work that the police do in Gloucester and Gloucestershire and I would like publicly to commend them. I know that the hon. Gentlemen and my hon. Friend join me in that commendation.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/5">The hon. Member for Forest of Dean will have heard some of the funding figures, but I need to put them on the record. There has been a huge increase in resources for the police service in England and Wales over a sustained period. On a like-for-like basis, Government grant and central spending on services for the police will have increased from &pound;6.2 billion in 1997-98 to&pound;11 billion in 2007-08, which is an increase of nearly &pound;4.8 billion or a cash increase of 77 per cent. or, in real terms, more than 39 per cent. between 1997-98 and 2007-08. Gloucestershire and other police authorities and police services throughout the country will have received their fair share of those resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/6">Provisional allocations for 2007-08 were announced as long ago as December 2005 to provide greater certainty and allow authorities such as Gloucestershire to improve medium-term planning. Police forces and police authorities have welcomed that. That is why we will move to a three-year settlement from 2008-09&mdash;the hon. Gentleman mentioned that&mdash;to try to provide some certainty for planning, although there will always be a debate about the level of those resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/7">All police authorities, including Gloucestershire, are set to receive an increase in general formula grant, which makes up the great bulk of central Government support to the police of 3.6 per cent. That increase is both higher than the 3.1 per cent. increase in general grant this year and well above inflation, which was forecast to be 2.7 per cent. The hon. Gentleman will know that the consultation period on the provisional funding settlement for 2007-08 closed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-05">5 January</phrase>. We are now considering the representations that we have received in response to the formal funding announcement that we made on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-28">28 November</phrase> and the House will debate the Government's proposed settlement at the end of the month.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/8">Gloucestershire, like every other police force, has benefited from the good funding settlements of the past few years. Total Government funding for Gloucestershire will have increased from &pound;51.7 million in 1997-98 to &pound;70 million next year, which is an increase of more than &pound;18 million or a cash increase of more than 35 per cent. However, it is only fair to acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's point that police authorities throughout the country, including Gloucestershire, have made local decisions about the level of precept that they should charge, and district councils such as my own, which do not have a police authority function, have also purchased police community support officers. My authority has purchased six.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/9">I take the hon. Gentleman's point about Gloucestershire's decision, which many authorities throughout the country have made. He wanted me to refer to that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-09a.62.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" speakername="Vernon Coaker" colnum="62"  time="013:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070109/halltext/70109h0010.htm#07010948000557">
	<p pid="a.62.1/1">There is always a debate about costs and income. My point is that there has been a significant rise in income for Gloucestershire police from central Government. The hon. Gentleman asked me to recognise that local authorities, including Gloucestershire, make a valuable contribution to that. I was trying to respond to that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/2">Gloucestershire will receive &pound;56.5 million in general grants in 2007-08, an increase of 3.6 per cent. or&pound;2 million over this year. That is in line with the broadly flat increase of 3.6 per cent. for all police authorities throughout England and Wales. It is worth noting that Gloucestershire would have received &pound;600,000 less if we had applied the police funding formula strictly. Gloucestershire has been supported by the funding formula for many years, and it benefits from that method. I receive complaints from police forces throughout the country which lose money because we establish a funding floor so that others, including Gloucestershire, do not lose out according to the funding formula.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/3">On top of the general grant that Gloucestershire will receive, there will be more than &pound;13 million in specific grants and capital provision. That will include&pound;1.8 million in special formula grant, a consolidation of former grants, which will include &pound;770,000 from the rural policing fund. Police authorities have complete flexibility to spend formula grants as they choose. We have recently announced that from this year, the control of officer numbers that accompanied the largest specific grant, the crime fighting fund, is being lifted, as the hon. Gentleman noted. It is a major facet of funding flexibility, for which the police service has long campaigned, and if we are being honest, the policy is a real difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/4">We have responded to the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities, which have asked us to stop ring-fencing money and give them the additional money so that police services can use it in their local areas as they see fit. That is what we have done. The changes that we have made, which brought about the reduction in police community support officer numbers to which the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Cotswold referred, were due to the flexibilities that the police service and the APA asked us to introduce. The APA press release following the change said that it was a welcome step in the right direction and &quot;a positive step forwards&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/5">There is a tension, however. The hon. Member for Forest of Dean, the hon. Member for Cotswold and my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud know that there is always a conflict between the national direction in which funds should be spent and local flexibility and decision making. We responded to the demand from local police services and authorities for flexibility, and we gave it to them. As a result, they are able to choose how they wish to spend the money.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/6">There is a consequence. I am sure that in other debates people would say, &quot;Central Government should get off the back of local services, let local people determine how best to deliver services in their area and let them make the choices which best fit that.&quot; That is what we have done with those funds and resources.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.2/1">I accept the Minister's point that it is helpful if police authorities are given the funds with as little ring-fencing as possible, but they must have the funds. One problem with the PCSO announcement was that although the Government did not tell constabularies to have a certain number of PCSOs, they did not give them all the money either. Therewas less money available nationally, the bulk ofit went to London, and the one-off amountthat the Gloucestershire constabulary received for neighbourhood policing was &pound;167,000, which does not pay for much at all.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-09a.64.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" speakername="Vernon Coaker" colnum="64"  time="013:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070109/halltext/70109h0010.htm#07010948000561">
	<p pid="a.64.0/1">The hon. Gentleman knows that in 2006-07 we funded 100 per cent. of PCSOs in Gloucestershire for five months. That figure was in the budget for 2006-07. In 2007-08, 100 per cent. of PCSOs will be funded at 75 per cent. of the cost. If we compare the money that Gloucestershire received for that five months in 2006-07 with the money in 2007-08, during which we are funding all PCSOs for the entire year at 75 per cent. of the cost, a figure that every constabulary throughout the country knew, we return to a 3.6 per cent. increase, rather than the 1.5 per cent. increase to which the hon. Gentleman refers.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/2">Neighbourhood policing is being introduced in Gloucestershire, and it is important: it provides the responsive, accountable and visible policing that we all wish to see. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>, Gloucestershire had 1,289 police officers, 156 more than in March 1997. Support staff are often missed out in any discussion of police officers, but they are an important part of the police service. The number of support staff working with those officers in Gloucestershire was 675, an increase of 240 since 1997. It helps with delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/3">Police numbers in the Forest and Gloucester basic command unit, which will be of interest to the hon. Gentleman, increased from 292 in March 2002 to 357 in March 2006. There were also 30 PCSOs by June 2006. It is interesting how the debate about PCSOs has moved on from opposition to their introduction to argument about their numbers. We should all pay tribute to the work that they do, as to be fair the hon. Gentleman has.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/4">Recorded crime fell by 1 per cent. in Gloucestershire in 2005-06 compared with the previous year; there was an impressive 14 per cent. fall in domestic burglary and a 16 per cent. fall in vehicle crime. Within the Forest of Dean crime and disorder reduction partnership, there were also impressive falls in crime. The hon. Gentleman pointed out alleged funding difficulties with which we do not agree, but in the basic command unit in his constituency, overall crime was down by10 per cent. Domestic burglary was down by 20 per cent. and vehicle crime was down by 26 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/5">The fall in overall crime in the Forest of Dean is better than those recorded by more urban CDRPs. We should pay tribute to the work not only of the police, as he has, but of the Forest of Dean CDRP. I had a look at its website, and the different initiatives are impressive. While we debate the levels of resources and funding, it is important to point out, as I know the hon. Gentleman will, the successes in reducing crime in many areas, so that people feel safer on the street.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" name="Paddy Tipping">the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase> on securing the debate today. He is an authoritative and committed supporter of this important industry, as are my other colleagues who have spoken.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.0/2">The Government believe firmly that access to a range of energy sources is essential to the security of energy supplies and that coal will play a continuing role in meeting this country's energy needs for many years to come. That is provided, of course, that its environmental impact can be managed satisfactorily. Reference has been made already to emerging technologies such as clean-coal technology, carbon capture and storage. Perhaps I should add that no one needs reminding of the importance of a nation's energy security to its wider national security.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.0/3">The Government believe also that UK-produced coal should play a role in meeting our total requirements. Again, reference has been made to our statement on that in the recently published energy review. This country still has substantial coal resources, which represent an important national asset. We need to put those resources to optimum use, provided that they can be worked at acceptable economic and, as I have mentioned, environmental cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.0/4">I believe that the Government have demonstrated their support for the coal industry by making more than &pound;200 million available in coal state aid since 2000. Of that, some &pound;33.8 million has been paid to mines in Nottinghamshire, including &pound;18.9 million to Harworth colliery. Welbeck and Thoresby collieries have also received coal investment aid. Welbeck was awarded some &pound;7.78 million, of which &pound;5.7 million has been drawn down, and Thoresby &pound;4.97 million, of which&pound;1 million remains to be claimed.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.0/5">Despite this support, UK output has continued to fall. Production in 2005 was 20 million tonnes&mdash;down some 18 per cent. on 2004. That was made up of deep mine production of 9.5 million tonnes, including9 million tonnes from English mines, and surface mine production of 10.4 million tonnes, of which just1.5 million tonnes was produced in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.0/6">Nottinghamshire's contribution to those totals was almost 3.2 million tonnes of deep-mined coal&mdash;up from 2 million in 2004&mdash;from three mines: Harworth, which stopped production owing to geological problems in August 2006, and Thoresby and Welbeck, which between them employed almost 1,500 people at the end of 2005. The long-term pattern for coal production, as has been acknowledged in Nottinghamshire, is one of decline. Although since 1996 the county has produced a total of 51.6 million tonnes of deep mined coal, three mines have closed due to stock exhaustion.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.0/7">The situation is different at Harworth, in that it might have further reserves in an unworked area of the top hard seam. However, UK Coal judged that it would cost more to access those reserves than the coal would earn, which means that it is not economically recoverable at the moment. Nevertheless, UK Coal is taking steps to maintain the possibility of re-entering the mine if circumstances change, rather than closing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.0/8">So what could change? I think that that is the question posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood. Harworth's main customer, as for most UK coal producers, has been the electricity-generating industry. Coal-fired generation supplies about one third of UK electricity needs across the average year, which can rise to more than 50 per cent., often at very short notice, to meet winter peaks in demand, as it did last winter. Coal is therefore a flexible fuel. The generators know how important their coal-fired plants are in meeting UK electricity needs. Many have already invested to keep their existing plants in operation to at least 2015, and some are planning the next generation of cleaner coal-fired stations.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.0/9">Generators have shown their commitment to coal in the generating mix, but what about their commitment to UK-produced coal as part of their feedstock? I understand that in contract negotiations the generators attach considerable importance to reliability of supplies, but deep mining is inherently high-risk. Geological problems, or a longer-than-forecast or unplanned break in production can easily put a producer in breach of a contract to supply.</p>
