<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-09.443.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1129" speakername="Denis Murphy" colnum="443"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050309/halltext/50309h01.htm#50309h01_spnew0">
	<p pid=".443.3/1">I should like to thank the House for allowing me this debate.</p>
	<p pid=".443.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-26">26 January</phrase> this year, UK Coal stunned everyone in the north-east by announcing the premature closure of Ellington colliery, with the loss of 370 jobs. The behaviour of the company in the run-up to that announcement and subsequently has been scandalous&mdash;I shall return to that later.</p>
	<p pid=".443.3/3">Electricity generation in Britain is currently fuelled by coal at 34 per cent., gas at 36 per cent. and nuclear at 22 per cent., with oil, hydro and renewables contributing the remaining 8 per cent. Those figures vary slightly depending on price and availability, but that is the general market share.</p>
	<p pid=".443.3/4">We are moving away from the dash for gas, but are in the midst of a dash for renewables. Although there is no doubt that renewables will make a contribution and now command all the political and public attention, there are genuine question marks against their efficiency. Unit costs for renewables are high per kilowatt installed, production is variable, they are unreliable for base load production and it is doubtful whether they will ever deliver value for money. Nevertheless, they are required in order to broaden our energy base. However, I doubt whether we will meet our ambitious targets in the proposed time scale.</p>
	<p pid=".443.3/5">The nuclear industry is regarded by many as holding the key to Britain's long-term electricity requirements. However, it does not offer a quick fix. There is a long lead-in time for project implementation and the lack of smaller and more flexible units makes the nuclear option expensive. The nuclear industry can and should continue to play an important role in the medium term. As a nation, we need to debate whether we want a new generation of nuclear power stations to provide a longer-term solution. Everyone recognises the need for secure electricity supplies, yet no one wants to live near a nuclear power station. The debate promises to be interesting.</p>
	<p pid=".443.3/6">Over the past 15 years, the dash for gas&mdash;the fuel seen then as a more efficient and cleaner energy source than the alternatives&mdash;has resulted in a significant decrease in the nation's gas reserves. It is well known that domestic UK gas supplies are diminishing, and that we will need to import large amounts of gas to feed the new generating capacity. There will be huge capital costs, as well as high gas prices to be paid. Liquid natural gas requires capital-intensive transport infrastructure, which requires liquefying plants, refrigeration and pressurisation ships, and gasification stations at UK ports.</p>

	<p pid=".444.0/1">I am listening carefully to the powerful case that my hon. Friend is making, but has he noticed where the imported gas is likely to come from? It will come from thousands of kilometres away, through areas that are subject to civil disorder, earthquake zones and so on. The pipelines will be vulnerable to attack, will they not? Is that not a further factor in considering an energy policy that relies largely on gas?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-09.444.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1129" speakername="Denis Murphy" colnum="444"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050309/halltext/50309h01.htm#50309h01_spnew2">
	<p pid=".444.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a fair point.</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/2">Coal-fired power generation constitutes some 34 per cent. of the total in this country&mdash;surprisingly, 2 points up from the use figure in 2002&mdash;and requires some 53 million tonnes of coal a year. Of that, approximately 20 million tonnes is produced in the United Kingdom. In my view, we will continue to need upwards of 50 million tonnes of coal each year for the next 20 years. The argument, therefore, is not whether we use coal or another fuel; rather, it is whether we use British coal or source coal from surplus world supplies.</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/3">The greatest number of job offers that the unemployed miners at Ellington have received have not come from the new business parks on Tyneside 12 miles away, as one would have expected. Rather, they have come from 12,000 miles away, from New Zealand, a nation desperately short of skilled miners as it seeks to expand its mining industry. An article in <i>The New Zealand Herald</i> stated:</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/4" class="indent">&quot;State-owned miner Solid Energy is offering unemployed British miners jobs&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/5">because of the company's rapid expansion and because</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/6" class="indent">&quot;it doesn't have time to train New Zealanders . . . Solid Energy is due to visit Northumberland in the next few weeks&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/7">to interview miners from the 150 responses that it has received. Chief operating officer Barry Bragg said:</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/8" class="indent">&quot;A lot of projects are under way and we need to get them running,&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/9">and that the company intended to offer a fresh start down under to those miners</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/10" class="indent">&quot;who have been cast aside by the British mining industry.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/11">Solid Energy's chief executive Don Elder said</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/12" class="indent">&quot;known global oil and gas reserves would be largely exhausted within 20 to 50 years, but abundant and accessible coal reserves would last more than 200 years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/13">That should surely send a warning to us all.</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/14">Every country with a coal-mining industry is expanding coal production and, in some cases, coal burn. In the United States, both main candidates in the 2004 presidential election proposed major investment in the US coal sector, especially for clean coal technology, in order to protect energy security and upgrade the environment. Similar proposals for expanding coal production are being made in Germany, where the cost of production is far higher than in the UK. However, such decisions are not being left to market forces. Energy security lies at the heart of the German Government's energy policy.</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/15">China and India require vast amounts of power to fuel their predicted growth. Most of that energy will come from coal. China alone wishes to build another 20 large coal-fired power stations. Had we as a nation invested in the development of clean coal technology, we could have sold those countries that technology. Instead, we have watched our research and development wither on the vine, where once we led the world.</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/16">What then of Britain's largest and most reliable source of fuel, coal? The first question must be: what on earth happened to an industry that 20 years ago employed 180,000 people at 200 sites? Have we learned anything from the mistakes of the Thatcher and Major Governments? They virtually threw away the bulk of the UK deep-mined industry, at enormous cost and in the face of the definitive run-down of UK oil and gas reserves. The cost amounted to &pound;30 billion in today's money, in redundancy and pit closure costs, written-off investment for closed mines, and wider economic and social costs.</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/17">Some major costs persist even to this day, including long-term unemployment and ill health. A report recently published by Sheffield Hallam university highlighted the problem, particularity in south Wales and my own area, Northumberland, where it has not been possible to replace the massive number of jobs lost from mining.</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/18">I would, however, congratulate the Government on the many initiatives that they have put in place to address those problems. Such initiatives are genuinely making a difference in former mining areas. Without the operating aid and the investment aid, I doubt whether we would have an industry left to debate. However, has that aid been too little and, as far as the industry's owners are concerned, too late?</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/19">That brings me to the company that owns the bulk of the remaining surface and deep mined sector, UK Coal. In my view, and, more surprisingly, in that of many in the City, UK Coal is not able to carry out its mining functions. It is a company rapidly turning into a land and property developer, and it will use any excuse to rid itself of its responsibilities and, if necessary, its contracts.</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/20">The work force at Ellington experienced at first hand what was, at best, the incompetence of the directors, or&mdash;what is more likely&mdash;a deliberate act of industrial vandalism not seen for decades. There is no doubt that the coal face was flooded. There was never any doubt that the face could have been pumped dry and production commenced quickly and safely. Every person at the pit, many of whom had more than 30 years' experience, knew that to be the case. They were horrified when Mr. Spindler, the chief executive, visited the mine and, within three seconds of speaking to the trade union announced, its closure.</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/21">I am indebted to my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and E-Commerce and to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister for their personal intervention in trying to persuade UK Coal to allow the work force a few more days to prove that they could recover the coal face. I am afraid that those requests, along with many more, were rejected. UK Coal refused point blank, saying that if the pit was not unsafe, it was uneconomic.</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/22">UK Coal cannot be allowed to sterilise any more of the nation's reserves. It currently mines coal that provides 20 per cent. of Britain's electricity. It has invoked force majeure at Drax power station, and there are serious doubts as to whether it can fulfil its contract at Alcan's power station in my constituency, at which 1 million tonnes of coal a year are burned, and which was previously supplied from Ellington colliery.</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/23">I do not trust UK Coal to be the guardian of the nation's coal reserves. It does not value its employees; it must be the only company in Britain that produces a comprehensive annual report in which it does not even mention the contribution of the people who work for it. It is time that someone investigated UK Coal's real agenda, to enable us better to determine a future for this industry. I am pleased that the National Union of Mineworkers has started to do just that. It commissioned a report by a team of City energy and finance experts to provide an overview and assessment of UK Coal plc.</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/24">The report makes interesting reading. It looks in some detail at the UK power generation and distribution sector and explains the changes that have taken place since the privatisation of the industry in 1990: the buy-outs, the distress sales and the spectacular collapse of British Energy in 2003. It also explains the huge losses made by high street banks and financial institutions through underperforming loans. Although accurate figures are, understandably, hard to come by, the City informally estimates the losses to be in the order of &pound;4 billion to &pound;6 billion through bad debt. I am sure that more noises would have been made were it not for the huge profits that the banks were making in other operations.</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/25">The losses have left their scars on investors, who now take a much shorter-term view of opportunities in the sector. Earnings per share and positive short-term cash flows are a much higher priority than long-term prospects or social issues, and quick-exit strategies are usually part of the investment plan, which tends to favour smaller, more flexible power plants and gas instead of coal or nuclear power.</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/26">Structural changes to the market have allowed 50 per cent. of it to be bought by non-UK state-owned enterprises from Germany and France, which operate in a protected market at home. Another consequence of the short-termism of financiers has been the reduction of reserve capacity in the system. Many observers say that it has dropped below prudent levels. Electricity cuts could well occur in the United Kingdom before any new major generating capacity can be installed. The report states:</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/27" class="indent">&quot;The scenario as described portrays an inherently unstable resource system. The general public remains blissfully unaware of the risks being run, and are themselves happy as the price of electricity has been reduced by 30 per cent. in real terms since privatisation. But today much of the UK's power system, comprising essentially of long term assets is being funded by relatively short term money. Not a good recipe for long term stability.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/28">On the mining industry, the report comments on both open-cast and deep-mining. On open-cast, it draws the logical conclusion that planning constraints are a problem in expanding the sector. On deep-mining it says:</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/29" class="indent">&quot;The question now is not just can coal production recover, but given its present outlook is it sustainable at all&quot;?</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/30">It is useful to reflect on the sector's financial characteristics, and the Selby closure is a classic example. Riccall colliery, the last mine at UK Coal's Selby complex mined its last coal in October 2004. When the closure plans were first put forward, the Aire valley marker was 95p a gigajoule&mdash;a long way below the levels of 1994. Since then, spot prices have climbed even higher to 170p a gigajoule. Although I am sure that the Selby complex would have had to close at some stage, its closure in 1994 was in many ways premature. The low spot price coupled with the big mine infrastructure hastened its demise. It is hard to believe, however, that there are not recoverable coal reserves at 170p a gigajoule.</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/31">In preparing the report, the authors interviewed an engineer who had spent a decade in the design and management of mines in the Selby complex. He no longer works in the industry, but he believes that considerable value could be unlocked from some of the coal deposits in the Selby area with relatively small new investment.</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/32">Of course, another factor in the closure of the Selby complex was the anticipated redevelopment value of the land on the surface. Finance brokers' notes in August 2004 talked of Gascoigne Wood having 270,000 sq ft of undeveloped land, which could be of use to a company wishing to set up a distribution operation, especially as it has 8 miles of sidings. That was only a small part of the land bank.</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/33">The report concludes by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the three chief executives that the company has had since privatisation. It concludes that it is too early to judge Mr. Spindler's reign, and says that he appears to be taking a hard-headed and unsentimental approach to UK Coal's mining operations. It continues:</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/34" class="indent">&quot;UK Coal is now seen in the City as a company whose principle assets are land holdings and were it not for the coal operations&mdash;the financing of which are rather opaque and bring with them some scary potential liabilities&mdash;the Companies shares would probably trade much higher. The property holdings were very conservatively valued in 2002 at &pound;174 million, virtually the same as the entire market value of UK Coal in February 2005 of &pound;190 million. The property assets should in time be worth a great deal more than this, so where does this leave coal mining?&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/35">It goes on:</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/36" class="indent">&quot;It is clear that UK Coal has suffered from some adverse geological conditions in some mines, but that is all part of the deep mining business. What really seems to have hit recent performances are somewhat curious management decisions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/37">For example, it asks:</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/38" class="indent">&quot;Why did UK Coal sell so much output to Drax their most important customer which in turn is owned by a consortium of banks and then declare Force Majeure on the sales contract?&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/39">It asks:</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/40" class="indent">&quot;Why does UK Coal work only one face at a time in each mine, resulting in big production and financial losses during face gaps?&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/41">It goes on to ask:</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/42" class="indent">&quot;Why does UK Coal seemingly not engage with and value the inputs from its workforce?&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/43">I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to intervene at Ellington once more. The NUM has secured the services of a mining engineer, Mr. Kenneth Johnson from Ashington, who is an expert on the coal seams and geology of the Northumberland coalfield. He is preparing a business plan to mine a section of coal at the Bewick Drift area of Ellington. We need time to develop that plan fully, and I ask the Minister to prevent those reserves from being sterilised by UK Coal's rush to close the pit in record time. We have a ready market on the doorstep, and that coal could be mined safely and profitably.</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/44">I conclude with a final quotation from the financial report. It says:</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/45" class="indent">&quot;From a national security perspective, the deep mining industry in Britain is too important to be allowed to wither under UK Coal's dubious stewardship. A credible alternative needs to be created. This should be possible using the considerable expertise available in Britain to operate these pits which can produce coal at or below the current market price.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/46">UK Coal has demonstrated that it is first and foremost a property and land development company. When it comes to a decision on mining coal or closing and developing the valuable land resource, it will always choose the latter. The City puts no cash value on its mining operations, and it is well known that the value of its shares will rise dramatically if it is rid of mining. That is not a company in which the nation's coal reserve should be vested.</p>
	<p pid=".444.1/47">I urge the Minister to examine the setting up of a new company for which the only priority is the mining of coal and which will pay huge dividends to the British people through a long-term supply of coal to the power stations. Network Rail is an excellent example of the type of company that could deliver the nation's coal supplies for many years to come.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-09.448.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1328" speakername="Brian Wilson" colnum="448"  time="09:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050309/halltext/50309h01.htm#50309h01_spnew3">
	<p pid=".448.0/1">I am very pleased to take part in this debate and support what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1129" name="Denis Murphy">my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck (Mr. Murphy)</phrase> has said. I assure hon. Members that anything I say about Government policy or the Government's attitude towards coal is based on experience and is in no way critical of colleagues, because I have been there, got the t-shirt and know the difficulties for people such as my hon. Friend who try to argue the case for coal in an environment that is essentially not well-disposed towards it.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/2">I want to see a change of approach to coal. After the next election there has to be another fairly major review of energy policy and the energy mix that this country is moving towards, which will give us the opportunity to cast aside the legacy of attitudes that still exist towards coal. In my experience, coal was always viewed as a problem; it was always looking for subsidy, and giving rise to short-term problems at particular pits. Somehow it was never possible to get out of that morass long enough to look forward to see what coal contributed, could contribute and&mdash;for the reasons outlined by my hon. Friend&mdash;must contribute to the energy needs of this country for a very long time to come.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/3">I agree with what my hon. Friend says about UK Coal. It makes no sense whatever to leave such a massive national asset as our coal reserves in the hands of a single private company, no matter how diligent, let alone a company that has the somewhat mixed record of UK Coal. A major asset that may or, arguably, may not be needed at present cannot be sterilised in the short term on the basis of random commercial decisions when it is absolutely certain that it will be needed in future. That issue does not relate simply to the current behaviour of UK Coal; it must surely be a philosophical principle that no commercial interest can sterilise a national asset.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/4">If we accept that as a starting point, other things flow. We need not only an audit of the nation's coal assets, but a clear assessment of the measures necessary to safeguard future access to them. That can be done only as one comprehensive project; it cannot be done in an isolated way from case to case as crisis after crisis arises. After the election, if there is to be a new look at where our future electricity supplies will come from, I hope that the question of preventing the sterilisation of the nation's coal reserves will have a high priority.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/5">I shall explain quickly why coal should matter and should be viewed in a much more positive light than has been the case in the past. My hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck touched on the fact that whatever happens in the United Kingdom, coal will continue to be burned on a gargantuan scale in the world as a whole. As he knows, in my role as a trade representative, I was in China recently and the Chinese were talking merrily about increasing production from 1.6 billion tonnes to 2.2 billion tonnes in order to fuel economic expansion. Incidentally, they are also going to build 20 nuclear power stations&mdash;sound people, the Chinese.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/6">The question is not whether the Chinese are going to burn coal, but whether they burn it in the old way, which would be an environmental disaster, or whether they burn it using clean coal technology, much of which, as my hon. Friend said, could be supplied&mdash;in fairness, some already is&mdash;from the UK. The other question is whether they are going to burn it in a way that continues to kill 10,000 miners a year, or whether they will benefit&mdash;I am pleased to say&mdash;from the contacts that they now have with our Health and Safety Executive.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/7">Whatever happens in this country, coal will be the major source of fuel globally. China, India, the Philippines and most of south-east Asia will burn coal, and America will continue to view coal as its major fuel source. That creates the opportunity for our manufacturing and technological industries to develop clean coal technology, which we are very good at. The UK's strength could be in carbon capture and allying the needs of the coal industry with the resources and accommodation available in the North sea.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/8">The Government have to play a part in that. I am not criticising them, because I faced exactly the same problems that they do, but there has to be some Government money to kick start the process. It is unrealistic to think that there can be a global, clean coal technology industry in the UK without also having a domestic market, including demonstration plants and so on. We need just enough to get things going to serve the needs of our coal industry, and we need to create the base for manufacturing industry and our very important exporting industry. If we consider the statistics for coal use and the demand there will be for clean coal technology if coal-burning countries are meet their Kyoto obligations, we can see that there is a corresponding massive opportunity for manufacturing and exporting in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/9">The other reason why coal is important and why we should be positive about it as we look to the future is that, as my hon. Friend said, a third of our electricity still comes from coal. Most people would find that a surprising statistic because all publicity about coal is unremittingly negative and suggests that coal is somehow a thing of the past. Even more crucially, at periods of peak demand that figure rises to around 45 per cent. In other words, if we do not have coal for the foreseeable future, the lights will go out; coal is as important as that.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/10">The two questions are where coal comes from and how it is burnt. The question of how it is burnt has to be rhetorical because we simply cannot go on burning coal in an environmentally unhelpful manner, as is still the case in many power stations at present. We cannot switch on dirty old coal-powered stations when we need extra supply without taking account of the environmental consequences. The reason why our carbon emissions have risen in recent years rather than fallen, as one would like to see them doing, is probably the reliance not only on coal but on dirty coal stations. Coal will have to burnt cleanly, and there is no point talking about a future for coal without linking it to clean coal technology.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/11">We cannot and should not go much below that 33 per cent. figure of energy from coal if we are going to maintain a balanced energy policy. The message I preach is that it is a false argument to pit renewables against coal, coal against nuclear or nuclear against renewables; those are all subsidiary arguments. The only argument that matters is how dependent we are prepared to become on gas, and when we talk about gas, we now mean imported gas.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/12">Based on the Government's projections, 70 per cent. of our electricity will come from gas by 2020, and 90 per cent. of that will be imported. I do not think that the great British public have latched on to that; it is something that will not happen by accident, but through a strategy that is being pursued as desirable. I know the arguments&mdash;they may be true&mdash;for saying that everything will be all right on the night: the gas will be there, the liquefied natural gas terminals are being built already, pipelines are being planned, and there is also the Orman Lange treaty, which I was delighted to see my hon. Friend the Minister conclude.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/13">All those are reasons why the gas might be there, but there are two questions. First, there is question of overdependence on strategic policy decisions taken in one country&mdash;Russia. Secondly, the gas will be there but at what price? Twice during my time as the Minister there were massive spikes in the price of gas, with very serious consequences for industries in this country that are heavily gas dependent. I tried hard, as I am sure my hon. Friend the Minister has done since, to get to the bottom of those spikes, but was told, &quot;We don't really know. It happened in the interconnector&quot;. That is interesting but not very impressive as a basis for a future energy policy based on much of our gas coming into the market through interconnectors.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/14">Do we want 70 per cent. of our electricity to come from gas? Do we want 90 per cent. of that gas to be imported? If we do not, we must maintain a more balanced energy supply. That supply must fit with our environmental obligations. Therefore, we come back to using renewables&mdash;yes, I am in favour of renewables&mdash;but we also come back to nuclear power and to clean coal, which is, in the context of the debate, the most relevant point. In other words, we must try to maintain an indigenous energy policy.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/15">I do not think that it has been noticed to the extent that it should be that since the start of the industrial revolution, Britain's prosperity has been based on the fact that we are not only a massive energy producer but a massive exporter to the world. If we head the way that we are going, we are contemplating becoming a massive energy importer in a short time. Circumstances change, and people will say that there is no problem being an energy importer. Like many G8 countries, for example, Germany is an energy importer. However, do we want to go that way on such a scale, in such a short time? If not, we need coal and nuclear industries and we need to do our bit on renewables. Of course we depend on some imported gas, but let us not put all our eggs in one basket.</p>
	<p pid=".448.0/16">I hope that after the election, when things can be considered in a more rational and long-term manner, the strands will be brought together and we will return to the concept of a balanced energy policy in which deep-mined British coal will continue to play a significant part.</p>

	<p pid=".451.0/1">Life is full of changes. I am 54 years of age and have changed my position a number of times based on the circumstances in which I find myself. When I started in the pits in 1965, there were 450,000 miners in Britain. When I left the pits in 1984, there were about 130,000 miners. We are talking about the demise of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1328" name="Brian Wilson">the coal industry. My right hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson)</phrase> said clearly that the big issues that we face are about security of supply and what we want to do with all other energies.</p>
	<p pid=".451.0/2">I am pleased that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1129" name="Denis Murphy">my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck (Mr. Murphy)</phrase> was able to introduce this debate, which is overdue. I well understand why he raised it&mdash;it is specific to his area. However, many of us have, for a long time, thought that a major problem will face us in the not too distant future. A few years ago, it looked as though that problem was a long way away. I think that the day of reckoning is coming. I remember that an oil price hike in 1974 created major problems throughout the world, but have we forgotten about that? If we put all our eggs in one basket, in terms of how we receive our energy, we are creating a major problem for ourselves.</p>
	<p pid=".451.0/3">I am talking from a Scottish perspective, which is sometimes different from the UK position of the National Union of Mineworkers. There is an old saying in my neck of the worlds: we are an island of coal, surrounded by fish. We have all those benefits. People are right when they say that other G8 countries, and other economically viable countries, can import energies, but those countries wish that they were in our position. I cannot think of many countries that are giving away what they have so that their fuel prices are determined by what comes to them.</p>
	<p pid=".451.0/4">The EU directive on emissions comes up on a regular basis. It is interesting, because Europe has a habit of making decisions and applying them differently to each country. I will watch with interest when that EU directive is applied to Poland, because I reckon that the EU will turn a blind eye to how best the issue can be dealt with there.</p>
	<p pid=".451.0/5">I said that I would talk about Scotland, which has always had the view that we must have a balanced energy supply. One of my predecessors, Alex Eadie, signed&mdash;as Energy Minister&mdash;a paper to open Torness nuclear power station under a Labour Government. A person called Tony Benn opened one of the power stations.</p>

	<p pid=".452.1/1">Indeed, but I do not think that that is in his diaries.</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/2">I have moved from a position in which I always opposed nuclear energy. I did not oppose it because I was a miner, but because of nuclear weapons. That has always been my view. However, many of the power stations that we are talking about building do not have that ingredient. Along with many of my colleagues and comrades, I take the view that there is not a competition between coal, nuclear power, gas, oil and renewables. Only two weeks ago, the energy unions all met in London. My hon. Friend the Minister spoke about what is required at that meeting. There is no competition like there was some years ago. There is enough for everyone. I strongly believe that we must address the issue on that basis.</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/3">The point has been made that we can make any decision that we want. That will not stop the United States of America, India, Africa or Australia expanding their coal industries. During the presidential election, both the Republican party and the Democrat party talked about investing &pound;10 billion in the coal industry and in clean coal technology. The USA is driving forward because it does not have the alternatives that we do. It has got to use the coal industry to develop its proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/4">China gets 8 per cent. of its energy requirements from coal. It has one colliery that produces 10 million tonnes of coal and has 3,000 people involved in it. The expansion programme that it is talking about is not for 20 coal-fired power stations. It is talking about establishing 20 nuclear power stations and 500 coal-fired power stations. It will make clean coal technology a major ingredient of that expansion, because it recognises that it has major problems of deserts and so on. Climate change is a big issue for the Chinese&mdash;it is happening in their country. That does not stop them driving their energy requirements and their economy forward. They see coal as an integral part of that.</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/5">I believe that we, as a Government, are making a major mistake. All Governments, previously and now, have taken the view that coal can be dispensed with and that we can get it from elsewhere. I do not believe that our future lies in the middle east or in Russia. Security of energy supply is something that the people of the United Kingdom will want, and the price is worth paying. It is something that our people will work flexibly to achieve. Indeed, the miners have been working flexibly in a host of areas. A week does not go by in which the NUM does not sit down with UK Coal and others to talk about changing the flexibility of work.</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/6">It surprises me somewhat, however, that, at a meeting with the Union of Democratic Mineworkers on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-24">Thursday 24 February</phrase>, my hon. Friend the Minister said that, under current working practices, he would find it difficult to go to the Treasury to ask for more money to be put into Thorsby colliery. He can clarify that point, but that is the information that we have. That suggests to me that negotiations can take place between employer and employee, but, when a Government get involved, it becomes difficult.</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/7">I suggested that we in Scotland have taken a different view. We have always taken an optional view across the board. We have always balanced open-cast mining with deep mining. One was developed to protect the other. We have always worked on that basis. Even now, 8 million tonnes of coal is produced in Scotland in open-cast mines. I do not oppose open-cast mining, but I reject the changes in planning applications that are being considered by politicians in the Scottish Parliament. They are trying to make open-cast mining more difficult. We must consider the bigger picture. The people who oppose windmills being established in Scotland will also oppose open-cast mining. We must take a bigger view. We must consider renewables, which I encourage and support. However, we must also consider open-cast and deep mining as part of the process that we are developing.</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/8">Longannett power station will come to an end in 2015, unless it can make adaptations. The Scottish Affairs Committee is taking evidence on that. The industry will make long-term investments if it can get long-term proposals from Government that will afford it the stability to invest, but it will not invest in an industry that the Government are saying has no future. That point is extremely important.</p>
	<p pid=".452.1/9">I realise that a number of my hon. colleagues wish to speak. I believe that it is imperative that this country develops a balanced policy for energy security. The people of the United Kingdom will not thank any of us in this Chamber when the power goes off and the lights go out. We must develop a strategy that ensures that the lights will not go out in the UK, and we shall continue to support our coal industry and the people working in it.</p>

	<p pid=".453.0/1">I am delighted to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/934" name="David Hamilton">my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (David Hamilton)</phrase>, not least because I can put the record right. I was at <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1093" name="John Mann">the meeting with my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-24">24 February</phrase>, and there was no question of Government aid being contingent on flexible working practices; I know that my hon. Friend the Minister will respond to that when he gets the opportunity. We were there to argue for Welbeck colliery: we followed <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1129" name="Denis Murphy">the path trodden by my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck (Mr. Murphy)</phrase>, who argued very strongly for Ellington colliery. I want to reinforce some of the remarks that he made about the way that UK Coal treats its work force.</p>
	<p pid=".453.0/2">UK Coal wanted new flexible working practices at Welbeck colliery, and forced them through by saying, bluntly and simply, to the men, &quot;Unless you change the way you work, we will close the colliery at the end of this year.&quot; At Welbeck and across the United Kingdom, we have the most efficient miners in Europe, and we should be backing them, as they are prepared to take the challenge and make the change. The Government are prepared to help them make that change by ensuring that Government money is available for long-term investment in, and the sustainability of, the British deep-coal industry. The Government have made available &pound;57 million now, of which &pound;7.1 million is available at Welbeck&mdash;so the curious situation is that the men are prepared to back the company and work more flexibly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian said.</p>
	<p pid=".453.0/3">The Government are prepared to back the industry with real money. The real problem&mdash;the third side of the triangle&mdash;seems to be the company, UK Coal, the biggest coal owner in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1328" name="Brian Wilson">the country. My right hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson)</phrase> made a very strong point about whether market forces and the needs of the private sector should sterilise an energy reserve. We are right to question the commitment of UK Coal, not just in its relationship with the work force but in its commitment to the industry. There are Ellington and Welbeck, but the prevailing view is that the British coalfield will soon consist of a rump of four or five pits. We must do better than that.</p>
	<p pid=".453.0/4">I say quite simply to UK Coal that it must change its attitude and the way that it works, because the issue is not just about the company but the future energy policy of this country. The company faces real difficulties: its own accounts showed a loss of &pound;38 million in the deep-coal sector last year. Output slumped to &pound;12 million. Production costs rose and there was a loss of &pound;3.15 for every tonne of coal produced.</p>
	<p pid=".453.0/5">In that context, I am very pleased that the company has cut its dividends: it must be right that shareholders take some of the pain. I am pleased that, at last, it has a chief executive who comes from a mining background, and that it is going to renegotiate coal contracts. The price of coal is going up, but UK Coal is still dependent on contracts that were negotiated at a lower price two years ago. It needs to demonstrate that it will invest in the industry. The company tells me that it will invest &pound;150 million between 2004 and 2006. There is a commitment across the company, particularly from the work force, to get those costs down. So, we have a committed work force and a committed Government, so we must now see real, substantial commitment from UK Coal.</p>
	<p pid=".453.0/6">Looking at the company's accounts, its cash flow&mdash;&pound;400 million of it&mdash;comes from the deep-coal industry. In reality, only &pound;4 million currently comes from property transactions. However, there is a view that it is a property company so it must change its image and show commitment.</p>
	<p pid=".453.0/7">The company must change its image because as other hon. Members, particularly my right hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North, have said, we face an energy crisis: perhaps not this year or next year, but there are real problems on the horizon. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister will remind us when we shall see the third annual review of the energy White Paper: it is due now. Perhaps he will give us a commitment, as was angled for earlier in the debate, that after the election&mdash;whenever it comes&mdash;we shall reconsider energy policy and put coal as one of its centrepieces.</p>
	<p pid=".453.0/8">I am concerned that our renewables targets are, quite frankly, ambitious. I think that we shall achieve 10 per cent.&mdash;not by 2010, but we shall get there. However, 20 per cent. by 2020 is really challenging. I note that the nuclear energy industry is going to run down. Whatever we say, there is currently no sign of any private sector investment coming in. We shall need that in the future. However, the most significant point has already been raised. Do we really want, by 2020, 70 per cent. of our electricity to be generated from gas, 90 per cent. of which will be imported? That would be a crazy situation to work ourselves into.</p>
	<p pid=".453.0/9">There will be a place for coal, and I hope that it will be British coal, produced by the most efficient miners in Europe. We must burn that coal cleanly, and invest in new clean coal technology. It hurts me enormously that Japan, which has no indigenous coal industry, spends more on clean coal research than we do in the UK. We can get the economics right and have an energy policy, but we must also protect the environment. That means that the way forward is Government stakeholding in investment in clean coal technology.</p>
	<p pid=".453.0/10">It has been a good, powerful debate, and I hope that we shall return to the subject as a Labour Government later this year, and come forward with new, better, and more thoughtful plans for a policy for the 21st century that has coal as its centrepiece.</p>

	<p pid=".455.2/1">I should like to thank my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and E-Commerce and the previous Minister for their help in keeping Welbeck and Harworth collieries working in my constituency, although at Welbeck, it is at a price. It might be all right for those on the surface to favour 12-hour days underground, but those who work underground are not too keen on it, so my constituents and others are paying a large price to keep coal at Welbeck.</p>
	<p pid=".455.2/2">I met a gentleman not that long ago who sat down with me here and told me that he saw the future of his country based in particular on its coal reserves. I have heard the case for coal put before, from politicians and union leaders in the industry, in my area and across the country over the years. That gentleman was rather different: he is the chief executive of Bechtel, the largest contractor working in Iraq, securing oilfields, and one of the largest nuclear companies in the world. It came as a bit of a surprise to hear him so enthusiastic about coal, so I asked him why he was. He gave two reasons: first, as has already been outlined&mdash;so I will not repeat it&mdash;he mentioned the security of supply in the long term, which is as obvious in this country as it is in the US.</p>
	<p pid=".455.2/3">It is the second reason, however, that I want to put on the agenda today, because it has not been raised. It relates not to the future of electricity supply, but to the future of the car. Hidden in Kerry's manifesto, and other manifestos in the US&mdash;and now adopted in the gas-guzzling car state of California by Schwarzenegger&mdash;is an attempt to become non-reliant on oil for the future of the car. In that context, Bechtel sees coal gasification as a fundamental part of future car energy consumption and energy requirements. That is in addition to electricity supply. We should not miss out on that. The other country that is considering it is China, which is probably already the largest producer of cars in the world&mdash;or it will be, if not next week, then next month. To be reliant on oil for the future of the car does not give it a very long future according to anyone's horizons.</p>
	<p pid=".455.2/4">I hope that we will see a delegation in the near future, before decisions are made on the future of nuclear. It should consist of MPs and unions going to see what is being done in the US in relation to coal gasification, how it is being done, the consequences and the economics of it and the investment and Government decisions required. I can suggest a potential sponsor of such a delegation: one of the solicitors&mdash;perhaps Thompsons&mdash;that have had a good deal out of the Government in terms of the coal health claims. They would probably feel it appropriate to contribute to the debate on the future of the coal industry. The timing will be everything because of the imminence of decisions on nuclear.</p>
	<p pid=".455.2/5">I want to make an important side point. The chairman of the finance and economic committee in China stated last week that China is now a net importer of coal and is desperate to import clean coal technology. Why are we not continuing to develop that clean coal technology here in a practical, everyday way and then export it to the Chinese? Shanghai is holding the Expo 2010, which is one of the biggest world trade fairs that there will ever be. That could be a centrepiece of what we are saying to the Chinese: we will help them by selling them our technology to help their environment at the same time as development takes place.</p>
	<p pid=".455.2/6">I have two final points. First, we know what the problem is. If someone nobbles people at EDF Energy in my constituency, they are pleased to explain, in reality, in a roundabout way, what the problem is: people in UK Coal have been selling coal too cheaply for too long. The electricity suppliers are laughing all the way to the bank with the contracts that they have got. That started with Budge's mentality and how he saw the pricing of the commodity, but UK Coal has continued that. If it was selling the commodity at the right price, in terms of the current contract, it would have plenty of profits pouring in. But that one mistake is threatening the future of the industry.</p>
	<p pid=".455.2/7">Secondly, if we are returned as hon. Members in a few months' time, we will be expected to vote through an expansion and renewal of nuclear policy. There are a lot of people on the Labour Benches who will see the price of supporting nuclear as a clear guarantee from the Government that there is a future for the coal industry.</p>

	<p pid=".456.0/1">It is a privilege to make a brief contribution to this debate, which was introduced with such passion by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1129" name="Denis Murphy">my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck (Mr. Murphy)</phrase>. That passion has been reflected throughout the debate, but we have also had a lot of thoughtful analysis.</p>
	<p pid=".456.0/2">I want to make three brief points. First, I want to make a suggestion to the Minister about the role of the Coal Authority. There is widespread fear across coalfields that we must get value for money from the investment aid, which is a large amount of money&mdash;nearly &pound;60 million. It would be good to have an enhanced role for the Coal Authority&mdash;first, in managing that investment aid and approving any further tranches&mdash;rather than leaving things to one or two officials in the Department of Trade and Industry who might not have the same expertise or the same day-to-day contact as the Coal Authority. After all, the Coal Authority is basically the regulator that licenses the mines. In terms of ensuring that UK Coal fulfils its promises on investment, an enhanced role for the Coal Authority would be good. That role would be better sitting with the Coal Authority than as an adjunct to the Department of Trade and Industry's work.</p>
	<p pid=".456.0/3">Many hon. Members have mentioned the post-electoral situation, and I hope that I will still be in a position to discuss that after the election. The Government have never been short of five and 10-year plans across a range of policy initiatives. In fact, probably only in the heyday of the Soviet Union were there so many five and 10-year plans. I am not knocking that&mdash;it is a jolly good idea. A five-year plan&mdash;at least&mdash;for coal would give some certainty. As one crisis has followed another over the past seven or eight years, many of my hon. Friends and I have beat our way to ministerial doors, which have always been open to us. Often we have seen the Prime Minister&mdash;on perhaps half a dozen occasions. We have had operating aid and investment aid, but it would be good to give a little more certainty to the industry over a five-year period about what is likely to happen in terms of aid.</p>
	<p pid=".456.0/4">It would be remiss of me not to mention, briefly, the situation at Kellingley and Selby, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck. It is worth putting on the record, in relation to Selby, the tremendous efforts of DTI officials, and, more importantly, of ordinary miners and many representatives of local bodies, who got stuck into the Selby taskforce. As he said, I and many people in the coalfield would have loved Selby to have just a few more years, but, regardless of that, it is worth recording the tremendous efforts that people made. Many members of the National Union of Miners were involved. Only about 50 miners, out of 1,600, are on the dole. That did not happen by accident; it happened because a lot of training took place. Every man was entitled to time off for a day's training each week, on full pay. Over two years, that made a real difference.</p>
	<p pid=".456.0/5">What happens at Kellingley will be a real test, and the situation is under review. Nearly 700 men are employed there. The NUM is negotiating for no compulsory redundancies. Certainly, Kellingley should have a bright future. It has proven reserves of 24 million tonnes, and its output this year is about 1.5 million tonnes, but there are plans to increase that over the coming years. The future of Kellingley is a litmus test for the future of the coal industry. I hope that the negotiations and discussions will be successful and will give the mine a future.</p>
	<p pid=".456.0/6">Finally, I want to reflect on clean coal technology, which has come up time and again in debates over the past seven or eight years. It is useful to look back at the various papers, some of which predate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1328" name="Brian Wilson">the time when my right hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson)</phrase> was Minister. I was reading a summary of energy paper 67, a Government paper from 1999, only last night. It stated that Government support for the demonstration of clean coal technology</p>
	<p pid=".456.0/7" class="indent">&quot;is not perceived to constitute value for money in a country with surplus coal-fired capacity that is moderately efficient. However, the Foresight Task Force has identified a case for demonstration after about 2005, and the Government will re-examine the position in about three years time.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".456.0/8">That re-examination was in 2002. We are now, happily, in 2005. It is make-our-minds-up time. Are we just going to continue with the research? As various hon. Members have pointed out, if that is all we do, we will never be credible in terms of selling technology to other markets, such as China. Kellingley was one possible demonstration plant and Hatfield another. In the third term of a Labour Government, it is surely time to get that demonstration plant up and running, given, for example, the resources that are going into wind energy and other forms of renewable energy.</p>

Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)</phrase> who would dearly have liked to be here. Many of his constituents are workers at the Ellington colliery. Unfortunately, he has other parliamentary business.</p>
	<p pid=".458.0/2">The debate gives us a welcome opportunity to consider a much wider range of issues than simply the closure of Ellington. I hope that the Minister will respond to the specific criticisms raised by the hon. Member for Wansbeck about UK Coal and its approach to the closure of Ellington, the loss of the 370 jobs and the loss of 1 million tonnes a year of coal capacity.</p>
	<p pid=".458.0/3">I would like to discuss some wider issues that have also been raised. When I did my GCEs, which was a number of years ago, I scored full marks for knowing that the UK's coal production capacity was 200 million tonnes; last year, I think that it was down to 28 million tonnes. The change in the coal industry, which has been referred to, has been very dramatic and painful, particularly for the communities directly affected. Almost half the coal produced comes from open-cast production rather than from deep-mine production. That, too, is a tremendous change in the balance of the coal industry. We must remember that consumption now runs at more than twice production. So, instead of being net exporters of coal, we are importers; the figure was about 34 million tonnes last year.</p>
	<p pid=".458.0/4">That is in a context where the price for coal internationally, although it has fluctuated, is now back towards being at an historic high, and consumption is rising at the international level, too. There has been about a 19 or 20 per cent. increase in coal consumption over the last decade worldwide. Some figure show that last year was the first year in which the north American zone became a net importer of coal. It is not just China and the UK that are importing, but north America. There is every sign that there will be continued growth in worldwide consumption in years to come.</p>
	<p pid=".458.0/5">Given that context, the Minister must consider how far he is prepared to allow the UK coal production industry to shrink and whether he is satisfied with both the current situation and the one that appears to be unfolding. He may be able to respond to some questions about what future he foresees for maintaining our deep-pit work force and expertise in the UK and the mining equipment industry. Specifically, what future does he foresee for clean coal technology?</p>
	<p pid=".458.0/6">A number of speakers have pointed out that it has been frustratingly slow work to reach the point of having an effective pilot plant that demonstrates technology that would be exportable. Yet, we have heard, even in this debate, plenty of evidence that across the world, with coal production growing and increasing pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there is an increasing need for clean coal technology to be widely available at an economic price. The opportunities for the UK to provide such technology are growing.</p>
	<p pid=".458.0/7">The hon. Member for Wansbeck made the case, and I would certainly support it, that the idea that coal is dead as an energy source worldwide&mdash;or, indeed, as far as the UK is concerned&mdash;is wrong. We must concentrate on ensuring that coal's use is less damaging to the environment nationally and internationally. The idea that we are simply dealing with a declining, closing industry and that it is a matter of washing it up as neatly and cleanly as we can is mistaken. We must have a long-term perspective on where we are going next.</p>
	<p pid=".458.0/8">I am not sure that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1328" name="Brian Wilson">the hon. Member for Wansbeck and the right hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson)</phrase> did their cases much good by attacking gas. The UK will be quite dependent on gas for a long time into the future. I do not think that anybody would really regard Norway as deeply unstable or, for that matter, subject to earthquakes. We must have some sense of perspective about what the alternatives are. There is no doubt that, for the foreseeable future, coal will form part of both our energy mix and the international one.</p>

	<p pid=".459.0/1">Is Liberal policy committed to an energy policy based on 70 per cent. of Britain's electricity coming from gas and 90 per cent. of that gas being imported? That is clearly the spirit of the hon. Gentleman's comments. He may be right, but it would be interesting to know if that is the policy?</p>

	<p pid=".459.1/1">One does not have a policy. One sets a direction in which policy goes. We have made it clear what we think the balance should be between renewables, gas and other sources of power generation. Indeed, when the right hon. Gentleman was a Minister, he and I debated this matter on a number of occasions and I have previously recommended that he read the book that we have produced on the topic.</p>
	<p pid=".459.1/2">Broadly speaking, I agree with what the right hon. Gentleman said today. I hope that the Minister will take time to respond to the powerful case made by the hon. Member for Wansbeck about the behaviour of UK Coal and the specifics of that situation. I also want to hear the Minister's answers about the Government's response to the balance between UK production and imported coal over the coming years.</p>
	<p pid=".459.1/3">The right hon. Member for Cunninghame, North just challenged me to say what I think about 90 per cent. of gas being imported. Does the Minister believe that it would be acceptable to have 90 per cent. of coal imported? Where does he want that balance to be struck? Where does he see the balance between deep-mine production and open-cast production in the UK in five or 10 years time, bearing in mind representations that I have received from UK Coal about the difficulties of maintaining production of open-cast coal, never mind that of deep-mined coal? He will know that I have asked him some parliamentary questions on that topic in recent months.</p>
	<p pid=".459.1/4">When and how do the Government intend to ensure that clean coal technology forms a significant part of the research and development process in this country, so that we have a product that we can both use and export across the world?</p>
	<p pid=".459.1/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1282" name="Paddy Tipping">The hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase> raised the point about the timing of the third annual review of the White Paper. Perhaps that review could encapsulate some of the answers that Members are seeking today about the coal industry and the future energy mix.</p>
	<p pid=".459.1/6">This has been an extremely interesting debate. It has perhaps been overdue. It has raised a number of big questions that are often kept out of the mainstream debate about energy. I hope very much that the Minister can respond fully and take these matters forward.</p>

	<p pid=".460.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1129" name="Denis Murphy">the hon. Member for Wansbeck (Mr. Murphy)</phrase> on securing t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1262" name="Andrew Stunell">his debate. As the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell)</phrase> said, it is a timely one, because we stand at a crossroads in terms of energy supplies.</p>
	<p pid=".460.0/2">From the research I have had done, the world will according to the International Energy Agency, need almost 60 per cent. more energy in 2030 than it does now. The hon. Member for Wansbeck, and, indeed other hon. and right hon. Members, have explained why that is the case. China and India, which I think contain about a third of the world's population, are expanding at a rapid rate of knots and will create an energy need. Much as I would like to think it were the case, it is rather ambitious to expect that energy saving will counter the growing demand. The world will require far more energy. That is the case at a time when our coal industry is under environmental pressures. They largely result from directives from the European Union, but they also come partly from Kyoto and from the fact that we take a very responsible attitude to climate change.</p>
	<p pid=".460.0/3">The coal industry is under environmental pressure, and our nuclear industry is in question, because although it currently provides about 22 per cent. of our electricity, that will be reduced to 2 per cent. in only 20 years' time. Given the nature of the nuclear industry, if we do not start planning now for life extensions or for new build, it will die. There is no question about that. We are in danger of losing scientists to companies abroad, because a number of new nuclear reactors are being built worldwide&mdash;or there are plans to build them. I think that 23 countries are planning to expand their civil nuclear capabilities. We are in danger of losing scientists to the rest of the world. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-06">6 May</phrase>, the next Government, regardless of which party wins the election, will have to look carefully at the future of the nuclear industry.</p>
	<p pid=".460.0/4">Our country's gas supplies are starting to decline. I do not want to be alarmist, but we will probably become net importers of gas next year, or, maybe, the year after that. We last discussed energy in this Chamber on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-19">19 January</phrase>. That debate focused on the future of gas, and the Minister was extremely candid, for which I pay tribute to him. He said that if there is high demand for gas in the coming winter or the winter after that, our gas supplies could be rather tight. I do not particularly blame the Minister, but that that is the case is a disgrace in a country with an economy as large as ours, because we do not need to be in that situation. We must give a lot of thought to our energy policy.</p>
	<p pid=".460.0/5">I entirely agree with the comments of a number of Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1328" name="Brian Wilson">the right hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson)</phrase>, about the need for a balanced energy supply in future. I say with some trepidation that one reason is that we have in the past been over-reliant on a single primary source of energy; the coal industry had too much control over our energy supplies. I say that as someone whose father was a miner, and I am unreservedly sorry that things have worked out as they have for the coal industry, but it is important that we learn lessons from the past, and I do not want our country to be over-reliant again on any one source of energy. The way things are going, with environmental challenges to our coal industry, our country's dwindling gas supplies and the possible withering of our nuclear industry, we could find ourselves in the situation described by the right hon. Member for Cunninghame, North, with gas supplying 70 per cent. or more of our electricity production and a large proportion of it being imported.</p>
	<p pid=".460.0/6">As the hon. Member for Hazel Grove said, there is nothing wrong with importing gas from Norway, and the negotiations for securing its gas supplies are at an advanced stage, but Norway will supply only a small part of our future gas import needs. Gas will have to come from further afield. It is possible that the gas supply that we get from Russia or Qatar, or one or two other places, such as Algeria, might not be interrupted because of political instability in those countries or terrorist activity, and I sincerely hope that that is the case. However, if I were energy Minister and we were over-dependent on gas supplies from certain areas of the world, I would not be too confident that I could guarantee to the people of this country that the lights would not go out. Such supplies might never be interrupted, but the Government have to be realistic. We must provide greater assurances. We should not depend too much on any single source of energy when it comes from such countries and from far away.</p>
	<p pid=".460.0/7">If our country and the world in general were to become too dependent on gas, there would also be an economic danger. We could well see the development of a gas equivalent of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and I would not want to speculate about what effect that might have on the price of gas. We must bear that in mind.</p>
	<p pid=".460.0/8">That brings us back to the question of what our country's policies should be. There must be a debate on the future of the nuclear industry. I pay tribute to those Labour Members who are being open and honest about their views on that. It was a tragedy in the past that the Conservative party was seen as anti-coal and the Labour party as pro-coal, and that the Labour party was seen as anti-nuclear and the Conservative party as pro-nuclear. I hope that we can consign such divisions to history, as they are not helpful. The provision of energy supplies should not be a party political issue, and I pay tribute to those Members of all parties who say that we need a clear policy on new build and on the life extension of existing nuclear plants.</p>
	<p pid=".460.0/9">What about the rest of our policy? There are opportunities at least to preserve what is left of our coal industry. When we talk about that industry, we should divide it into two sections: the mining industry and the generation of electricity from coal, because they are slightly different things. As the hon. Member for Hazel Grove said, we import more than 50 per cent. of the coal that we burn. There are good reasons for that; it is low in sulphur content, which helps us meet our environmental requirements. However, we must look to the future and explore possibilities for providing clean coal technology. I hope that we can achieve that, although it is not entirely clear how we can do so without writing cheques for massive sums, and I am not going to say that the Government should write cheques for sums that are too large for any section of the industry.</p>
	<p pid=".460.0/10">The creation of a free market in energy has led to a fall in energy prices. Paradoxically, that has created a problem in attracting investment, which we must address. I hope that we can move towards clean coal technology at least as quickly as the Government have tried to move towards wind power. That industry has been given &pound;117 million to develop offshore wind farms, the supply of energy from which will be intermittent and unreliable.</p>
	<p pid=".460.0/11">The great thing about coal is that it has been a very good back-stop&mdash;I do not want that to sound derogatory. The nuclear industry is a base load supplier of electricity, but coal is far more flexible, and it has provided a very cheap source of electricity. If I were to look ahead and see the continuing decline of the coal industry, I would be sad. I accept that we have to address our environmental challenges, but I would be unhappy if the coal industry were to decline in the way that it has done. Members have quoted figures on that, and I will not repeat them, but it was only 1990 when coal provided about 66 per cent. of our electricity generation, and the figure has fallen to below 30 per cent. I think that it has fallen recently for the reasons that we have given, but the Minister will correct my figures if they are wrong. It is obvious that the trend is downward, regardless of whether the correct current figure is 28 per cent. or 32 per cent. We must question whether we want to allow that trend to continue.</p>
	<p pid=".460.0/12">I again congratulate the hon. Member for Wansbeck on securing the debate and on introducing it in such a passionate and caring way, and I pay tribute to all Members who have contributed.</p>

	<p pid=".462.0/1">It is a pleasure to respond to t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1129" name="Denis Murphy">his debate. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck (Mr. Murphy)</phrase> on securing it, and I thank all the Members who have participated. There have been some excellent contributions. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1328" name="Brian Wilson">My right hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson)</phrase> is well known for his deep commitment to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1282" name="Paddy Tipping">the debate on energy. My hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase> has a deep knowledge of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/934" name="David Hamilton">the mining industry. My hon. Friends the Members for Midlothian (David Hamilton)</phrase>, for Selby (Mr. Grogan), and for Bassetlaw (John Mann) have all lobbied me and made sure that coal industry issues are at the forefront of the Government's considerations; in some cases, they have been to see the Prime Minister to raise particular issues.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1192" name="Laurence Robertson">The hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase> made an interesting contribution and set out his case very well. As he comes from the Conservative party, which destroyed the mining industry, he speaks with limited credibility. However, he made some comments to which I should draw attention. One was about the gas supply&mdash;yes, it has been tight this year; we became a net importer in December. Although the figures will vary from month to month during the coming year, it is likely that we will in future import more gas than we export. In terms of overall energy, the situation may change during the course of next year, because we are still exporting oil.</p>
	<p pid=".462.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1262" name="Andrew Stunell">The hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell)</phrase> spoke for the Liberal Democrats, who have the valiant record of having done nothing for the coal industry for a very long time. His admission that the Liberal Democrats have not a policy, but a direction, was fascinating. I should be interested to read the book on the direction that they propose, given that they do not have a policy. I am not entirely sure about the distinction, but it was interesting none the less to hear of it.</p>

	<p pid=".463.3/1">That is very kind. I shall read it with the deep interest with which I read all Liberal Democrat party documents.</p>
	<p pid=".463.3/2">I share the belief of my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck in the continuing importance of the coal industry. It is essential that we maintain a coal industry. The Government's view is that it is enormously important to our energy future, and I want that industry to have a long-term future. Of course, I might well say that, given that there is a profitable, good, deep mine in my constituency. When I was first selected for Parliament, there were four mines there, but under a previous Government, three went: my area knew the impact of the closure of those pits.</p>
	<p pid=".463.3/3">Last night, I was at a meeting in a mining area in my constituency. The adjoining village lost its pit, and there was a devastating impact on the local community. Many relationships were fractured in Keresley End, where Coventry colliery closed, and we have seen problems with drugs and all sorts of social difficulties. Therefore, the damage done when pits such as Ellington close, and what has happened in Selby, seem to be a lot better than what happened in my constituency. I not only feel, but understand the problems faced by mining communities when pits close.</p>
	<p pid=".463.3/4">Our energy future must come from the security established by diversity of supply. That diversity will guarantee our long-term future and it must come from gas, oil, nuclear sources, wind power, solar power, hydrogen power, but also&mdash;importantly&mdash;the coal industry. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North said, China, the United States and other countries are ensuring that they develop their coal industries for the future. We need to be sure that we do that in this country, too. Carbon sequestration and clean coal technology are the key. I shall come back to those issues in the next few minutes.</p>
	<p pid=".463.3/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck raised Ellington colliery and the 370 jobs being lost there. The Prime Minister met MPs on that, and so did I. I also met Gerry Spindler, the chief executive of UK Coal, and asked him to allow the pumping of the pit to establish whether it could be saved. Gerry Spindler and UK Coal took the view that they would not do that. The Prime Minister made the same request, but the industry is privatised and companies can make their own judgments on such matters, as UK Coal did.</p>
	<p pid=".463.3/6">If the pit had been pumped, the mines inspectorate could have looked at it, decided on the level of risk and made an informed judgment about the risk of reopening it. UK Coal did not want to carry out that pumping operation, nor give that opportunity to the mines inspectorate. Clearly, the company would have to take responsibility for miners' safety if it wanted to reopen a pit. Our view was that a report from a mines inspector on the level of risk in the pit would have been helpful to some extent in determining the judgment. UK Coal did not share that view.</p>

	<p pid=".464.0/1">I have never doubted the Minister's commitment to the coal industry, nor his role in trying to secure a future for Ellington colliery. However, the industry has reached a critical point. Each individual colliery left is a stand-alone unit. What prevents UK Coal from continuing to close the industry down, knocking mines over like a pack of dominoes? That is the very reason for this debate.</p>

	<p pid=".464.1/1">UK Coal has given us reassurances that it plans to invest in the region of &pound;150 million in the coal industry between 2004 and 2007. The Government, too, are investing substantial amounts in coal aid for the industry, and we plan to continue to do so. Coal investment aid to the tune of &pound;57.5 million has already been allocated, and there is more money in the kitty; it is a limited amount at the moment, but there will be ongoing discussions with the Treasury about the future of that investment.</p>

	<p pid=".465.1/1">Very well, Mr. Deputy Speaker. That allegation is unfounded. There was some discussion about working practices in particular pits, and I made it clear that that was a matter for negotiation between the trade union and the employers, not one for me to raise in that way.</p>
	<p pid=".465.1/2">The Government intend to continue to support the coal industry. We want pits to develop in future. As we have discussed, there were reviews of Welbeck and Harworth. Following discussions between the unions and management, the industry has begun to address some of those issues, and some pits have been able to remain open. We want such pits to have a long-term future. Coal investment aid is important, and we want to ensure that it can continue.</p>
	<p pid=".465.1/3">As far as the industry is concerned, we are committed to investing in the long term through developing research into carbon sequestration and clean coal technology. We are already putting substantial funding into that. If we can continue to develop such technologies, we believe that they will provide the sort of carbon-free, long-term future that the coal industry wants.</p>
	<p pid=".465.1/4">We want the coal industry to continue to provide a substantial amount of our electricity needs. Coal-fired power stations are better able to respond more rapidly&mdash; certainly more rapidly than gas-fired plants&mdash;to fluctuations in electricity demand. We need to ensure that we keep that capacity.</p>
	<p pid=".465.1/5">There are only seconds left, so I shall conclude by reaffirming that the Government firmly believe that there should be a continuing role for coal as part of a varied and balanced energy mix.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-09.466.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" speakername="John McDonnell" colnum="466"  time="10:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050309/halltext/50309h02.htm#50309h02_spnew0">
	<p pid=".466.1/1">By way of introduction, I should say that Adjournment debates are meant to enable individual MPs and others to outline an issue and permit time for ministerial response. I accept that today's debate may be somewhat different. The complexity of the issues involved requires me to spend some time outlining and explaining them. This is an ongoing matter&mdash;a work in progress&mdash;so the Minister will be able to say only a limited amount this morning. Instead, I suggest that she takes note of the issues, and responds more fully in separate meetings, in writing and possibly in a further debate later in the year.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/2">Despite such facts, I believe that it was my duty to obtain this debate to place on record the matters that have so concerned me, my constituents and local councillors, so that everybody can have access to the fullest information on this important issue. I also wish to ensure that the House has a progress report on a matter that raises questions of public administration, practices and probity that go well beyond local interest and to the heart of administrative accountability in local and national Government.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/3">I wish to explain briefly the background to the debate and the Audit Commission's inquiry into planning services in Hillingdon, to examine the conduct of that inquiry and discuss its findings, and to outline some concerns about the reaction to it from the ruling Conservative administration in the London borough of Hillingdon and from chief officers at the borough. I want also to explain the way forward that I propose should be taken to address the continuing concerns of local residents, councillors and me.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/4">To explain the background to today's debate, in 2002, the Government introduced a planning delivery grant system to improve the performance of local planning departments. An additional grant was awarded to planning authorities as an incentive if they met Government targets for turnaround time from the receipt of a planning application to the date of the dispatch of the decision to the planning applicant. The proposal was generally supported across the House, and both the Government and Opposition parties felt that that was a way in to improve overall performance centrally and ensure an accurate record of how that performance changed over time.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/5">The London borough of Hillingdon, in which my constituency is located, received a planning delivery grant in 2002 in reward for its significant improvement in planning performance. Given the widespread local criticism of the performance of Hillingdon's planning departments over the years, that came as a surprise&mdash;to say the least&mdash;to some local councillors, and residents, and also to me, based on anecdotal evidence from my constituency surgery and consultations with local community organisations and constituents. The Audit Commission designated Hillingdon's planning department as scoring the lowest possible measure for performance and, overall, the authority has been consistently scored as weak.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/6">The contradictory information provoked one local councillor, Councillor Janet Duncan, who is in the Public Gallery today and is a retired assistant director of planning, to delve more deeply into detail of the planning department's records in order to understand why there should be such a discrepancy between local perceptions of the planning department's performance and the high standards claimed by Hillingdon council's planning department as part of its submission for a planning delivery grant.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/7">Councillor Duncan's attempt to inquire into the matter, remarkably, met intense hostility and even abuse at meetings from leading councillors in the Conservative administration. The council is hung, with a Conservative administration supported by the Liberal Democrats. There was and continues to be a disgraceful campaign of personal vilification against Councillor Duncan, led by leading members of the council: the leader of the council and the lead cabinet member for planning. It was even apparent in our local newspaper over the past few weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/8">In addition to the campaign at council level, Councillor Duncan was denied access to information by officers, refused attendance at key meetings with officials to discuss her concerns and faced with a concerted campaign of obfuscation and delay on access to information. To her credit, she persisted and, with great skill, she discovered the following points.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/9">First, the council had claimed performance target achievements, and therefore Government grant awards, based on the use of a target date, contrary to the guidelines and regulations set out by the Government. The claim was based on the date that the decision was made, rather than when it was dispatched to the applicant. Secondly, an internal memorandum showed that the use of the incorrect target date, contrary to the Government's requirements, was known to the management team of the council's planning department. That memorandum was also copied to the head of planning services. Thirdly, planning reports had been physically altered, often very crudely, to change the dates, enabling targets to be met and grants to be gained. Fourthly, the staff were aware of the problems and were so concerned that they had raised them at their union meeting.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/10">Our impression of the planning department during that period is of a department permeated by a climate of fear, intimidation and bullying, particularly of junior staff. In my view, that prevented whistleblowers from coming forward. Indeed, no whistleblowing procedures were put in place in the local authority.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/11">I want to explain the level of involvement of Members and Ministers. Once Councillor Duncan's inquiries revealed evidence of potential malpractice, she approached me and, in autumn 2003, I lodged the information with the relevant Minister in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Housing and Planning. The Minister rightly took the matter seriously&mdash;I commend him for that&mdash;and tried professionally and expeditiously to address it in the way that he thought most appropriate. He therefore passed the information to the Audit Commission, which was asked to undertake an urgent investigation.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/12">The Minister had already appointed consultants on two occasions to try to examine the performance of the London borough of Hillingdon and to improve its planning department's procedures and performance overall. By June 2004, I was increasingly concerned at the lack of progress in the pursuit of the Audit Commission's investigation undertaken by the local district auditor. Neither I nor Councillor Duncan had heard anything or received any report on the activities of the district auditor.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/13">Consequently, I secured an Adjournment debate on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-09">9 June 2004</phrase>, in which I outlined the concerns and questioned the Minister on the progress of the district auditor's inquiry. I raised further concerns that evidence, particularly computer-based evidence, was at risk and being destroyed. I expressed my worries about the appropriateness of the district auditor's inquiries and, I have to say without any form of arrogance, it seems almost prophetic that I questioned whether the district auditor would have the skills and abilities to investigate such matters and bring such an investigation to a conclusion. I suggested that a more independent investigation might be required, certainly into the administration of the department, and that the police should be involved.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/14">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-08">8 July 2004</phrase>, when I was led to understand that the district auditor had drawn his investigation to a conclusion and was drafting his final report, I raised in business questions my anxiety that the district auditor had not approached me or Councillor Duncan for interview, nor even the full range of council officers involved in the process. Indeed, my understanding was that no local residents who had raised their concerns had been interviewed. As a result, the district auditor did not complete his report, but eventually wrote to Councillor Duncan and me and agreed a meeting at which we were at long last able to directly explain our concerns and hand over further evidence.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/15">I now turn to the district auditor's report, which was eventually submitted to the borough on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-31">31 January 2005</phrase>, more than 12 months and leading on for 14 since I raised the matter with the Minister, who had properly and in a timely manner submitted the evidence to the district auditor. Although the chief executive of the London borough of Hillingdon had given an assurance to the district auditor that the report would be published on an open cabinet agenda, the report was withheld from the first cabinet meeting after publication and withheld from the Labour group councillors and the public for more than 10 days. In the meantime, the local press were briefed. They were told that the district auditor had given the council a clean bill of health, the investigation had found only minor administrative failures and that no one apart from a few junior officers was to blame. That was pure spin, distortion and, in many instances, a downright lie.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/16">What is the reality of the report? Far from giving the council a clean bill of health, the district auditors confirmed the facts. They confirmed the facts exposed by Councillor Janet Duncan's own investigations.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/17">First, did the council misreport its development control performance by reference to the wrong date, contrary to Government procedures? Yes. I shall quote directly from the district auditor:</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/18" class="indent">&quot;The council has misreported its development control performance over a number of years by reference to the date of decision, rather than the date of despatch of decision.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/19">We discover from the brief sampling&mdash;not the full investigation&mdash;that more than one in 10 planning applications were using the wrong system, contrary to Government guidelines that were known and issued at the time.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/20">Secondly, did that misreporting have an effect on the council's overall performance records? Yes it did. It had a significant impact on the actual performance achieved by the council. Again, I shall quote the district auditor:</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/21" class="indent">&quot;Indeed, it is a far more significant matter, in terms of its impact on reported performance, than any of the matters originally referred to us.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/22">The facts of the matter are extraordinary.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/23">Thirdly, did the council receive grant from the Government based on misreported performance? Yes. Let me refer to the auditor again:</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/24" class="indent">&quot;The Council received &pound;320,000 planning delivery grant for 2003/2004 from the ODPM, in part reflecting improvements to its development control performance that had been calculated to the date of decision, rather than the date of despatch of decision.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/25">Thanks to the beneficence of this Government, and I am grateful to the Ministers involved, they have not demanded that that grant be paid back. Otherwise, my constituents would have had to pay for that through their local council taxes&mdash;paying for the abuse of the system by the council itself and council officers.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/26">Fourthly, were reports tampered with and dates on reports changed? Yes. In more than one in six planning application reports, the district auditor discovered and confirmed that reports had been &quot;manually adjusted&quot;. That is the district auditor's euphemism for tampering, crossing out, backdating crudely and overriding dates&mdash;in many ways what in common parlance would be described as forgery.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/27">The district auditor determined from a limited sample that in more than one in 25 of those cases the detailed application processing papers were regarded as definitely suspicious. That is a district auditor who I believe has erred on the side of caution and in favour of the local authority, but even in those figures he identified real suspicions.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/28">Fifthly, were senior officers in the planning department aware that the date of decision and not dispatch was being used contrary to Government guidelines? Yes. The e-mail from the planning department's management team was produced confirming that. From the district auditor's report one would expect that, having found all the major factual allegations correct and proven, he would conclude that it was a serious matter warranting action, and that it would behove him to ensure further independent investigation was enabled and promptly undertaken. From my experience in local government, I would expect the district auditor to see the matter through from investigation to report to full independent investigation and implementation of a view of improvements in procedures. Otherwise, how can my constituents gain or regain any confidence in the administration of the planning process in my area?</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/29">Bizarrely, the district auditor, having found out the facts of the matter, stops. It is as though he withdraws from the role as the engine of further investigation and reform. He also draws some extraordinary conclusions that no reasonable person could possibly arrive at.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/30">First, I shall review his investigation process. From the outset, I was concerned about the lack of skills and competence of the district auditor to pursue the matter. That was exacerbated when we found out that the inquiry was to be ended early without myself or Councillor Duncan being interviewed. However, I now discover that the auditor definitely did not interview all relevant staff, particularly those staff with their names attached to planning reports, and particularly junior staff. In addition he did not even bother to interview the local resident upon whom we submitted an affidavit confirming that he had discovered that the date of his planning application had been tampered with and had reported it to the head of planning services at Hillingdon.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/31">The district auditor, we now discover, had not implemented any whistleblowing procedures to enable vulnerable staff or planning applicants to produce evidence in confidence and security. Even when it was pointed out that staff had raised their concerns at their union meeting, the district auditor did not even contact the trade union or its representatives to clarify the matter.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/32">Secondly, the district auditor relied heavily on evidence being collected and analysed by the London borough of Hillingdon planning department itself&mdash;the very organisation being investigated was providing him with the materials upon which he was to base his conclusions. For example, whereas the council was reporting the percentage of reports using the wrong date as 0.6 per cent., when he checked the department's information and verified it with a small sample, he discovered that it rose to 11.2 per cent. The numbered tampered with rose from the council's claim of 9.9 per cent. to 17.4 per cent. when the district auditor undertook further investigation. The auditor then naively suggested that that was not deliberate but may have been just the result of pressure of work.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/33">I have previously given to the Minister examples where dates have been scrubbed out, rubbed out and new dates crudely inserted above them and signed off by a number of officers. That is not overwork; that is tampering with information upon which legal matters are determined. Even the auditor is critical of how, instead of instigating an independent review, the council had the audacity to appoint the head of planning services to investigate her own planning department. In addition, he criticised the limited scope of those internal investigations.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/34">Thirdly, the final conclusion of the district auditor exposes the inadequacies of that route&mdash;that whole mechanism for addressing what I believe to be a deliberate and organised attempt to manipulate the planning system in Hillingdon for the benefit of the ruling council administration and senior officers. Having discovered that the wrong procedures were used, that the council officers had been fully advised of the right dates and procedures, that there had been tampering with and adjustment of official documents and that that was suspicious, he concluded that nobody was to blame. Despite all the evidence of tampering and forgery, no one is to blame, because he cannot find what he describes as conclusive evidence to nail any individual officer or group of individuals. Even the council had to admit in its own investigation that it had been led to believe that the objective of tampering had been to try to gain additional Government grant.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/35">The district auditor seeks to downgrade the matter, saying that no extra grant was achieved. That is not right: extra grant was achieved in the first year and we did not lose it because the Government were good enough not to demand it back. The auditor argues that nobody gained individually. Quite the contrary: senior officers have been complimented on their performance by leading local councillors. No doubt, their careers will be enhanced and they will receive the associated pay rewards that follow.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/36">What next? Is the district auditor to see the matter through to any conclusion? No. He recommends that the council organise an independent investigation into the forged dates and tampering. The leader of the local council responded in our local paper, saying that he and the borough solicitor will undertake that investigation. Where is the independence in that?</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/37">The scrutiny committee on the planning environment seeks to set up a sub-committee perhaps to examine the report. It is understood that the leading Conservative administration will seek to block that at the whips committee next week. The district auditor reports that, as a minimum, there should be an investigation into the officers who are responsible for significant manual adjustments&mdash;forgeries. To date, not a single member of staff has been disciplined, and I predict that none will be. If anybody is, he will just receive a slap on the wrist and the issue will be allowed to die quietly. That is the Hillingdon way under its present administration.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/38">In conclusion, many in my community feel betrayed by their local council. Now, they feel let down by the district auditor too, believing that the body that is responsible for ensuring probity and efficiency in the delivery of local services has not undertaken its work thoroughly. I will not fail them. Too much evidence of fraudulent behaviour has come to light during the investigation&mdash;and that is in addition to the dire failure of planning services in my community. Planning enforcement is almost non-existent; there is no pro-active planning; the staffing levels in the department are poor; and we have planners who go to site meetings without even knowing where the sites are. The disregard of the wishes of local people goes on apace. The selling-off of community assets; the disregard of covenants on individual pieces of land; the distribution of grants and the award of contracts&mdash;all have a whiff about them if they are associated with the London borough of Hillingdon.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/39">Today, I am calling for a fully independent public inquiry into the London borough of Hillingdon as a planning authority. I am launching a petition, which I shall urge local residents, businesses and community organisations to sign, calling upon the council to do its duty and to convene an independent inquiry. That will bring the matter back to the attention of the council, the community and, if necessary, Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".466.1/40">If the administration of the London borough of Hillingdon has nothing to hide, why should it refuse to support such a call? If the councillors are so confident of the probity of their administration, I ask them to open up the books. In the London borough of Hillingdon, there is an endemic culture of connivance and a belligerent refusal to be accountable. That has resulted in a grotesque failure to deliver the services that my community needs and deserves. The administration is tainted and contaminated at the highest levels, and it is my role to expose that, in order to ensure that my constituents are better served by their council.</p>

	<p pid=".472.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" name="John McDonnell">my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> on securing the debate and on using it to raise an issue that he has been pursuing for some time. He set out clearly some of the problems facing Hillingdon and raised many of the problems that were pointed out in the Audit Commission report on Hillingdon. He has been instrumental in pushing forward the district auditor's inquiries in meetings with my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning in late January 2003 and early 2004, and promoted the subject in a debate in Westminster Hall last year.</p>
	<p pid=".472.0/2">As my hon. Friend knows, the Audit Commission conducted a thorough investigation and concluded that for some years Hillingdon had incorrectly based the reporting of its development control performance on the date of making, rather than the date of issue, of decisions on planning applications. It concluded that that did not appear to have been done deliberately with the motive of enhancing reported performance, although it did have that effect. The Audit Commission's analysis showed that the difference in reported performance in a particular category could affect as many as 50 per cent. of the decisions in that category. It also found some manual amendment of decision dates, which improved performance figures by 2 to 4 per cent. I understand that the council is investigating that further.</p>

	<p pid=".472.1/1">I find it extraordinary that the district auditor's report concluded, without further investigation and on the basis of information provided by the local authority with limited sampling and so on, that nothing was done deliberately. Even within the council, there was one officer who might have ensured some independence within the authority. Its statement says that</p>
	<p pid=".472.1/2" class="indent">&quot;there are grounds for suspecting that there were adjustments to the dates certain applications were signed off and this had the intention of having the determination of these cases meeting Government set targets&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".472.1/3">and yet there is to be no further investigation of that matter, other than an internal one.</p>

	<p pid=".472.2/1">My hon. Friend makes important points, particularly on the manual amendments. I will come back to that.</p>
	<p pid=".472.2/2">As part of its investigation, the Audit Commission sought to verify that the council had put in place procedures to secure proper recording of performance. It identified some errors and indicated that the council has taken steps to prevent their recurrence. The report also enumerates a wide range of checks&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".472.3/1">Let me make this explicit and put it on the record: the council's actions were taken only after Councillor Janet Duncan had raised the matters, not just with the council, but with the Government office for London. When the discussions between the Government office for London and the council took place, she was excluded from the meetings. So only when one councillor undertook a whistleblowing exercise were the matters addressed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-09.473.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/818" speakername="Yvette Cooper" colnum="473"  time="11:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050309/halltext/50309h02.htm#50309h02_spnew4">
	<p pid=".473.0/1">My hon. Friend will understand that I am not able to comment on the detail of individual councillor's roles or on their participation in particular meetings. The council has certainly instigated changes in response to the Audit Commission report and the problems that it identified.</p>
	<p pid=".473.0/2">Our consultants have also indicated that there might still be concerns as to whether the improved performance can be maintained, because they think that the council has not addressed all the issues that might put performance at risk. Senior officials from the ODPM met the council's chief executive in February to put the issue to him, and dialogue is continuing with the borough about what still needs to be done.</p>

	<p pid=".473.1/1">In the past, reports published by the ODPM on the planning performance of the London borough of Hillingdon have been denied to councillors for a considerable number of weeks, if not months. Therefore, there is no transparency in Hillingdon. I urge the ODPM to take a more active role in ensuring that discussions between the Department and the council are made open and transparent, and that all reports are provided to all councillors. That has not been the case until now. In fact, obtaining information from the London borough of Hillingdon at member level is like drawing teeth.</p>

	<p pid=".473.2/1">I am keen to ensure that there is appropriate transparency of discussions, so I shall happily discuss the matter further with my hon. Friend to ensure that the right level of transparency is implemented in practice.</p>
	<p pid=".473.2/2">It is important that when allegations are made that touch on the propriety of the council's conduct, appropriate investigations are undertaken so that the situation can, as far as possible, be put right. As I said, the council continues to investigate certain aspects of the misreporting. The auditor will also need to see that the authority is taking effective follow-up action, and if the auditor has reason to be concerned that the action is not effective, it is open to the auditor to carry out further inquiries.</p>
	<p pid=".473.2/3">My hon. Friend has asked for further investigation into these matters. I am happy to consider his points and to talk to him about them, because he raises important details and issues for consideration.</p>

	<p pid=".474.0/1">The key issue is that the district auditor has specifically recommended that there should be an independent investigation, but that is not being pursued by the local authority. We will not restore confidence in planning in the London borough of Hillingdon until we have an open, transparent and independent public investigation.</p>

	<p pid=".474.1/1">I recognise the import of the points raised. Obviously, internal investigations are continuing with the council and the auditor will want to see that the authority is taking effective follow-up action, but I will have further discussions with my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid=".474.1/2">To reduce the risk of similar problems occurring in future, the ODPM has collaborated with the Audit Commission in preparing new and clearer guidance to auditors about the checks that they should make and the things that they should look out for in auditing the arrangements for recording planning performance. In due course, we will consult on a draft prescribed application form for all local planning authorities. That will make it clear how the beginning and end of the time taken to handle a planning application must be recorded.</p>

	EU Structural Funds (Wales)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-09.475.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1279" speakername="Simon Thomas" colnum="475"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050309/halltext/50309h03.htm#50309h03_spnew0">
	<p pid=".475.1/1">I am delighted to have the opportunity to open this debate and to see the Minister for Trade and Investment in his place. I look forward to his reply. The issue is of great importance to Wales&mdash;as well as to one or two other objective 1 areas&mdash;and goes to the heart of the Government's regional policy and its future.</p>
	<p pid=".475.1/2">I start by referring to the debate and the vote in the House on Monday. The Government proposed that the House note and approve their approach to structural funds at the European level. The motion made it clear that the Government sought to put a ceiling on the EU budget, at 1 per cent. of gross value added&mdash;GVA&mdash;and bring structural funds from Europe back to the Treasury. That is a perfectly legitimate position&mdash;I understand it and I know where the Government are coming from. However, I shall argue against it, because many issues need to be taken account of.</p>
	<p pid=".475.1/3">Although I am delighted to see the hon. Members for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham), for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) and for St. Ives (Andrew George), I was disappointed that neither the Conservatives nor the Liberal Democrats joined us on Monday by supporting our amendment to the Government's motion. I understand that the Conservatives might have particular concerns about the size of the EU budget, but only a week ago the Liberal Democrats put a motion to the National Assembly for Wales proposing that the Assembly</p>
	<p pid=".475.1/4" class="indent">&quot;believes that Wales's best interests would be served by proactive campaigning by the Welsh Assembly Government to ensure support for the European Commission's structural funds post-2006 proposals&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".475.1/5">The Liberal Democrats could not have been more unequivocal in the Assembly, but they certainly can be equivocal here in Westminster, where they sat on the fence and did not vote on Monday.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid=".475.2/1">The hon. Gentleman will understand that the amendment to the Government's motion also had the effect of putting in jeopardy the British rebate. Because of that, we could not vote for it and abstained.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-09.475.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1279" speakername="Simon Thomas" colnum="475"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050309/halltext/50309h03.htm#50309h03_spnew2">
	<p pid=".475.3/1">That is an interesting position and means that the Liberal Democrats could not think up an amendment to take their policy into account.</p>
	<p pid=".475.3/2">The hon. Gentleman's point also underlines a problem that I shall address later. How do we tackle the EU budget without facing up to the British rebate? I hope that when the hon. Gentleman has heard what I have to say about what the rebate and structural funds bring to Wales, it might be clearer to him why he should support our position. Indeed, the hon. Member for St. Ives had a debate in the House a few months ago&mdash;it was at the end of the day and he had a lot of time, as I remember&mdash;when he said positive things about structural funds. One cannot positively campaign for structural funds to be retained by the EU without addressing the implications of that for Government spending, the rebate and so forth.</p>
	<p pid=".475.3/3">We have had our say on that, however, so let us look to the future. Let us consider how we can ensure that opportunities for my constituency and west Wales and the valleys continue to flow from EU structural funds. If the Government get their way in their twin-pronged attack on structural funds&mdash;they want to limit the budget and repatriate the funds to the Treasury&mdash;what undertaking will they give today and in future to ensure that Wales and the objective 1 areas in England do not lose out? I accept that we have heard warm words from the Government, but we have not yet received any such undertakings.</p>
	<p pid=".475.3/4">Perhaps the Minister will say, &quot;Trust the Government&mdash;we will deliver.&quot; Many of us have difficulty trusting the Government these days, over many issues. Many hon. Members, on both sides of the House, have shown that in recent votes. In particular, the Government are not to be trusted on regional policy and they need to underpin their commitment to regional economic policy for several reasons.</p>
	<p pid=".475.3/5">The eligibility of Wales for objective 1 funding is not a badge of pride, but a badge of failure&mdash;the failure of UK-wide regional policy over many years and by many Governments. Westminster and Whitehall have got us into that state, so some of us have little faith that future Governments will get us out of it.</p>
	<p pid=".475.3/6">UK regional policy is appalling. We have the worst regional inequality in the European Union, with the possible exception of the islands of Greece, which, again, is not a badge of pride. There has been a failure to develop any worthwhile regional economic or fiscal measures, such as the ability to vary corporation tax in objective 1 areas or the ability to levy local business taxes, income tax or variations of that. We have still not dealt with the post-industrial legacy of unemployment, long-term sickness and incapacity benefit claimants, which is particularly serious in the south Wales valleys.</p>
	<p pid=".475.3/7">With such a history of failure, we have deep suspicions as to whether the Treasury or the Under-Secretary of State for Wales will be able to deliver an equivalent programme of investment over the forthcoming objective 1 period, which we know the Commission is proposing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-09.476.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/907" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="476"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050309/halltext/50309h03.htm#50309h03_spnew3">
	<p pid=".476.0/1">I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman has moved on from pre-election froth about the badly worded amendment that was put to the House on Monday. To get to the substance of the issue, would he agree that we are not just talking about suspicions? It is a matter of fact that the Commission would be able to offer objective 1 regions a seven-year programme, plus another two years of funding, which the Government cannot possibly match. That is a fundamental reason why objective 1 regions such as Wales, and Cornwall and the Scilly Isles must campaign for the continuation of the programme.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-09.476.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1279" speakername="Simon Thomas" colnum="476"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050309/halltext/50309h03.htm#50309h03_spnew4">
	<p pid=".476.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right, although of course I do not accept his definition of our amendment, which I thought was perfectly respectable for Wales and Cornwall. He is right about forthcoming regional programmes: the objective 1 programme&mdash;or the convergence programme, as it is likely to be called&mdash;will be a six-year programme. There will also be transitional funding after that, depending on how well the areas receiving the funding do.</p>
	<p pid=".476.1/2">With the best will in the world, Governments now work only on two or three-year cycles. I appreciate that this Government have moved to a three-year fiscal cycle, but any Government can at most give only an outline commitment for three years.</p>

	<p pid=".477.0/1">Or for one Parliament.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-09.477.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1279" speakername="Simon Thomas" colnum="477"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050309/halltext/50309h03.htm#50309h03_spnew6">
	<p pid=".477.1/1">Indeed&mdash;if there is an election, things change again. It is essential that our communities have direct access to those EU structural funds without having to go through Whitehall&mdash;or even, to a certain extent, through the Assembly or whatever. That is why the Cornish convention supports Plaid Cymru's position, and I look forward to hearing what the hon. Gentleman has to say about that.</p>
	<p pid=".477.1/2">That argument is also why the Wales TUC opposed the Government's proposals in its submission to their consultation at the end of 2003. The Wales TUC said that Wales needed the long-term investment and that it did not have confidence in the proposed investment policy. It is something for the Wales TUC to say that about a Labour Government.</p>
	<p pid=".477.1/3">Let us consider the current legacy. We could be asked, &quot;Why are you making all this fuss?&quot;. It might be argued that objective 1 has worked&mdash;that west Wales and the valleys have come out of their unfortunate position and are perhaps not even eligible for objective 1 any more. Regrettably, however, that is not the case. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-28">28 January</phrase> EUROSTAT published new statistics on GVA per head in the EU regions. West Wales and the valleys continue to be listed among those below the 75 per cent. threshold of eligibility for objective 1, with GDP per head currently estimated at 73.82 per cent. of the EU average&mdash;Cornwall is at 70 per cent., as the hon. Gentleman might know. The figure for west Wales and the valleys is 67.35 per cent. of the pre-EU enlargement average, but it is still low enough to qualify for objective 1 funding.</p>
	<p pid=".477.1/4">We have the opportunity. If the structural funds continue and the Government are part of that, west Wales and the valleys are poised to take further advantage of objective 1. With a figure of 53 per cent. of the EU average, Anglesey is the worst area, so I am pleased that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1148" name="Albert Owen">the hon. Member for Ynys M&ocirc;n (Albert Owen)</phrase> is here for this debate&mdash;he was not present on Monday. It is vital for Anglesey and constituencies such as mine that we continue objective 1 funding.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid=".477.2/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising the issue of GDP in parts of Wales, but does he not accept that the figures that he quoted are for the early stages of the programme up to 2002? The recent figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal a considerable increase, showing that objective 1 and major projects are working in areas such as Ynys M&ocirc;n.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid=".477.3/1">Anglesey has been in decline, it must be said. The figures to which I referred are the latest European statistics from the member states, and the hon. Gentleman must bear in mind that eligibility for further objective 1 funding is based on those figures, not the most recent ONS figures. He surely does not want to deprive west Wales and the valleys of eligibility for objective 1. I hope that he will now support the fact the Commission is prepared to use the figures that show eligibility and that he will not seek to create an artificial situation that would mean that we would not be eligible.</p>

	<p pid=".478.0/1">Has not the hon. Gentleman's party been putting the argument in the media over the past few days that if we do not act by July, the new figures will, by December, prove exactly what I said&mdash;that there has been considerable improvement in the GDP of west Wales and the valleys, including in my constituency?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-09.478.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1279" speakername="Simon Thomas" colnum="478"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050309/halltext/50309h03.htm#50309h03_spnew10">
	<p pid=".478.1/1">The hon. Gentleman cannot say that. <i>[Interruption.] </i>If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to continue. If we do not act by July, the UK will take up the EU presidency and will therefore be in a position to dictate the terms. He has to decide whether he is for or against structural funds for Anglesey. If he is for structural funds for Anglesey, he will support the campaign. If he is against them and believes that the Treasury will deliver a similar sum of money, he can by all means line up with the Treasury. However, people in Anglesey know that the structural funds are delivering to them. <i>[Interruption.] </i>If he wants to know about the money delivered to Anglesey and about the jobs created, I can tell him. Some 2,080 jobs have been created in Anglesey by objective 1. Those are the jobs that he wants to put down the pan, by supporting his Government's position on objective 1.</p>
	<p pid=".478.1/2">We have heard enough about the matter from the hon. Gentleman, who finds himself on somewhat weak and shaky ground. The choice that I described is the real choice we face.</p>
	<p pid=".478.1/3">The Government are leading a campaign in Europe&mdash;and will strengthen it after taking up the EU presidency in June&mdash;to cut the budget to 1 per cent. of average EU national income. That would mean a severe cut in all policy areas, including in objective 1 areas.</p>
	<p pid=".478.1/4">Let us turn from one end of Wales&mdash;it was interesting to have the Labour party's Anglesey policy illuminated&mdash;to the other, to the south Wales coalfields. A recent report from Sheffield Hallam university, which many hon. Members have no doubt seen and which was published on the 20th anniversary of the end of the coal dispute, found that south Wales continues to suffer most from the lack of jobs that resulted from the closure of the coal industry. Some 20,000 mining jobs went in that period.</p>
	<p pid=".478.1/5">I accept that that was not this Government's responsibility, but we need to ask what has been done since to bring those post-industrial areas up to a state of competitiveness, so that they can take advantage of what the Government say they want to come from the Lisbon agenda, for example, and so that the working population can become trained, fit and active.</p>
	<p pid=".478.1/6">The story in south Wales is very sad. Out of all the former coal areas, Wales has made the slowest progress out of depression and unemployment towards a more active and vital work force. Only about 22 per cent. of the old coalfield jobs have been replaced, whereas in some areas, such as Yorkshire, the figure is 100 per cent. The Government might say that means that regional policy has worked for Yorkshire. However, one thing is for certain: UK regional policy following the miners' strike and the closure of the pits has not worked for south Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".478.1/7">The Sheffield Hallam report also points to around 100,000 former miners who count as the hidden unemployed. They are the people claiming incapacity benefit who come to our surgeries. We know that the Government also have plans for incapacity benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".478.1/8">The interesting thing about the report is that Professor Stephen Fothergill of Sheffield Hallam university estimated that it would take a further 10 to 15 years for full economic recovery. Curiously, 10 to 15 years is exactly the time scale of another objective 1 period and another set of transitional funds. The prescription and the analysis have been made and there is a possible solution: continuing to support objective 1 for south Wales.</p>

	<p pid=".479.4/1">I am sure that good sense will be reflected later in his speech.</p>
	<p pid=".479.4/2">The hon. Gentleman mentioned Professor Stephen Fothergill. In fairness to the professor, he said that his analysis is unsurprising because it has been difficult to attract inward investment into the south Wales valleys because of issues of topography.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-09.479.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1279" speakername="Simon Thomas" colnum="479"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050309/halltext/50309h03.htm#50309h03_spnew16">
	<p pid=".479.5/1">I accept that point. I have no problem whatever with that analysis, but, even so, how do we attract inward investment and encourage indigenous start-ups in the valleys when there is such poor infrastructure there?</p>
	<p pid=".479.5/2">The hon. Gentleman will know that many of the infrastructure improvements in the valleys, including the railway lines to Caerphilly and from Taffs Well up to Pontypridd and on to my home town of Aberdare, have been made with objective 1 money. Does he want such investment to continue for areas such as Caerphilly, or does he trust a UK Government of whatever political colour, as there is a general election coming up, and we could have change&mdash;I am sure that the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk will want to make his pitch for that later&mdash;maintaining that for 10 or 15 years? I do not think so.</p>
	<p pid=".479.5/3">I should hope that the hon. Member for Caerphilly, as a former MEP, recognises the huge strengths that we can gain from being locked into a European-wide regional policy that has some of the best features of dealing with regional disparity, and some of the best socialist features of delivering aid from the richest areas in Europe to the most deprived. I advocate that policy in the UK and the European Union; it can deliver for Caerphilly and Ceredigion, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will support it, because some of the alternatives rely on Government policies such as state aids.</p>
	<p pid=".479.5/4">Let us consider what has happened with state aids from the UK. Unfortunately, they have gone down in the UK by 22.5 per cent. It is sad that the latest figures on state aids that I was able to obtain show that they were higher in the period from 1996 to 1998, which was the transition period from a Conservative to a Labour Administration, than under this Administration. State aid in manufacturing, in particular, is way below in the UK, at half the European average.<i> [Interruption.]</i> As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1170" name="Adam Price">my hon. Friend the Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Adam Price)</phrase> says from a sedentary position, &quot;More Tory than the Tories.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".479.5/5">The Government's use of state aid has been extremely slow and has not matched the EU average, which is the equivalent of &euro;534 per person compared to the UK average of &euro;261 per person. We are way behind in regional spending using state aid rules.</p>
	<p pid=".479.5/6">What if we follow the Government's policy and it transpires that we are not part of EU structural funds and we renationalise those funds to the Treasury? The new EU Commissioner for Competition, Neelie Kroes, said, when interviewed by the <i>Financial Times</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-26">26 January</phrase>, that even regions below the 75 per cent. figure, such as Wales and Cornwall, should not be eligible for Government state aid if they are in member states that are not relatively poor.</p>
	<p pid=".479.5/7">The Commission seems to be saying, &quot;If structural funds are available, you can make use of them, because you can come straight to us, but if your Government want to stop structural funds being made available, we will carefully scrutinise how state aids are used within your member state.&quot; I understand that that is political posturing from the EU Commission, but there is a lesson there for the Government about the price that they may have to pay to get this handbag rebate that they seem to have inherited from Maggie Thatcher and that they seem to think is so crucial.</p>
	<p pid=".479.5/8">Let us consider what the EU Commission proposes and what the Government are saying no to. The Commission has a set of proposals for regional cohesion policy from 2007 to 2013, which should start at the beginning of 2007. It proposes to modify objective 1 to highlight its economic convergence aspect in line with the Lisbon agenda, so it may well become known as the convergence objective.</p>
	<p pid=".479.5/9">Regions will still be eligible, however, if their GDP per head is less than 75 per cent. of the average for the enlarged EU&mdash;I have already pointed out that that still applies to west Wales and the valleys&mdash;and is calculated on the figures for the three years prior to adopting the regulation. That brings us back to our earlier point of debate: if we adopt the regulation now, we will have the necessary figures to qualify. I do not want to lose that opportunity because of the Government's delay. Newly published EU statistics show that west Wales and the valleys and Cornwall would be included, but Merseyside and south Yorkshire would not. Those two objective areas would no longer qualify.</p>
	<p pid=".479.5/10">Of course, all that is subject to member states' agreement, but the proposals would apply to west Wales and the valleys because the EU proposes that half the cohesion funds should be spent in the EU 15, and half in the new 10 accession countries. Of the half to be spent in EU 15, 78 per cent. would go to the convergence fund. How much that would mean for Wales depends on how many areas in the EU 15 and in the nomenclature of units for territorial statistics&mdash;NUTS&mdash;proposals come below the 75 per cent. threshold.</p>
	<p pid=".479.5/11">There are 1.8 million people in the west Wales and the valleys area, and we should expect a continuation of funding of at least &pound;2 billion. If one considers that many areas in the EU 15 will come above the 75 per cent. average, one sees that there is a little less jam to go around, but it does not have to be spread as thinly because there is less area to cover. The opportunities for Wales will still be considerable. Perhaps the Government can even tell us what those opportunities are. Who knows? The Minister may have the figures to say what the EU structural funds would mean for west Wales and the valleys; I would certainly like to hear that the Government at least know what they are going to throw away, because that reflects what they will then have to commit from the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid=".479.5/12">We should also remember that such sums must be additional to current Government spending. That is another problem that both the TUC and I want to raise. How can we be sure about the clarity of additionality? It is one thing for the Treasury to say, &quot;We will spend the same as you would have got under objective 1 for the next two or three years,&quot; but another altogether for it to follow that through in the spending round in the public expenditure survey, and to ensure that that happens. We know that it is extremely difficult. It is difficult with all Governments; we have to be clear about that, but there is no doubt that there is more clarity with EU structural funds. Did not we in Wales recently have to use the Freedom of Information Act 2000 in relation to what the National Assembly for Wales identified as an additionality need&mdash;&pound;451 million per year&mdash;and to establish the fact, as we said all along when the Treasury gave an extra &pound;200-odd million as a Barnett-plus formula, that it was not meeting the full additionality?</p>
	<p pid=".479.5/13">This is an important opportunity to obtain significant and continuing investment in west Wales and the valleys, to bring in match funding from the private and public sectors, and to ensure that such funding is in addition to current Government spending. However, we must ensure that those opportunities are not preserved in the Treasury model; to use the word &quot;model&quot; is a little extreme, because there is no clarity about where it adds up from.</p>

	<p pid=".482.3/1">Thank you, Mr. Olner. The point that I was trying to make to the hon.

The waiting lists are testament to the lack of long-term investment in the health service in Wales. The hon. Gentleman can chew the cud over that when he gives his speech.</p>

	<p pid=".482.5/1">Thank you, Mr. Olner. My hon. Friend the Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr has pointed out how structural funds could be used for investment in the health service in Wales, but I leave that for another day. My point is that the use of additional match funding from elsewhere in the budget meant that there was an effect on public services.</p>
	<p pid=".482.5/2">I move to the final aspect of structural funds. We have talked about objective 1, which is obviously of great importance in my constituency and in those of, not all hon. Members present, but one or two at least. The final aspect is the future of agricultural funding affecting Wales. A European agricultural fund for rural development has been proposed as part of the structural funds project and is being discussed in European Parliament. Following common agricultural policy reform, that is now the major focus of policy reform for funding. It is certainly of great importance to my constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".482.5/3">The fund will determine what European funding is available for rural areas from 2007 onwards, so the next decision is important for how that is shaped in Wales and the shape of the programme throughout the UK. The UK has historically received a low allocation; today the House of Lords has produced a report which shows Ireland's allocation of that particular funding shooting up, and the UK lagging well behind. We are told that we will get money from the rebate, and that that will help us if the Government get their way.</p>
	<p pid=".482.5/4">Currently, the rebate is about &pound;3.4 billion. We want a commitment from the Government to spend the equivalent of objective 1 in west Wales and the valleys and elsewhere in Wales on these policies. I admit that if they make that commitment, some of my argument dies. We look forward to receiving a commitment, not to spend money, but a commitment in facts and figures that is put into the Treasury forward planning.</p>
	<p pid=".482.5/5">The Government will have to consider both objective 1 and European funding. I am particularly concerned about less favoured area status, which affects all our constituencies. Some 80 per cent. of Wales is less favoured area status. The proposal being made&mdash;because of a European audit on the fund, which has found some problems in other countries, not the UK&mdash;is that socio-economic factors should be taken out of less favoured area status. That would be disastrous for Wales and its farming and rural areas. Although that is not objective 1, it is part of structural funds, and I hope that the Minister will consider that in detail.</p>
	<p pid=".482.5/6">I conclude by asking some questions. Will the Government fight to keep less favoured area status for Wales? Will they fight for socio-economic factors to be taken into account so that we can continue to access rural structural funds from Wales on the basis of the impact and support of our farming based on social and economic factors as well as geographic terrain?</p>
	<p pid=".482.5/7">Will the Government fight for objective 1 or convergence funds for west Wales and the valleys? That is almost a rhetorical question, because they have already said that they will not do that, in which case what binding guarantees will they now make for ongoing funding that will be transparent and additional to usual Treasury funding for west Wales and the valleys?</p>
	<p pid=".482.5/8">What will the Government do to fight for other structural funds in Wales? There is a plethora of other structural funds that I have not mentioned in any detail, which are available under other objectives. If the Government do not seek to make those structural funds available to Wales and seek instead to do that through the UK Treasury, what binding guarantees of ongoing funding will they give?</p>
	<p pid=".482.5/9">We find it difficult to accept promises from a Government who have come before Parliament several times with promises in a manifesto and overturned those promises. We are seeking more than mere words here today. We are seeking real, binding commitments to ensure that the most poor areas in the whole of the United Kingdom from Anglesey to Ceredigion down to the south Wales valleys are kept in line for significant regional assistance and aid. Whether it comes from Europe or the UK Treasury, it must be transparent, available and accessible to those communities. That is the purpose of the debate, and that is what I hope Members will support.</p>

	<p pid=".483.0/1">May I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1279" name="Simon Thomas">the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas)</phrase> on securing the debate? It is an extremely important issue, which should be considered fairly and honestly, and it is complex, so it must be approached in a reasonable manner. He did so in part, but only in part, I am afraid.</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/2">I begin by pointing out where we are at the moment. West Wales and the valleys have objective 1 status, which was secured by the British Government in 1999 at the Berlin summit. West Wales and the valleys receive the largest tranche of European money of any objective 1 area in the United Kingdom: some &pound;1.5 billion. In real terms that is &pound;3.2 billion because there is match funding, partly from central Government through Barnett plus, and also from the voluntary and private sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/3">In contrast to what happened with structural funds under the Conservative Government, it is absolutely clear that all the money available is being drawn down from Brussels and put to good effect. It really is being put to good effect because the latest figures show that some 2,325 projects in west Wales and the valleys are either taking place or about to take place because of that funding.</p>
	<p pid=".483.0/4">The hon. Gentleman referred to some EUROSTAT figures that have been submitted and, yes, they are accurate, but the important thing to stress is that they are out of date. They do not illustrate just how well the Welsh economy, and in particular the objective 1 part of it, is doing.</p>

	<p pid=".484.0/1">Whether or not what the hon. Gentleman is saying is accurate, does he accept that those figures will be used for determination in July?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-09.484.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/842" speakername="Wayne David" colnum="484"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050309/halltext/50309h03.htm#50309h03_spnew27">
	<p pid=".484.1/1">I do not think that those figures will be used in determination in July because there is a lot of debate still to be had, and I will come on to that in a moment. The hon. Gentleman is just looking at one set of figures dealing with a particular moment of time.</p>
	<p pid=".484.1/2">If we look at the most up-to-date situation in Wales, what do we see in the objective 1 area? That part of Wales has the fastest growth rate in the whole of the United Kingdom, and we have seen 84,000 jobs created or safeguarded because of objective 1 funding. If we consider gross value added per head in west Wales and the valleys, we find an increase of 17 per cent. from 1997. What is weird is that there appears to be a determined effort to talk Wales down all the time and say that things are terrible and awful. The reality in Wales is quite different, and the people of Wales know that.</p>
	<p pid=".484.1/3">The objective 1 programme is a success, but I would argue that it has been particularly successful since the mid-term review. That review accurately identified a number of weaknesses in the early part of the programme, and I hope that hon. Members accept that. There was too much bureaucracy and partnership in the structural fund programme, to the extent that things were becoming ossified in part. That has been put right by the Welsh Assembly Government, to their credit, and we now have a far more streamlined and effective programme.</p>
	<p pid=".484.1/4">The crucial question is, from the financial perspective, what happens during the next funding period. Another crucial question following from that is where continuing support for west Wales and the valleys should come from. Should it come via Brussels or from central Government in London? That is a critical question because the British Government have made a commitment to ensure that that extra funding continues, so that the excellent work of the objective 1 programme will continue whatever happens. The critical question is whether it is better to have money from Brussels or from London.</p>
	<p pid=".484.1/5">On the basis of my experience, it is better to have a more streamlined system, with money coming directly from the Treasury and London. I give three reasons for that. First, from a British Government perspective&mdash;Wales is part of Britain, let us not forget that&mdash;and a UK financial perspective, it makes sense to ensure that we have in place a better system for regional funding. For every extra &pound;1.60 that the British Government would have to give to Brussels under the Commission's proposals, only &pound;1 would come back. In other words, we would be short-changed, and the money would not necessarily go to some of the most disadvantaged parts of the European Union. Under the present Commission proposals, some of that money would go to some of the most prosperous states. The British argument has it, quite sensibly, that it is better for the richer members of the European Union to ensure that they have the correct support in their own nation states to help their less prosperous regions. That makes a great deal of common sense.</p>
	<p pid=".484.1/6">There is also the issue of the rebate, and the size of the British Government's contribution to the EU budget. If hon. Members wish to go into the general election arguing for a big increase in the size of the EU budget, a big increase in the size of Britain's contribution and an end to the British rebate, I can tell them that ordinary people in Wales and elsewhere, who will have to pay more into the EU budget, will take a pretty dim view of that argument.</p>

	<p pid=".485.1/1">There are certain qualifications that have to be added to that.

	<p pid=".485.2/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way again. Accepting that it is a complex issue, and accepting that the core issue is the one that both he and I identified&mdash;the best way to do it&mdash;will he stop reducing the question to a simplistic argument about which treasury pays what and address the important issue of the best way to get the best deal for west Wales and the valleys?</p>

	<p pid=".485.3/1">Absolutely. We are at one on that, and I hope that as the debate continues everyone will accept that we are talking about what is best for Wales. We are trying not to score cheap party political points, but to look at the facts and come to a conclusion about what is best for our country. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will do that, and accept that my party is trying to do it as well.</p>
	<p pid=".485.3/2">Much has been said about the European Commission's proposals. I would say that it is very easy for the Commission to make any sort of proposals; it is not talking about its own money, but member states' contribution. The Commission can pluck any figure it wishes from the sky, and at the end of the day the Council of Ministers will make a decision about the size of the EU budget.</p>
	<p pid=".485.3/3">The issue of trust has been raised. It is important to recognise the cold, hard facts of historical experience. We have had objective 2 and 3 funding in the past under the Conservative Administration, but prior to 1997 much European money simply stayed in Brussels. It was not drawn down; it was not claimed. That was because there was not match funding. It does not really matter at the end of the day how much money is allocated in Brussels if we do not have a sympathetic Government in London to ensure that match funding is provided. That is why it is absolutely essential that a Labour Government continue in power to ensure that the structural funds work. That is objective fact, and history proves that what I am saying is absolutely correct.</p>
	<p pid=".485.3/4">I would like to make a couple of points about why there is much to be said for the Government's case. First, much has been said about the difficulties that have been experienced with the objective 1 programme, especially during its early days. Those were certainly referred to in the debate in the House the other day. What we really require is a programme that complements what the Welsh Assembly Government are doing, not a programme that is tagged on.</p>
	<p pid=".485.3/5">One of the difficulties for the Welsh Assembly Government has been prioritising, first under the single programme document, and then under the objective 1 programme. That is because of Brussels rules. One of the great issues in south Wales is improving the transport structure: we need more roads to open up the upper parts of the valleys. Hardly any money under the objective 1 programme is devoted to that. Why? The Welsh Assembly Government want to do it, and the British Government are quite happy for it to happen, but the European Commission at the start of the programme said that transport and roads are not its priority. Therefore, objective 1 areas have suffered in practical terms because of diktats from Brussels. If the European principle of subsidiarity were applied, the Welsh Assembly Government would be able to use extra money coming from London according to their own democratically agreed priorities. That would be a huge step forward.</p>

	<p pid=".486.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point, but that money in Ireland came from the cohesion fund, not the objective 1 programme, and the rules of the cohesion fund are fundamentally different. They are specifically designed to help the development of infrastructure; objective 1 funding is not. Looking to the future, we want the greatest flexibility for the Welsh Assembly Government to use money from whatever source in the best possible way. What the Government are proposing would not short-change Wales; it would ensure that it had resources to spend as it knew best, and for that reason there is a lot to commend in the Government's proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".486.1/2">In conclusion, the issue is, as we have said, vital and complex. We need to recognise that everyone in Wales is concerned about getting the best possible deal for Wales, but I would appeal to the Plaid Cymru Members not to make cheap party political points on the issue: it is far too serious. Let us have a reasonable, constructive and sensible debate on the best way forward. If we do that, I am quite confident that Members will agree that there is much to be said for the Government's proposals.</p>

At the Berlin summit, we were told, the Prime Minister spent all night arguing and I have no doubt that he spoke the truth every single time he argued. Labour Members said, &quot;We have the panacea&quot;. Yes, a huge amount of money was coming in, and by and large it has done a lot of good work. That is common ground between us all; it has to be. What is not, however, is what will happen if this proposed cut is made. What will happen to Wales? We will lose any cohesion policy, research and development money and objective 1 money.</p>

The hon. Gentleman seems to want to laugh about the issue. We have been suffering from under-investment at the rate of about &pound;401 million per year in cover from the public expenditure survey and additional matched funding. That is a fact. We have been saying it for years, and it was eventually confirmed. The late Professor Phil Williams put it on the map in the Assembly.</p>

Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David)</phrase> said. I have no doubt that the hon. Gentleman is absolutely committed to what he said. I think that he is wrong-headed, but I accept his good faith. He cannot say whether there will be a cut, because, unless the Minister gives one today, we do not have a guarantee about the sum that would be available under any Treasury policy. As Treasury policy is not necessarily linked to match funding or additionality, we do not know whether additional resources will be available. Those are questions to which we must have answers before we can give a response to the proposal that the hon. Member for Caerphilly asked us to support. Without the facts, we cannot support that proposal.</p>

	<p pid=".488.5/1">The point, surely, is that funding is guaranteed for six years under EU rules, whereas it cannot be guaranteed for that long under Treasury rules&mdash;it can be guaranteed for three years or, possibly, for the length of a Parliament. However sincerely given, the promise is not bankable in European terms, which is another problem.</p>
	<p pid=".488.5/2">The other thing that concerns me is that if the scheme is going to be replaced&mdash;repatriated&mdash;by a Treasury scheme, then, considering past performance, I sincerely believe that there will be cuts. I also believe that the scheme will be at risk of being politicised and subject to the priorities of Government. I have no doubt that areas of Wales will suffer further because of those political priorities. I also have no doubt that it will, in due course, create more social exclusion in Wales, whether in the south Wales valleys or in the more rural areas. I am extremely concerned about that. None of us wants it to happen; we are sounding the alarm. As I said, we sounded the alarm that the PES cover and additional funding were insufficient. Under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, we have been proved right.</p>

	<p pid=".489.3/1">I came here with a pinched nerve, but, because I have jumped up and down so many times, it seems to have gone. At least some good has come from the debate.</p>
	<p pid=".489.3/2">In case anyone gets the impression that we are just whinging or being alarmist, I will make a few points. I for one am not proud that GDP remains what it is in Wales. We have argued about the EUROSTAT figures. The important point is that we accept those figures, and they are the figures that will be used for a decision in the coming months. That is an important point. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/842" name="Wayne David">The hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David)</phrase> mentioned the thousands of jobs that had been created by objective 1 in west Wales and the valleys. I do not suppose that that takes into account the thousands of jobs being done away with by his Government, who are closing down benefits offices and creating further social exclusion. I do not know the exact areas that we are talking about. If employment were such a priority, there would have been some read-across from those cuts.</p>
	<p pid=".489.3/3">We are not prepared to leave matters to the vagaries of any promise that might be forthcoming from the Treasury. I do not impugn the sincerity or honesty of the hon. Gentleman, but Treasury mandarins are people who are faceless and who do not always stick to a given set of rules. They are masters of their universe. We are unhappy about that. At least when we flushed out what was happening under the Conservative Government&mdash;money was coming to London and stopping there&mdash;our party leader Dafydd Wigley went to Brussels. I have no doubt that the hon. Gentleman would have supported what Dafydd Wigley said. The money was getting stuck in the Treasury in London. That is why I do not trust any bankable agreement from the Treasury. It is not worth the paper that it is written on. That is my concern.</p>
	<p pid=".489.3/4">The European Union was given clearly defined objectives. After three years of faltering, due to the Welsh Assembly Government, things in Wales eventually began to move. That did not happen soon enough; hence the position that we are in. Labour was, of course, then in coalition with the Liberal Democrats. We want to press for a further tranche of money to come direct from Europe. That money would not be subject to political interference. It would not be diverted because of spending that should, in any event, have been core spending.</p>

He will undoubtedly wish those benefits to continue, but he seems to be completely happy for the Treasury to promise that those substantial amounts will come through directly in regional policy. Regional policy in Wales has, unfortunately, been lacking for decades. That is why we are in this awful hole.</p>

	<p pid=".490.4/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1279" name="Simon Thomas">the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas)</phrase> on obtaining the debate. It is vital that we take the opportunity to discuss regional funding and support for Wales and, indeed, other peripheral parts of the United Kingdom in good time, so that we have some influence on the discussions and decisions made about those important issues.</p>
	<p pid=".490.4/2">Historically, the more distant parts of the United Kingdom have suffered because the market has not functioned as well in those regions as it has in the south-eastern areas of both the UK and Wales. For a long time, the people who lived there have survived on lower incomes, had a poorer quality of life and have not had the opportunity to take part in the thriving economies that have sometimes occurred in other parts of the UK. It was not until we obtained structural funds from the EU that we had the certainty of a continuation of support for a number of years. That enabled people to put together a considered programme rather than one-off and ad hoc projects that various Governments of various persuasions sometimes dished out for the poorer areas of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".490.4/3">I return to objective 5b funding for rural areas. That was particularly effective in dealing with our systems. Although objective 1 funding did not come to the area of Wales that I represent, and we were concerned about that, we were happy that west Wales and the valleys benefited from it. Some of us would have said that Powys should have been included in the objective 1 area. If some of the statistical criteria had been considered more closely, I think that Powys would have qualified, on the basis that its GDP was below the 75 per cent. figure. For some peculiar technical reason, the European Union said that there could be only two NUTS areas in Wales. Including Powys would have meant three NUTS areas and that was apparently unacceptable to whoever was setting up the rules. I felt that, in a way, the competition to achieve objective 1 status was slightly belittling to Wales, in the sense that areas had to portray themselves as a poor and unsuccessful part of the United Kingdom. At one time, I compared it to an ugly competition. We had to parade up and down in front of people and say how unsuccessful we had been in the economy and that we were in desperate need of support.</p>

	<p pid=".491.3/1">Be that as it may, Wales and, certainly, west Wales and the valleys have benefited from objective 1. That is obvious from all the statistics and criteria. Indeed, one can see that structural funding has been very successful in other nations in the EU&mdash;for example, in Ireland. Even the Irish would say, however, that it is not just structural funds that have contributed to the success of their economy. They also look to investment in education and in training. Although structural funds can contribute to that, we need to put more money into education and training as well as to looking for regional support via structural funds.</p>
	<p pid=".491.3/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/842" name="Wayne David">The hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David)</phrase> said that money from Brussels was no different to money from London. Yes, &pound;1 from Brussels is the same as &pound;1 from London. However, what is important are the conditions that are attached to that flow of money. Everybody involved in the programme committees that were set up for the introduction of objective 1 were very frustrated by the bureaucratic requirements that had to be put in place&mdash;there had to be equal men and women, and equal representatives from the public, private and voluntary sectors&mdash;and it seemed that setting up the committees was more important than delivering the programmes. Some of that has been addressed, and I know, having talked to people in the private sector, that they feel more involved than at the beginning of the process.</p>
	<p pid=".491.3/3">Having said that, the questions are: what are the Government going to do, and what commitments will they make on the issues? Although we can judge what the benefits and disadvantages of money coming from London or Europe will be, we need to know what the level of funding will be, and what commitments the Government can make. The issue that has been mentioned many times by hon. Members speaking for Plaid Cymru is that, whereas the objective and structural funds can be guaranteed over seven years and two years' transition in future, it seems highly unlikely that the Government are going to give any commitment at all above and beyond a three-year period or a Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".491.3/4">There is also the question of match funding. I can go back a long time to when the Conservative party was in power, and some applications for European funding and support were not accompanied by additional funds&mdash;the additionality that should be required. The British Government were taken to task a number of times for that. Commissioner Bruce Millan sorted that out, and I am sure that he did a good job in ensuring that European support was never allowed to be given without such additionality.</p>
	<p pid=".491.3/5">All in all, Liberal Democrats believe that structural funding would be the best way to address the problems of Wales and other peripheral areas such as Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. My colleagues in the Welsh Assembly say that not only should local government in Wales support the issue, but the Assembly should too. We see more benefits flowing from support and commitment over a long period of time coming from Europe, rather than the relatively short-term commitments that the Government can make, whatever they may be. For that reason, we support the maintenance of structural funds, either objective 1 or the cohesion fund.</p>

	<p pid=".492.0/1">I should like to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1279" name="Simon Thomas">the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas)</phrase> on securing the debate, and on the way in which he proposed it, ably supported by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1053" name="Elfyn Llwyd">his party leader, the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)</phrase>. I have always admired Plaid Cymru for their gutsiness in taking on this Government and standing up for rural communities in Wales, and how they have often made common cause with other rural MPs in supporting countryside issues. They have, on a number of occasions, been supportive of some of the campaigns that I have run, and I congratulate them on that. The hon. Member for Ceredigion was quite right when he said that the matter goes to the heart of regional policy.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/2">The Opposition support the Government when they say that they are keen to see a reduction in the maximum size of the EU budget from 1.24 per cent. of gross EU income to 1 per cent. We support that because we agree with the Governments of France, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and Austria, who wrote to Romano Prodi in December 2003, making the point that a 1 per cent. limit would still allow for annual increases in the EU budget above the growth rates of national budgets in most member states. That is a key point.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/3">One should also bear in mind&mdash;perhaps the Minister will comment on this&mdash;that there has been substantial fraud in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/870" name="Gwyneth Dunwoody">the EU budget system. The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody)</phrase> recently highlighted the fact that for nine successive years&mdash;this will be the 10th year&mdash;the European Court of Auditors has refused to sign off the EU accounts. A lot of money is washing around, having gone missing.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/4">We also support what the Government have said about the Lisbon agenda, although we should like a clearer and more focused policy on aid. On structural funds, we understand where the Government are coming from. We are concerned about the amount of bureaucracy and the lack of clear focus in how some of the funds are managed. I shall come to some of the points made by Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats, but we feel that national control over those funds would enable us to target them better, at the areas that need them most.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/5">I repeat what my MEP colleague, Philip Bradbourne, said in the European Parliament recently:</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/6" class="indent">&quot;It is no surprise to me that the funds have yet again not been signed off.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/7" class="indent">With ten years of dodgy accounts, including &euro;5.3 billion going unused into Commission coffers from the Regional Aid Budget in one year, devolving grant aid back to Member States seems the only viable solution to an ongoing problem.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/8" class="indent">This would allow British Ministers to properly determine where and how this money is spent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/9">I sympathise in many ways with the hon. Member for Ceredigion, because our instinct is to support the idea of Her Majesty's Government having more control. I take on board his points, and I hope that the Minister will clarify exactly what the Government's position is, and perhaps give us some comfort that if the funds are repatriated, the same amount of money will be spent. One of the most pertinent and telling points that the hon. Gentleman made was that the Government currently have a much shorter time scale. Normally, we are talking about funding for a three-year fiscal period, possibly one Parliament, and a maximum of four years, as Parliaments tend to develop. If there is a much closer result in six or seven weeks' time, there could be another election two or three years after that. Let us not speculate too far, but the bottom line is that the EU can take a longer-term view and deliver more stability and commitment over a longer period. Can the Minister comment on that? That is the main argument against the Government's position, which is to some extent supported by my party.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/10">I take on board the points that the hon. Gentleman made, supported by his party leader, regarding the problems that Wales faces. The former mining valleys in south Wales have not had the opportunities or the momentum to regenerate and deliver new jobs in the same way as places such as south Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire have done. Those of us who attend the main Chamber regularly often hear <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1229" name="Dennis Skinner">the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner)</phrase> boasting about the number of extra jobs being created outside the coal industry and the amount of regeneration that has taken place in his constituency. That has not happened in the Welsh valleys, and there is obviously a good reason for that. If the Minister knows what that reason is, will he comment on it?</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/11">I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman when he talks about some areas of Wales being left behind. In Norfolk&mdash;not far from my constituency, and in that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1339" name="Anthony D Wright">the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase>&mdash;there are some of the poorest wards in the country, where, without EU funding, there would be really serious problems. I must declare an interest because my constituency has received objective 5b status funding that has made a significant difference. The Minister must satisfy the Plaid Cymru Members that the Government can deliver the money and make up any deficit.</p>
	<p pid=".492.0/12">I shall make one final point so that the Minister will have 20 minutes in which to wind up. One of the key points that goes to the nub of the subject is the rebate. I listened to what the Chancellor said the other day: he said that the rebate is fully justified. He made that clear in Berlin when the last EU budget was fixed, and that continues to be the British position. There have been worrying reports that the Government have secured a deal with EU leaders to postpone negotiations on the rebate until after the general election. Is that the case? The relationship between the repatriation of structural funds and the debate is absolutely crucial. I hope that the Minister will be able to answer that point, and the other points that have been ably and succinctly put by the hon. Member for Ceredigion and his colleague.</p>

	<p pid=".494.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1279" name="Simon Thomas">the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas)</phrase> on securing the debate. I am genuinely grateful for the opportunity to explain the Government's proposals for future EU structural and cohesion policy after 2006. It has been an interesting and often passionate debate, and I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/842" name="Wayne David">my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David)</phrase>, who added some important perspective to the hon. Gentleman's remarks , both on the strengthening of the Welsh economy in recent years and the reality of the proposals under discussion.</p>
	<p pid=".494.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1053" name="Elfyn Llwyd">The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)</phrase> made a characteristically understated speech, if I may say so, some of which I shall endeavour to respond to. I shall be happy to address the points that he raised. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1324" name="Roger Williams">The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> wisely acknowledged, as he put it, that &pound;1 from London is worth as much as &pound;1 from Brussels, and he went on to acknowledge the streamlining of European funds that has taken place in recent years.</p>
	<p pid=".494.0/3">I am grateful for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/726" name="Henry Bellingham">the support of the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham)</phrase> for our approach to the Lisbon agenda. On the specific issue of the rebate, with which he concluded, it will be no surprise that I can assure him that the position remains as stated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and that work continues on the rebate and the wider issue of the financial perspective. As the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, other parties are privy to those discussions.</p>
	<p pid=".494.0/4">I assure the House that the Government are committed to a strong regional policy that is at the heart of our efforts to achieve high and stable levels of growth and employment, ensuring that economic prosperity reaches every part of the United Kingdom. We have significantly increased spending on regional policy across the UK, focusing resources on drivers of productivity such as skills, infrastructure, enterprise and new technology.</p>
	<p pid=".494.0/5">As a consequence of devolution in Wales, the Welsh Assembly Government are driving forward their programme for regional development, and are currently driving forward the &quot;Winning Wales&quot; strategy to provide an over-arching framework for Wales's continued regeneration. The Welsh Assembly Government are providing significant match funding for Wales's current structural fund programmes. As we have heard, Wales has benefited from a unique funding arrangement with the UK Government, &quot;Barnett Plus&quot;, to support the programmes. In the spending reviews of 2002 and 2004, the Welsh Assembly Government were allocated an extra &pound;106 million for 2005&ndash;06, an extra &pound;128 million for 2006&ndash;07 and an extra &pound;147 million for 2007&ndash;08, in addition to the block grant under the Barnett formula in order to provide match funding for its objective 1 programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".494.0/6">I accept that the structural funds have played an important role in supporting valuable initiatives in recent years in Wales and other parts of the United Kingdom. However, domestic spending&mdash;national programmes and co-financing for structural funds projects&mdash;plays an increasingly important role in regional development. I would add to that a personal perspective from my constituency: there should be recognition that although real expertise has developed, not least within local government, and a capacity to deal with Brussels, that expertise all too often reflects a mindset that developed during the time of the previous Government, when many of us looked to Brussels hoping for regional support when Whitehall and Westminster were providing very little such support.</p>
	<p pid=".494.0/7">There is an opportunity now, not least given the significant uplift in regional expenditure being made by this Government, to develop our thinking on regional funding. It is essential to understand that three quarters of public spending on regional development in the UK already comes from domestic sources, and we must recognise that in any scenario that proportion is set to increase in the near future. The enlargement of the European Union and the entry of 10 poorer countries means that EU regional funding will, inevitably and rightly, shift to the new member states, and the richer countries such as the UK will increasingly depend on national resources to fund their regional development. This new situation calls for a fundamental reappraisal of the EU's regional policy. We are determined to push for effective reform of the structural and cohesion funds that delivers a good result for the UK and its nations and regions, as well as for the other member states and the EU as a whole.</p>
	<p pid=".494.0/8">On timing, the current regulations governing the structural and cohesion funds will expire at the end of 2006. Negotiations on the future of the structural and cohesion funds began in September 2004 and are continuing under the Luxembourg presidency.</p>
	<p pid=".494.0/9">Let me set out the Government's objectives for structural funds reform. The UK has five main objectives for reform of the funds, which were set out by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in two statements to Parliament in September and December 2003. First, we want to develop an EU regional policy that fully supports, and adds value to, the ambitious devolution, decentralisation and regional development agenda already being pursued domestically. Secondly, we wish to ensure that the structural funds actively support the EU's agenda, set at Lisbon, Gothenburg and elsewhere, for higher productivity, employment and sustainable development. Thirdly, we wish to concentrate the EU's necessarily limited financial and administrative resources on the poorest member states, which are most in need of assistance. Fourthly, we want to develop simpler and more flexible implementation and monitoring arrangements for structural funds programmes, which are proportionate to the amount of funding available. Finally, we are determined to secure a fair budgetary deal for the UK taxpayer and a total EU budget of no more than 1 per cent. of EU gross national income.</p>
	<p pid=".494.0/10">The Government have put forward detailed reform proposals as a means of securing those objectives. We have proposed that richer member states should, in future, fund regional programmes from domestic sources, and that the EU's limited resources should be focused on the poorest member states, where EU intervention is likely to have the greatest impact and value. That would introduce genuine EU solidarity and help to ensure that the enlargement of the EU to 25 members is recognised as a success. However, for clarification, I want to point out that the Government are not advocating that regional policy should be renationalised in the richer member states. On the contrary, we believe that there should continue to be EU-wide co-ordination of regional policy in all member states, so that we continue to work towards shared goals across the Union.</p>

	<p pid=".496.0/1">I would be interested to hear the Minister elaborate on that point. He said that one of the Government's objectives was to give support to the poorest European states. We understand the thinking behind that, but that member state-led approach can ignore the real regional disparities that exist even in richer member states. Germany springs to mind as an example. West Wales and the valleys is poorer than Slovenia, yet his proposals would divert funds to Slovenia but not necessarily to west Wales and valleys. He needs to say a little more about what European perspective can be brought to bear to ensure that member states do not get away with not delivering internal regional equality. If he does not do that, people will lose faith in the European ideal.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-09.496.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/693" speakername="Douglas Alexander" colnum="496"  time="15:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050309/halltext/50309h03.htm#50309h03_spnew60">
	<p pid=".496.1/1">I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's analysis, but no sympathy with his prescription. Of course it is a factual reality that there can be regions even in richer member states that continue to suffer deprivation and poverty. That is why, for example, the UK has such an active regional policy, which we have pursued with such vigour over recent years.</p>
	<p pid=".496.1/2">On the relationship between the role of member states and the role of the EU, let me offer a few more words by way of clarification. We have put forward proposals for an EU framework for regional policy whereby all member states would agree to a set of high-level, outcome-focused objectives for regional policy, which support the achievement of the Lisbon and Gothenburg agendas. According to our approach, member states would continue to share best practice and monitor progress through a process of peer review.</p>
	<p pid=".496.1/3">At the same time, however, we remain fully aware of the challenges faced by regions in the UK, particularly those with current objective 1 status&mdash;as we have been discussing&mdash;and we are determined to support their continued economic development. It is for that reason that we have made an unprecedented guarantee&mdash;if our reform proposals are accepted&mdash;to increase domestic funding for regional policy in the UK. If our proposals are accepted, we have undertaken to increase the domestic funding for regional policy by the amount that our regions would have received under a no-reform scenario in an enlarged EU. Of course, such a guarantee would not be possible if there was a major expansion in the structural funds budget. As was pointed out, any expansion would inevitably come at a cost to the UK taxpayer, leaving less money for national spending. That is why it is in all our interests to secure a fair budgetary deal for the UK as a whole.</p>
	<p pid=".496.1/4">The Government set out their detailed methodology for applying the guarantee in their written statement to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-11">11 December 2003</phrase>. If our reform proposals were accepted, we would increase the domestic resources available for regional policy by the amount that our regions would have received under the current arrangements for allocating structural funds, were they applied under a no-reform scenario to an EU of 25 member states. In order to calculate the value of the guarantee, it will be necessary to know data such as the gross domestic product and employment statistics for the whole EU for the most recent three years available prior to the start of the next programme period in 2007. It is unlikely that the most recent data will be for 2001 to 2003. That information will not be available until the end of 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".496.1/5">The Commission's proposals for reform of the funds have set much of the context for the debate. The proposals were set out in its third cohesion report in February 2004 and in a package of draft structural and cohesion funds regulations for the next European Community financial perspective, published in July 2004. The Commission proposes to focus the expanded budget on three new priorities: a convergence objective, which, like the current objective 1, would be allocated to regions with a GDP below 75 per cent. of the EU average; a regional competitiveness and employment objective, to foster competitiveness and support labour market programmes in richer regions; and a European territorial co-operation objective, which would replace the current Interreg initiative to promote transnational and cross-border co-operation projects.</p>
	<p pid=".496.1/6">The Government have welcomed aspects of the Commission's approach, including its proposals, on the Lisbon and Gothenburg agendas, to strengthen the strategic focus of EU regional policy. However, we have serious concerns regarding aspects of the Commission's approach. First, it is dependent on an unaffordable expansion of the EU budget. The Commission is advocating a major&mdash;indeed, 33 per cent.&mdash;real-terms increase in the structural funds budget from &euro;257 billion in the current cycle to &euro;374 billion for the next EU financial perspective. Its proposals would require a significant increase in the contributions made by member states to the EU budget at a time when Governments are required to demonstrate budget discipline.</p>
	<p pid=".496.1/7">Secondly, the Commission's proposals fail to focus the EU's limited resources on its key priority of the economic development of the poorest member states. As was acknowledged, its proposals would lead to a 50:50 split of funding between old and new members and to the continued, wasteful recycling of resources between net contributors to the EU budget. Thirdly, the Commission's proposals do not go far enough to simplify the bureaucratic arrangements for implementing programmes or to give member states, their nations and their regions greater flexibility to deliver programmes that genuinely reflect local needs.</p>
	<p pid=".496.1/8">So, what would be the impact for Wales? It has been suggested today that the Commission's expansionist budgetary proposals may hold some attractions for some Welsh stakeholders. However, as I hope to explain, the Commission's proposals would offer a poor deal for Wales and no security for our poorer Welsh regions. By contrast, the Government's approach offers a genuine guarantee of continued funding for Wales and a fair deal for Welsh taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid=".496.1/9">First, it is important to understand that the Commission's proposals in no way constitute a credible offer of funding for the UK's regions. Net contributors to the EU budget, such as France, Germany, Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands, are firmly opposed to the Commission's budgetary proposals and share the Government's determination to maintain a total EU budget of 1 per cent. of EU gross national income. The Commission's proposals simply promise money from a pot that does not exist and which will not be agreed by member states.</p>
	<p pid=".496.1/10">Secondly, it is essential to remember that the UK is a net contributor to the EU budget and that all receipts from the EU will come at a cost to the UK taxpayer. This is not free money. We currently contribute about &euro;1.60 for each euro that we receive. In order to continue to receive substantial structural fund receipts following enlargement, the UK will inevitably have to make much greater contributions to the EU budget, leaving less money available for domestic spending on regional policy in Wales and across the whole the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".496.1/11">As a result, increased contributions to the EU budget would reduce the amount of money that Wales receives in the form of a block grant under Barnett for regional spending and other domestic spending. In contrast with the Commission's proposals, the Government's guarantee represents a firm commitment, if our approach to reform is adopted, to increase resources for regional policy in the UK for the whole of the next structural funds cycle. We therefore believe that the guarantee offers far more certainty for Welsh regions than the Commission's unrealistic and unsustainable proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".496.1/12">The structural funds currently constitute only a small fraction of total expenditure on regional policy in the richer member states. Structural funds account for only one quarter of expenditure on regional policy in the UK and will, under any reform scenario, represent an even smaller fraction of total expenditure in the future. It is therefore far more important for the Welsh regions that the Government should achieve a fair budgetary deal for the UK, based on a disciplined and sustainable EU budget, than that continued structural funds receipts should be secured in the next financial perspective on the basis of a budget that we do not regard as being a credible way forward.</p>

	<p pid=".499.0/1">Does the Minister not see that, for many people in Wales, the difficulty with his proposals is that he has set out an approach that does not inform the people in west Wales and the valleys how much money they can expect from the Treasury until at least the end of 2005, if not later? The suspicion must be that the Government are hanging on for favourable statistics before they can make their promise and commitment. In the meantime, there are proposals on the board from the Commission. He has described them as unrealistic, but they are supported by other member states. Can he not see the difficulty that his Government will be in this year in trying to advocate a policy that he cannot put a figure to? Until a figure is available, people will be deeply suspicious of what the Government are setting out to achieve.</p>

	<p pid=".499.1/1">The hon. Gentleman raises a number of points; let me endeavour to answer them. First, on the timing in relation to the Government's position, as I sought to reflect in my remarks, the terms of the guarantee were offered in a written statement to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-11">11 December 2003</phrase>. In that sense, it does not strengthen his argument to suggest that we are doing things on the basis of figures that may emerge in due course. On the substantive point that he raises, I would have more sympathy were the Commission in a position to give the exact cash figure that, under its proposals, would be achieved in Wales, or any other area that presently qualifies for funding, on the basis of the future financial perspective. However, nobody is in a position to give such an undertaking on the basis of negotiations that are presently under way. Simultaneous negotiations are taking place both on structural funds and support for them, and on the wider issue of the financial perspective.</p>
	<p pid=".499.1/2">It diminishes rather than enhances the hon. Gentleman's argument to suggest that somehow the British Treasury is at odds with the EU. It raises the question of whether there is a political motive for questioning the commitment of the British Government and at the same time upholding the integrity of the EU. That is a debate that I have had on many occasions with Scottish nationalists. It seems curious to be determined to prove the efficacy and success of a wider political union, but unwilling to accept the important contribution that the British Union makes to the livelihood and well-being of people in Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".499.1/3">I conclude by underlining again the Government's commitment to tackle persistent regional disparities in the UK. We accept that poverty still scars Wales, Scotland and other regions and nations in the UK. Perhaps the difference between the Welsh nationalists and the Government is that they still regard the English border as what is scarring Wales, whereas we see the challenge of addressing issues such as child and pensioner poverty. We are convinced that our reform proposals would ensure the best deal for the UK's nations and regions, while setting EU regional policy on a sustainable footing and ensuring genuine solidarity between member states.</p>

	Farming (Lewes)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-09.501.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/710" speakername="Norman Baker" colnum="501"  time="15:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050309/halltext/50309h04.htm#50309h04_spnew0">
	<p pid=".501.1/1">I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise a matter that is important for my constituency. Mine is a rural constituency that stretches from the coast up to the borders of Haywards Heath and Uckfield, and it covers a wide area. The number of farmers may be relatively small compared with the rest of the population, but what they do is important&mdash;beyond their numbers&mdash;in social, environmental and economic terms. In fact, according to the Library, they comprise 6.3 per cent. of my constituents, including spouses and partners.</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/2">There is uncertainty among local farmers about what the future holds for farming generally and for them in particular. That is not simply driven by the faster speed of life and the changes that are coming to the common agricultural policy. It is also about what strategic role the Government have in mind for farmers and farming in the 10, 20, 30 and 40-year scenario. Is it the Government's view that there should be a move towards self-sufficiency in food production or, at the other extreme, do they think that it does not matter whether we produce food, because world trade will take care of us? What is their view on that strategic matter?</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/3">For what it is worth, my view is that, in this uncertain world, we do not know where we will be in 20, let alone in 50, years' time. It would therefore be prudent for us to be more self-sufficient in food and energy than we currently are, in order to ensure that we are able to cope with potentially unstable geopolitical situations in the longer term. I am interested to hear the Minister's comments on that. We certainly do not want farmland to be transformed into housing estates and golf courses in such a way that any withdrawal of agricultural land cannot be undone in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/4">As for what the Government and the European Union are doing, I welcome the move towards a single farm payment. That is a sensible innovation, and I hope that it will be useful for farmers and for the environment. However, it is important to make the point that, for that system to work, there needs to be prompt payment to farmers. The Minister will be aware that there have been complaints over the years&mdash;indeed, I have written to him myself on some occasions&mdash;about the performance of the Rural Payments Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/5">If we are to get ownership of the single farm payment from the farming community, it is important that there are prompt payments. That means that payments should be made in December, rather than in January or February as is presently suggested. Will the Minister consider an arrangement for the historic element of the single payment scheme to be paid as an advance payment? Have the Government examined that and is he able to say something positive on it?</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/6">I also welcome the environmental stewardship scheme, which, again, is useful in providing both some sort of continuity for farmers and continuity of income. The only criticism I have is that the paperwork, particularly for the entry-level scheme, seems to be enormous. I spoke to some farmers this morning and they told me that they were concerned that they had to fill out lots of forms in order to qualify. In their view, that was a deterrent, although they will probably go along with the scheme. Of course, the Minister must be rigorous, to ensure that there is no fraud and to ensure that all the necessary points are covered. However, there is always a balance between proper rigorous control and not overburdening people with paperwork. I hope that he will bear that in mind as the scheme unfolds.</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/7">I want to discuss another important point. To prepare myself for this debate, I spoke to a range of farmers in my constituency. It is strange how many of them came up with the same points. That suggests that the points that I am making today are of general concern in my constituency and, perhaps, beyond.</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/8">One such point, which the Minister will be familiar with, is the uneven relationship that exists between the farming community&mdash;the suppliers&mdash;and the purchasers of their goods, particularly the supermarkets. That uneven relationship means that while the price paid to farmers for their produce has stagnated or fallen, supermarket profits have rocketed. For example, he will know that the price of a litre of milk in my part of the world was about 25p a litre in 1996 and it is now down at about 18.9p a litre&mdash;and that represents a marginal increase in the past year or so. That price is way below the price of almost 10 years ago. That is clearly not an economic situation that can be sustained indefinitely.</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/9">Let us consider the finished cattle prices situation. The Minister might know that in 1993, there was an average price of 128p a kilogram, which decreased to 90p a kilogram in 2002. As for the relationship between the suppliers and the supermarkets, there is, in my view at least, a damning statistic. In terms of finished cattle prices&mdash;the farm-gate prices&mdash;in 1988, 67 per cent. of the retail price was related to the producer. That percentage had dropped to 47 per cent. in 2003, which meant a further squeeze on producers and more profits for the supermarkets.</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/10">Of course, no one is against profits. We all adhere to a capitalist society these days. However, it is worth pointing out that Tesco is scheduled to make &pound;2 billion this year and it will make a profit of some &pound;115,000 in the time taken by this short half-hour debate. In other words, it will probably make more profit in five minutes than some of my farmers will make in an entire year. That is a rather uneven relationship&mdash;one that the Government ought to correct.</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/11">The Minister will be aware that the Office of Fair Trading has been involved in this matter and that it concluded the last time it considered the matter in a rather peculiar manner that, although there was a problem, the OFT was going to do nothing about it. It has now done some further work, as he will know. Perhaps he will enlighten me on that in his response. Part of the work involved obtaining information from supermarkets by conducting a focused compliance audit of each of the four supermarkets, dealing with suppliers.</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/12">I welcome that approach, because clearly no one will complain directly about the supermarkets&mdash;not because there is not a problem, but because they are frightened of being squeezed out if they do so. They think that they will be picked on if they make a complaint. It is therefore important that an independent rigorous way of analysing the trade between supermarkets and suppliers exists, to pick up what most people think is going on, which is that supermarkets are exploiting their suppliers, particularly the farmers. I hope that the Minister will be able to say something positive about that. I wonder whether he has considered the idea of either a food trade inspector in the OFT, which my party supports, or a buyers' charter, which the National Farmers Union has put forward as an alternative.</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/13">The consequence of the uneven relationship is that some farmers wonder why they are in the business at all. They look at the money that they are earning and what they are paying their employees and they see that they are not able to provide money for re-investment and they do not feel that they are getting a fair wage. One tenant farmer said to me this morning that he may as well hand back his land to the landowner. That is a sad state of affairs.</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/14">We want our tenant farmers to survive and we want a diversity of farmers in this country, rather than a decreasing number of ever-bigger farmers. That is the way to help social cohesion as well as to provide diversity in the agricultural sector. Does the Minister agree that we should not necessarily welcome the move towards fewer and fewer farms and fewer and fewer owners?</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/15">As for local matters, which follow on from that point, we must try to protect the local infrastructure, so far as we can, and we must also ensure that it is expanded wherever possible. There used to be a number of abattoirs in my constituency, but they have all closed. It is a long way to go to the abattoir in Guildford or the one in Broad Oak from my constituency. The ones in Wivelsfield and Ringmer have closed.</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/16">Consequently, animals are now being taken further to slaughter, which is bad, for animal welfare reasons. It is bad for the farmer for economic reasons and bad for the environment generally because it causes extra lorry journeys. The closure of small abattoirs and the need to travel further to have animals slaughtered has no benefit. What are the Government doing to encourage smaller abattoirs to open to serve local needs? The situation in this country is vastly different from that in France, where there tends to be an abattoir in each local area. Farmers are far more connected in that way to their local market.</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/17">The Minister will know the controversy that there has been over the possible closure of Hailsham market, which is a cattle market that serves my constituents, although it is based in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/955" name="Charles Hendry">the constituency of the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry)</phrase>. That market has had a sword hanging over its head. It is important that it survives, for the same reasons that I think local abattoirs should survive.</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/18">Local suppliers are important in other ways as well. A farmers' market takes place on the first Saturday of the month in the pedestrianised precinct in Lewes. It is tremendously popular and hugely successful. People like to have local markets and they like to buy local produce. They support such efforts in vast numbers and they are disappointed when they go to their supermarkets and find that they can buy one or two varieties of apples only, as opposed to the vast number of varieties that there used to be when there were greengrocer shops. Some of the varieties have come from France and elsewhere. Why is it not possible for supermarkets to have far more local produce? Why do none of the supermarkets in my constituency have a Sussex food counter? What is the Minister doing to encourage the retail trade to buy more products locally and to support local producers far more than it has done?</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/19">One consequence of not supporting local producers is that supermarkets ratchet up huge amounts of lorry miles transporting food hither and thither across the world. The supermarkets in our country alone accrue 670 million miles in lorry movements every day; that is the equivalent of two return trips to the moon. That statistic comes from data from the supermarkets themselves; I secured the information from them, and it is included in a report on supermarkets that is on my website. That is a gigantic amount of travel; it is unsustainable in environmental terms, as well as being undermining of local supply and produce.</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/20">It would be helpful if the country-of-origin labelling rules were tighter, so that people who want to buy British food can do so. Will the Minister look into that? Can things that are imported and then packaged in this country properly be described as British? I understand that that sometimes happens.</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/21">All the farmers I spoke to raised the matter of tuberculosis in cattle. It is a serious issue, particularly in my constituency and the Sussex area. One farmer who wanted to be identified&mdash;his name is Paul Collinson&mdash;tells me that he has a closed pedigree herd, but there are always TB cases in it so he cannot sell his pedigree cattle, expect to the Minister's Department. Testing takes two days, which slows matters down, as well as having a cost. He says that the Department no longer tests badgers, as it used to do some years ago. He also questions what the policy should be on the removal of roadside badgers. He tells me that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food&mdash;as the Minister's Department was then known&mdash;had a policy of removing such badgers until 1991, but that now, in Sussex at least, that is left to the farmers themselves to deal with, which is an extra cost to them. I do not know whether that is true, but perhaps the Minister can enlighten me?</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/22">There seems to be a proven link between TB in badgers and TB in cattle&mdash;I should point out at this point that I am my party's animal welfare spokesman. Does the Minister accept that that link is now established? We have been testing for a long time&mdash;we have had the Krebs report and other investigations&mdash;but nothing much seems to happen. What are the Government going to do to deal with TB in cattle? There are three possible ways forward; either the Minister must find a proper vaccine for cattle, which is my preferred solution if it can be achieved, or he must introduce a badger cull, which the farmers believe is necessary&mdash;although many people would be uncomfortable with that&mdash;or he must introduce compensation payments to recognise the fact that the Government are not solving the problem and that farmers are significantly out of pocket. Please will the Minister tell us what is the Government's policy on TB in cattle, with particular reference to my constituency, as my farmers would welcome hearing that?</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/23">I turn to a few small environmental matters that affect farmers. The Minister will be aware that new regulations will be introduced to deal with farm waste. As an environmentalist, I support the idea of ensuring that we deal with our waste properly, but can the Minister assure me that he has thought through the consequences of the regulations in relation to farm plastics? Will he ensure that there is a system in place to deal with farm plastics, including a national collection system, before the regulations come into force? We do not want a repeat of the fallen stock fiasco, which occurred when regulations and a system were in place. Will those regulations be in place? Will the National Farmers Union and others be properly consulted about them?</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/24">There are two further small environmental matters. Biomass has the potential to provide an income for farmers, particularly on set-aside land. I welcome that, and we should offer further encouragement to farmers to go down that road where that is appropriate. However, some of my farmers feel that the Government are not doing enough to promote that. What more will the Government do to promote the take-up of biomass on set-aside land?</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/25">Lastly, the Minister will be aware of an issue I raised in respect of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill. Fly-tipping on farmland&mdash;and, indeed, on private land generally&mdash;is a significant problem. In a letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-03">3 March</phrase>, the Minister's colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment said:</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/26" class="indent">&quot;The current defence of not knowingly caused or permitted will remain to protect innocent victims of fly tipping.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/27">That is true up to a point, but there is still a requirement to remove the material, and I fail to see why farmers should pick up the bill for something that they have not done.</p>
	<p pid=".501.1/28">This has been a run-around-the-houses speech, but these are important matters for the farmers in my constituency. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</p>

	<p pid=".505.0/1">I welcome this opportunity to respond to what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/710" name="Norman Baker">the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase> referred to as a run-around-the-houses speech. I congratulate him not only on securing this debate, but on managing to pack in a whole series questions, each of which would justify a short Adjournment debate on its own. In the last few minutes alone, he referred to biomass and fly-tipping. We have had exchanges on those issues, and I understand that they are important, but the hon. Gentleman has covered so many topics that I doubt that I can do justice to them all. All I can say is that I will write to him after this debate to deal with any topics that I do not have time to address now.</p>
	<p pid=".505.0/2">The hon. Gentleman began by asking a large strategic question about the future of farming. He related that to farmers in his constituency, but in order to answer it one has to look at the wider picture, as, indeed, he invited me to do. The Government's view is that our farmers need to be sustainable in terms of their income and viability for the future and need to be entrepreneurial in order to achieve that. The Government want to support farmers to act effectively as businesses, as many of them already do, instead of looking backwards to the period of subsidy, which led to a dependence culture, rather than an entrepreneurial one.</p>
	<p pid=".505.0/3">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman agrees with the steps that we have taken to work with the industry through the strategy for sustainable food and farming. This year is a year of massive change for the farming industry. It is the first year of applications for the new single payment scheme, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. The new environmental stewardship scheme will also be introduced, as will the whole farm approach, later in the year. Those are three vital building blocks as we move towards creating a sustainable future for farming and for food industries. In 2002&mdash;which is not that long ago, although it sometimes feels like long ago&mdash;we set out our vision for the long-term development of the industry. The theme of reconnection runs through that vision; reconnecting farming with the enhancement and protection of the environment, and reconnecting farmers with both their markets and the needs of society through higher animal health and welfare standards and higher food safety standards. It is an approach that has sustainability and sustainable development at its core.</p>
	<p pid=".505.0/4">I recognise that change is accompanied by challenges as well as opportunities. Not all farmers will find that transition easy; some farmers will have to change from their traditional approach, or make choices about whether they want to continue in farming. The hon. Gentleman is right to highlight that. However, although some farmers will find it difficult to adapt, creating a market-focused and environmentally and socially responsible industry&mdash;which does things that the public want and that bring public benefit, but which is also market-orientated in terms of producing what the consumer wants&mdash;will offer great rewards for farming and society alike. We must not lose sight of the long-term outcomes that we seek to deliver.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-09.506.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1111" speakername="Alun Michael" colnum="506"  time="16:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050309/halltext/50309h04.htm#50309h04_spnew1">
	<p pid=".506.1/1">I was explaining the way in which change is both challenging and beneficial to the farming industry. It is worth underlining the fact that the groundbreaking deal that we secured on the reform of the common agricultural policy removed the link between production and subsidy for the first time. That decoupling is integral to the vision of reconnection that I referred to earlier and will help to deliver an increase in returns from farming.</p>
	<p pid=".506.1/2">Economists from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estimate that on average farm incomes could rise by about &pound;100 million relative to what would have happened in the absence of a single payment scheme. That represents about 3 per cent. of total income from farming in 2003. Many small farms are also very competitive and are being developed by farmers as effective businesses.</p>
	<p pid=".506.1/3">The hon. Gentleman's suggestion that we should not simply sit back and allow farms to increase in size is understandable, but an increase in size is one way to achieve efficiency and sustainability in parts of the farming industry, although there are alternatives. Diversification is one, and increasing returns to the farm as the primary producer is another.</p>
	<p pid=".506.1/4">I would cite two examples in Sussex. The first is the Sussex Downs Conservation Board, which is working with a number of farmers to produce south downs lamb as part of a range of locally branded products being developed under the south downs landscape enhancement initiative. The project aims to boost the sale of local products and help sustain the south downs habitat, so there is an economic benefit to the farmers and an environmental benefit to the area. We have helped that through the rural enterprise scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".506.1/5">The second example is the Sussex producers consortium, a group of livestock producers working together to process and market their meat and meat products. They have taken a 50 per cent. share in a meat pie making company, ensuring that they get a better share of the retail price and enabling local produce to be sold locally. Those are two examples, and there are many other ways in which farmers can ensure that they get a better return for their work.</p>
	<p pid=".506.1/6">The hon. Member for Lewes welcomed the development of the single payment and referred to the welcome received by the high level stewardship scheme in the last week or two. He asked about prompt payment. It appeared to me that he was talking about early, rather than prompt, payment. The Rural Payments Agency was engaged in a considerable period of change when it was given the task of implementing the CAP reforms. It faces a challenging time, but neither it nor we have underestimated that challenge and we are confident that the RPA will deliver.</p>
	<p pid=".506.1/7">It must be pointed out that the payment window for the single payment scheme is from <phrase class="date" code="">1 December 2005</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">30 June 2006</phrase>. That means that a payment on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-28">28 June</phrase> would not be a late payment. However, that is not what we are aiming for. We are aiming for payment as early as possible within the window, but we need to be realistic. The agency will aim to make as many payments as possible as early as practicable within the time scale. That remains the case. Payments are likely to be made from February 2006 onwards, well within the payment window. In response to the hon. Gentleman's question, we have asked officials to investigate the options for interim payments, and they are due to report back to me shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".506.1/8">The benefit is that as a result of the changes it should be possible to make payments in future years even earlier in the payment window and to give greater certainty to farmers as to when they should expect those payments, because this is the year of transition and great challenge. We have a transitional year in which we want to help farmers to as great an extent that we can, and are investigating ways to do so. We will announce the outcomes of our deliberations as soon as we can. We are working closely with the industry and the representative bodies on those issues.</p>
	<p pid=".506.1/9">The hon. Gentleman also referred to concern about the power of supermarkets. We share that concern. The issue is what one can do to make sure that we achieve a fair outcome without damaging competitiveness. That is why we were keen to encourage the Office of Fair Trading to undertake its review of the operation of the supermarkets' code.</p>
	<p pid=".506.1/10">The hon. Gentleman was right to say that the outcome of the review was disappointing in that it did not point to specific actions. However, that is why the OFT commissioned a focused audit of supermarkets' dealings with suppliers following the review. That is due to be published in the next few weeks, and we should consider its findings and recommendations carefully. I have no doubt that hon. Members such as the hon. Gentleman, who represent seats with a considerable farming element, will want to look at those recommendations and debate them with Ministers as soon as the report becomes available.</p>
	<p pid=".506.1/11">It is also worth pointing out that for the most recent months where figures are available, the price of milk is 19.12p per litre. Despite fears about what would happen, the average farm gate price&mdash;18.56p per litre&mdash;was actually higher in 2004 than 2003. That was the highest since 2001. The University of Manchester report, &quot;Economics of Milk Production, England and Wales, 2002/03&quot;, found that 60 per cent. of milk produced in the UK was produced at a profit, but that that production was by 40 per cent. of dairy farmers. Clearly, there is a huge disparity in the costs of production and profitability. Figures going back further than the past few years show that over a longer period of time the issues of profitability in the milk industry form a pattern that requires close scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid=".506.1/12">The hon. Gentleman referred specifically to TB. Bovine TB is one of the most difficult animal health problems facing Government and the farming industry in Great Britain. We are committed to finding the best way to combat the disease, backed by available evidence and taking account of all interested parties, including the taxpayer. Some 5.7 per cent. of herds were affected by TB restrictions at some time during 2004 and 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".506.1/13">The number of new incidents in 2004 was slightly up on 2003; 3,313 compared with 3,220. Those are the provisional figures that we have. Several key measures are being introduced, including the emphasis on keeping areas clean and reducing TB in hot spot areas, the new surveillance measures announced last autumn, and the work with the farmer-chaired stakeholder group to finalise a detailed proposal to implement pre-movement testing of cattle. Those proposals will be subject to further consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".506.1/14">It is worth remembering that in 2003&ndash;04 we spent more than &pound;15 million on research, covering among other things the transmission of bovine TB within and between species. Research included the randomised badger culling trial, improved diagnosis and vaccine development. I know that the hon. Gentleman has asked in the past about the possibility of vaccine development as a means of dealing with the issue.</p>
	<p pid=".506.1/15">A limited road traffic accident survey is being conducted in seven counties of England. They are the lower-incidence-comparative counties of Cornwall, Devon, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Shropshire and Dorset. Farmers outside those areas can submit badger carcases for private post mortem at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, but that involves a cost. The fact is that dealing with bovine TB is far from easy, and the trouble is that some outcomes of the work done in Northern Ireland have been presented in some parts of the media as if they provide an instant solution. I think the hon. Gentleman will be aware that they do not. There were considerable reservations about some of the conclusions that the industry jumped on.</p>
	<p pid=".506.1/16">One point I would make to the hon. Gentleman is that the sorts of examples I gave earlier about how the farming industry is making itself competitive nationally, and locally, by getting a more effective return for the farmer, require the industry to take the lead. The purpose of government is to work alongside and support the industry to become more effective and competitive, but the ownership of becoming truly competitive and effective must lie with the industry. Many farmers are demonstrating what can be done to change and become successful.</p>
	<p pid=".506.1/17">We are committed to supporting the farming industry through the current period of change in order to leave it well equipped to succeed in the future. In particular, we will launch a business advice service aimed at getting farmers to grips with the business implications of CAP reform. That will complement existing technical advice on issues such as cross-compliance, pollution minimisation, and conservation. Such headings indicate the sort of adjustments with which farmers have to cope.</p>
	<p pid=".506.1/18">We are also supporting bodies such as the Food Chain Centre, English Farming and Food Partnerships and the dairy, red meat and cereals industries forums to help the farming industry improve its own competitiveness. The methods for that must be collaboration, co-operation, benchmarking, and the sharing of best practice, as well as the identification of solutions to sector-specific issues.</p>
	<p pid=".506.1/19">The hon. Gentleman referred to fly-tipping on farmland as one of his specific queries. Again, there is a considerable amount of detail, so I repeat my offer to write to him about some of the issues I have been unable to cover in full during this short debate. The Government are committed to tackling the problem of illegally deposited waste or fly-tipping. It is a huge antisocial problem, affecting local authorities, the Environment Agency, other organisations, landowners and farmers.</p>
	<p pid=".506.1/20">The hon. Gentleman referred to the key component of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill, which is with the House of Lords. I hope that its provisions will assist the Environment Agency, local authorities and victims of fly-tipping, including farmers, and reduce that nuisance.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-09.510.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1135" speakername="Dan Norris" colnum="510"  time="16:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050309/halltext/50309h05.htm#50309h05_spnew0">
	<p pid=".510.1/1">The title of this debate will be a mystery to many of those people who do not live in or near my constituency; however, the reason why the debate has come about is because of the bitter experience of council tax payers in the north-east Somerset part of my constituency. It has been a sad and sorry tale. I am referring to the Bath spa project, a new, modern and exciting development that has tragically gone wrong. It is at least three years overdue and at least three times over budget, costing about &pound;35 million when it should have cost &pound;13 million. About &pound;5 million of additional costs will take the project up to &pound;40 million, and there is still no opening date.</p>
	<p pid=".510.1/2">Although I know that the Minister is well briefed about the matter, perhaps I can explain to him a little bit about the history of the project. It was announced in 1997 that the Millennium Commission had agreed to pay about &pound;7 million towards the project. Latterly it gave about an extra &pound;1 million, giving it a total of about &pound;8 million. It was announced also that the local council, Bath and North East Somerset council, would contribute about &pound;3million, and that a private operator would make an additional contribution of about &pound;2 million to make a project total of about &pound;13 million.</p>
	<p pid=".510.1/3">Through no one's fault, the project got off to a bad start. Excavations at the site were protracted. Bath has historical importance, and it is important to ensure that when new buildings are constructed, one knows what historical damage one is doing. That was a necessary delay and was compounded by nature, as mallards were nesting on the site and had to be left there before construction work could start.</p>
	<p pid=".510.1/4">The start was hopeful, but sadly progress was slow. In 2000 a key decision was made about the financing of the project. It is often referred to as the time when councillors signed a blank cheque and effectively underwrote whatever costs might accrue on the project, simply because they had had little success in securing other funding. That is regrettable and should have rung the alarm bell that they were likely to get into deep water. If private initiative examines a project and realises it cannot make money, that should be a clear indication to a local authority, whose job it is to provide cost-effective local services rather than dabble in the market and risk council tax payers' money.</p>
	<p pid=".510.1/5">With the benefit of hindsight, 2000 was a bad year. There was a hung council, and all the Liberal Democrat councillors, except those with a pecuniary interest, supported the project, and about half the Labour councillors supported the underwriting of the project. About half the Tory councillors supported the project, although that is denied by Conservative councillors. However, councillors Bailey, Dewey, Hawkins, Kew and Organ are on record as having voted for the project, so perhaps they can write to tell me if they disagree.</p>
	<p pid=".510.1/6">The year 2001 was another bad one, with very little progress. It was significant because it was the year in which the Bath spa project was intended to open. The opening date came and went, and it turned out to be the first of six opening dates that have not been achieved. The council so lacks confidence that it is not prepared to say whether the project will open this year.</p>
	<p pid=".510.1/7">Then came 2003, which turned out to be yet another bad year. The three tenors gave a terrific concert, which was very well received by local people but, sadly, it was not possible for them to open the spa as planned. The four pools were filled with water, so everything looked fine from the outside when the media were allowed in to see the three tenors walking around the premises. However, most of that water came not from the thermal springs that make Bath famous but from the mains supply, because there was difficulty in obtaining sufficient water. Questions have been raised about the contamination of some of the spa's sources, but it is hoped that those can be resolved.</p>
	<p pid=".510.1/8">Then, significantly, peeling paint was spotted in the pools. At that time, it was expected that it would cost some &pound;500,000 to correct. That might have been a subtle issue in the general scale of things, but council tax payers started to become very angry when they realised that, in order for them to enjoy the wonderful spectacle of the three tenors at the Bath spa project, cobblestones had been laid to make the area look attractive on the outside, although it was known that, only weeks later, they would have to be dug up at the cost of many tens of thousands of pounds. There is dubious benefit from the project to my constituents, who live in the part of Bath and north-east Somerset that is outside the city&mdash;in fact, many of them live closer to Bristol than to Bath&mdash;so the requirement on them to contribute to the project via their council tax had never been received with great joy. When they saw expenditure such as that on the cobblestones, they questioned the wisdom of the project, and asked whether there was sufficient skill and talent to manage it. It was being overseen by the council.</p>
	<p pid=".510.1/9">Then we arrived in 2004. That was a truly appalling year, a year that my constituents are unlikely to forget when it comes to the saga of the Bath spa. It turned out that a special paint was required for the pools and a special surface was also needed, so the previous estimate of &pound;500,000 was incorrect. It was estimated that that would cost between &pound;3.4 million and &pound;4.3 million. That is a huge sum of money for paint for four small pools. In addition, it was decided that because the surface had to be scraped away and blasted off back to the concrete for the new surface to be applied, the original concrete steps were no longer adequate and what was needed to allow people to enter and exit the pools were stainless steel steps costing &pound;500,000. In addition, the council announced that it had overlooked &pound;300,000 in architect fees. The public were, understandably, very concerned. In fact, they were mystified.</p>
	<p pid=".510.1/10">Can the Minister shed any light on the saga of the huge cost of the paint? How was it not foreseen at the start of the project that such expensive paint would be needed? Why was the cost not factored in at the outset? The total that is to be spent on painting four small pools is something like the cost of a small primary school; we know how much more wanted and valued a school would be. The figure defied the belief of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid=".510.1/11">Now we are in 2005, and that started badly. The per-head cost, that is the extra cost over and above the original amount for every man, woman and child in the district, including people in my constituency and that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/895" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase>, turned out to be &pound;116. To put that into context, it is nearly seven times the &pound;17 per head that the millennium dome cost every man, woman and child. It is a stupendous figure, and one that has sent shock waves around my constituency and elsewhere in the area. The project is infamous not just among my constituents but across south-west England and beyond. Indeed, I have read reports from America about the farcical circumstances that surround it. The total cost has escalated from &pound;13 million to about &pound;40 million with hidden costs, and I suspect that it will be higher by the time the project is completed.</p>
	<p pid=".510.1/12">I should tell my hon. Friend the Minister that his intervention last month, when he visited the spa, was very timely and much appreciated. So far, I have not mentioned the fact that the project has been cloaked in tremendous secrecy. As soon as things started to go wrong in 2003 and 2004, media access to the project and to information about it was conspicuous by its absence, as was co-operation with representatives of the media who wanted to go inside and see what all that council tax payers' money was being spent on. That is why the Minister's visit was so valuable. He was able to call the bluff of the various parties. The construction company, Mowlem, said that it was happy for the media to attend, and claimed that Bath and North East Somerset council was causing the difficulty in terms of access. The council said the exact opposite&mdash;that it was happy for the media to attend, but the construction company had failed to let them in. A Shakespearian situation was set up. The Minister, having obtained unconditional access and agreement from Mowlem that he could attend and bring with him whomever he wanted, invited, through me, all the media.</p>

	<p pid=".512.1/1">I shall not give way now, but might do so if the hon. Gentleman tries again slightly later.</p>
	<p pid=".512.1/2">There was disagreement about who was responsible for the access&mdash;or the lack of it&mdash;by the media. I have here a letter from BANES' lawyers, Veale Wasbrough, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-24">24 January 2005</phrase>, writing to the solicitors who represent the construction company Mowlem; effectively, it is a letter from the council to the construction company. I shall not read it all, but the key paragraph says:</p>
	<p pid=".512.1/3" class="indent">&quot;No statement or comment must be made to the press or in public with regard to the Project Works without the prior written consent of the Council.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".512.1/4">I shall leave it for them to carry on arguing, but I know who my money is on as the cause of the difficulty about access.</p>
	<p pid=".512.1/5">The Minister came, the bluff was called and the media were allowed in. That was important and made a difference; huge public pressure developed as a consequence of people's knowing about the huge delays, and about the fact that all that money had been spent on the project, yet years on it was still a building site. Within about three days&mdash;on the Thursday following the Monday of the visit&mdash;the council and the construction company were having face-to-face meetings lasting for hours, whereas in the previous 12 months they had had hardly any face-to-face meetings at all. That was very helpful, and I thank the Minister for his important intervention. Without it, we would still be sitting there without media access and, I suspect, without discussion of the offer made by the construction company to complete the project in six months.</p>

	<p pid=".513.1/1">I want to push on. I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman if I can.</p>
	<p pid=".513.1/2">I must thank the Minister also for his frankness in discussing the competence of the council. The story is rather like that of the emperor's new clothes. The Minister came, saw and stated what everyone in my area really knew; the council had been incompetent in its handling of the project. That was confirmed, if confirmation were needed, by a television poll on BBC's &quot;Points West&quot; regional news programme on the evening of the Minister's visit. More than 1,200 telephone calls were received in about 20 minutes. Bath and North East Somerset council was backed by 11 per cent. of those who rang in&mdash;people who thought that the project had been handled in the right way&mdash;and 55 per cent. of callers wanted the construction company's offer to finish the project within six months to be accepted. However, amazingly, 33 per cent. were so fed up with the incompetence of BANES that they wanted the project to be abandoned, and no more money to be wasted on it. They had lost faith that it would ever be completed.</p>
	<p pid=".513.1/3">The whole affair has been a case study in how not to manage a building project and how to alienate council tax payers. Some years ago, would you believe, a council employee admitted on ITV West that the project was a loss leader. That was later denied, but was none the less said on camera. When I was in a live interview with the council leader on national breakfast TV, he just lost his temper; clearly he is not used to being criticised or asked questions about the project. I suggest strongly that he surround himself with people who do not just say yes all the time.</p>
	<p pid=".513.1/4">A year ago, I believe that the Minister set up a confidential meeting between the three parties; the council, the construction company and the architects. Unfortunately, that confidential meeting was undermined by the fact that it was leaked to the media by councillors from Bath and North East Somerset council. That was terribly unhelpful. Litigation has been rife in this matter; all the parties have been sending legal letters left, right and centre. As I understand it, only last year that council had to pay legal bills of &pound;500,000. There is a lot more of that to come, I am sad to say.</p>
	<p pid=".513.1/5">In many respects, the council has been irresponsible in how it has dealt with the project. It produced a brochure that described what it was like to be in the spa, as if the spa had been open, and left us all with egg on our faces when people arrived from the USA, for example, only to find that it was not open. Motorway signs near the project still point to the spa, even though it has not been completed.</p>

	<p pid=".514.0/1">Thank you, Mr. Olner; I shall respect that.</p>
	<p pid=".514.0/2">I say in conclusion that modern methods of construction should mean cost-effective buildings for council tax payers; buildings that bring pride, not ridicule. The problem with incompetent councils is that they are often way out of their depth and cannot deal with such things. I hope that Bath and North East Somerset council will stick to basics in future. The Millennium Commission needs to think about how and when it gives such large sums of money to organisations that are not up to scratch when it comes to fulfilling their commitments. The district auditor needs to be clear about how council tax payers can best be guaranteed to get value for money. The whole Bath spa fiasco has brought humiliation and damage to our area; it is like a &quot;Carry On&quot; film, but I am afraid that no one in my constituency is laughing.</p>

	<p pid=".514.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1135" name="Dan Norris">my hon. Friend the Member for Wansdyke (Dan Norris)</phrase> on securing this debate on behalf of his constituents; the council tax payers, every man, woman and child of whom, I understand, is paying an estimated &pound;116 for this absolute fiasco.</p>
	<p pid=".514.1/2">I should like to praise my hon. Friend. At times during the nine years of this fiasco, it must have seemed to him that he was a lone voice, speaking up and stating quite proper concerns on behalf of council tax payers. I am pleased that the vast majority of people in his and neighbouring constituencies now endorse what he is doing.</p>
	<p pid=".514.1/3">As the Minister with responsibility for construction, I like to get out of the Department of Trade and Industry once a week, if I can, and visit manufacturers, business groups and construction projects. Construction makes a great contribution to the UK economy. It is worth more than &pound;225 billion a year, more than 8 per cent. of our GDP, and employs more than 2 million people in many of our leading companies and small businesses.</p>
	<p pid=".514.1/4">British architects are hailed around the world for their bold and gracious designs. British construction companies work in more than 100 countries. I have seen the work of Sir Nicholas Grimshaw, the architect of the Bath spa, on the fabulous Eden project; he is an architect of world renown. The contractor, Mowlem, also has an international reputation, with vast experience of bringing in projects on time and on budget. Both Sir Nicholas and Mowlem work with clients who are highly professional and highly competent, and who adopt modern methods of construction, consult our construction flagship body Constructing Excellence, examine the benefits of build off-site and look at best practice wherever that is found in the world. Such clients have achieved higher quality and better standards than ever before. They have reduced waste, cut deaths and are, I hope, achieving the target that I am setting of zero tolerance for any deaths in this great sector.</p>
	<p pid=".514.1/5">The best clients attain such a record. Sadly, neither Sir Nicholas nor Mowlem have found such a client in Bath and North West Somerset council&mdash;not at the inception of this ill-fated project, nor at the humiliating appearance of the three tenors at the so-called opening in 2003, nor at the building site that is the Bath spa, which I visited a month ago.</p>
	<p pid=".514.1/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Wansdyke would not have called this debate if it were not that, as far as his constituents are concerned, there is no opening date, nor end in sight for this project. In any traditional JCT contract, the construction costs represent about 85 per cent. of the project and the consultants on-costs about 15 per cent. In the Bath spa project, the client&mdash;the council&mdash;forced down the construction costs to &pound;11m, less than 50 per cent. of the consultant's on-costs. To achieve that, it insisted on reducing the quality of certain items. The most staggering example was a &pound;200,000 reduction in spending on paint. There is a highly specialised type of paint that makes baths watertight. The paint&mdash;Kartoxon paint&mdash;is used by pool contractors all over Europe. It was deemed too expensive and was substituted by a concrete that was merely painted with a cosmetic paint, in spite, I understand, of there being no track record of similar usage on any similar project anywhere else.</p>
	<p pid=".514.1/7">Half a decade later, when everyone accepts that Kartoxon is the solution to the Bath spa problem, the cost of rectifying that false economy of &pound;200,000 has risen to more than &pound;4 million. If that were the only failing of the client, Bath and North West Somerset council, it would be put down to inexperience or incompetence; costly, but no more than that. Sadly, it appears to have been only the tip of an iceberg of incompetence.</p>
	<p pid=".514.1/8">A year ago, aware that the Government have very limited powers to intervene in such cases, I contacted, in confidence, the three main parties involved. I invited the chief executive of Bath and North West Somerset council, Sir Nicholas Grimshaw from Grimshaw's and Sir John Gains from Mowlem to meet me in the Department of Trade and Industry, away from any blaze of publicity, to discuss my solution to their seemingly intractable problem. It was a simple proposal; that the client&mdash;the council&mdash;should instruct that the work be completed, and that the other two parties should agree to abide by any arbitration or court finding.</p>
	<p pid=".514.1/9">I was operating, in strict confidence, on the principle that the work that had stalled and been delayed for years should proceed, and that no party sitting around that table should undertake any face-saving in public. Although I secured the agreement of all parties that the meeting would be kept confidential to ensure that no one faced any accusations of backing down, the chief executive of the council told his leader, councillor Paul Crossley, about it, and he told a local newspaper. In effect, that sabotaged my attempts to resolve the issue, even before we were able to sit around the table. Sadly, I am told that there is a pattern of those councillors shooting their mouths off in public and jeopardising progress at almost every stage of the project, while costs have shot through the roof.</p>
	<p pid=".514.1/10">We have a deadlock with the council, but there is also a problem of facing facts. I am pleased to say that my visit resulted in a round-table meeting with Mowlem in the same week. During that meeting, the company followed up on an offer that it had already put in draft and in writing to the council. I hoped sincerely that progress would be made. However, the council is delusional. At the time that the council chief executive was writing to me that access to the media was entirely a matter for Mowlem and that the contractor, not the council, was blocking access, the council was sending&mdash;not in confidence&mdash;the letter from its solicitors to Mowlem that my hon. Friend passed me at the beginning of the debate, stating almost precisely the opposite. The letter censures Mowlem for briefing the press on a number of occasions.</p>
	<p pid=".514.1/11">As Mowlem made clear to me, in, I think, the presence of all those present on the day of my visit, it was happy for the media to visit the spa. It is now clear to me that the council were not happy about that. The reasons are also clear; we are nine years into the project, &pound;14 million, &pound;15 million or &pound;16 million has been spent and the bill is estimated by the council at in excess of &pound;20 million, with estimates rising to &pound;35 million. I have seen the figure put at &pound;39.5 million, and I would be surprised if it stopped there. From those escalating figures, it is clear that the council has little or no intention of coming clean with the public on its handling of the case.</p>

	<p pid=".516.0/1">I genuinely believe that the Minister has misunderstood, or been misinformed on, a number of points. I draw attention to the fact that he has got the name of the council wrong. It is Bath and North East&mdash;not north west&mdash;Somerset council. He keeps referring to his visit as &quot;the visit of the Construction Minister&quot;. Will he confirm the letter from his private secretary that I have seen, which says that, when he came to Bath in February, he did not come as the Construction Minister but in a private capacity?</p>

	<p pid=".516.1/1">I am the Construction Minister and I am addressing the debate as such. In checking the record, I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman has not sought an Adjournment debate on the issue. I am surprised that the excellent briefing I received from my civil servants shows that he has not sought an Adjournment debate before. To their knowledge, he has not asked any Department to help the council in trying to resolve the mess. We have a lot of expertise in the area. The sad fact that I conclude is that the most incompetent council in the country also has the weakest Member of Parliament. The problem is a council that is indecisive and a Member of Parliament who, because that council is run by his Liberal Democrat colleagues, will not stand up against them. We see many Members of Parliament having to do that in tough local situations in which we know that a council of the same political party is getting things wrong.</p>

	<p pid=".516.4/1">The Minister is making the debate personal. I know that my time to intervene on him is brief, but I point out yet again that he has got so many of his facts wrong.

	<p pid=".517.0/1">I am afraid that the defence of, &quot;It's not me, guv&quot; is not good enough. It is not an excuse that my constituents would accept. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's constituents would not accept it either. I have given him the chance to join us in criticising, if not condemning, the shambolic handling of the affair by his Liberal Democrat colleagues. I have thick piles of press cuttings. In them, I see not one word of criticism directed at his council colleagues on the issue. In the meantime, of course, the costs are escalating horrendously.</p>
	<p pid=".517.0/2">I understand that the council has in front of it a possible solution to the issue. The hon. Gentleman has written to me saying that he does not accept that that is a solution. The possible solution is a design-and-build completion to the project that would cap the spending at &pound;26 million. I was hoping that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/895" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> might, in his intervention, give me a progress report about the months since I went to Bath on exactly how far they are down the road in agreeing that settlement. The important thing is, of course, that a settlement must not prejudice what the people of Bath get at the end of the day. At the moment, that is, as far as I can see, the only solution on the table.</p>
