	<p pid="b.339.0/1">I congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" name="Ian McCartney">the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase> on obtaining this debate. I am glad to see the Minister in his place. He was a member of the all-party fire safety group and a promoter of sprinkler systems, and he knows that sprinklers are an important aspect of the package that is needed to give protection to schools and other buildings.</p>
	<p pid="b.339.0/2">There has been a marked improvement in fire safety in recent years, which is basically due to the great measures and proactive work of the fire and rescue service. This is an opportunity tell the fire and rescue services that we are pleased with, and thank them for, their work in protecting schools and communities more generally.</p>
	<p pid="b.339.0/3">It is interesting to put fires in schools in the context of the general cost of fires to society. The latest statistics from the World Fire Statistics Centre for 2008 show that the cost of fires in the UK is &pound;7.03 billion a year, which is almost 1 per cent. of gross domestic product. Clearly, the costs are great, and some 28 per cent. of them are incurred because of domestic fires&mdash;there were 55,000 domestic fires in 2007-08. The statistics indicate that there were 1,300 fires in schools. I looked on the internet last night, but the costs are not entirely up to date. My right hon. Friend has referred to the figure of &pound;1 billion, which is enormous, but the figure that I found is subject to a lag.</p>

	<p pid="b.339.2/1">I am grateful for that correction.</p>
	<p pid="b.339.2/2">The net suggested that between 2000 and 2004, the cost of fires was &pound;58 million per year on average. Again, that is an enormous cost compared with the programme that the Government are pushing through in building new schools. In my constituency, we are building a raft of primary schools and new learning centres at secondary level. We built our first school after the Labour Government came to power in 1997&mdash;it was built at Mapplewell in that first year. As the school building progressed, someone phoned me to ask whether I realised that the new school, which was the first to be built in Barnsley for 25 years, was being built without any plan for a sprinkler system. I telephoned the chief executive and reached an understanding that we would press for sprinklers. As a result of his pressing, sprinkler systems were fitted to the school.</p>
	<p pid="b.339.2/3">As my right hon. Friend has said, when a school burns down, there is a much wider effect than disruption to the school, although that is in itself substantial, because it means, for example, that some children have to travel many miles to another school to continue their studies. Because schools are used by the community much more than previously, fires in schools cause bewilderment and vulnerability in the community, which can undermine determination. It is therefore important to ensure that we use every means to protect schools and that we ensure that any fires in schools do not spread.</p>
	<p pid="b.339.2/4">Of course, as the Minister is aware, one way of doing that is by using sprinklers in vulnerable points in schools. However, we cannot use sprinklers alone&mdash;they must be part of a package that includes fire doors, warning systems and so on. Within that combination, sprinkler systems can save schools, because they can prevent fire from spreading. Ensuring that fires cannot spread quickly is the main point of sprinkler systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.339.2/5">I was pleased when the Minister announced&mdash;in March 2007, I think&mdash;that he expected all new schools to be fitted with sprinkler systems. As my right hon. Friend has said, there is now a necessity to firm that up and for some reinforcement, which the Minister could obtain by meeting, and getting an understanding from, the LGA. That understanding could then be fed down the line to local authorities, so that we can get the support that is required to ensure that all new schools have sprinklers. However, we would then have to deal with older and refurbished schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.341.0/1">I thank my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" name="Ian McCartney">the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase> for securing this debate on the vital issue of fire safety in our schools. During the past four years, I have supported and worked with the National Fire Sprinkler Network's campaign to make the installation of fire sprinklers standard in newly built schools. I was alerted to the problem by Bernadette Hartley, who has, sadly, died. She was a great and passionate advocate for sprinkler systems in schools. She worked tirelessly on the project with many fire chiefs throughout the country, and particularly with Peter Holland of the Lancashire fire service. In recent years, their hard work, persistence and commitment to fire safety have delivered progress, and I congratulate them and the Government on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.341.0/2">Working with Bernadette was quite exciting at times. At one point, we met the TV presenter Nick Ross, who wanted to put an MP from each party&mdash;one Liberal, one Labour and one Tory&mdash;into a trial fire building by agreement, leave us in there and then rescue us, so that we would realise the impact on the lives of people who could end up in a fire with no prospect of rescue. It never happened, but it often makes me think what will happen to people if we do not do all that we can, not only in terms of buildings&mdash;the cost is huge&mdash;but in terms of the social and human impact that a fire has.</p>
	<p pid="b.341.0/3">It has been a long-fought campaign for better safety on school premises, and there is clearly some way to go yet. I welcome wholeheartedly the move by the Department for Children, Schools and Families to encourage the installation of sprinkler systems in newly built schools. Including that in Department guidance will significantly reduce the costs and disruption caused by fires in schools. In our discussions with the National Fire Sprinkler Network, manufacturers and fire departments, it has been made clear that the more the guidance is adhered to and the more sprinkler systems are put in schools, public buildings, shops and areas where the public are at risk, the more innovation there will be and the more the costs will drop. It is important that we get on with it. Safety in our schools is paramount, and the sprinklers add an extra level of security.</p>
	<p pid="b.341.0/4">Schools play an increasingly important role as community hubs. They are no longer open from 8.30 am to 3.30 pm; there are breakfast clubs and after-school activities. They offer a place where the local community can come together. In some places, the local school might be the only decently functioning community facility. We must protect those resources as best we can, as well as the health and safety of the people who use them.</p>
	<p pid="b.341.0/5">Lancashire county council, as the local education authority, includes sprinkler systems in all new schools built under the Building Schools for the Future programme. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield has said, some 2,000 schools are damaged by fire each year. The Building Schools for the Future programme will invest &pound;25 billion in renewing schools. We should not do anything that might put that investment at risk. We should protect it, and sprinkler systems are a logical next step, especially as we are investing such huge sums.</p>
	<p pid="b.341.0/6">Installing sprinkler systems makes a great deal of financial sense. The cost of a sprinkler system is 1 to 2 per cent. of the total project cost for a new build. If incorporated at the design stage, it can become cost-neutral, so why not just do it? There are additional benefits. For example, Zurich will reduce a school's insurance premium by 65 per cent. and the excess, which is often about &pound;100,000, to nil. That is an immediate benefit of putting sprinkler systems in schools. It is even more sensible to do so at the design stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.341.0/7">I want to place on record my support for the work of the National Fire Sprinkler Network and everybody associated with the health and safety of all the people involved in protecting those who use public buildings. I hope that the Department for Children, Schools and Families, being committed to the installation of fire sprinklers in schools, will push on as hard and as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.342.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" name="Ian McCartney">the right hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase>, but on the birth of his 10th grandchild, which is possibly the most important event for him today. I also congratulate him on securing this important debate and on his achievements in improving fire safety over the years, which have affected so many people.</p>
	<p pid="b.342.0/2">As we are discussing schools specifically, it is useful to reflect on the scale of the problem. In a recent parliamentary question, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" name="David Laws">the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase> established that more than 4,000 fires were attended by local fire and rescue services between 2004 and 2007. The House of Commons Library briefing contains some incredible statistics. For example, 90,000 children are affected by arson each year; an average of 20 schools are damaged or destroyed by arson each week; 12 is the average age of fire vandals; only 400 of 32,000 schools in the UK are fitted with sprinklers; the cost of arson to schools was &pound;70 million in 2008 alone. As the right hon. Member for Makerfield has pointed out, the opportunity costs are considerable in terms of how many brand-new schools, extra teachers and so on we could benefit from, if we were to reduce the number of fires.</p>
	<p pid="b.342.0/3">Every year, about 2,700 school fires are started deliberately. Sadly, schools are prime targets for arson attacks because the perpetrators are often past or present pupils.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-19b.342.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" speakername="Annette Brooke" colnum="342"  time="010:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090519/halltext/90519h0002.htm#09051961000579">
	<p pid="b.342.2/1">The hon. Gentleman has correctly surmised that I will mention heathland. He may have seen in the local papers for my constituency that there have been some major heath fires over the past couple of weeks. It would be surprising if I did not mention that.</p>
	<p pid="b.342.2/2">Levels of fire protection and detection have traditionally been very low in schools. As hon. Members have said, the financial cost is not the only problem brought by a school fire. The Arson Prevention Bureau estimates that almost a third of school fires occur during the day, putting the safety of pupils and staff at risk. Furthermore, fires disrupt the learning of more than 90,000 pupils a year through damage to classrooms and school property. That can include coursework, school work and teaching notes and aids. The disruption caused by damage can range from one classroom being out of action for a few weeks to a whole school being taught in temporary accommodation for several years.</p>
	<p pid="b.342.2/3">This debate could not have come at a more pertinent time for me. Tomorrow, I will attend the opening of the new buildings at Lytchett Minster upper school, an excellent comprehensive in my constituency that was devastated by an arson attack in 2000. Tomorrow it will formally open its new maths, science and humanities centre after nine years and &pound;12.5 million worth of rebuilding work.</p>
	<p pid="b.342.2/4">I cannot describe the disruption and stress that has been caused. I well recall attending a local carnival on the Saturday afternoon when news of the fire came. Immediately, devastation was caused for local people, the head teacher, staff and pupils. Because of the scale of the fire, about 35 portakabins were required. The country had to be scoured just to get the school up and running again. Over the eight to nine years of the rebuild, a generation of schoolchildren has gone through the system receiving maths and science education in portable classrooms. The portakabins were 400 m from the rest of the school buildings, resulting in less time being spent in lessons and problems during inclement weather.</p>
	<p pid="b.342.2/5">The new build cost an incredible amount. The owners of the land on which the portakabins were housed had to be paid. The insurance money granted in 2000 was nowhere near the amount needed. A rebuild after a major fire is not planned, so it is more difficult. There were enormous delays, some of which were inexcusable. For example, an infamous tree in a place vital to the rebuild was judged to be of such great value that it could not be taken down. Ironically, the fire hazards over the eight years were incredible. Science lessons were being held in portakabins that were 400 m from the school and were accessed by a narrow path.</p>
	<p pid="b.342.2/6">It is generally accepted that standards will suffer when children are taught in temporary accommodation. It becomes much more difficult to engage children in education. Many items of coursework were destroyed in the fire. Such things are not quantifiable. I would like to emphasise that Lytchett Minster upper school maintained its incredibly high standards. Prior to the opening tomorrow, I would like to place on the record my congratulations to the head teacher, staff, pupils and local community. As other hon. Members have said, the impact is greater when schools have opened themselves up to the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.342.2/7">When we consider safety in schools, we must look at three aspects. Many preventive measures can be taken. The design of schools, in particular of corridors and ways of escape, is incredibly important, as has been said. Smoke alarms have also been mentioned. Other basic things can be done, such as banning matches and lighters in schools. Waste should be kept in a sensible storage place. Fires, however small, should always be reported to the fire brigade. As has been said, all fire starters should be referred to fire service aversion schemes. I will come back to that in a moment. We must ensure that school perimeters and buildings are well maintained and secure. We must be aware that the broken window syndrome attracts vandalism, as the Library briefing paper states.</p>
	<p pid="b.342.2/8">Education on this issue is important. The average age of school arsonists is 12 and such crimes are usually opportunistic. Dorset fire and safety runs an effective arson prevention unit, which aims to educate schoolchildren about the devastating consequences of arson. Fire and rescue services must not be forced to cut their budgets for important preventive measures. In Dorset, roadshows and the time that fire services spend in schools are under threat. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> reminded me, education about fire and heathland is also vital in constituencies such as mine, which have so much heathland.</p>
	<p pid="b.342.2/9">There is a wonderful safety centre in Dorset called Streetwise, which has been running for more than 10 years. About 115,000 people have visited the centre since its opening. Children act out all sorts of scenarios, identify dangers such as fire risks, and say what should be done. As a charity, it is reliant on the generosity and time of local partnerships and businesses. It is essential that funding for such vital services is not cut during the economic downturn. Dorset fire and rescue service has had to cut its contribution to that important facility. Dorset also has a Firesetters programme, which seeks to educate young people who are referred to it by concerned parents and youth offending teams. It aims to teach a greater awareness of the consequences of fire. Intervention and education are important and we cannot afford for there to be cuts.</p>
	<p pid="b.342.2/10">Beyond intervention and education, we should think about the design of schools and the inclusion of sprinkler systems. I agree that we must fight fire on all fronts. Sprinklers are a vital ingredient in that. I was pleased in 2007 when the Department for Education and Skills published guidance saying that all new-build schools should have sprinkler systems fitted as standard unless it could be demonstrated that a school was low risk enough and that the system would not be good enough value for money. In principle, I agree that the decision-making process should be local, but I am concerned to hear that the cost is judged to be prohibitive in many schools. Many schools affected by the funding problems of the Building Schools for the Future programme might decide to cut this expense.</p>
	<p pid="b.342.2/11">The Minister will be aware that there have been some overspends on Building Schools for the Future in Dorset, which have made the cost rocket up. To one set of people in Dorset, that is the Government's fault&mdash;this appears on much election literature at the moment&mdash;but to another set of people, it is because contracts are not being managed well enough at a local level. It is probably fairly clear which camp I am in, but the point is that if there is poor contract management at local authority level, costs escalate and there has to be scrimping and saving. That point is important.</p>
	<p pid="b.342.2/12">The Minister has said that fire safety must be central to the design of new school buildings. He has also said:</p>
	<p pid="b.342.2/13" class="indent">&quot;I expect new schools to be built to include sprinkler systems as a safeguard against school fires. The installation of sprinklers can extinguish fires quickly and reduce damage to buildings.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.342.2/14">Dorset fire and rescue service has compared the cost of providing carpets throughout a school with that of installing sprinklers; we might ask which is more important in this day and age.</p>
	<p pid="b.342.2/15">I have some questions for the Minister. What does the guidance that all new schools should have sprinklers mean in practice? Dorset county council has said that it will fit sprinklers in certain new schools, but opposition councillors have not managed to get any clear answers about that. I believe that the council has ruled out fitting sprinklers to existing buildings. Is that what the Minister wants? What about part-rebuilds? Sprinklers have not been installed in the new-build part of Lytchett Minster upper school, although it cost a lot of money. It is difficult to know how many new schools are being fitted with sprinklers, and I appreciate that there will be a time lag, as the statement was only made in 2007, but does the Minister feel that any progress is being made? I am against having a centralised system, but I am worried that we do not have a grip on this issue across all local authorities&mdash;I imagine that some will be much better than others right across the board.</p>
	<p pid="b.342.2/16">Cost should not be a prohibitive factor in the decision-making process regarding fire safety, but this all comes down to cost-benefit analysis. Everyone who has spoken today has mentioned costs, including monetary, social and educational costs. It is obvious that there will be huge benefits to installing sprinklers in schools, including monetary benefits. The Zurich briefing points out that reductions in insurance costs mean that there is a relatively short payback period for the cost of installing sprinklers. Can the Government look at payback periods and cost-benefit analyses, obviously without favouring any particular insurance company, in the widest possible sense? This has been an important debate, and I look forward to hearing the Minister's answers.</p>

	<p pid="b.345.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" name="Ian McCartney">the right hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase>, whom we have just learned was one of the &quot;Three Amigos&quot;, on securing both the debate and a new granddaughter, Ian.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/2">The Department for Communities and Local Government estimates the average cost of fires in schools at &pound;58 million a year, whereas the Arson Prevention Bureau puts the UK total higher still at about &pound;100 million a year. If one multiplies that figure by 10, one gets the National Union of Teachers' figure of &pound;1 billion, which the right hon. Gentleman quoted for the decade. It is fortunate that there have not been any fatalities from school fires in the past 10 years, but there have been 290 injuries, and, as he said, it is only a matter of time before tragedy strikes.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/3">Schools that suffer serious fire damage face other problems. Pupils and staff may need to move to neighbouring schools, and teaching may have to be in temporary accommodation for long periods. When I was a fourth-year pupil at Roundhay secondary school in Leeds, a neighbouring school had to be closed to repair concrete cancer in the ceiling, and we had to share our school with that school's pupils, each having a morning or afternoon shift. Although I had my afternoons free as a child, that sharing arrangement was very disruptive to all involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/4">On top of the practical difficulties, schools' educational resources can suffer drastically when a school burns down, as data on pupil performance, teaching materials and lesson plans may be lost. Senior staff at St. Felix school in Newmarket told <i>The</i><i>Times Educational Supplement</i> that they felt like newly qualified teachers again, when their school burned down, having lost all the material that they had accumulated over a lifetime in the teaching profession.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/5">The DCLG has provided figures showing that there are consistently more than 1,000 fires a year in schools in England. The TeacherNet website says that, each year, more than 1,300 UK schools suffer fires that are serious and dangerous enough to warrant calling out the local fire brigade. The figures are made all the more alarming by the fact that a high proportion of those fires&mdash;often the majority&mdash;were started deliberately. In 2006, 589 out of 1,075 recorded fires&mdash;55 per cent.&mdash;were started on purpose. In the DCSF press notice that accompanied new safety guidance in 2007, the Minister said that</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/6" class="indent">&quot;60 per cent. of fires are started deliberately.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/7">A second disquieting statistic about school fires is the average age of the arsonists. In March 2009, <i>The</i><i>Times Educational Supplement</i> pointed out that the average age of &quot;fire vandals&quot;, as it correctly called them, is just 12 years old. That echoes the view of fire brigades up and down the country that run arson prevention programmes, such as those that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> mentioned. In April this year, <i>The Birmingham Post</i> carried an article on the fire prevention work of the west midlands arson task force, whose work, focusing on 10 and 11-year-olds, had brought about a sharp dip in the number of school fires in that area. In May, the <i>Hull Daily Mail </i>reported that Humberside fire and rescue service had targeted its Fire Friends programme at children aged between five and 11. I was interested in the Nick Ross idea, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1667" name="Rosie Cooper">the hon. Member for West Lancashire (Rosie Cooper)</phrase> mentioned, of putting three MPs&mdash;one from each party&mdash;into a controlled fire. That sounds like an interesting experiment, but I am not sure how advisable it would be in today's climate.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/8">There is no doubt that schools can take sensible measures to protect themselves against the threat of arson. They can co-operate with fire programmes, such as those that I have mentioned, and invest in good security, such as perimeter fencing. They can also make special arrangements for the school holidays, when few staff will normally be at the school site. However, all those precautions address the symptoms rather than the causes of the problem. Given that many fires are caused by schoolchildren, this issue is, to some extent at least, about behaviour. The children who start fires are likely to be those who struggle at school, particularly with basic skills. They are likely to be disruptive in lessons and to cause other problems around the school. <i>The</i><i>Times Educational Supplement</i> has pointed out that arsonists will invariably have a &quot;history of troublemaking&quot;, and that</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/9" class="indent">&quot;nine times out of 10 they will be known to the police or other related agencies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/10">Deliberate school fires do not arise out of the blue. They are not random or isolated occurrences, but one more troubling consequence of the breakdown in behaviour that is all too common in too many of our schools today, even at primary school level. We have argued on many occasions that teachers do not have the powers that they need to keep order in schools and to underline their authority. They are hampered in setting detentions, in searching pupils and in permanently excluding persistently disruptive students. Often, they do not have the autonomy that they need to create the type of whole-school ethos that can shape the behaviour of pupils for the good by setting and enforcing high standards and expectations. We know that standards of pupil behaviour are an absolute priority for the public, but, as the evidence for arson in schools shows, the Government are still struggling with this issue. We recognise, however, that not all fires are started deliberately, and that this problem can only be reduced, rather than solved, by concentrating on behaviour. There are other issues to consider, such as building regulations and, in particular, sprinklers, as the right hon. Gentleman has said.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/11">The DCSF responded to a series of parliamentary questions by explaining that it does not hold data on the number of existing schools that are fitted with sprinkler systems, and that it will be able to provide data only on fittings in newly constructed schools from the current financial year onwards. It seems likely, however, that the vast majority of existing schools do not have sprinkler systems, as our own anecdotal experience tells us. Zurich Municipal puts the proportion at just 1 per cent. of schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/12">The Government sought to change the situation in 2007, and I congratulate the Minister on implementing new building bulletin 100, which was designed to deal with fire safety in schools. That document summed up the fire safety precautions that schools were required to take, and it included guidance on many issues, such as evacuation and alarm systems. The document's key recommendation concerned sprinklers. It introduced a new expectation that all newly built schools should include sprinklers, unless they were classified as particularly low risk. When winding up the debate, it would be helpful if the Minister were to define &quot;low risk&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/13">A written answer from the Minister's colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1766" name="Sarah McCarthy-Fry">the hon. Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry)</phrase>, stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/14" class="indent">&quot;It is our presumption that all new schools will have fire sprinklers installed but we do not intend to require this.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-10-14.1144"><i>Official Report</i>, 14 October 2008; Vol. 480, c. 1144W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/15">The Minister himself said in a parliamentary answer:</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/16" class="indent">&quot;it is our expectation that all new and some refurbished schools designed after the introduction of our new policy in February 2007 will have fire sprinklers installed, although this is not a compulsory measure. There may be cases where local authorities or other promoters of schools consider that sprinklers are not needed. If so, they will need to be able to demonstrate that such schools are very low risk and that sprinklers would not represent good value for money.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-03-31.700"><i>Official Report</i>, 31 March 2008; Vol. 474, c. 700W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/17">When the new guidance was introduced, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/18" class="indent">&quot;I expect new schools to be built to include sprinkler systems as a safeguard against school fires. The installation of sprinklers can extinguish tires quickly and reduce damage to buildings.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/19">Clearly, sprinklers are important and are cheaper to install as part of a new build school than as an addition to an existing building&mdash;particularly because large water storage tanks need to be constructed as sprinklers are not just connected to the water mains.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/20">When sprinklers are built into a newly constructed school, they typically cost between &pound;250,000 and &pound;300,000, which the contractor, Willmott Dixon, has said can</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/21" class="indent">&quot;cause problems in meeting client's budgets&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/22">Sprinklers are not a statutory requirement, so funding is not always available. Yet, the Government have set a strong expectation that almost all new schools will be fitted with sprinklers, and the risk assessment tools that the DCSF provides reflect that assumption. Very few schools that take the test will be classified as low risk and therefore, after the application of the risk assessment tools, contractors often face the problem of having to incorporate a sprinkler system.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/23">In addition, the school or local authority face the problem of finding additional funding to install a sprinkler system. The time taken for those deliberations can be costly. According to the engineering firm Buro Happold the</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/24" class="indent">&quot;application of the tools can result in a design impasse&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/25">which in turn</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/26" class="indent">&quot;results in increased project costs and delays while the need for sprinklers is debated&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/27">Will the Minister confirm whether, in practice, it is all but compulsory to have sprinklers in new build schools and whether that cost is incorporated into the Building Schools for the Future and primary capital programme budgets?</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/28">As the hon. Member for West Lancashire has mentioned, it is important to note that insurance premiums are significantly lower for schools that have sprinklers. Zurich Municipal, for example, has suggested that sprinkler systems in schools reduce insurance premiums by around 75 per cent. According to the House of Commons Library, that could result in a payback period of between 13 and 21 years for a typical secondary school. Considering that a school is supposed to last more than 21 years under BSF, that seems like a good economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/29">This has been an important debate about safety in schools. We all share the concerns expressed by the right hon. Member for Makerfield&mdash;this is certainly not a party political issue. We have been fortunate that no recent fatalities have resulted from fires in schools. However, 290 casualties during the past 10 years is clearly 290 too many. I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-19b.348.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" speakername="Jim Knight" speakeroffice="The Minister for Schools and Learners"  colnum="348"  time="010:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090519/halltext/90519h0003.htm#09051961000581">
	<p pid="b.348.0/1">Many of us come into politics hoping to impact on people's lives in a positive way. I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" name="Ian McCartney">the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase> for his achievements in the field of fire safety. His hard work and commitment in relation to the legislation surrounding dangerous inflammable foam furniture and the installation of smoke detectors in homes have helped to save many lives. His achievements in public life are many, but I am sure that he is particularly proud of those.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/2">I join others in congratulating my right hon. Friend on becoming a grandfather for an unbelievable 10th time. It is worthy of great congratulations for someone who is clearly so youthful in demeanour to become a grandfather on the 10th occasion. I also congratulate him on his speech. I could easily have delivered such a speech myself in this Chamber in the last Parliament&mdash;but it would perhaps have been without the same passion and professionalism that he obviously applies. I congratulate him on securing what I and others consider a hugely important debate on a significant issue. The nature of the debate has shown this Parliament at its best&mdash;as being well-informed and passionate, and caring about something that really makes a difference to people. That is worthy of note, given the current climate in relation to the nature of this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/3">We heard not only my right hon. Friend's passionate and strong argument, but the arguments of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase>, who I enjoyed serving with as an officer of the all&mdash;party group on fire safety and rescue. He raises these and other health and safety issues, such as asbestos in schools, with me regularly. He pursues those matters with great passion. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1667" name="Rosie Cooper">the Member for West Lancashire (Rosie Cooper)</phrase> has to some extent taken over the baton that I had to abandon when I took up ministerial office: advocating in the House on behalf of the National Fire Sprinkler Network. I join her in paying tribute to Bernadette Hartley, who was instrumental in getting me interested in what some describe as the slightly weird and arcane subject of fire safety and sprinklers. When she died recently, it was a great loss.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/4">We also heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase>, who talked about Lytchett Minster upper school in her constituency. I have visited that school in a ministerial capacity to see what could be done to unlock the unacceptable time delay in rebuilding the school, following the devastating fire there. I am happy to hear that it is opening tomorrow and hope that the encouragement I was able to instigate through the Department was in some small way a contributory factor to getting on with things. From my visit, I well recall the huge impact that the fire had on the people in that school community&mdash;the teachers and pupils. I particularly remember what could almost be described as the shanty town of mobile classrooms that were reached by going down a long muddy path on the other side of the lawn. I look forward to visiting the school again in due course to see the impact of the new investment that has taken place there. I will try to address the hon. Lady's questions later.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/5">With his characteristic style, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1429" name="Nick Gibb">the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb)</phrase> contributed in a well informed way. I was interested to hear about the disruption to his education during what we describe in modern parlance as year 10&mdash;the fourth form, as it probably was then. Just imagine how much better he would be&mdash;even better than he is now&mdash;if he had not had that disruption to his education.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/6">My right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield will know that&mdash;I have hinted at this&mdash;I am passionate about the subject. I have advanced it through my patronage of the National Fire Sprinkler Network, as treasurer of the all-party group on fire safety and rescue, as a director of the Fire Protection Association and as chair of the Fire Safety Council. I first got involved with the issue because I was persuaded that, certainly at that time, no one in this country had died in a fire in a building that had a properly maintained sprinkler system, and that fire deaths occur disproportionately among people who suffer disadvantage.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/7">Beyond all the technicalities of passive and active measures, tanking systems and water pressure, this issue is about social justice. This is not just about people's safety; the matter is vital to our schools. Contributions from all hon. Members, including those who have intervened&mdash;the hon. Members for Castle Point (Bob Spink) and for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose)&mdash;have demonstrated the effect of the issue on the education of children and their work. As the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole said, there is also an effect on teachers' work and careers. That was behind my motivation when I was appointed Schools Minister to do something about the situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/8">The initial advice that I received was that the installation of sprinklers would add 10 per cent. to the build cost. Through dialogue and bringing in experts from outside, we managed to achieve a happy consensus that the figure could be as low as 2 per cent. or less, so there was the ability to move forward; hence the announcements that we made in 2007 around a presumption.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/9">There has been some discussion about the statistics, with which I do not disagree. It is worth pointing out&mdash;I am pleased to report this&mdash;that in the past three or four years there has been some reduction in the number of arson cases and fires overall in schools, and, consequently, in the costs. In 2003, there were just over 1,300 fires, in 2004 there were just under 1,300 fires, and in 2005 there were just under 1,200 fires. The percentage of arson cases went down by 60, 56 and 45 per cent. respectively. In 2006, by far the largest number of fires fell into the &pound;1 to &pound;500 cost band&mdash;I assume that that is the property cost&mdash;but six fires resulted in more than &pound;1 million of damage. It is clear that we must not ignore the issue, and that I and other Members of this House must continue to focus on it.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/10">As right hon. and hon. Members have said, fires in schools inflict considerable damage both in the risk that they pose to staff and pupils and in terms of cost. In March 2007, as I said, my Department introduced a new policy on fire sprinklers in schools. We announced our expectation that almost all new schools and some refurbished schools should have sprinklers fitted. My right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield was right to say that that is not a compulsory measure. The decision to install sprinklers is one for local authorities, but with the presumption that I have articulated and which is articulated in guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/11">In terms of how the decision making works, I would like to read out part of a letter that I sent to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>, who slipped me a note saying that unfortunately he had to get away to attend a meeting with another Minister about an important matter in his constituency. In that letter, I stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The current version of the risk analysis tool is more heavily weighted than the original version and the vast majority of schools will now be assessed as 'average' or 'high' risk using it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/13">That refers to the new tool that we introduced in 2007 to assist local authorities in measuring their requirement for sprinklers. The letter goes on:</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/14" class="indent">&quot;In the earlier version of the risk analysis tool, we asked for sprinklers in 'average' risk schools to be considered using the Cost Benefit Analysis Tool which accompanies the Risk Analysis Tool...whereas in the latest version of the tool we now recommend that 'average' risk schools are fitted with sprinklers notwithstanding the results of any cost benefit analysis.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/15" class="indent">The difference between the earlier and the current version of the DCSF risk analysis tool is largely due to the increased weight given to the loss of community facilities&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/16">to which many hon. Members referred&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/17" class="indent">&quot;and pupil's coursework which it was felt could not be adequately reflected in cost terms.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/18">Those are important areas of progress. I went on to state:</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/19" class="indent">&quot;The DCSF position is now that sprinklers should always be installed in all new schools except the very few schools if any that are assessed to be of 'low' risk and for which there is also no whole-life cost benefit.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.348.0/20">The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked how we define low risk. It is a simple question with a complicated answer. I would have to refer him to building bulletin 100, which he referred to and which I am sure he has assiduously read. On page 25, there is a formula for measuring risk assessment. Risk is the summation of hazards or scenarios multiplied by the frequency and the consequence of those scenarios. There is further explanation in appendix H, but it is all quite complicated. In essence, if there is a history of arson or fire in a building, that obviously raises the risk. I am confident that, if the tools are used, they will indicate that fire sprinklers should be installed in the vast majority of cases.</p>

	<p pid="b.351.1/1">As we put the tool together, we had contact with the ABI but principally with Zurich, which has been frequently mentioned in this debate. I understand that it is a dominant insurer in the schools insurance market&mdash;there are few, if any, other insurers in this market&mdash;which is why it is a useful source of information and advice. I do not disagree with the statistics that others have used about the kind of savings that could be made. They certainly have been included in the cost-benefit tool that is used by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.351.1/2">Alongside requiring the use of the tool, we have significantly tightened up requirements for the installation of sprinklers in new academies and in all new projects built under the new contractors' framework. Sprinklers will be installed unless the local authority specifically requests that they are not. Local authorities can also use funding outside the Building Schools for the Future envelope to install fire sprinklers and other fire safety measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.351.1/3">In private finance initiative projects, lower insurance premiums mean that sprinklers pay for themselves in 10 to 12 years. Most PFI providers automatically install sprinklers to get reduced insurance premiums&mdash;they are more concerned about whole-life cost&mdash;thereby providing good value whatever the risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.351.1/4">We have also published on TeacherNet design guidance for the primary capital programme which sets out our expectation that primary facilities should provide a safe and healthy environment. It recommends the use of our fire safety and sprinkler guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.351.1/5">We have made good progress, but it is fair to say that because of the lead-in times around designing and building schools, and with the new guidance only being introduced in 2007, it is difficult for us yet to be able to judge what the impact has been. The early indications are that whereas previously less than 10 per cent. of new schools had sprinklers installed, as many as 75 per cent. may now have them. I would like to see the figure higher still, but it is clear that some progress is being made.</p>
	<p pid="b.351.1/6">Further to the suggestion of my right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield, I am happy to meet with the Local Government Association, Partnerships for Schools and, given its understanding of the market, Zurich. I make a commitment to the House that I will do that in order to refresh my understanding of how thorough implementation of the guidance is across local authorities, and whether there is more that we can do.</p>

	<p pid="b.355.4/1">I believe that this is the first time that I have intervened on my right hon. Friend. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> It may not be the last. Does he agree that the ombudsman's position is at stake? What is the point of having an independent ombudsman if the Government can so easily ignore and sweep aside her reports? Is not the ombudsman's role to protect people, such as my constituent, Mr. Peter Ricket, whose two Equitable Life pensions lost more than half and two thirds of their value, and at the age of 78 he still has to work?</p>

	<p pid="b.365.1/1">The Minister shakes his head, so I shall tell hon. Members why the ombudsman feels that her report has been casually dismissed. She has stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.365.1/2" class="indent">&quot;First, the Government's response provides insufficient support for the rejection of those findings.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.365.1/3">She has stated that the response includes only a</p>
	<p pid="b.365.1/4" class="indent">&quot;brief statement setting out the Government's view of the regulatory regime&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.1/5">That shows the casualness of the Government's response; it is a detailed, thorough report that took years, and all we get from the Government is a brief statement. The ombudsman has stated that</p>
	<p pid="b.365.1/6" class="indent">&quot;The standard applied in my report was grounded in a detailed analysis&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.365.1/7">but that the Government's response seemed to be based on an &quot;assertion&quot;. That is the contrast&mdash;thorough, detailed, rigorous analysis was countered by assertion.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.1/8">The ombudsman has stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.365.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Secondly, the Government's response also fails to address the basis on which I came to several of my findings when rejecting those findings.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.365.1/10">In other words, the Government did not consider the reason for the ombudsman's findings and deal with them. The Government did not deal with what led her to make those conclusions; they simply rejected them. They did not deal with the ombudsman's reasons for reaching those conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.1/11">The ombudsman has stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.365.1/12" class="indent">&quot;Thirdly, the Government's response begs the question as to what the purpose of regulation was supposed to be.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.365.1/13">The Government's position, in paraphrase, seems to be that it would not have made a blind bit of difference if we had the best regulators in the world. The ombudsman has stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.365.1/14" class="indent">&quot;If it were truly the case that the relevant regulators, acting without maladministration and operating the regulator system as Parliament intended it should be operated, could have made no difference...that would be astonishing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.365.1/15">What is the point of having regulators? Whether or not they do their job, it makes no difference. It seems to be the Government's position that the conduct of the regulators would have made no difference, which is absurd.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.1/16">Finally, the ombudsman has highlighted her concerns about what she calls, &quot;The Government's alternative approach&quot;. She has expressed five concerns. The first is about the lack of a detailed timetable. I hope that the Minister will be precise. His intervention was interesting, but I hope that he will be clear about what Sir John Chadwick said about when the first of the money will be paid. That is the bottom line.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.1/17">The ombudsman's second concern was that Sir John is only an adviser, and that if the Government can ignore her, they can now ignore Sir John. What do we have in the way of cast iron assurances? Her third concern is that she had set out her conclusions but that Sir John has been asked to respond to the Government's reading of them. Surely, he should be asked to respond to what the ombudsman said, not the Government's reinterpretation of it.</p>

	<p pid="b.370.2/1">There is another irony that would be hilarious if it was not so serious. In their comments on the ombudsman's last report, the Government could have said, &quot;Well, we have had maladministration. It occurred under the Conservatives, and it has occurred under us, so we are all to blame.&quot; However, they have insisted, in their last response, that all the maladministration occurred under this Government and that that which occurred under the previous Conservative Government was not maladministration at all. They said that to minimise their liabilities. However, when historians reflect, they will find a funny irony in a Government desperately trying to exempt the previous Government from blame, which is what they appear to have done in their final response.</p>
	<p pid="b.370.2/2">In pursuit of this cross-party approach, I tabled an early-day motion a few weeks ago that has attracted widespread support. My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon asked what would happen if there was a change of Government, and I say this partly in response to that. My motion has received encouraging support from both sides, including from some very senior people&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.371.5/1">Yes, and the language in the Government response is that only those who are dependent on Equitable Life pensions will be compensated. That penalises people who are prudent and who have diversified their investments.</p>
	<p pid="b.371.5/2">I have two central criticisms and concerns. One relates to the endless foot-dragging, and the other to the compensation mechanism. Let me remind everyone of the foot dragging and how it happened. It first came to light in a debate in 1999. There was a very long period in which hon. Members of all parties pressed for an inquiry. Lord Penrose himself said that it was &quot;iniquitous and unfair&quot; that no inquiry was established until 2001. Then we had the Penrose report, which took two and half years to compile. In the findings, we had a mixture of policy failure, which is not a compensation injustice issue, and administrative failure. Lord Penrose clearly and explicitly acknowledged that administrative failure had taken place.</p>
	<p pid="b.371.5/3">I recall going to the ombudsman five years ago with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase>. Others will have done so at about the same time. The ombudsman's report took an awfully long time, and it eventually appeared in February 2007. It took the Government two years to respond to the ombudsman, thanks to the Maxwellisation delays and endless responses to requests for additional information. Now we have all the additional delay imposed by the compensation process. Therefore, endless foot-dragging has been the defining characteristic of every stage in this process, and it continues to this day. As hon. Members have said, time is of the essence for the pensioners. Some 30,000 have died since the collapse occurred.</p>
	<p pid="b.371.5/4">As for the compensation mechanism itself, several hon. Members have reminded us about the defects of the existing system. My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon aptly summarised them, and I shall make the key points. First, the ombudsman specifically recommended a tribunal system that was genuinely independent and transparent. Instead, we have had a Treasury-led process conducted by an adviser, who may be an admirable individual but simply does not have the powers to adjudicate in compensation that the ombudsman recommended.</p>
	<p pid="b.371.5/5">Secondly, the mechanism will relate only to those injustices accepted as such by the Treasury, which effectively has reduced by 90 per cent. the potential claims identified by the ombudsman. Thirdly, we have the means-test concept that has been introduced. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" name="Gordon Prentice">The hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)</phrase> helpfully intervened to explain the difficulties that that would present. Fourthly, we have the problem of the apportionment of blame, which still has to occur and goes contrary to the ombudsman's advice. We have had the rejection of interim payments, and we now have in place a slow, onerous and costly process that individual pensioners have to pursue. It is a dreadful story, yet, to this day, we have had no satisfactory resolution. I hope that the Minister will make some progress in this thoroughly reprehensible tale.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-19b.372.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1582" speakername="Mark Hoban" colnum="372"  time="012:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090519/halltext/90519h0007.htm#09051961000654">
	<p pid="b.372.0/1">I congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2034" name="David Davis">the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> on securing this debate and setting out very clearly the failings of the Government's response to the ombudsman's report. As hon. Members have said throughout the debate, the ombudsman is an Officer of this House, and she is entitled to our respect. Her report and the work that she does are very important because they give justice to our constituents. The theme of the Public Administration Committee's first and second reports on the ombudsman's report&mdash;&quot;Justice Delayed&quot; and &quot;Justice Denied&quot;&mdash;typifies the experience that many hon. Members have had when they have spoken to their constituents about the Government's response. There has been foot dragging to get to this point in the first place, then, in the Government's refutation of the ombudsman's findings, there has been an attempt to deny justice to many people.</p>
	<p pid="b.372.0/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase>, acting as recruiting sergeant for his all-party group, made a powerful plea for his constituents, as did other hon. Members on all sides of the House. Two themes emerge from the debate to which the Minister must respond. The first relates to the inadequacy of the Government's response to the ombudsman's report. That comes across very clearly in the Select Committee's report. In the supplementary memorandum to that report, the ombudsman gives examples of where she believes the Government have sought to reinterpret her findings, and where they have not given sufficient explanation of their response to those findings. The Treasury have sought to rebut such examples. The rebuttal of her findings is an important issue. An earlier legal case established that the Government were not bound to accept her report but had to give reasons why they chose to reject it. People want to see some cogent reasons for the rejection of her findings so that they can see whether the Government's approach was well thought through, logical and right or whether it was open to challenge.</p>
	<p pid="b.372.0/3">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> mentioned, when the ombudsman published her report in July, there had been a lengthy period of &quot;Maxwellisation&quot; beforehand. It is clear from reading the ombudsman's report that there had been significant discussion between the Government and the ombudsman about her findings and her approach. It is almost as if the Government are coming back for a second bite of the cherry.</p>
	<p pid="b.372.0/4">Given the number of findings of maladministration and injustice, which the Government have rejected, people expected that the Government would produce something more substantial than their command paper in January. When the Minister was quizzed on this matter by the Public Administration Committee, he said that he wanted something that was accessible and readable. The Committee rejected that approach. It wanted to see a much more substantial rebuttal of the ombudsman's findings to demonstrate that the Government had cogent reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.372.0/5">The Minister should take the opportunity today to accept that the Government's command paper was inadequate and to say that they will produce a much more substantial paper that sets out the real reasons for rejecting the ombudsman's findings. The Minister would do himself and the House a great service if he made that commitment today. At the moment, the policyholders feel that the Government are searching for some weak arguments to try to deny them justice. It is incumbent on the Minister and the Government to produce a much more substantial response that explains, in a logical and clear way, why the Government sought to reject the ombudsman's findings. That would provide the opportunity for a further debate on the Government findings. Such a debate may even prove that we are wrong and that our cynicism and scepticism about the Government's motives are incorrect.</p>
	<p pid="b.372.0/6">The second theme that runs through this debate is the process that the Government kicked off with Sir John Chadwick. By that I mean the basis on which payment should be made to policyholders. The process is not straightforward. In paragraph 5.26 of the Government's response, the Government set out four steps that Sir John would have to take. The first, they say, is to assess</p>
	<p pid="b.372.0/7" class="indent">&quot;the extent of relative losses suffered by Equitable Life policyholders&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.372.0/8">From looking at the PAC report, I know that there is no agreement, not even on what relative loss means and how it is calculated. Without that first step, it is very difficult to see how the second, third and fourth steps can be taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.372.0/9">One hon. Member suggested that Equitable Life had spent one hour with Sir John Chadwick to explain where the situation was and for Sir John to give his view. When will Sir John and the Government reach conclusions on relative loss and whether and when it will be calculated? Only when we understand the relative loss that people have suffered will we be in a position to take the debate further. We could then move on to the question of what proportion of the losses can be attributed to the maladministration that has been accepted by the Government in the actions of Equitable Life and other parties. However, the ombudsman's report was very clear: it set out the failings of the regulatory system and where injustice flowed from that maladministration. It is therefore hard to understand why the Government believe that there should be a sharing of responsibility between Equitable Life, the regulator and other parties.</p>
	<p pid="b.372.0/10">The concept of &quot;greatest impact&quot; has had very little explanation by Ministers. Is it about hardship? Does it involve means-testing? Is it a question of which policyholders have lost the most or the least? There is a lack of explanation from the Government. Only when we have such explanation will Sir John be in a position to advise the Government on what factors might be borne in mind to design a payment scheme for the policyholders who have suffered losses.</p>
	<p pid="b.372.0/11">My overwhelming feeling is that the Government, having delayed, hesitated and prevaricated for years in responding to the problems at Equitable Life, are again seeking to kick it into the long grass. In the same way that it took them months to respond to the ombudsman's second report, they want to delay dealing with the problem for years and to deny policyholders justice for yet longer&mdash;for years. That is not fair to the policyholders. Hon. Members talked about the numbers who have died awaiting justice. We know that many policyholders will be suffering losses and living on reduced pensions and annuities, waiting for the day that they can receive justice from the Government. Where is the Government's urgency in responding?</p>
	<p pid="b.372.0/12">On the Chadwick process, are the Government able to give any undertaking as to the time scale? The Minister said that it was not going to take as long as two and a half years, but when will policyholders begin to receive payments? When will Sir John publish his interim report, and will it include a timeline? Will the Government publish Sir John's interim reports in full and immediately? How many staff has Sir John recruited? I understand that he has sought some legal support from his chambers, but how many staff has he recruited? Does he have the necessary actuarial expertise on his team? How much have the Government allocated to Sir John, not only for his own fees, but for the team he will need if he is going to comprehend these complex issues? Those are important questions, and the answers will demonstrate whether the Government are taking the matter seriously, or whether they are seeking to avoid responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.372.0/13">The Minister said in an intervention that he thought that the Opposition would do the same as the Government. Let me be clear on the difference between us and the them: we have accepted the ombudsman's findings and recognise the claims of maladministration and injustice that she found. We also accept, as she made clear in her initial report and the section 10(3) report, that the relative loss that policyholders have suffered should be reflected. That concept has been agreed on both sides. We also accept, as she said, that the costs to the public purse need to be recognised. I was pleased that the hon. Member for Twickenham accepted that point when it was made by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" name="Oliver Letwin">the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.372.0/14">The ombudsman's recommendations need to be accepted. I welcome the fact that the Government have apologised for regulatory failures, but it is important for us to move forward quickly to provide justice for those policyholders. They cannot wait much longer. My concern is that every sign from the Government tells me that they want to kick the problem into the long grass and avoid dealing with it, meaning that justice will be denied to people who are suffering as a consequence of the regulatory failure of Equitable Life.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-19b.376.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1554" speakername="Ian Pearson" colnum="376"  time="012:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090519/halltext/90519h0008.htm#09051961000662">
	<p pid="b.376.6/1">In our response to the ombudsman's report, we gave detailed reasons. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1582" name="Mark Hoban">The hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban)</phrase> alluded to the Bradley case. The Government have to look at reports from the ombudsman and should only depart from an ombudsman's findings when there are strong and cogent reasons to do so. We believe that there are such reasons for departing from the report, which is why we have done so. We have accepted other of her findings.</p>
	<p pid="b.376.6/2">It is not quite true, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> suggested, that we have exonerated the previous Conservative Government and sought to put all the blame on the current Labour Government. We looked at the findings on their merits&mdash;it was not a matter of timing. For instance, we accepted part of finding 4, which relates to the period 1994 to 1996, and maladministration&mdash;but not injustice&mdash;in relation to finding 2, which relates to the period 1990 to 1993.</p>
	<p pid="b.376.6/3">I wish to address the concerns about remedy that the ombudsman has recorded and to take the opportunity to update the House on Sir John Chadwick's work. If there is time, I would like to inform hon. Members about the Government's response, which we have issued today, to the Public Administration Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.376.6/4">On the ombudsman's report's comments about remedy, let us be clear&mdash;this has been recognised in the debate&mdash;that one option open to the Government was to reject the recommendation for compensation on public policy grounds and to have left it at that. Indeed, the ombudsman acknowledged that in her evidence to the Public Administration Committee. However, we did not do so. We did not accept the compensation recommendation, but at the Government's discretion, and in recognition of the impact that may have been suffered by some policyholders, we have announced a scheme that will deliver help to those affected by the events at Equitable Life who need it most.</p>
	<p pid="b.376.6/5">The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden referred to the link between injustice and compensation. As he knows, the ombudsman, in her report, discussed breaking the link between injustice and remedy, and investigated what options for remedy had been in prospect from the start from the Government's perspective. She was critical of what she saw as selective use of the Penrose report.</p>
	<p pid="b.376.6/6">It has been suggested that the Government have relied on an absolute bar on payments of compensation for regulatory failure. That is not the case. At the outset of the ombudsman's investigation, we could not and did not close our minds to the possibility that compensation might be appropriate. However, the Government stand by the principle that we have articulated: it is not generally appropriate for the taxpayer to fund compensation even where there is regulatory failure.</p>
	<p pid="b.376.6/7">On the report by Lord Penrose, the Government have never denied that Penrose found fault with the regulatory system. Indeed, we referred to that in our response. The general principle, which I make no apology for repeating, is that the responsibility to minimise risks and prevent problems in a particular institution lies first and foremost, as the right hon. Gentleman noted, with the people who own and run that institution.</p>
	<p pid="b.376.6/8">The nature of the Government scheme has also come under scrutiny. The ombudsman has referred to the clarity of the process and the timing of the work that we asked Sir John Chadwick to undertake. It would be irresponsible of the Government to design a scheme without full knowledge of the facts. It is premature to speculate or draw conclusions about, for example, who will be eligible and for how much. That will be determined during the design process in the light of the advice received from Sir John Chadwick. However, as a Government, we recognise policyholders' legitimate interest in knowing the precise details of the scheme and when payments will be made. I assure them that we are working as quickly as we can to deliver the scheme. We have committed to giving regular updates on progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.376.6/9">In that spirit, I will update hon. Members about the work of Sir John Chadwick concerning Equitable Life. Sir John has provided the Treasury with an update on his recent progress that I can now share with the House. The task to which he has been appointed requires detailed consideration of complex matters. It has always been recognised that although he will seek to provide his final advice as quickly as he can, his task cannot properly be completed within just a few months. However, I assure hon. Members that we are committed to making speedy progress. Sir John's terms of reference require him to provide interim reports of his work on a continuing basis. I will now set out Sir John's summary of the progress made.</p>
	<p pid="b.376.6/10">First, Sir John has obtained, read and analysed the extensive material relevant to the ombudsman's findings relating to maladministration resulting in injustice, which the Government accepted in our response to her report. Secondly, he has established an office to manage the work that will be required, appointed the key members of his team and secured accommodation for them. Thirdly, he has met and corresponded with representatives of Equitable Life and obtained documents from that source, including specimen policy documents.</p>
	<p pid="b.376.6/11">Fourthly, Sir John has responded to an offer of assistance from the parliamentary ombudsman by requesting certain background material to which her report refers. Fifthly, he has replied to correspondence from numerous policyholders and former policyholders. Sixthly, he has interviewed applicants for appointment as actuarial adviser so that his office will have the expert technical support needed. The proposed appointment involves a number of commercial and technical issues that the Treasury is now addressing with its legal advisers. It is hoped that an actuarial adviser can be appointed shortly. Sir John expects to establish a website through which interested parties can keep informed of his work as it progresses and make representations to his office.</p>

	<p pid="b.382.1/1">We must certainly do everything that we can. I usually travel on First Great Western and must admit that some of the journeys I have taken on Arriva trains have been better. Much needs to be done to ensure that the service is absolutely reliable. Some of the rolling stock is not up to scratch, which causes problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.382.1/2">The train times appear to be dictated by the optimal use of the rolling stock, rather than by passenger needs. There are gaps of almost four hours between trains, which are mostly just 72-seat single railcars. The capacity is so low that when a local school recently wanted to send 30 pupils up the line for a study trip, the booking was refused for fear of overcrowding. Some services are little used because of timing. For example, the first northbound train leaves Swansea at 4.36 am and is therefore hardly used for the first half of its journey. The paucity of the service means that even when passengers find that they can get to their destination on time, there is often no suitable train for their return. Sometimes that works the other way around.</p>
	<p pid="b.382.1/3">The inadequacy of the service results from the inadequacy of the franchise specification. The formula required just a reproduction of the level of service immediately before privatisation. On the Heart of Wales line, the service had just been reduced from five trains to four so that was put in the franchise.</p>

	<p pid="b.383.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this debate and on promoting his early-day motion on the subject. He gave us a pictorial account of the beauty of this part of Wales. The Aberystwyth to Shrewsbury line is also very beautiful. Does he agree that the Heart of Wales line is particularly important to the tourism sector? Many tourists who arrive in south Wales will attempt to make the journey that he has made on many occasions and will be bewildered at the timetabling and the problems that he has outlined. That is not the way in which Wales should be promoted in the tourism sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.383.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. I pay tribute to the Aberystwyth to Shrewsbury line because, as he knows, I used to live in Aberystwyth. I thoroughly enjoyed travelling on that line, unless I was in a great hurry, of course. The potential for green tourism on those lines and on the Cambrian coastal line is tremendous, but that is not being exploited well enough. The most underused line is the Heart of Wales line.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.1/2">As I was saying, the inadequacy of the franchise specification is at the heart of the problem. The service on the Heart of Wales line had just been reduced from five to four trains, so that is what we had in the franchise. In contrast, that other beautiful Welsh line, the Cambrian Coast railway, which serves similar communities, had eight trains a day before privatisation, so its franchise requires that it still has that number&mdash;and good for that railway. The four-train timetable of the Heart of Wales line, with the last train leaving each end at about 6 pm, just cannot meet the needs of that, or, indeed, any other, 120-mile route. To confirm what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" name="Mark Williams">the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)</phrase> has just said, the director of the mid-Wales regional tourism partnership recently said:</p>
	<p pid="b.383.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The Heart of Wales line offers wonderful opportunities for rail tourism in Central Wales and the Border Counties, but we find it hard to promote because of the poor timetable&mdash;a train every 4 hours is just not enough.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.383.1/4">We need more services, and all the evidence demonstrates that that will require additional resources from the public purse.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.1/5">Let me pay tribute to all the communities along the line that support and campaign for it, and who show real ownership of the line. I also pay tribute to the Heart of Wales Forum, an umbrella group of providers and users that has worked assiduously, imaginatively and successfully, despite the major obstacles that I have outlined, to promote use of the railway. Let me also recognise the work of the Heart of Wales Line Travellers Association, which has kindly provided me with much of the information that I have used in the debate. More importantly, it has done invaluable work to map out a way forward and campaign for its delivery.</p>

	<p pid="b.384.1/1">I agree completely. That would be good for the environment and for supporting the line, and there are particular products&mdash;he mentions timber&mdash;for which that would be totally appropriate. I hope that we can move in that direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.384.1/2">I draw to the Minister's attention the main objectives of the strategy that the association produced at the end of last year. The first is to secure, as soon as possible, a fifth train in both directions between Shrewsbury and Swansea from Monday to Saturday. The second is to secure additional evening trains, and the third is to have a two-hourly service running on the line seven days a week by the end of 2011. The fourth objective is to improve facilities at stations, partly through the provision of a real-time information system, improved access and interchange, and, at some stops, personal security. The fifth is to improve infrastructure to allow trains to run faster, and the sixth is to improve the quality of rolling stock for comfort, access to on-train facilities, and&mdash;I would add&mdash;better visibility, so that views can be properly enjoyed. The seventh is to improve integration with other train and bus services, and the eighth is to ensure that resources are provided so that the management, organisation and development of the route is more appropriate and locally focused. I support those ambitious but realistic objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.384.1/3">Clearly, the Welsh Assembly Government have a lead role to play in bringing the line to the standard at which it will fulfil its potential for communities, local businesses and the delivery of beneficial green tourism. However, the line also serves part of England, and its enhancement could have enormous benefits for the border area to the east of Offa's dyke. I appeal to my hon. Friend the Minister to look at the problems and at the potential for this wonderful railway line, and to investigate whether the UK Government can work in partnership with the Welsh Assembly Government to begin delivering the improvements that are so badly needed, which have been clearly identified.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-19b.385.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1594" speakername="Paul Clark" colnum="385"  time="012:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090519/halltext/90519h0009.htm#09051961000686">
	<p pid="b.385.4/1">The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the general thrust of our work on railways is to reduce congestion on our main routes. The investment that there has been in infrastructure, including work on lines and electrification, is indicative of longer-term planning, as are the investment in rolling stock that we have announced through the high-level output specification programme, which has been brought forward as part of the fiscal stimulus, and specific rail infrastructure programmes such as high-speed lines. The focus is on dealing with the phenomenal increase in the patronage of railways, in the past 10 or 11 years, of almost 50 per cent., and on managing demand by making sure, first and foremost, that the capacity is there, and then by looking at new lines.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.4/2">Let me take some time to discuss the Government's approach to rural lines. We want to get the best value from local and rural railways&mdash;that is essential&mdash;so we need enterprising thinking about these lines and services. That is why we published the &quot;Community Rail Development Strategy&quot;, in 2004, which set out a number of ideas, including ways of reducing costs, increasing revenues and increasing community involvement in those routes. The 2007 White Paper, &quot;Delivering a Sustainable Railway&quot;, re-emphasised and confirmed ongoing support for community rail, and stated our continued commitment to the existing network, with no closures of regional or rural routes in England during the current railway planning period, which runs from this month for the next five years. That is the control period that we are discussing.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.4/3">At the core of our strategy is the bringing together of a partnership between the railway and the wider community to promote and support their lines. I put on the record our recognition of the work undertaken by the Heart of Wales Line partnership and the Heart of Wales Line forum. They have been involved in a number of initiatives to help drive patronage of the line and have established an interactive website, produced printed publicity materials and promoted rail access to local businesses. I want to put on the record that I know that active travellers' associations can work well in that way. Indeed, groups of station friends operate to make stations attractive, approachable and encouraging. Dolau station friends&mdash;if I have pronounced it correctly&mdash;is renowned for its work and has, in fact, won awards. More community involvement is part and parcel of the strategy to which I referred earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.4/4">Let me turn to the substance of the matter. On frequency timetables and where we are at, as I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Gower is aware, in the 1980s there were some five services a day. At that time, British Rail wanted to reduce costs and so it reduced the frequency to some four services a day, which is the current pattern. Indeed, when the franchise process went forward, the franchise agreement for Arriva Trains Wales was reached exactly on that basis. That agreement was, of course, let by the Strategic Rail Authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.4/5">As my hon. Friend has indicated, responsibility for franchise services on the Heart of Wales line has now been devolved and is entirely a matter for the Welsh Assembly Government. In the discussions that our Department has had with the Deputy First Minister and the Minister for the Economy and Transport in the Welsh Assembly Government, I have been advised that they have included additional Heart of Wales line services in their rail forward programme and that such services have high-ranking potential for early approval, subject to feasibility and business case appraisal. That, of course, is the case across the network for any additional services, whether in Wales or England. I understand that a number of options are under discussion but, as my hon. Friend has rightly recognised, that is a devolved matter for the Assembly.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.4/6">I have also been advised that the Welsh Assembly Government already fund a second winter Sunday train on the Heart of Wales line. The line has been included in the first two years of the Welsh Assembly Government's concessionary fares rail pilot scheme, which provides free travel to certain cardholders. I recognise the commitment that has clearly been given by the Welsh Assembly Government, and my hon. Friend will recognise the need for a business case to be made for additional services.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.4/7">I shall turn to the issues surrounding infrastructure. For the infrastructure to allow an increase in the number of trains operating and to ensure that the existing line is robust, we need to ensure that some of the passing loops are operational. Most of the track that we are talking about is single line and therefore passing loops are essential in ensuring that the existing line is robust for existing services and, indeed, considering whether there should be an increase in the number of services on that line.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.4/8">Currently, the Heart of Wales line has five passing loops, which are fitted with self-acting hydraulic points. Network Rail has informed me that it has had to cannibalise&mdash;if I may use that terminology&mdash;three operating units in order to keep others in use. However, Network Rail intends to restore&mdash;it will do this shortly&mdash;the operability of three of the loops, and it has funded a programme to renew the hydraulic switch equipment. I am delighted to report that Network Rail has advised the Department that it has undertaken work on the loop at Llandeilo, which will be reinstated in the next few weeks for operation. Network Rail's commitment to carry out the work to reinstate the passing loops for operational use is welcome and having all five loops ultimately back in use will certainly increase reliability and operational steadfastness. Network Rail's requirement is to be funded to maintain the steady state of the network in terms of capability and capacity, which obviously includes the lines in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.4/9">The independent Office of Rail Regulation is aware of the issues associated with the temporary reduction in the number of passing loops on the single track Heart of Wales line. Indeed, the ORR has informed the Department that it had discussions with Network Rail about its recent approach to maintenance on the line and what Network Rail intends to do differently in the future. The ORR is considering Network Rail's approach to the Heart of Wales line in the context of a wider assessment of Network Rail's infrastructure capability programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.4/10">My hon. Friend might be aware that Network Rail is seeking a short-term network change at each of the loops to formalise the current reduced capacity and capability of the infrastructure. Train and freight operators have been notified of that and have the opportunity to appeal to the ORR. I put on the record that both the Department and the Welsh Assembly Government have objected in strong terms to the proposed temporary loss of capacity on the line. I wish to make it clear that we believe there would be difficulties in terms of the vulnerability that would be placed on the existing line if anything were to happen at, for example, one of the other points or if there were a need for a redirection of services because of problems elsewhere in the vicinity. As I have indicated, it would be difficult to provide additional services considering the limited capacity in terms of passing loops. Indeed, I believe that special services are, for example, put on for the Royal Welsh flower show. Again, doing so would be difficult without proper provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.4/11">Let me deal with one or two of the other points raised. I notice that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit pik">the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> has had to leave but, on the matter he raised, the Cambrian line service from Aberystwyth to Birmingham New Street has recently been extended to Birmingham International. Improving reliability, dealing with the problems at New Street and the opening up of new journeys through to the airport and conference centres for travellers from mid-Wales has been part and parcel of those developments. Improvements have happened in that way. My response to the hon. Gentleman's intervention reflects my general comments and our overall thrust, which is about improving capacity within existing lines where possible and developing the amount of rolling stock, carriages and units.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.4/12">On freight, the Welsh Assembly Government have recently published a freight strategy, which includes financial assistance for freight facilities in Wales. Again, that is a devolved matter, but the steps that the Welsh Assembly Government have taken are welcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.4/13">In conclusion, as I said at the beginning, this debate has clearly put on the record the fact that treasure exists in Britain's railway network. That treasure is, of course, of importance for people going about their business, and, indeed, some of the steps being taken by the forum to promote the use of the line for business are part and parcel of recognising that. The line is also important for the vital issue of tourism. We will continue to maintain close relationships with our counterparts in the Welsh Assembly. Indeed, my noble Friend Lord Adonis met the Deputy First Minister just last week to discuss cross-border rail services. We will continue to work together to ensure that the needs of that railway and of constituents in Wales and the borders are met by a reliable service.</p>

	<p pid="b.389.1/1">It is a pleasure to speak in a debate with you in the Chair, Mr. Bercow. As usual for Westminster Hall debates, I have done my best to inform the Minister of the subject matter that I shall raise. I hope that she has received the information.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/2">I want to draw to the Minister's attention some case studies from my constituency of people who have had difficulty accessing appropriate national health service treatment; that is, treatment that has been recommended following dental diagnosis and which should, as far as I know, be available on the NHS. Not only that, these individuals have felt under pressure to go private, which raises an ethical question about how appropriate it is to restrict access to NHS treatment and then to follow that up with a tempting offer of potentially more successful or significantly more rapid access to private sector treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/3">I recognise that there is NHS and private provision of dentistry and that, sadly, the private provision is more widespread than the NHS provision. I have never understood why one part of the body should have a health service that is more privatised than that for another part of the body. In fact, it is not just teeth; foot care is increasingly privatised, so there is a foot and mouth issue around the increasing privatisation of services, although historically there has been significant private sector involvement in dentistry.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/4">Today is not the day to go into the detail of what I believe even the Government accept has been a failure to provide as much access to NHS dentistry as they would have liked, as citizens and patients deserve, and as successive Prime Ministers have promised. The Government will recognise that they are behind on their targets and that there are still problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/5">It is also not the day to go into the detail of the problems of dentistry from the dentists' point of view. They feel that the way in which the dental contract is organised means that they are constrained in what they can offer on the NHS if they are to make a living, run their business effectively and provide the quality of care that they want to provide. Dentists often say that it is because they cannot provide an adequate quality of care on the NHS that they leave the NHS to go private. It is not simply to increase their income but because they feel uncomfortable about the amount of care that they can give. There may be something in that; if so, it is an indictment of the contractual arrangements that the Government have set up if people get the right payment for NHS work but feel that they are not giving appropriate treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/6">I wanted to flag up those matters at the beginning but, as I said, now is not the appropriate time to go into detail about them. I also flag up the fact that there are still enormous inequalities up and down the country in dental health, particularly in respect of fluoridation policy, which is uneven. And, of course, there are other health inequalities.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/7">I have been notified of at least three cases, and I believe that the <i>Oxford Mail</i> has more, of people who do not feel that they have been treated appropriately by an NHS dentist who has offered private sector alternatives. I shall give a couple of case examples of which I have given the Minister notice. The names are invented to preserve anonymity; not even the initials match.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/8">Sally Reynolds is a constituent of mine. She had been a patient at her local dental clinic for many years, attending regularly every six months. She became disillusioned with the clinic last year over an episode involving a visit for root canal treatment. During that visit, she was told that the treatment could not be undertaken by the NHS dentist but that another NHS dentist at the same clinic would perform the treatment, but only if Ms Reynolds came as a private patient.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/9">I do not understand that. The extent of the treatment to be given for certain conditions, even painful ones, may differ between the NHS and the private sector, but if a dentist is an NHS dentist, they cannot say that they can exercise their expertise only in the private sector. In primary care medicine, there are clear rules about that. One cannot try to switch one's patients between the private sector and the NHS within a consultation. The clinic did not offer any help or advice as to whether or where the treatment might be available on the NHS. As Ms Reynolds was in considerable pain due to her dental condition, she had no option but to accept the offer to go private at that clinic.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/10">There is a specific issue when people are in pain. A range of desired dental interventions are not be covered by the NHS because they are deemed to be low priority and/or cosmetic, but, clearly, tooth pain is always covered by the NHS. If the pain is due to root canal problems, I would have thought that it should be capable of being definitively treated on the NHS, usually on a course of treatment that one should not have to wait too long for, even if the initial treatment is merely to deal with the pain. I would like the Minister to confirm that.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/11">Asking someone who is in pain whether they wish to go private and have the treatment, or not be helped at all, is not acceptable, even if the patient is able to go to an emergency NHS access clinic the next day or the next week to sort out the pain in the first instance. It is not acceptable for the prospect of private treatment to be dangled before patients on the day when they are attending a practice as an NHS patient.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/12">I serve on the British Medical Association medical ethics committee, which has given clear guidance about what consultants in an out-patient clinic, for example, should not say, even if it is true. They may say, &quot;I cannot treat you for this because we are not funded to do so&quot;, but they cannot then say at the same session, &quot;But I can see you privately in my rooms next week.&quot; They have to refer the patient back to the general practitioner or ask them to speak to someone else. They can answer only if the question is volunteered by the patient. At the very least, the same should apply in dentistry, especially if someone is particularly vulnerable because they are in pain.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/13">To continue the case study, following the root canal operation, Ms Reynolds was left in excruciating pain once the anaesthetic wore off, and painkillers did not work. That prompted her the next morning to call the clinic, which directed her to the NHS helpline. The helpline arranged an emergency appointment and further treatment at an emergency dental service at a different clinic. She had to take two days off work, and visited the original clinic the following week to have the tooth filled.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/14">Given the circumstances, Ms Reynolds understandably refused to pay the &pound;300 which had been verbally quoted. She did, however, pay what the cost would have been had the treatment been carried out according to the NHS code of practice. The dentist declined her payment.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/15">Ms Reynolds then wrote to the primary care trust to ask why the treatment was not available on the NHS. Apparently it began an investigation and visited the clinic, but could offer no explanation other than that the procedure was difficult, and few NHS dentists undertake molar endodontics. I consider that to be a poor explanation, as there apparently was an NHS dentist at the clinic who could and did undertake the procedure, but only under private terms.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/16">I am engaged in correspondence with the PCT. I am not asking that the Government cut across it&mdash;I am capable of having that correspondence&mdash;but I would be interested to know whether they recognise this as not simply a local issue in one area. If necessary, I will publicise the case through national consumer programmes to determine whether there is a more common problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/17">Clearly, there is a concern that the dentist in question said, &quot;I can't, but my colleague can, under private terms&quot; to build up the clinic's private practice at the expense of NHS patients or to boost its financial income. If root canal work is considered so difficult, why is it considered only a band 2 charge under the NHS dental charges regime? My understanding and, indeed, that of my constituent, is that to be an NHS dentist, one must have competence across a range of treatments.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/18">This year, Ms Reynolds attended the clinic for her next six-monthly appointment and was confronted by the same dentist who undertook her root canal work. The dentist informed her that unless she paid in full for the previous treatment, the clinic would no longer treat her as an NHS patient. She left without receiving treatment, and has told me that she considers such conduct to be equivalent to blackmail.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/19">I question whether such actions are appropriate. Cost recovery procedures may have to be undertaken, but they should not be a matter between an NHS dentist and a patient, or even a private dentist and a patient. The patient should come first. Bills can be chased through other means rather than by refusing treatment. I should like to hear the Minister's view on whether refusing to see someone as an NHS patient because there is a dispute is acceptable. At the very least, in the instance that I am talking about, there was a dispute and a complaint.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/20">Sally Reynolds has since been able to source another NHS dentist, but understands that others may not be so lucky. I share her concern. I wonder whether there is a trend among some dentists to try to deter people from registering as NHS patients so that they can concentrate on private patients, either for their own reasons or because the NHS dental contract does not permit them, in many cases, as I said earlier&mdash;and as many dentists and their association claim&mdash;to make a living with a high volume of under-remunerated, under-reimbursed dental work.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/21">The second case involves someone who I am calling Anne Cowley, who was refused root canal treatment by an NHS dentist on the alleged grounds that she was a new patient, because she had registered as a new patient. When she enquired how long she would have had to be a patient before she was entitled to treatment, the reason was changed and she was then told that the tooth was too far back in her mouth. She was faced with the prospect of going private for the treatment, which she could not afford. The dentist at the clinic offered to do the treatment himself privately for nearly &pound;500, but this did not solve her problem, because she had registered as an NHS patient to avoid having to go to a private dentist to have her painful condition dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/22">Anne Cowley has a further complaint, which is that she was treated rudely by the dentist and the practice&mdash;I am asking the PCT to investigate this&mdash;despite having been in considerable pain due to her condition for three weeks. Apparently, the dentist first said to her when finding out that she was a new patient, &quot;Tell me about your teeth. Please tell me there's nothing wrong with them.&quot; That may show that there is a general problem in dentistry, with dentists dreading new NHS patients with major problems, because they lose income owing to the remuneration available from the dental contract. That is what has been said to me, although I do not exclude the possibility of this being a local problem with a particular dentist or practice. The PCT has told me that it is looking at what action can be taken in respect of this case and I will be engaging with it.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/23">I have set out for the Minister two examples&mdash;there are others&mdash;and mentioned the ethical concerns, aside from rudeness and putting people in a difficult position with respect to money when they are in pain, about NHS dentists seeking to advertise their private practice to a patient in the chair who has come to see them as an NHS patient. Perhaps there is a role for guidance, at the very least, to be given to dentists by the Government through PCTs, which says, &quot;If you're faced with this problem, you cannot have that conversation with the patient in the chair,&quot; and, maybe, &quot;You are constrained from recommending your own practice as the provider of that private treatment.&quot; There has to be some constraint.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/24">Not having heard both sides, I do not have enough information to condemn the dentists complained about in these cases. It would not be appropriate for me to identify them or the patient, even if the patient was willing, without having heard their side. There is due process to go through in respect of complaints through the PCT. But my receiving three such complaints in the short space of a few weeks suggests that there is an underlying problem here, and I would be extremely surprised if it were confined to my constituency or to Oxfordshire. I should be grateful if the Minister responded to these cases in respect of the information that we have, which I accept is only from one side, and for any general points that she can make about both the ethical position and the position relating to the contract. I look forward to her response.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-19b.393.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1448" speakername="Ann Keen" colnum="393"  time="013:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090519/halltext/90519h0010.htm#09051961000690">
	<p pid="b.393.1/1">I understand that the figures are given retrospectively and that they have improved in the past year. I am happy to write to the hon. Gentleman about the figures.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.1/2">In Oxfordshire, there are areas where people are unable to see an NHS dentist as quickly as they would like. The hon. Gentleman may be aware that in the Oxfordshire primary care trust area the latest figures show fewer patients were seen in the past two years than the national average&mdash;46 per cent. against 53 per cent. I have been advised by Oxfordshire PCT that that reflects recent retirements and a reduction by some practices of delivery of NHS dentistry in the transition to the new contract, which was in place in 2006. But the PCT has not been idle. It agreed a dental commissioning strategy in July 2008, which will support improvements in access to NHS dentistry in Oxfordshire and lead to improved oral health for the local population. That is backed by increased funding. The PCT has received a 13 per cent. increase in its dental allocation, which is an additional &pound;2.6 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.1/3">The hon. Gentleman has raised the matter of access to root canal treatment. I am concerned to hear that some of his constituents may have been misled about the availability of root canal treatment on the NHS. It is important that individual patients receive all the treatments that they need and that NHS dentistry can meet all clinical needs. Patients should be able to trust their dentist to provide a comprehensive, high-quality service that reflects their needs and preferences. That is reflected in the principles and values set out in the NHS constitution, which was launched in January this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.1/4">NHS dentists have both a contractual and an ethical obligation to deliver all treatment that is clinically required, including root canal treatment. Indeed, they are paid to deliver such care. Although the vast majority of dentists provide excellent care for their patients, it is unacceptable for patients to be told that root canal treatment is not available on the NHS. Where that happens, it is important that the PCT takes decisive action.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.1/5">This morning, in view of this debate, I discussed one of the cases that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned with the PCT. The PCT informed me that the case was raised last week; that a remedial notice was sent yesterday to the practice, which was given 28 days to provide reassurance that it will not happen again; and that if the concerns continue, the PCT can terminate the contract. It has said that it will keep me informed. I feel confident that the hon. Gentleman will be interested in any communication that I receive, which I am happy to share with him. As he has said, it is difficult to comment on individual examples, but Oxfordshire PCT assures me that it has investigated the complaints and taken action.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.1/6">Pain is pain, wherever it happens in the body. Acute pain requiring root canal work is extremely distressing, and the ethics of how the patient is treated will always be of great concern to us all. Health professionals must, wherever they serve, behave as ethically as possible. I am disturbed to hear what the hon. Gentleman has said. If those concerns continue, the PCT will take action.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.1/7">Sometimes, a dentist is unable to provide a treatment because of its complexity. In such circumstances, they should refer the patient to a suitable NHS service that can provide the treatment. Those services are available, and many clinicians are renowned for root canal work. The PCT has worked with local dentists to improve guidelines and advice when patients need to be referred for more specialist NHS dental care.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.1/8">In the past year, the PCT has successfully improved access to NHS dental services in Oxfordshire by supporting practices to expand their surgery capacity, bringing in new dentists, making capital grants to support expansion and extending contracts. New providers have been established in Banbury, Wallingford and Oxford in the past 18 months, and 8,000 more people have been seen in the past year. The PCT is also targeting children in areas of deprivation with high levels of dental decay by providing topical fluoride varnishes in Sure Start centres. The hon. Gentleman referred to the inequalities in health and dental care, and it is important that the mum has good antenatal care, because teeth are formed before we are born. Fluoride is the most effective and cost-effective remedy for tooth decay and Sure Start centres, not only in Oxford, but around the country, are starting to address the serious inequalities in health. Those projects will expand next year.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.1/9">That is just the beginning. Proposals for 2009-10 include an additional &pound;4 million to continue improving access to dentistry until 55 per cent. of the population are covered. That funding will increase by another &pound;2 million the following year, as services become fully established, with the aim of reaching 64 per cent. of the population. New services opening this year include the Leys health centre in Oxford, which is due to open in July 2009, and will provide access for an additional 7,000 patients. That is an increase in provision for a population in an area of high deprivation, where people are currently high users of emergency dental services. There will also be new services in Bridge street, Banbury, which is another area with high oral health needs, and in Witney and Wantage.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.1/10">It is expected that those measures will enable a further 20,000 patients to be seen by an NHS dentist in Oxfordshire during 2009 and 2010. It is, of course, important that patients know where the new services are, and the PCT's dental helpline helps 40 to 50 Oxfordshire residents every week to find dentists who accept new NHS patients. The PCT is working with patient groups on ways to raise public awareness of that useful source of advice about local dental services.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.1/11">Oxfordshire PCT is being helped in its work to implement its dental strategy through the expanded national dental access programme that the Government have set up. The programme is being led by Dr. Mike Warburton, an experienced clinician and manager, and supports the NHS in rapidly expanding dental services where needed. The programme will work closely with Professor Jimmy Steele's independent review of NHS dentistry. That will also help us to understand how we can ensure that NHS dentists deliver consistently high-quality care while providing the right level of preventive work, as well as considering how we can further reduce inequalities in oral health.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.1/12">The core of our dentistry reforms&mdash;the NHS holds the dental budget locally and commissions dentists directly to deliver NHS care&mdash;is here to stay. There is no shortage of dentists wanting to deliver such care. In Oxfordshire PCT, the number of dentists increased from 262 in March 2007 to 289 in March 2008. If an individual chooses to leave, the local PCT can simply commission alternative care from another practice. Our NHS is confident that it can achieve its aim of delivering access to a dentist for all who seek it by March 2011. We strongly welcome the level of commitment to tackle dental access that that time frame demonstrates.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-19b.397.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" speakername="Richard Burden" colnum="397"  time="013:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090519/halltext/90519h0011.htm#09051961000695">
	<p pid="b.397.1/1">When people talk about Birmingham, they often refer to its diversity. Diversity means many things, but I am in no doubt that Birmingham's ethnic, cultural and religious diversity are great strengths in so many ways. If we are to address both the opportunities and challenges that diversity brings, we must understand the diversity of diversity.</p>
	<p pid="b.397.1/2">The ethnic mix of my part of Birmingham&mdash;an outer-city suburb south-west of the city&mdash;is not, in comparison with other parts of the west midlands, very multicultural. Yes, there are more people from new communities now than there were 20 years ago, but the make-up of my constituency is still more than 90 per cent. white. The dominance of white communities in Birmingham, Northfield obviously says something about the colour of people's faces in the area, and it may even say something about the likely religious make-up of the area, but it does not say very much about the diversity of the area in terms of class, life chances, income and opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="b.397.1/3">Nowhere is that more evident than in relation to education. That is why I am grateful for the opportunity to introduce this debate, arising from a report on the underachievement of white disadvantaged pupils in Birmingham. Although the report, branded &quot;Brighter Futures&quot;, was commissioned in 2005 by Birmingham city council with funding from the Learning and Skills Council, it was not published until the end of last year. However, its message remains relevant today, in Birmingham and at national level, and particularly in white working-class communities such as the one that I represent, which are often at the edge of our great cities up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.397.1/4">White pupils are the largest underachieving group in Birmingham and across the UK. That may seem a strange thing to say when, according to the Department for Communities and Local Government report, &quot;Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society&quot;, published in February 2009, 49 per cent. of white British pupils who were not on free school meals achieved at least five A* to C GCSEs in 2007. That was exactly the same as the national average for all pupils, but it was the figure for those who did not receive free school meals. When we look at white British pupils on free school meals, the proportion achieving five A* to C GCSEs falls to just 17 per cent. To put it another way, in 2007, 83 per cent. of white British pupils on free school meals did not achieve five A* to C GCSEs.</p>
	<p pid="b.397.1/5">That is a horrifying statistic, but it is all too often masked when figures for white British pupils are presented as a whole and therefore averaged out. If we stop talking about proportions and start talking about real numbers, the picture is even more disturbing. Why? Because quite simply there are a lot of white pupils. According to Karamat Iqbal, the author of the report that I am introducing today, in Birmingham 2,496 pupils out of a total of 4,795 who did not achieve five A* to C GCSEs in 2007 were white. The numbers are even worse when English and Maths are included, and they are disproportionately bad among boys.</p>
	<p pid="b.397.1/6">I say this not to deny that there are huge needs among other ethnic groups or that those groups require effectively targeted action, because they do. I say it simply to show that we must do more to address the huge impact of poverty, disadvantage and inequality within white communities or predominantly white communities. Part of that impact is obviously material. Poor housing, low incomes and family worklessness are bound to affect the practical ability of pupils to take advantage of educational opportunities to build their own futures, but it is about more than that. Disadvantage also undermines the resilience of communities and depresses aspiration in a destructive cycle.</p>
	<p pid="b.397.1/7">Again, according to the report's author, disadvantaged white pupils are the least likely to enjoy going to school, the least likely to think that it is important to get a college qualification and the least likely to think that it is important to go to university. How important is all that? In my view, it is very important. According to the report of the independent Social Mobility Commission in January 2009,</p>
	<p pid="b.397.1/8" class="indent">&quot;There is good evidence that success in education leads to improved life-chances. Therefore, improving educational outcomes for disadvantaged children has to be central to any policy strategy to increase their upward social mobility.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.397.1/9">I know that it is hardly earth shattering to note the impact of poverty on aspiration, educational achievement and life chances. The point is what we do about it. All too often, the sheer size of white communities and the tendency of institutions to consider proportional disadvantage between ethnic groups can end up averaging out deprivation statistics relating to white ethnicity. As a result, the scale of specific problems of deprivation in those communities is masked.</p>
	<p pid="b.397.1/10">What needs to be done? The first thing is to acknowledge the work put in day in, day out, by teachers and other staff, by parents and by so many people to address those issues on the ground. Just the other week, I saw what is being done to inspire pupils' passion for engineering and technology at the city learning centre in my constituency. It is based at Frankley high school, but it is a collaborative project involving a number of different schools, with welcome support from the Government. We should also acknowledge, in relation to both Birmingham city council and national Government, that a number of different initiatives have been and are being implemented that offer the prospect of addressing some of the problems of underachievement in deprived white areas more imaginatively than has been the case in the past.</p>
	<p pid="b.397.1/11">However, more needs to be done to address the issues both nationally and locally. We have to be confident enough to debate this issue openly. A specific recommendation in Karamat Iqbal's report is that the white ethnic category should always be subdivided according to eligibility for free school meals when statistics are compiled to inform education policy. The report makes several other recommendations, and I encourage my hon. Friend the Minister and other colleagues, both in this place and outside, to examine them. It stresses the need for a national strategy backed up by action at local authority level, including in Birmingham, with the involvement of parents and the wider local community and collaboration between schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.397.1/12">Beyond the recommendations in Karamat Iqbal's report, I emphasise the importance of addressing the realities of deprivation in white working-class communities when initiatives to tackle worklessness during the current recession are brought in, whether through the mainstream budgets of councils and Government agencies such as primary care trusts, regional development agencies, the Learning and Skills Council and Jobcentre Plus, or through the use of targeted funds such as the working neighbourhoods fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.397.1/13">It is good that super output areas are increasingly being used instead of local government wards to identify pockets of deprivation, but there is still a problem. In the Birmingham city region area, as much as anywhere, super output areas&mdash;those local areas that are used to target deprivation&mdash;are all too often grouped together into priority wards when resources are allocated. In Birmingham, where we are talking about wards of between 15,000 and 20,000 people, the averaging effect of that causes massive unfairness to the deprived white communities who live near, but not in, more affluent areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.397.1/14">Today is an anniversary: it is exactly 17 years since I made my maiden speech as the new MP for Birmingham, Northfield. The focus of that speech was deprivation in Britain's outer cities. Column 185 of <i>Hansard </i>for <phrase class="date" code="1992-05-19">19 May 1992</phrase> records that I said the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.397.1/15" class="indent">&quot;Unless and until we tackle the problem of poverty in our outer ring estates, we shall have increasing problems with racism. We must reject any attempt to stir up resentment against people who live in the outer ring or inner ring. We shall not achieve anything until we address the problem of poverty in the outer ring and empower the people who live there to contribute to their own destinies.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1992-05-19.185"><i>Official Report</i>, 19 May 1992; Vol. 208, c. 185</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.397.1/16">Yes, the Labour Government have made many improvements since 1997, but many of the problems that I highlighted in my maiden speech sadly still exist, and the racism that those problems breed is still being peddled by groups such as the British National party, which preys on the real problems that people face at this time of recession and their real fears for themselves and their families. In this week of all weeks, and today of all days, we should remember that it also preys on people's alienation from the political process. The truth is that the simplistic solutions laced with hate that the BNP and their friends peddle are blind alleys that offer nothing to our communities, but it is up to us to show in practice that there is a different way. Doing far more to respond to the reality of underachievement among white pupils in disadvantaged areas must be an essential part of that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-19b.399.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1766" speakername="Sarah McCarthy-Fry" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families"  colnum="399"  time="013:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090519/halltext/90519h0011.htm#09051961000696">
	<p pid="b.399.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> on securing the debate, and I certainly agree that it is well worth having such a debate. My hon. Friend works hard to ensure that people in his constituency and around Birmingham get the opportunities that they deserve. Indeed, he has been working hard to achieve that ever since he entered the House, as evidenced by his quote from his maiden speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.0/2">Before I move on to the specific issue of white disadvantaged pupils, which my hon. Friend raised, let me cover some more general points. Of course, no barrier should prevent a child from learning&mdash;whether that barrier is a disability, a special educational need, how much their parents earn or their occupation. There should be no barriers of gender, class or ethnicity. Black or white, boy or girl, advantaged or disadvantaged, every child should be able to make good progress at school, and that is what personalisation is about. That is an ambition that everyone can share.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.0/3">We have made significant progress over the past decade. On poverty, about 15 per cent. of children come from homes that are poor enough to be eligible for free school meals. In primary schools, 20,000 more free school meal pupils now achieve level 4 in maths at the end of key stage 2 than was the case 10 years ago. In secondary schools, the chances of an FSM pupil getting a good maths GCSE have increased from 25 per cent. to 35 per cent. over the past four years.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.0/4">However, there is more to do to tackle the gap between disadvantage and achievement. We know that that gap starts early&mdash;even before the age of 22 months&mdash;and it is vital that we address it as soon as a child starts their learning experience. By key stage 4, the odds of a non-FSM pupil achieving five good GCSEs are three times greater than for an FSM pupil, so we need to sustain support through primary school and on into secondary school.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.0/5">I assure my hon. Friend that the Government are taking steps to tackle the problem vigorously. During the early years, we are ensuring that families get the specific support that they need from our 3,000 children's centres. For children at school, we are modernising the curriculum by strengthening our focus on personalised learning, improving parental engagement and encouraging schools to work together to improve standards. Across our wider children's services, we are ensuring that health, mental health and social services are even more accessible and better co-ordinated through strengthened children's trusts.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.0/6">Let me move on to my hon. Friend's concerns about children in Birmingham from disadvantaged backgrounds. Let me first give some evidence of the progress that has been made in dealing with all children from disadvantaged backgrounds, before coming in a moment to the specific case of white children.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.0/7">At key stage 2, data for 2008 showed that Birmingham's FSM gap for English had decreased by two percentage points, from 19 to 17 per cent., from 2005, while the gap for maths had reduced by three percentage points, from 18 to 15 per cent., over the same period. At key stage 4, data for Birmingham show that the gap between non-FSM and FSM pupils who get five A* to C GCSEs has narrowed from 25.3 per cent. to 23.5 per cent., although that is still way too large.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.0/8">My hon. Friend is particularly interested in the case of white children. I note his concern that we risk masking the combination effect of disadvantage and ethnicity at local level by publishing data that show only one or other of those two effects, but not both in combination. He is correct that we do not publish data on the attainment of white children who are eligible for free school meals for every local authority, but that is simply a matter of manageability. Doing that for every underperforming group and every local authority would require us to publish an additional 150,000 items of data each year. However, we can supply such data on request for a given local authority, and I would be happy to give my hon. Friend the data that he requires. We also publish national attainment data by a combination of characteristics. Specifically, we publish data by gender, ethnicity and FSM&mdash;three characteristics in combination &mdash;in table A1 of the annual statistical first release.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.0/9">My hon. Friend referred to a report produced in conjunction with Birmingham city council and published last November, which dealt specifically with the underachievement of white British pupils, and I welcome the contribution that the report makes. I agree that we need to acknowledge the problem of underachievement among white children from disadvantaged backgrounds and to make the issue more visible at national and local level. That is why, from January this year, we are requiring local authorities for the first time to set targets for the progress and attainment of children who are eligible for free school meals, as well as for those from underperforming ethnic groups, so that they get the help that they need.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.0/10">Where those targets are insufficiently challenging, national strategies advisers have held detailed conversations with local authorities over the past few months, examining the scale of the issue, discussing local strategies to raise attainment for disadvantaged pupils and working with authorities to set more stretching targets for those pupils' progress and attainment.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.0/11">I agree that a national strategy is needed to narrow the attainment gaps between disadvantaged young people, whatever their ethnic group, and their more advantaged peers. That is why we published &quot;Breaking the link between disadvantage and low attainment&mdash;Everyone's Business&quot; this March, as well as the accompanying evidence report, &quot;Deprivation and Education&quot;. I commend those reports to my hon. Friend. Together, they spell out the progress that this country has made in reducing attainment gaps over the past decade. More importantly, they signalled our future policy direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.0/12">Among the highlights of the strategy are: an extension of free early learning and child care to around 23,000 of the most disadvantaged two-year-olds a year; tailoring learning experiences in school to children's needs&mdash;for example, through the use of one-to-one tuition; a new school report card, which will focus schools on the progress of all pupils and on narrowing the gaps not just in academic attainment, but across all five Every Child Matters outcomes; an expansion of extended services to disadvantaged families; and a full review of the relevant school funding&mdash;the &pound;3 billion that we allocate under the direct school grant for disadvantage&mdash;to ensure that it is properly targeted to meet the needs of disadvantaged pupils.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.0/13">I agree that we need a focus on community cohesion, the importance of which is reflected in the new duty on maintained schools, which came into effect in September 2007. That duty recognises, and builds on, the good work that many schools are already doing to promote community cohesion. Since September 2008, Ofsted has inspected schools against that duty. The issue needs to be everybody's business.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.0/14">I agree that we need to know what works. Sharing examples of best practice pushes forward positive change. Our Extra Mile project, which focuses on engaging children from deprived communities in their education, is based on approaches that we have seen make a real difference for disadvantaged pupils. The project currently runs across 23 schools, but it will be rolled out to another 60 secondary and 40 primary schools later in the year. Case study material will be published at the end of the summer term and made available to all schools and local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.0/15">Further examples of good practice in supporting disadvantaged communities are included in the &quot;Breaking the link&quot; document, in the recent Ofsted report &quot;White boys from low-income backgrounds: good practice in schools&quot; and in the National College for School Leadership publication &quot;Successful leadership for promoting the achievement of white working class pupils&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.0/16">I agree that we need to engage parents and the wider community in the work of schools. Parents are the single most important influence on a child's attainment, and we are taking forward a range of measures to strengthen parents' engagement in their children's learning. Our parental engagement strategy will: ensure that parents get more regular information about progress and that their voices are heard; legislate to ensure that there are strong children's trusts in every area, with schools, children's services and the voluntary sector working closely together to improve outcomes for children and young people; intensify the focus on personalised learning and on tracking the progress of every child through one-to-one tuition and catch-up programmes such as Every Child Counts; and legislate to ensure that there is a children's centre in every community, so that all children can get off to a good start in life.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.0/17">We recognise the significant impact that the community has on a young person's aspirations and attainment. Our Inspiring Communities programme will support people in deprived communities as we look to raise the achievement of young people, broaden their horizons and build self-esteem. The programme is designed to put local people&mdash; parents, neighbours, businesses, teachers, voluntary groups and councils&mdash;in the driving seat to harness their collective knowledge, energy, resources and enthusiasm. Expert help and funding of up to &pound;450,000 will be made available to up to 15 neighbourhoods over the next two years for the design and delivery of projects and activities. The deadline for applications is <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-03">3 June 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.0/18">My hon. Friend made the point that we need to provide opportunities for disadvantaged white pupils to celebrate their culture and identity. Experience in our Extra Mile project reveals successful strategies for developing an atmosphere in which that can happen. Our Extra Mile schools go out of their way to bring in local heroes, characters and successes as role models, so that people can see that success is possible for people from their walk of life. They teach pupils what they need to know about ways of talking, writing and behaving in the wider world, so that they have the repertoire to succeed in formal and unfamiliar situations. They educate for equality. They define non-negotiable standards of behaviour and a culture of mutual respect, which plays well with local parents, who value the twin traditions of discipline and personal caring. They apply that culture to teachers as well as pupils.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.0/19">Extra Mile schools provide cultural opportunities beyond the budget of local families, so that pupils get a taste of sports, arts and activities from which they would otherwise be excluded. The schools are socially attuned. New teachers tour the catchment area before they start to teach, take time to talk about local concerns with pupils each day and learn how to meet, greet and converse in ways that are not patronising. They empathise with the local community and local values. In the knowledge that poverty can induce feelings of emptiness and hopelessness, the schools work harder than others to provide rewards and incentives to pupils. Their notice boards are invariably plastered with honours, rewards, mentions, certificates and prizes. All those are successful strategies that can be used in any school serving a disadvantaged community, whether it is predominantly white or more ethnically mixed.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.0/20">In Birmingham, our national challenge programme provides extra support to the schools serving its disadvantaged communities. We have agreed a plan with Birmingham city council to provide it with a significant amount of national challenge funding&mdash;&pound;2.8million&mdash;in the academic year 2008-09. That will help 30 Birmingham schools to meet their wide-ranging set of specific school improvement solutions, as defined by their national challenge adviser. Those include one-to-one support for disadvantaged pupils, particularly in schools that serve disadvantaged communities; a focus on the wider Every Child Matters outcomes; and support for the schools' senior and middle leadership teams, which is intended to raise the effectiveness of the school and, crucially, its aspirations for its children.</p>

	<p pid="b.403.1/1">I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend. We hope that local authorities would do that anyway, but, as a way for us to help them to push that agenda forward, under the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill, which is currently going through the other place, schools become for the first time statutory partners on the children's trust board. The board is responsible for putting together the children and young people's plan. The guidance that we shall consult on at the end of the year will be about defining how the relevant organisations&mdash;schools, PCTs, Jobcentre Plus, the police and the local authority&mdash;work together to deliver exactly the services in question. There will not be one individual department working in isolation, but a community of those partners working for the benefit of children.</p>
	<p pid="b.403.1/2">Our forthcoming 21st century schools White Paper will deal with making sure, through our new school report cards, that all schools are measured not just on how well they support the progress of the average child, but on how well they stretch the most gifted and talented, help those who need extra support, and collaborate with other schools in their area to drive up standards. We shall want to include parents' views on the school report card as well, so that we have the important dimension of listening to parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.403.1/3">I understand my hon. Friend's concerns, many of which are replicated in my constituency. We are doing our utmost to ensure that everyone has the best possible chance of an excellent education. I have spoken about the challenges we face, and how we rise to the challenge. As I have said, breaking the link that my hon. Friend spoke about is everyone's business: it is the business of all head teachers and school teachers, in all areas, and of children's services and all sections of local government, as well as national Government. We shall all have to work together, as I have said, if we are to achieve that ambition.</p>
