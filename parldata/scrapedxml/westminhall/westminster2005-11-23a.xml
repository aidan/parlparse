<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.417.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1749" speakername="Bill Olner" colnum="417"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h01.htm#51123h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.417.3/1">I declare an interest as the joint chair of the all-party group on space, which has the support of nearly 100 Members, from both Houses and from both sides of this House. I am delighted to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1578" name="Ian Taylor">my co-chair, the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor)</phrase>, on the Opposition Front Bench, and to see the considerable number of members of the space group here. They, and you, Mr. Illsley, will know that my interest in space and my support for it in the House is of long standing.</p>
	<p pid="a.417.3/2">I asked for this debate for a number of reasons. First, the relevance of space to all of us is growing. We live in an information age, and much is possible because of satellites. Television, mobile phones, weather forecasting and satellite navigation are just a few things that show that our lives increasingly depend on space technology. Increasingly, space applications play a crucial role behind the scenes, monitoring disasters, assisting in aid efforts and driving forward our understanding of climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.417.3/3">Secondly, today's debate allows us to pay tribute to the lead role of UK space in that revolution. That role has been possible only because of sustained development and investment in technology over the years. I give the hon. Member for Esher and Walton credit for his work as a Minister in the previous Government to put forward joined-up thinking about space. Such thinking is crucial if the UK is to play a major role in Europe and across the globe and to get its share of space contracts in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.417.3/4">In March and November, the world's biggest and most sophisticated telecommunications satellites were launched. The Inmarsat-4 satellite series was made in Britain by EADS Astrium and operated in Britain by Inmarsat, the world's most profitable mobile satellite communications company. That is a triumph both of British technology and of British business success in using that technology to ensure that profits are made for British business. It is a shining example of technology transfer really working, involving British technology moving through to a British business and on into the global marketplace, all of which is a huge success.</p>
	<p pid="a.417.3/5">When UK space was not making the news, it was often behind the news. UK space is a vital part of the world's disaster monitoring and disaster management infrastructure, and British companies used British space technology this year to make a real difference to relief efforts after the Asian tsunami, the famine in Darfur and, most recently, the earthquake in Pakistan and Indian Kashmir. Our space industry is not just making money; it is saving lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.417.3/6">It is no surprise that the space sector is seen by many countries as a prize asset and a strategic asset. Britain spends &pound;195 million a year on civil space activities. That is equivalent to about a penny per person per day. Sadly, our level of spending as a proportion of gross domestic product is only 16th in the world; we are well behind the Finns and the Belgians. Although we do well, if we are to remain a world leader and a sharp cutter at the edge of this technology, we need more investment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.418.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" speakername="Nigel Evans" colnum="418"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h01.htm#51123h01_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.418.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if the Government were to increase that money, it would be not expenditure but investment? It would repay itself, not only because of the commercial profitability of which he has spoken, but because the skills that our space industry is famous for encouraging would grow and prosper.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.418.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1749" speakername="Bill Olner" colnum="418"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h01.htm#51123h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.418.1/1">Yes. There is always a semantic difference about whether funding is an investment or a cost. Money invested is space is just that: an investment for the future. As I shall say a little later, it is an investment because of the amount of technical expertise in the industry. The figures will become clearer later, but an enormous number of graduates take up worthwhile and meaningful careers in the space sector. Investment in the industry not only repays itself; it is an investment into the education of some of our young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.1/2">Across the UK, the space sector employs more than 15,000 people in more than 200 companies and offers some of the most exciting and rewarding work to be found anywhere. More than two thirds of the work force have a degree; they are probably the most highly skilled work force in British manufacturing, and they are adding value to Britain. By the Government's own measurement, the space industry is one of the most value-adding, generating about &pound;4 billion a year for the British economy. The global space industry is growing at 15 per cent. a year&mdash;past investment is paying off.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.418.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1708" speakername="Alan Meale" colnum="418"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h01.htm#51123h01_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.418.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on his speech about a very important subject. Although he calls for vast increases in investment in space activity, I am aware that he knows that a tremendous number of satellite operations have failed and that an extraordinary amount of rubbish is circulating the globe. Does he not think that Governments should invest, or have invested, huge amounts of money to clear up that mess before we further pollute the outer atmosphere of the Earth?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.418.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1749" speakername="Bill Olner" colnum="418"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h01.htm#51123h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.418.3/1">Yes, there is some space litter up there, and we probably need to pay attention to it. However, my hon. Friend's point about failed launches shows that, although we take for granted such things as getting a signal on our mobile phones or getting a television stream, such technology is at the cutting edge. Space technology is not just about pressing a button; it is not just a given. There are real challenges out there, and I think they are being addressed by our companies. We have failures, but our successes far outweigh them, which, unfortunately, are well publicised. The space industry is doing well in all that it does.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.3/2">At the European Space Agency ministerial conference, the UK must decide where it is going&mdash;not just where space technology is going, but where the country is going. The UK Government must make two decisions if we are to sustain Britain's bank of space technologies, which generate wealth throughout the economy. We must subscribe at the same level to the Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems technology investment programme. If space technology and the industry are to remain at the forefront of global efforts to combat climate change and develop a global early-warning system for natural disasters, we must play a leading role in the global monitoring for environment and security initiative. Those decisions will test the UK's aspirations to having a high-tech, highly skilled future and its global leadership in combating climate change.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.419.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1495" speakername="Cheryl Gillan" colnum="419"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h01.htm#51123h01_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.419.0/1">I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman for his long interest and expertise in the space sector. Does he agree that during the late evening debate on climate change last night, it was a little surprising that, in responding to my intervention, the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment did not appear to be entirely au fait with GMES and the role that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has to play? Does he agree that that is slightly alarming, and that it will be interesting to see the Minister's written response to me, which I hope will arrive before the ESA ministerial conference?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.419.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1749" speakername="Bill Olner" colnum="419"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h01.htm#51123h01_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.419.1/1">I did not hear that intervention on the Minister last night, but I assume that he is more au fait with the issue now and that it will burn in his mind when the ministerial conference comes up. It is important that all sections of the Government know the UK's position in the field of space technology and how crucial it is to get proper support from the various Departments.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.419.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" speakername="Jo Swinson" colnum="419"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h01.htm#51123h01_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.419.2/1">I add my congratulations to the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate. He mentioned the importance of GMES and UK space policy for helping to tackle climate change and for environmental monitoring. Does he agree that it is surprising that the UK Government are considering contributing only &pound;3 million when a UK contribution of &pound;11 million is required to fund GMES properly?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.419.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1749" speakername="Bill Olner" colnum="419"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h01.htm#51123h01_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.419.3/1">The hon. Lady makes an important point, which I was going to stress later: it is no good the Government just giving warm words and reassurance. Those things must be matched with the investment&mdash;spending is not just expenditure; it is investment in the industry. It allows the UK to play a major role with the rest of its European competitors.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/2">Space could well be used for many things. We all know that one of the Prime Minister's passions is Africa and how we are best able to help it. A company called Avanti is seeking to put a type of footprint over Africa that will allow various things on tele-medicine and tele-education to be streamed into Africa&mdash;things that we in Europe perhaps take for granted because we have overflying satellites that provide a footprint here. Unfortunately, the footprint is not as heavy as I would like it to be in Africa, and UK industry is able to play a role there.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/3">Such a role brings the industry into contact with the natural hazard working group, which the Prime Minister set up after the Asian tsunami in December last year. Its report said that</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/4" class="indent">&quot;there is a clear need for a sustainable and effective global multi-hazard early warning system building on existing capabilities and frameworks.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/5">Keeping our eye on the planet will help our ability to forewarn, particularly in Africa. Famine is one of the scourges in Africa, whose climate leads to failing crops. Being better able to predict and plan for such events will start to put the world in a better position to assist people living where natural disasters might occur.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.420.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1578" speakername="Ian Taylor" colnum="420"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h01.htm#51123h01_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.420.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend&mdash;I use that phrase as the hon. Gentleman is my co-chairman on the all-party group on space. Will he pay tribute to Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd's disaster monitoring constellation, which uses four big satellites and which is now part of a wider operation ensuring that natural disasters are monitored?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.420.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1749" speakername="Bill Olner" colnum="420"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h01.htm#51123h01_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.420.1/1">The amount of intelligence and skill that we have put up in the skies to be able best to monitor some of the natural disasters that happen all over the globe is not generally known about.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.1/2">I hope that the Minister will address the point about DEFRA and the minimal UK contribution to GMES, because the UK needs to make its position known at the ESA ministerial meeting in December and needs to be a lead country in space. The fact that DEFRA plans to put in less than &pound;2 million a year for the next two years is a disaster. That is part of a UK contribution totalling less than &pound;3 million a year. If we were talking in billions or could add a couple of noughts to those figures, we could, and would, be looked at as a major player. Although &pound;2 million or &pound;3 million is still a lot of money to me&mdash;I still have not made my first million&mdash;in the run of things it is paying lip service to something that needs better investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.1/3">Other hon. Members want to speak, so I will curtail my comments. Next month the Government face a decision. The question is not: &quot;Are we in space or are we not in space?&quot; It is far simpler than that. The question is whether we really want a high-tech, highly skilled economy and whether we really care about climate change and natural disasters. If the answer is yes, we need to sustain our support for ARTES and to play a leading role in GMES. Anything less would simply pay lip service to our vision not only of a better Britain, but a better world.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.1/4">In my early teens, as an apprentice at Bristol Siddeley Engines, I developed a keen interest in space. In the early 1960s, we manufactured launchers. We have not manufactured many since, unfortunately, but the UK and its industries have since played a major role in harnessing for the betterment of mankind the advances in communication and observation that I have spoken about. We must not allow the position that we now enjoy to be lost. I look forward to hearing from the Minister the assurances that I and the industry require and which are so crucial.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.421.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" speakername="Nigel Evans" colnum="421"  time="09:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h01.htm#51123h01_spnew11">
	<p pid="a.421.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1749" name="Bill Olner">the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner)</phrase> on securing the debate. As he said, it is important because of the ESA ministerial meeting that will take place on 5 and <phrase class="date" code="">6 December</phrase>. He noted the small amount that this country spends on space activities. We have only to look at the expenditures of some other countries to see a stark difference. That is worrying. It is not that if we do not engage in space activity, it will not happen. If we do not engage in it, other people will. That means not just that we will lose out, although clearly we will, but that the skills with the space industry and the profit related to it&mdash;the wealth of a country can be measured in many ways&mdash;will be lost to this country and go elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.0/2">Where will those things go? Clearly the United States of America is spending vast sums on space activity&mdash;it always has&mdash;but we should look at China. It has an ambition to put a man or woman on the moon, and there are a number of other activities that the Chinese want to engage in. The Chinese do not want to do that for nothing. They know the importance of space, which is why they want to be involved and why they are spending somewhere in the region of $620 million on it. That figure will increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.0/3">The decisions to be taken next month are important for us. The hon. Gentleman referred to the fact that DEFRA plans to spend something like &pound;2 million a year on space, which is a ridiculous sum of money. He spoke about natural disasters and climate change. Everybody talks about climate change, and we must do a lot more about it, but that will not happen on its own. A vast amount must be invested and, frankly, &pound;2 million is chicken feed in the context of what we need to do.</p>

	<p pid="a.421.1/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that it is appalling that we spend about &pound;195 million a year on civil space activities, whereas France spends &euro;1.9 billion and Germany spends &euro;850 million? Our spending on civil space activity falls behind 15 other countries, including Finland and Belgium.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.421.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" speakername="Nigel Evans" colnum="421"  time="09:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h01.htm#51123h01_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.421.2/1">It is embarrassing. I am looking at the tables showing what other countries are doing. We know about China. It has growth rates of about 8 per cent and it is definitely growing its space programme. The same is the case in Russia and in India, which also has growth rates of about 8 per cent. and is spending $500 million. We are spending almost half the money that India is spending on space activities. I am worried that we will lose all the skills involved and that Britain will be seen as a country that is not interested in or committed to the space programme. When other collaborations take place in the future, Britain will not even be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/2">There is also great worry about whether skills can be retained. There are tremendous skills in this country. For example, I visited Astrium, which builds satellites. We should be proud of the absolutely fantastic skills in that company.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1708" name="Alan Meale">The hon. Member for Mansfield (Mr. Meale)</phrase> referred to debris in space. A great deal of attention must be paid to how it can be managed, and since the pollution of space is clearly in no one's interest, that is something in which this country could be involved.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.422.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1578" speakername="Ian Taylor" colnum="422"  time="09:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h01.htm#51123h01_spnew14">
	<p pid="a.422.0/1">There is the prospect of a Dutch satellite that will gulp up debris. I believe that that project is private-sector driven, and perhaps my hon. Friend would like to consider it. The serious point is that we must clear the way for other satellites to be launched and ensure that no damage is done to them.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.422.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" speakername="Nigel Evans" colnum="422"  time="09:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h01.htm#51123h01_spnew15">
	<p pid="a.422.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point about the project being commercially driven. There is a great deal of money to be made in the space industry, so it is commercially attractive to companies. However, there is definitely a need for the Government to drive progress harder and faster than is currently the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/2">Various activities are involved. For example, we discussed telecoms. I remember that when I first became a Member of Parliament in 1992&mdash;never mind when others first became MPs&mdash;the internet was in its infancy, and satellite television was just starting, but look at the situation now. We have a choice of 300 channels and that number will grow. It will not be long before we all hold devices that allow programmes to be beamed down to us wherever we happen to be. The excitement in the telecoms market is superb. I am delighted that Britain is at the forefront of the telecoms market, but we must continue to invest on a much larger scale if the industry is to have a future.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/3">The hon. Member for Nuneaton discussed the number of space industry jobs in this country and the fact that two thirds of them are filled by people with university degrees. That is superb, and we want to further it. I hope that the Minister will comment on the closure of physics departments in universities, the shortage of physics teachers in schools and the fact that many youngsters are not interested in physics. That worries me. We will store up trouble for the future if we do not try to correct that.</p>

	<p pid="a.422.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that it would also be interesting to hear from the Minister what progress this country is making on the Lisbon goal? It appears that we will not meet the target, which means that we will not produce the number of scientists needed to support our economy or the European economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.422.3/1">The attitude in this country to science, and scientists and physicists, must change. I hope that the Minister will say something about that. A couple of weeks ago, I spoke to a constituent who visited the House of Commons. He said that he was the last physics teacher in his university, and that he was on a short-term contract&mdash;a 12-month contract. I do not know how people are supposed to plan when they are on such contracts. He feared that the whole department might close. Scientists are respected in other countries, but we do not treat them the same way.</p>

Under this Government, expenditure will go from 1.9 per cent. to a target of 2.5 per cent. for 2014. That record is better than his party's.</p>

	<p pid="a.423.8/1">I congratulate Glasgow, of course. It is tremendous that all parts of the United Kingdom should get involved in the opportunities relating to space. The hon. Lady mentioned enthusiasm and excitement and that is what space provides. It captivates people, as Beagle 2 did; people were excited. I went to the Royal Geographical Society when Beagle 2 was separated. Prince Andrew turned up, it was exciting and everybody was enthused and gripped. It was a shame that the project was not a success, but I do not think that it diminished people's enthusiasm for space, its potential and what can be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.8/2">The hon. Member for Nuneaton mentioned climate change and the natural disasters that seem to befall Earth far too often these days. That is where space can play its part, too.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.424.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1766" speakername="Sarah McCarthy-Fry" colnum="424"  time="09:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h01.htm#51123h01_spnew28">
	<p pid="a.424.0/1">I, too, am a member of the all-party space group. Why I should want to become a member was a source of perplexity to some of my parliamentary colleagues. To many people, space technology means either space exploration or boys' toys&mdash;the &quot;Star Trek&quot; or &quot;Star Wars&quot; syndrome. Whether one has aspirations to be Captain Kirk or Luke Skywalker, there is another important aspect of space, which is the eco-warrior role. The role of the space industry in monitoring, tracking and ultimately helping to reverse&mdash;or at the very least better manage&mdash;climate change is crucial.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/2">A few weeks ago, I was fortunate enough to be invited to the European Space Research Institute at Frascati in Italy to watch a video link to the launch of the Cryosat satellite. All seemed to be going well, but unfortunately after what we thought was a successful launch, the satellite ended up plummeting into the Arctic ocean. It was a bitter blow for the British man, Dr. Duncan Wingham, whose brainchild the satellite was. It was going to survey from space the thinning of the Earth's icecaps and provide the clearest picture yet of what climate change is doing to our planet. We monitor from the ground, but that is not good enough. The information that we could have got from the satellite would have been crucial.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/3">The aborted launch brought home the fact that space is still an inexact science. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1708" name="Alan Meale">my hon. Friends the Members for Mansfield (Mr. Meale)</phrase> and for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner) remarked, we do not yet have all the answers. However, we have a wealth of opportunity. The satellite was launched on top of an old Soviet SS-19 ballistic missile. I could not think of a better example of the swords-into-ploughshares argument: a rocket designed to destroy parts of the Earth being used to launch a satellite that was going to help save it.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/4">Climate change is probably the most important global issue, and I want to make sure that we do not lose the opportunity to gather important data. The data that that satellite was seeking are essential to our understanding of climate change, would have given scientists a definitive picture of the rate of thinning of the Arctic sea ice and would have enabled them to improve computer models of climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/5">Will Europe approve a replacement satellite? That is one of many issues that will be debated at the European Space Agency ministerial meeting. Cryosat cost &pound;90 million, which is not insubstantial. However, the project director said:</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/6" class="indent">&quot;You have to see the replacement cost in context, there is a cost in not knowing what is going on and in the end that's an even larger cost.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/7">If a decision is made quickly, much of the original team will still be in place, so we will not need to reinvent the wheel. The original satellite took seven years to build, and it is estimated that if we move quickly, a replacement could be built in three. That is better than seven years, but it will be three years in which the icecap thins still further and scientists do not have the information they need. That is just one example of the importance of the space industry, not only to the United Kingdom, but much further afield.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/8">We have reached the point where we must ask whether we want the UK to be a major player in the space industry. Last month, Lord Sainsbury of Turville, the Minister for Science and Innovation, said that UK Space's importance as a contributory factor in achieving our goal to be Europe's leading knowledge-based economy is without question. However, we are at a crossroads. Without continuing investment, we will not be able to play that role. Space is one of the few industries in which Britain retains a comprehensive design and integration ability and it employs the most highly skilled work force in British manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/9">Ironically, it was a British man, Arthur C. Clarke, who found fame and fortune from space&mdash;not from designing or manufacturing space hardware, but by writing about it. He was my literary hero during my teenage years. I found his books fascinating, because although they were fiction, they were rooted in real scientific ideas. He was a man way ahead of his time. He predicted communication satellites way back in 1945 and inspired generations of young people to dream about space.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/10">In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States Apollo missions inspired a generation of Americans to go into science, engineering and technology. A MORI poll last year found that 70 per cent. of young people would be encouraged to go into science, engineering and technology because of UK involvement in space, but we need to have a space industry for them to use their skills in.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/11">When I watched the doomed Cryosat launch last month, I found it fascinating that the technology for putting satellites into space was still basically a giant firework. Once again, we can turn to Arthur C. Clarke for inspiration. His view is that the rocket has as much future in space as dog sleds have in serious Antarctic exploration, but at present it is all we have. However, he came up with the vision for communication satellites remaining poised over a fixed spot on the equator by matching their speed to the turning Earth. He progressed that idea in his book &quot;The Fountains of Paradise&quot;: by adding a cable linking the satellite to the ground, payloads could be hoisted mechanically and reach their orbit without the need for expensive rocket power. He called that a space elevator and although at first it was just a fanciful idea, since the discovery of material with which it could be built&mdash;the third form of carbon, C60&mdash;it has become a real possibility. It would have the effect of massively reducing the cost of putting payloads into space. We should imagine what the growth effect of that would be on the UK satellite industry and what it would mean for the UK economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/12">In my constituency, I have seen the effects of job losses across industry and, in particular, jobs going to the low-cost eastern Europe and Pacific rim countries. However, we should examine which jobs are being outsourced; by and large, they are at the low-skill and low-tech end of the market. The key to retaining jobs in the UK is to maximise the number of high-skill, high-tech jobs, and that is exactly what jobs in the space industry are.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/13">EADS Astrium, which is one of the UK's leading space companies, employs around 1,000 people in my constituency. They have highly skilled jobs, which is precisely what my constituency needs in order to be a driving force in the knowledge-based economy. We need many more knowledge-based, high-tech, science-based industries and I want my constituents to be able to obtain the skills they will need to work in those industries. There is so much good work going on in my constituency to encourage young people into those career paths. EADS Astrium has sponsored the local girls' school to become a specialist school in science and maths. The support and help of such a leading player in the space industry helps to inspire schoolchildren to take a positive look at science, engineering and technology opportunities. School standards in my constituency are still below the national average, despite huge improvements since 1997. I welcome the involvement of such a major high-tech company in helping my young constituents to reach their potential and to have an ambition beyond working in McDonalds&mdash;not that there anything wrong with working in McDonalds, but it should not be the only choice. The head teacher is very enthusiastic about the project and has said that attaining specialist status in science will give the girls in her school a unique opportunity to acquire the technical, and ultimately transferable, skills that they need to thrive in the 21st century. However, what is the use of their gaining those skills if we cut the legs from under the UK space industry through short-sighted cutting of funding?</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/14"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> has left, but referred to the European global monitoring for environment and security programme and said that the UK should contribute around &pound;11 million a year to maintain our position in the driving seat of that programme. If it is true that we will contribute only &pound;3 million, it sends the message to our European partners that the UK does not want to be a leading player in the co-ordinated European effort on environmental monitoring, including disaster management and monitoring climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/15">The UK holds the EU presidency and recently held the chairmanship of G8. Our Prime Minister has said that tackling climate change is a key part of those roles, but we cannot do it alone. We must bring other countries on board, but if we cut back our contribution, what message will that send out?</p>

	<p pid="a.426.0/1">The hon. Lady is making an excellent speech and I agree with every word that she utters, so I will call her my hon. Friend. Does she agree that we are not talking big bucks in terms of Government spending? We are talking about the difference between a commitment of &pound;3 million and the amount that industry and outside assessors have arrived at, which is &pound;11 million. That is just pocket change to the Government, even though it is taxpayers' money. It is almost ridiculous that we have to fight for that money and encourage the Government to spend it when the Prime Minister rightly said at G8 and various EU meetings that he wants to take a lead. Showing leadership would surely mean finding this small amount of money.</p>

	<p pid="a.426.1/1">I hesitate to say that I agree with the hon. Lady, but it is good that we have cross-party consensus on driving space industry forward because we all realise its importance. One difficulty is that different Departments contribute, and in this debate we can impress on the Minister the fact that we need a co-ordinated effort across Departments. The matter is important to the UK economy and for jobs in my constituency, but there is a much wider importance and the effort needs to come not just from one Department. I hope that the Minister will pass that message on.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/2">The GMES programme is vital for the early warning of environmental disasters and climate change. Returning to my favourite hero, Arthur C. Clarke once said:</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The dinosaurs are not around today because they didn't have a space programme&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/4">He said that the meteor that released the poisonous chemicals and created the cloud that blocked out the sun could have been foreseen and averted with a sufficiently advanced space programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/5">The natural hazards working group, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton referred, acknowledged that earth observation, space science and space engineering are key parts of our scientific knowledge bank and are helping us to understand and prepare for natural hazards.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/6">I have spoken today from the perspective of my constituency about the economic aspirations of the young people of Portsmouth and wanting it to be a high-tech, high-skilled city, but the consequences of not supporting the GMES programme with the full commitment go far beyond the borders of my constituency. We would let down not just my constituents but people in other parts of the world who might face tsunamis, hurricanes or earthquakes. We have a responsibility to our children and grandchildren to do all we can to tackle climate change. By supporting the space industry, we could do that.</p>

	<p pid="a.427.1/1">I do not intend to keep the Chamber for long. I am delighted that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1749" name="Bill Olner">the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner)</phrase> secured this debate, for which several of us applied.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.1/2">It is important that we have this brief debate because it is a considerable time since we have had a chance to debate space. With the important decisions coming up in the next few weeks, I am grateful to the Speaker, who had the foresight to grant it. However, I am less impressed with the Government&mdash;I apologise to the Minister if I imply a personal criticism&mdash;who do not see fit to devote their time to debating or examining policy in this area before taking fairly serious decisions that will affect our businesses and research councils.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.1/3">Space is exceedingly exciting. I went to a Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council exhibition the other day, which was, rather inappropriately, held in the Treasury. I had with me a schoolboy doing work experience, who was very enthusiastic about what he saw in the presentation on what was happening in space. For example, it was good to find, even under the auspices of an anonymous philanthropist, that the opportunity for schools to use a telescope directly through computers in their schools is being made available through Cardiff university.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.1/4">A couple of weeks ago, I visited Salford to look at the Group 4 Securicor tagging and monitoring exercise, where I saw the satellite tracking that is being used in two pilots&mdash;among the three being conducted by the Home Office&mdash;monitoring the control of criminals at the end of their sentences when they are in the community. I was impressed by what has already been shown up by those pilots. I hope that the Minister will familiarise himself with the commercial applications for space, which are paying our society dividends.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.1/5">I shall concentrate mainly on one aspect, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1766" name="Sarah McCarthy-Fry">the hon. Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry)</phrase> mentioned. How do we ensure that the benefits from space research flow through to our space industries? I yield to no one in my admiration for the successes achieved by our space scientists in pushing forward our knowledge of the universe and its origins, and there is a lot to say about that. However, I am concerned that we are not optimising the industrial benefits that should flow not only from scientific research, but from civil research, whether funded by the Government, the European Space Agency, the EU or our space industries.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.1/6">Like many people, I do not see the issue as political and I certainly do not raise it to score political points because many of the problems have existed for some time, whether under a Conservative Government or the current Labour Administration. I raise the matter from a genuine desire to engage the Government in a discussion and to find a solution. I share the Government's objectives to exploit space technology to benefit us through improvements in communications, Earth observation to monitor climate change and all the other items that have been mentioned in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.1/7">Massive improvements have been made in using space technology, but it is not functioning correctly. The problems result from the machinery of government and are, therefore, all the more difficult to solve. As the practical uses of space extend, more Departments are affected. Having recognised that some 20 years ago, we established the British National Space Centre to act as a focus for space activities, both internationally through ESA and the EU, and recently, bilaterally with China. Internally, BNSC acts as a forum for interested partner Departments and the scientific research councils. All the agencies and councils have worked together well and achieved some great successes.</p>

	<p pid="a.428.0/1">Does the hon. Lady agree that we are in danger of missing a golden opportunity, because Departments are not talking to each other? The Department of Trade and Industry has put in an awful lot of work and money. Lord Sainsbury has been a tremendous champion of space over many years. We are fortunate that he has held that position for so long. The problem is not Lord Sainsbury, but the fact that other Departments do not realise the relevance of the space industry and of joining all the bits together.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.429.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1495" speakername="Cheryl Gillan" colnum="429"  time="10:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h01.htm#51123h01_spnew34">
	<p pid="a.429.0/1">The hon. Gentleman takes the words out of my mouth. I am certainly not laying the blame at the door of Lord Sainsbury, who is a space enthusiast, as far as I know. Indeed, I say that while sitting next to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1578" name="Ian Taylor">my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor)</phrase>, a well known expert who was a first-class Minister on the subject. I am trying to focus the Minister's mind on joined-up government. The hon. Member for Nuneaton makes my point exactly, and I think that he probably agrees with me.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/2">Although the BNSC, through the DTI, can fund industrial research via the European Space Agency, my concern is that funding applications in the public sector become the responsibility of the relevant Department, whose main interest is not space. A current example is the European space navigation project, Galileo. That is an agreed European project funded mainly by the EU, but with ESA as the up-front research organisation&mdash;its responsibilities include the first four proving satellites. Funding is required from both the DTI and the Department for Transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/3">I hope that I am wrong, but there are signs that the Department for Transport cannot fully provide the funding required and that our industries could well lose out rather than cash in on all their work. I seek reassurances on that from the Minister. There are similar potential problems with international efforts to use space technology to help on climate change. I refer to global monitoring for environment and security&mdash;GMES&mdash;which we talked about earlier. It seems that DEFRA will find that funding is wanting, with disastrous consequences in my view and that of many people in this House and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/4">The Government, in common with previous ones, have long insisted that our space industries should share in funding research and that we should not just look to taxpayers' money for funding. Our industries have responded to that challenge better than industries in other European countries where Government funding is more forthcoming, and I admit that there have been notable successes. For example, the privately funded consortium launching Paradigm's Skynet has proved a great success at providing communications satellites for our military. However, Galileo is a European, publicly funded project. Our industries have won an impressive share of the work, but that will be realised only if the Government are prepared to fund their share alongside other European countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/5">This and similar cases raise the &quot;machinery of government&quot; issue. Unless we can find some way of ensuring that Government-funded research is followed up with Government-funded support for public sector projects, our space industries will not benefit fully from the research that they and the Government initially funded. After all, we are talking about front-edge technology that is recognised as being critical for the UK, particularly as lower-technology industries are taken over by developing countries. I hope that the Minister will take that thought away from the debate and examine whether improvements can be made to Government arrangements that will benefit our space industries and ensure that what we have already invested is not wasted for want of a ha'p'orth of tar.</p>

	<p pid="a.430.2/1">How could I ever forget the famous by-election? We were both part and parcel of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" name="Nigel Evans">The hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans)</phrase> made a doom-and-gloom speech, attacking the Government's science and technology policy. I do not want to make the debate partisan, but the hon. Gentleman has sufficiently provoked me to do so. As somebody who has worked at the sharp end of research most of my adult life, was a practising scientist and engineer in research and specialised in engineering before entering the House, I can tell him that I have never seen a Government devote so much of their resources to tackling science and technology, its problems and the contribution that it makes. UK space policy is part and parcel of that, and it is a great credit to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.2/3">I speak loudly in praise of the Government. I know that the Minister will do a grand job because he excels in every Department in which he has served. I speak loudly also of Lord Sainsbury of Turville, whom my hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton mentioned. Lord Sainsbury is one of the best Science Ministers we have ever had. He is exemplary and outstanding, and his contribution has lifted the spirit of science and science policy in a way I have never known in all my years following science policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.2/4">The issue I take with the hon. Member for Ribble Valley concerns the figures I quoted for the increase in investment in research and development, from 1.9 per cent. of GDP to 2.5 per cent. by 2014. Those figures are quoted in &quot;Science in the New Parliament&quot;, a report by the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, which is an independent body. I wanted to put it on record that I did not pluck those figures from the air. That is why I asked the hon. Gentleman to give way earlier.</p>

	<p pid="a.430.3/1">I wonder why the hon. Gentleman thinks that the French and the Germans spend so much more than we do. Does he not think that we are missing a trick, that it is an investment and that it would benefit us if we spent more?</p>

	<p pid="a.430.4/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but we should remember the base from which we started, and where we were under his Government. That is the difference. Under his Government, science went downwards. I praise <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1578" name="Ian Taylor">the former Minister, the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor)</phrase>, because he did a great job under difficult circumstances when the country's finances were screwed up. The credit goes to this Government, however, because our finances are healthy. That is why we are able to invest in science and technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.4/2">I praise the Government, and one of their greatest achievements has been to secure money for science and technology. Much credit goes to our Prime Minister, because he speaks with great passion for science, and to the Chancellor. The ideas that we develop, we translate through action.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.4/3">I support many points that hon. Members have made about the need to spend more money. I am happy to go along with that, but we must recognise what has been achieved. That is important, because it was not always so. Year after year, scientific research grants were cut at universities. That is not the case now because budgets have been growing, which is a great credit to this Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.4/4">I agree with some points that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1495" name="Cheryl Gillan">the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)</phrase> made about exploiting the UK's space policy and technology. I am happy with that, because I recognise the contribution that space policy would make, assisting us with the problem of climate change, developing climate model forecasting and dealing with coastal and flooding problems. Climate change will be an important issue during the next five years and more, because it is on our doorstep.</p>

	<p pid="a.431.0/1">As the hon. Gentleman has chosen a party political platform, perhaps he would acknowledge that the British National Space Centre was started by a Conservative Government. He should face Lord Hunt of Wirral in the other place and tell him that we did nothing about science and technology. We did a tremendous amount about it, including starting the framework for action, and the hon. Gentleman should be better informed on such matters before he starts slinging things at previous Conservative Governments.</p>

	<p pid="a.431.1/1">I am happy to make such acknowledgements and I was not slinging things. The Nietzschean picture of doom and gloom painted by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley is not my view of science and technology. I was trying to help the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham and was agreeing with some of her important comments. She was right that we have to exploit these things. I did not try to demean the previous Government. I tried only to paint the picture.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/2">I agreed with the hon. Lady about one issue, which was the drop in the number of students studying physics. If we are to create scientists and engineers to deal with the problems of UK space policy, we have to train scientists and we ought to have more physicists. I find it sad that the number taking physics at school is dropping in the country that gave Newton, Faraday and Maxwell to the world. We do well at primary school level in getting children interested in science. At secondary level, things seem to go in the wrong direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/3">I speak as a strong friend of the Government and praise their achievement, but my hon. Friend the Minister ought to have some words with the Secretary of State for Education and Skills. We ought to consider why those things are happening; there is no magic answer. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley gave no explanation of how to deal with it. He just said, &quot;Enthusiasm, enthusiasm, enthusiasm&quot;. That is fine, but we can create only so much enthusiasm before it reaches a certain level. It existed in the spirit of scientific innovation once upon a time, but I know that we have moved away from Faraday and Newton and individuals do not do research in the way that they did; they work in collaboration either in research institutions or internationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/4">To a certain extent, I am concerned, just as the hon. Member for Ribble Valley is. We must look ahead and the situation I describe is the thing that we must get right if we are to create world-class physicists. That is one thing about which I strongly agree with him. I am sure that the Minister will address it because it is worrying, as is the situation in relation to chemistry departments mentioned by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/5">I was not trying to make a partisan speech. I had not even prepared to take part in this debate. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley provoked me into doing so by trying to rewrite the achievements of the Government. This is the first time that I have spoken loudly on science policy on behalf of the Government. As I said, it is a testament to our very good Minister for Science and Innovation, who has achieved a great deal. I idolise him and think that he has done a marvellous job. He came to my constituency several times trying to encourage youngsters to study science and he was there during the election campaign. In fact, he visited one of the science labs at Laurence Jackson school.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/6">Ministers can do only so much. Nevertheless, we must take seriously the concerns that I have addressed. As one who had no intention of taking part in the debate and ended up making a 10-minute speech, I think that I ought to shut up and sit down.</p>

	<p pid="a.432.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1749" name="Bill Olner">the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner)</phrase> on securing this debate on the exciting subject of UK space policy. Although it is now nearly 50 years since the first satellite was sent into orbit, space exploration remains exciting and full of prospects for understanding the origins of the universe and life on Earth. There is also the tantalising prospect of finding evidence of life on other planets. Space studies continue to advance our knowledge of the universe and the fundamental laws that govern it. Although the exciting part of space is often exploring other planets and trying to understand the origins of life, the space industry is an important one in many other respects and can bring many benefits here on Earth.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.0/2">Satellites play an important role in communications and navigation. For example, the Government's proposals for road-user pricing would be impossible without satellite technology. Satellite services have a crucial role to play in extending broadband networks to households throughout the country, particularly in those remote and rural areas that are too far from telephone exchanges to be able to receive broadband on a landline. Satellites can also play an important role in monitoring the Earth, helping to forecast the weather, measuring climate change and aiding responses to natural and man-made disasters.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.0/3">Space is a high-value global industry and Britain a world leader in many aspects of space technology. An estimated 15,000 people are employed in more than 200 companies in Britain in space-related jobs. The jobs are highly skilled, and more than two thirds of the workers hold a university degree. The industry generates about &pound;4 billion a year for the British economy, and it is therefore important that we maintain it.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.0/4">It is vital that our schools and universities continue to produce people with high expertise in science, especially in physics, chemistry, astronomy and maths. Young people must be encouraged to take those subjects at school and university. The excitement and possibilities of space travel and exploration certainly encourage young people and must be used for that purpose. In order to achieve that, we need more graduates of those subjects teaching in our schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.0/5">We also need to address the supply of research scientists. We need to ensure that there are physics departments in local universities and that these subjects are sustained and grown. We need to tackle the problem of short-term contracts and job insecurity for science post-doctoral researchers. We also need to recognise that increased student debt deters graduates from going into teaching and research in the public sector and encourages them to go into higher-paid jobs in private industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.0/6">Investing in space involves cutting-edge technology, which is obviously very expensive. Co-operating with our European partners clearly makes sense. Roughly two thirds of the UK's budget is spent through the European Space Agency and EUMETSAT&mdash;the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites&mdash;which provides and operates Europe's weather forecasting satellites.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.0/7">The procurement system used by ESA is known as &quot;fair returns to contributing nations&quot;. That means that the bulk of the contracts are awarded to companies simply because they are in countries that have contributed to the ESA budget and not necessarily because they are the most cost-effective bidders. That is not a sensible system. Awarding the contract to the most cost-effective bidder would be better and would reduce costs. However, given that that is the system, it is important that Britain contributes, so that British companies can gain a fair share of the contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.0/8">The loss of the Beagle 2 Mars lander was referred to earlier in the debate. It was clearly a setback to the UK's involvement in space, but we should not allow that setback to deter us from undertaking future projects. It is necessary to take risks to make scientific progress and in a cutting-edge business such as space, some projects will inevitably be disappointing failures. Beagle 2 was an exciting project and high-value returns were possible, so it was right to take risks.</p>

	<p pid="a.433.0/1">We talked about the failure in that case, but Mars Express&mdash;we are involved on three of the instruments that are being used&mdash;is bringing back much information from which we will benefit. The successes clearly outweigh that one failure.</p>

	<p pid="a.433.1/1">I agree. As I was saying, we should not allow that failure to put us off taking risks. It is important, however, that, when a project involves a significant risk, there should be a thorough feasibility study to identify the risks and options, investigate potential benefits and accurately estimate of the project costs. If it is decided that we should proceed with a risky project, it is important to ensure that, having carried out the feasibility study, the project is properly funded. Trying to cut corners is often the road to disaster.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/2">We should take risks to explore space. Britain is a world leader in space industries and space offers exciting prospects. I hope that the Government will do all they can to maintain that leading role.</p>

	<p pid="a.434.0/1">I am grateful to my co-chairman on the all-party group on space, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1749" name="Bill Olner">the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner)</phrase>, for securing this debate and to colleagues on both sides for contributing so knowledgeably. This important debate is about an important subject, just ahead of the upcoming European Space Agency ministerial conference.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/2">I pay tribute to my successor as space Minister. My only successor, believe it or not, is the noble Lord Sainsbury. I was the Minister for three and a half years. Most of my hon. Friends thought that that was far too long and that I was in orbit for most of the time, but Lord Sainsbury has had a remarkable record and I pay tribute to his enthusiasm. If there is one drawback of his continuity in the post, it is that the space Minister is not a Member of this House, which has sometimes held back some of our discussions. However, I believe that his enthusiasm has kept the space budget at the forefront.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/3">We should not play party politics too much. I happen to have a good memory of the period in which I was the Minister for Science and Technology, and it does not matter what the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, on whose council I serve, says. One of the good things I was able to do, when my ministerial colleagues at the Department of Trade and Industry were not watching, was to grab some year-end funds and put them into the space budget. The British National Space Centre, the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council and others were rather grateful for that.</p>

	<p pid="a.434.2/1">That intervention was pretty infantile, if I may say so. I was saying that the space budget during my period as Minister compares very favourably. There is no doubt that the overall budget for science and technology has gone up under this Government, as I have said many times in the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.2/2">One of the key things to come out of this debate is the enormous excitement and importance of space. There have been many examples of that this year: the Venus Express has just been launched and Mars Express has been mentioned. Although Beagle 2 was ultimately lost, a lot of its technology has been captured and will be reused in other missions. The Huygens probe has landed on Titan; the Inmarsat launch will be vital for global communications. Those are really big issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.2/3">No one doubts that space issues are crucial. The question for the Government is about their tactics at the ESA ministerial conference. What key issues will they raise? There are some big questions. The ARTES programme, which has been mentioned, is pretty crucial. ARTES has mixed funding, from industry and Government. Even Lord Sainsbury has said that we can get a measurable commercial return on ARTES investment of at least six or seven times. In that context, it is genuinely an investment. It represents perhaps about 80 per cent. of UK space industry activity, yet makes up only 10 per cent. of UK civil space spending. What is the Government's commitment for further work on ARTES?</p>
	<p pid="a.434.2/4">GMES has been mentioned. It is important and fulfils all the criteria on environmental monitoring set forward by the Government themselves, yet the participation level that the Government are committing to is, in my judgment, sub-critical. What will the Government do about GMES?</p>
	<p pid="a.434.2/5">On the space science side, will the Government continue to commit to Aurora? I shall mention two other programmes that will not be discussed at the ESA ministerial conference. There are still top-up funding arguments to be made on Galileo, which is vital for the UK space industry. We have already won contracts for the two preparatory satellites from EADS Astrium and Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd, but there are many other upstream and downstream implications. I should be grateful if the Minister had a word with his Ministry of Defence colleagues about TopSat and how we will continue that investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.2/6">When I was Minister, I found that the key thing about the space industry is that it really wants to work with the Government, the European Union, which has now taken on a space role, and the European Space Agency to turn technology into wealth, to amplify skills&mdash;they were mentioned earlier&mdash;and to improve academic excellence. We have some fantastic universities&mdash;I do not have time to mention them all&mdash;and detailed knowledge of what is happening in space and some of the work that is being done. Such work is exciting and inspirational to younger people, yet DTI funding of the national programme has been cut alarmingly. I believe that it is only some &pound;5 million or &pound;6 million, whereas it used to be well into the twenties. What is the future of the DTI's investment in the national programme? How will the British National Space Centre, which has been reviewed several times, not least by the National Audit Office, improve its game in respect of co-ordination across Government Departments, which was one of its original functions? It seems not to have gone much further than persuading the Department for Transport to put some money into Galileo, and, in fact, that is with the Department now.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.2/7">There must be drive and determination. This is not a personal comment on the individuals involved, but the centre is not seen by the outside world as a driving force across Government Departments, which it needs to be, as the space industry now affects so many aspects of our lives. The DTI certainly is not the space ministry. The Department of Health, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for Transport are all vitally involved in the downstream use of space. As they are, in a sense, the consumers of space-derived material, to what extent should they also be the anchor tenants in projects and have extra funding, rather than just depending on the DTI or the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council?</p>
	<p pid="a.434.2/8">I want to give the Minister a full opportunity to respond, as we do not get ministerial statements on space often enough. There are challenges. For example, is he content that during our presidency we are taking a lead on space policy in the European Union, which now has a dedicated space ambition? I have not seen evidence of that. Are we on top of the marriage between space and security? A panel of experts on space on security has produced an interesting report. What are the implications for Britain in the security aspects of, for example, GMES and Galileo? It seems that the rest of the EU is thinking about those fundamental questions but we are not articulating them.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.2/9">Is the Minister content that the expenditure in available budgets is properly balanced between science, industry and industrial applications and enabling technologies? Is a further review intended?</p>
	<p pid="a.434.2/10">There has been a succession of space policy documents. I am glad to say that mine in 1996 was the first, and there have been some excellent ones since, but I am worried that we are fudging some questions, perhaps because of budgetary pressures or because we have not really decided what we want to do in the future. I recently saw a Royal Astronomical Society report on the scientific case for human space exploration. It reads extremely well, but I urge the Minister not to be seduced by the idea that Britain should start investing in manned space exploration. We have not dedicated enough money to existing space activity, which has a much higher priority. I was the Minister who decided that we should not have an active role in the international space station, simply because it would have sucked out money disproportionately from every other activity. I was not convinced that it was good science anyway, and I believe that my successor, the noble Lord Sainsbury, has been grateful to me ever since.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.2/11">I do not believe that the Government's expenditure on space has reached critical mass. Let us not argue about statistical analyses of the past. I am dealing with issues that confront us today and with new programmes. Indeed, I would argue that during the eight years since I was Minister, space has become more central to decision making in Government. What was only beginning to be anticipated, for example, in the use of space to evaluate fraud in the EU and in the common agricultural policy has now become a central platform of what the EU wishes to do, much to the irritation of some member states, incidentally. Most of the fraud in that area is not carried out by the Commission but by member states. Nevertheless, it is of extreme importance for the use of space for the practical delivery of policy. That is an important point, and we have not previously been able to utilise it.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.2/12">On disaster monitoring, the satellites launched by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. with some interesting partners&mdash;Nigeria and Algeria&mdash;cover an area of the world that is prone to problems. Someone mentioned the tsunami in the Indian ocean; that was picked up and tracked by satellites. Sir David King, the chief scientific adviser to the Government, did not sufficiently show in his report the way in which satellites can help us to monitor and anticipate such events. I would wish the Minister to have a further word with Sir David about the role that satellites can play.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.2/13">This is an opportunity for the Government to show leadership. I wish my party were in government; we are not. That is something for the future. I assure the Minister on a personal basis that if the Government take a lead in space policy, he will have strong support from the Conservatives because of the national importance attached to it for science, discovery, skills and its industrial base.</p>

Friend the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner)</phrase> on securing it. Indeed, all the contributions have been excellent. I felt quite humbled in being unable to match from my earlier career the experience and interest of some of the people present.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/2">On the subject of Arthur C. Clarke, as every schoolgirl knows, this autumn is the 60th anniversary of his proposal that we should use geostationary satellites for global communications. As I recall, that was published in <i>Wireless World</i> in October 1945. That is a useful reminder.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" name="Ashok Kumar">My hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar)</phrase> has learnt a new scientific law of political science this morning. If someone attacks the Government, that is above politics and statesman-like. If they have the temerity to defend the Government, that is sheer partisanship. We have learnt a new law of one of the softer sciences, which we should all reflect on.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/4">This is an opportunity to consider the UK's role in space. I applaud the work of the all-party parliamentary space committee&mdash;I feel jealous that I am not a member, and I must declare it as an interest. The debate is certainly timely. In Europe, the world, and the UK, decisions are being taken and new developments taken forward. The UK is taking a leading role. Although there are issues and concerns, we have a great deal to celebrate in our space sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/5">I will start with Europe, where the UK has taken centre stage throughout our EU presidency. A joint European Union/European Space Agency space council will focus next week on the programme definition for global monitoring for environment and security. Our success in taking forward the European space programme will set the pattern for the future framework of European space initiatives. The EU is an increasingly important user of space, and we support an approach in which Commission directorates use space when that is the best means to achieve policy goals. It should not seek to enhance its status by prestige projects, however.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/6">A week later, the ESA ministerial council will see important decisions taken on the level of UK involvement in key ESA programmes. We will contribute to programmes that meet our economic, scientific and technological objectives. The ESA matters enormously to us. About 60 per cent. of the government's civil space spend is invested in its activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/7">The United Kingdom also leads on the global stage. We are coming to the end of our G8 presidency, and space has done much to help us meet our objectives in support of Africa and climate change. That environmental theme has been a feature of this morning's brief but important debate. In providing images of changing land usage, environmental changes, and the impact of human and natural events, space offers detailed data and images that cannot be obtained by other means. Satellites played an important part in the response to a number of recent events, such as the earthquake that had such devastating effect in Pakistan and the terrible hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the United States.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/8">As many people know, the UK, through the British National Space Centre, took the chair of the committee for earth observation satellites in November 2004; it passed to Argentina last week. The committee has an important role in co-ordinating space-borne information systems, and the UK has sought to develop that role. In support of that vital work, it was announced last week that the UK-led disaster monitoring constellation has been accepted to operate within the international charter for space and major disasters. UK technology can now play its part in helping to respond to major disasters.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/9">Finally, on the international front, the UK has taken the initiative in considering the threat from near earth objects&mdash;what most would call asteroids and comets. The threat is not just good fodder for films such as &quot;Armageddon&quot;; although it might bring some solution to concerns about avian flu, it is nevertheless a serious matter&mdash;and not only to those on the Liberal Benches.</p>

	<p pid="a.438.0/1">Before the Minister leaves the international scene, will he comment on what is happening with the space race? First, it is being led by the United States, which is currently pursuing a policy that would give it territorial rights in space. Secondly, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1578" name="Ian Taylor">the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor)</phrase> asked about security in defence. The American Government&mdash;or should I say the President?&mdash;have announced a $25 billion programme for defence in space, which includes space-to-space as well as space-to-earth defence activities. Will the Minister comment on those factors?</p>

	<p pid="a.438.1/1">If my hon. Friend will forgive me, I need to make a number of other comments in response to the debate. However, I shall draw those matters to the attention of the relevant Defence and Foreign Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/2">I shall speak next about our national priorities. The UK space strategy for 2003&ndash;06 sets out three objectives for the use of space, all of which require a dynamic and innovative space sector in order to succeed. I believe that those objectives remain a sound basis for the next UK space strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/3">The first objective is to maintain high-quality science&mdash;another theme of this brief debate. We have all seen the value of collaboration through ESA in the recent exciting results from Cassini-Huygens. The first pictures from the surface of Titan were astonishing. Another recently launched mission with major UK involvement is Venus Express, which plays well with our interests in climate change. Science is also about advancing our understanding of our environment. Much has been achieved in developing stronger capabilities in services aimed at prevention, forecasting and assessment of damage from disasters.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/4">The second objective is to stimulate commercial use of space and to develop not only the important upstream areas of space but to identify areas where carefully focused investment will lead to significant downstream economic benefits. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1837" name="Barbara Follett">My hon. Friend the Member for Stevenage (Barbara Follett)</phrase> has spoken to me about the importance of that to her constituency. The telecommunication and broadcasting sector makes up 80 per cent. of all UK space industry turnover. There is now a large commercial space industry, worth more than $100 billion globally and estimated to be growing at 9 per cent. a year. We must, of course, be part of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/5">The Government seek to support the development of technology for the space industry. However, we should not forget that the overall UK budget for space has risen from &pound;160 million in 2002&ndash;03 to almost &pound;200 million in 2004&ndash;05. I am sure that others will consider the words of colleagues: in an ideal world we would be spending more. That has been a strong theme of the debate, but the Government are proud of our record, not least in relation to the overall science budget. When making international comparisons, we should recognise that, in my judgment, the return on our investment exceeds&mdash;I shall be tactful&mdash;that of many of our counterparts.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/6">The third objective is to seek to identify and support projects that most benefit the lives of citizens in the UK and the wider world. Galileo has been mentioned. The UK is committed to that important programme. It is a key part of the infrastructure that is necessary for a digital world. The UK has made a strong technical contribution, but there is still much to decide both now and in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/7">To respond to a point raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1495" name="Cheryl Gillan">the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)</phrase>, I am advised that the UK has contributed more than 17 per cent. of the cost of the early phase of Galileo. We also contribute through the EU budgets. Decisions on funding for the next phase have not been taken, and I understand that discussions could proceed well into 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/8">GMES was mentioned. It is well known to the DTI and across government. Over the past few years, we have been able to demonstrate the benefits of a series of practical services from the GMES programme. Their value was dramatically shown in the aftermath of the Boxing day tsunami.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/9">The UK's achievements in this area are credible, and I want to address some specific issues. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1708" name="Alan Meale">My hon. Friend the Member for Mansfield (Mr. Meale)</phrase> mentioned the clear-up of space debris. The UK is working in the inter-agency space debris co-ordination committee&mdash;I wish I was a member of it, but, sadly, I am not&mdash;to address problems and to develop codes of conduct for the disposal of satellites. It is important that we are concerned not only about waste on our own planet.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/10">Education was another theme of the debate. I know from my time as Minister for Lifelong Learning in the then Department for Education and Employment that that is a matter of great concern to Ministers with responsibility for education, and rightly so. We are all concerned about what has happened in respect of physics teaching. There are programmes to address the problem, and to get competent scientists to teach in our schools; there are salary inducements and other incentives. I am not saying that we have entirely cracked the problem, but colleagues are on the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/11">The development of sector skills councils, which I had a hand in when I had ministerial responsibility in that area, is important, as is the interface with education more generally. I am pleased that the Department for Education and Skills is now a member of the British National Space Centre; that is an example of joined-up policy that shows that we are moving in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/12">Parliament has shown a strong interest in what we are doing in respect of space. In the past few years, there have been inquiries by the Trade and Industry Committee and the Science and Technology Committee, and the Public Accounts Committee has addressed the subject, too. There has also been discussion of asteroids and the European Space Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/13">It is encouraging that there is that level of interest in the subject. Reviews have shown that spending on space is good value&mdash;it is a sound investment in an exciting sector that can only become more important. Parliament's interest helps the country to know about space and informs discussion on the subject. We are at the end of an exceptional year in space, and this debate has very much been in keeping with that positive tradition.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/14">I will draw the conclusions and judgments of Members in this debate to the attention of Lord Sainsbury of Turville, and I welcome the tributes that have been paid to the important role that he has played in government and industry.</p>

	Jobcentre Plus Customer Management System
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.441.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" speakername="Anthony D Wright" colnum="441"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h02.htm#51123h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.441.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Illsley, and to have secured this timely debate on the Jobcentre Plus customer management system. It will have a profound effect on most, if not all Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/2">The CMS has been designed as part of a complex plan to centralise and streamline the benefit system. I will focus on the roll-out of the CMS at the contact centre for the east of England, which will operate in tandem with the benefits processing centre in Norwich. The contact centre is in Lowestoft. I should add as a footnote that Great Yarmouth is 20 miles from Norwich and 11 miles from Lowestoft.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/3">Before CMS, any prospective claimant had a choice of ways to start their claim. They could telephone or attend the local office, where queries on the relevance of questions in the claim forms could be raised. Alternatively, they could collect forms from the post office, general practitioners' surgeries, citizens advice bureaux, and so on. Now, under the CMS, the only method accessible for the vast majority of people to begin a claim is via the Lowestoft contact centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/4">Unlike the previous system, the CMS is supposed to operate first by a telephone call made at the caller's expense, when they lodge a claim and basic personal details are taken. That should result in a callback within 24 hours. The outward bound call from the contact centre should result in details being taken to enable a claim to be made and an appointment to take place at the local job centre. That process should take place within four days; then the information collected on the CMS should be transferred to the benefits system, enabling payments to be worked out within 30 days of the initial call.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/5">The roll-out of the CMS for Great Yarmouth was delayed, due to the associated costs of an extension required to provide a screened area for social fund work and an area for processing, and did not happen until after March this year. Great Yarmouth was the first office in the east of England region to use the CMS, although some offices elsewhere in the country had previously piloted the system from late last year. Management reports from the pilots, including one in the west country, were critical and concluded that the CMS did not work well in small offices. Concerns from the pilot have proved well founded in Great Yarmouth.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/6">The CMS has meant that experienced local staff are being moved to Lowestoft to undertake contact centre work, or into Norwich to the benefits processing centre. Owing to that, we are losing a vast amount of knowledge and understanding in dealing with local cases in Great Yarmouth, as workers are coerced into moving, or being made redundant. Indeed, work force skills are being ignored to satisfy the drive to centralise processing and customer handling, whatever the consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/7">The CMS and the centralisation process have resulted in the closure to the public of Yarmouth house, the social security office covering the whole of Great Yarmouth, during a process that was accelerated over the summer, despite assurances that adequate time would be given to consult before a closure decision was made. Following representations from the Public and Commercial Services Union, the office is at least able to open its doors to allow people to collect payments. Despite that, however, management has refused to use the facilities available for effective customer contact.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/8">I have been told that to avoid having to reverse a decision on closure, Jobcentre Plus management has gone so far as to send claimants to the town market place to receive a phone call in a public call box for a crisis loan interview, followed by a later call to advise them of the decision to pay under the CMS. Small queues have even been known to form at those telephone boxes as a result. Surely, if that is true, it is ridiculous, especially in the Great Yarmouth constituency, which suffers from high benefits dependency.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/9">In the most deprived ward in one of the most deprived constituencies in the country, we have lost jobs in the community as people directly and indirectly employed in Yarmouth house have left, been moved, or await their fate under the CMS, despite Government promises that they would move more jobs away from the centres and out to areas of deprivation. Here we see the reverse happening. Perhaps the Minister will tell me how many jobs have been taken away from Great Yarmouth and give us an evaluation of why Yarmouth house was not even considered as one of those centres, because there is enough space in the building.</p>

	<p pid="a.442.0/1">I am interested to hear my hon. Friend's sad stories, which he will know are shared by other Members of Parliament throughout the country. For example, the CMS system in east Kent that serves my Dover constituency has caused so many problems that some people are waiting one month, or even two, to get their first jobseeker's allowance claims, and even when they go to the telephone hotline&mdash;we have to call it a warmline now, apparently&mdash;they might be waiting for an hour. Some people have even been threatened with eviction because no money is coming in during these sad, sorry delays.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.442.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" speakername="Anthony D Wright" colnum="442"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h02.htm#51123h02_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.442.1/1">Absolutely. I agree with my hon. Friend's sentiments. That situation is replicated throughout the country. Indeed, those stories are heard in my office, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.1/2">How good is the CMS service that is replacing the service previously offered by Yarmouth house in Great Yarmouth? Apparently, only 8 per cent. of calls were getting through to the Lowestoft contact centre under the CMS at one stage, and as few as 6 per cent. were getting through elsewhere. The CMS in Lowestoft was suspended several weeks ago and the contact centre is only now starting to reuse the system. When one gets through, which takes hours and sometimes days, the initial call usually takes much longer than envisaged: 20 minutes plus instead of five minutes. The callback often comes several days, rather than several hours, later. Imagine the cost to the contact centre of lengthy calls to mobile telephones, bearing in mind that the vast majority of people claiming benefits do not have a phone in their home and rely heavily on mobile phones. The contact centre in Lowestoft is recruiting 55 more staff, which will take it to a level that it did not anticipate requiring until the full roll-out of the CMS, showing that staffing levels are set too low and have led to problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.1/3">I understand that staff in the centre find the work unrewarding and are aware that they provide a poor service because of that and the inadequate scripting that they are provided with under the CMS. Before CMS3 started recently, the staff had a paper brief of 35 pages of issues not covered in the script. The script restricts staff in many ways; for example, it includes a request for answers to sensitive questions about a partner's details which are not required when a claimant wishes only to claim national insurance stamps.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.1/4">More concerning is the fact that under the CMS, emergency appointments are discouraged by the system because appointments cannot take place for four days after the contact centre makes its callback to allow for forms to be posted, received and brought to an interview. Non-emergency appointments to attend the jobcentre under the CMS often take place between one and two weeks later. For example, in Great Yarmouth on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-18">18 November</phrase> the first appointments were for <phrase class="date" code="">2 December</phrase>, despite extensive overtime. Many appointments are then missed because appointments often overrun and last up to two hours rather than the projected 45 minutes. Indeed, we have only now reached the stage that we were at before Jobcentre Plus and the CMS.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.1/5">The CMS is not only behind with the appointments that it keeps, but inflexible when making them. The system does not allow a booking prior to circumstances occurring. That significantly impacts on a resort such as Great Yarmouth, where the end of seasonal work could normally be planned for and appointments could be made in advance of unemployment. The CMS allows individuals to call only from the first day of unemployment. Due to its rigidity, the system also requires appointments with the financial assessor and personal adviser to take place consecutively. That has caused conflict because frustration must be managed. Yarmouth jobcentre currently has four security guards and two floor managers, when only a receptionist was required previously. Despite that deterrent to aggressive behaviour, local incidents recently included the arrest of a man in the office for possession of and threatening to use an 8-in blade. Another incident involved two men with an axe and a sharp gardening instrument being taken away by the police.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.443.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" speakername="Ian Gibson" colnum="443"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h02.htm#51123h02_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.443.0/1">That is only in Yarmouth.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.443.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" speakername="Anthony D Wright" colnum="443"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h02.htm#51123h02_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.443.1/1">I think they came from Norwich.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.1/2">Ironically in the light of those incidents, the aim of the CMS was to reduce the need for contact and general footfall&mdash;the number of people who visit the offices to use the services available. Unlike other organisations that try to improve that scenario, Jobcentre Plus now actively discourages that by referring people to a website or another contact centre for jobs, or by advising them that they need an appointment to have a query on their benefit claim answered. The CMS was designed to play an important part in that active discouragement. Despite that, the last count in Yarmouth indicated that some 5,500 people a week came in compared with the 2,500 planned for. That is a direct result of the problems caused by making processing more remote through the CMS.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.1/3">The goal of 80 per cent. of information being transferable from the CMS to IT systems that enable the processing to be done is simply pie in the sky. Incapacity benefit claims do not transfer at all, two thirds of the others do not transfer, and anticipated savings on processing have not been realised because of the additional time required by the CMS on liaison between processing teams and financial assessors.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.1/4">The administrative nightmare caused by the CMS is serious. Claims under the CMS now have to be totally rebuilt following minor administrative errors. That fault could be rectified through reprogramming, but others will not be so easy to solve. Under the CMS, statements of between 15 and 30 pages were being posted from the contact centre to local offices to avoid administrative problems in using the CMS. The situation was not vastly improved under CMS2, which required handwritten notes to be faxed to the local office from the contact centre. Under CMS3 those details are now held on the CMS, but the system continues to be unreliable. A good example of that was when it went down for the whole afternoon on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-15">15 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.1/5">Owing to the introduction of the CMS, some officers are no longer even taking claims. In Suffolk, only three of the 13 sites take claims. A similar process is starting in Norfolk. Soon, people from North Walsham will be required to choose to attend one of three sites, necessitating an up to 50-mile round trip at their own expense. To further compound that problem, I even heard suggestions that contact centre staff have been told to refuse requests for travelling expenses, and to refer cases for an alternative decision only when complainants become aggressive.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.1/6">The closure of some sites has already occurred, with others opening on a reduced basis. As more work is centralised, the situation is likely to be exacerbated. I have been made aware of problems of constituents calling the jobcentre to ask about payments. They are referred to a team in Norwich, only to be referred again when querying payments. In future, jobseeker's allowance will be based in Basildon, social fund in Norwich and bereavement benefit in Bury St. Edmunds, with more of the same consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.1/7">Dissatisfaction with the CMS has been portrayed in feedback from Citizens Advice in its recent memorandum and in press articles highlighting the 62 per cent. increase in incidents in Jobcentre Plus. The Public and Commercial Services Union, representing staff in Jobcentre Plus, has made extensive efforts in consultation with and briefing of interested parties, including the Work and Pensions Committee, to raise further those concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.1/8">Despite that, Jobcentre Plus's middle management and the chief operating officer continue to maintain that there is no problem with the CMS. If that is the case, why has the roll-out been delayed and, more recently, suspended? Why does feedback from the practitioners in local offices, in processing, social fund and the contact centres, indicate a lack of confidence in the system? Why do complaints via various sources confirm a problem?</p>
	<p pid="a.443.1/9">Middle management and the chief operating officer are completely wrong, and the strategic delivery of the CMS has been deeply flawed. The problem is profound, and it falls on the Government to address it quickly. I do not envy the Government that task and responsibility, working to develop a system with contracting companies that have no interest in or knowledge of the product. It is very likely that we shall have another IT disaster&mdash;similar to the Child Support Agency and debt management&mdash;unless we act quickly. Instead, we are cutting staff numbers and morale before ensuring that the transition is practicable.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.1/10">We are not seeking the views of interested parties, such as Citizens Advice, welfare rights services, unemployed representatives and trade unions. Further, we are not assessing and testing new processes fully before their roll-out, and by failing to develop standard operating models and contact centres for those whose needs are best catered for by a local service, we are not addressing the equality issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.1/11">By not resourcing the project responsibly, and by not testing the full costs of proposals, the true savings of the CMS have been massively overestimated. For example, in Yarmouth, a whole year's budget of paper was used in the first month, and the additional cost of severance schemes made possible by the changeover to the CMS is &pound;8 million for Jobcentre Plus in the east of England for the current scheme alone. Further costs are being incurred rapidly for movement of staff, postage, telephony and movement of people and work from one office to another. That has all been undertaken without asking those most affected&mdash;the customers and proposed customers&mdash;what service they would like. We need to review with urgency the policy that has led us to that situation, put a hold on job cuts, and suspend roll-out and use of the CMS and movement of work while we do it.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.1/12">This Government have built a platform dedicating polices to producing change within society and creating the support structure that society can expect. The change under discussion should be the right one, but it should be delivered using the appropriate technology, risk-assessed and properly tested. The change should ensure a high level of service, delivered locally where possible, at the right pace for customers and workers&mdash;something that the CMS is sadly not delivering.</p>

	<p pid="a.445.0/2">During my hon. Friend's speech, he made several specific points about the performance of local services within Jobcentre Plus. I hope that I shall be able to respond to some of them in the course of my remarks, but I cannot deal with some of the specifics at this moment. I undertake to ask the local managers for a report responding to the specific points that my hon. Friend has made. Once I receive it, I will write to him in due course about the points that I am unable to cover.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.446.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1909" speakername="James Plaskitt" colnum="446"  time="11:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h02.htm#51123h02_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.446.0/1">I am more than happy to do that, because I am anxious to make progress on this matter as rapidly as we can, both for my hon. Friend's sake and for his constituents'.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/2">When we formed Jobcentre Plus in 2002, we integrated the job-broking elements of the former Employment Service with the benefit-payment functions of the former Benefits Agency. In doing so, we created a new, modern and more accessible way of delivering services to meet the needs of all people of working age. We are three years into a four-year programme of rolling out the new services through a network of more modern offices. This week, I can report the opening of three more offices, which brings the total to 672.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/3">Jobcentre Plus is not just about delivering services in a new, more modern physical environment; it is about delivering services in a new way to all people of working age. So, alongside the roll-out of a new network of offices, we are investing in new IT to support the new business model. We learned from the early pilots that our customers welcomed the opportunity to make contact with us using the telephone, often in the comfort of their own home. That led us to develop a network of contact centres, and to support those centres with the new customer management system that my hon. Friend has spoken about.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/4">The CMS is an important tool in enabling our staff to collect essential information from our customers, and to use that information to build up claim details on our systems so that we can pay them the correct entitlements. We introduced the system in 2003, after first testing it in Livingston.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/5">The system was not as robust as we needed it to be, and we took steps to correct those problems with what are known as performance releases, which my hon. Friend mentioned. I am pleased to say that, in large measure, the system is now performing in line with our requirements. However, my hon. Friend is right to draw our attention to some continuing difficulties that we have faced in operating the new business model. I acknowledge that in some parts of the country, particularly during the recent summer months, some of our customers experienced difficulty in getting in touch with us through the contact centres. That gave rise to some long waits for callers and some long delays in payments, which were not acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/6">However, I do not want to pin the blame for those delays on the computer system. The management of Jobcentre Plus quickly realised that they needed to look more deeply for the causes of the difficulties, because it became evident that the problems were more to do with the way that the contact centres were run and the way in which calls were handled.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/7">The management team has acted quickly to remedy the problems. It has tackled basic issues such as staff recruitment, learning and development, and the management of individual contact centres. In addition, it has invoked contingency measures and adjustments to the processes in order to recover the performance in the most affected centres. Early indications following the introduction of the adjustments have been encouraging. Since September, we have seen week-to-week improvements in call handling.</p>

	<p pid="a.447.0/1">Does the Minister think that, during those difficult times and those long delays, it was sensible to continue laying off staff and reducing the establishment, especially in the south-east of England and in Norwich?</p>

	<p pid="a.447.1/1">I am grateful for that intervention, which reminds me that my hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth, who introduced the debate, has asked me to deal with specific issues on staffing numbers. I intend to do so in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/2">Each of our 24 contact centres is working to an action plan for recovering performance, and we are managing the return to a full system as quickly and carefully as we can. Nine of the centres are continuing to operate with some clerical procedures, but well over three quarters of the new offices are now operating normally.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth asked me specifically to address issues about the closure of Yarmouth house. I understand his concern about that, but I remind him that the roll-out of Jobcentre Plus is a massive four-year programme involving the makeover and modernisation of a national network of offices. We are also developing a network of contact centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/4">While we work on making our services more accessible through new IT and telephony systems in our contact centres, we have to examine carefully our use of the estate. We inherited some unsuitable buildings, often in the wrong locations. That is why we are closing some buildings and opening new ones, as well as refurbishing some existing ones. As we take forward our plans to centralise benefit processes, some buildings, including Yarmouth house, will no longer form part of our network.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/5">We have taken a view, across the country, on the buildings most suitable for accommodating the number of processing staff that we need, and Yarmouth house does not match our requirements. That is not to say that we are in any way depriving customers in Yarmouth of a quality face-to-face service; on the contrary, a service for all our customers will continue to be delivered from Copperfield house. That service will include dealing with social fund and other inquiries that cannot be dealt with by telephone. In our processing centres, staff will be able to develop benefit knowledge and experience to deal with more complex cases more effectively and efficiently, and our customers will have greater access to services irrespective of their geographical location.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/6">Clearly, the closure of any site has an impact on staff. My hon. Friend is, of course, concerned about that. Some 50 members of staff will need to be relocated from Yarmouth house, of whom around half are not able to travel to sites outside Great Yarmouth. Consultation will continue with individuals and we are, of course, making every effort to redeploy the staff affected to alternative jobs, including inter-departmental vacancies, to avoid redundancies. Our policy, agreed with the trade unions, has been to avoid compulsory redundancy wherever we can. That is why we are making every effort to redeploy those people most directly affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/7">My hon. Friend also asked, rightly, about the performance of the Lowestoft contact centre. The management team at Jobcentre Plus has taken prompt action to rectify the problems at that site. That action includes: the development of a performance improvement programme; speeding up recruitment and increasing staffing numbers from 184 to 242; and providing additional learning and development support. Of course, it will take a little time for those measures to make a difference to the service for our customers, so, in addition to tackling the causes, Jobcentre Plus has introduced clerical contingency measures and temporary changes to its business processes to ensure that customers are not inconvenienced. That has had an immediate impact on performance in terms of answering calls; it improved significantly in the last week of September, and went from below 50 per cent. to above 90 per cent., a level that has been maintained for a six-week period.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/8">I add for my hon. Friend's information that I have been checking performance at the Lowestoft centre against the national situation. Back in the summer&mdash;in August&mdash;the national performance was way short of the target that we set, but the Lowestoft performance was even worse than the national performance. The more encouraging news recently is that, nationally, we are now very close to reaching the 90 per cent. target. However, at the beginning of November the Lowestoft centre was exceeding both national performance and the national target; so in a period of four or five months there has been a sharp improvement in performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/9">I acknowledge that last week there was a drop to 82 per cent. when a number of calls were diverted from another site to Lowestoft in order to support learning and development activities in Lowestoft. However, we are monitoring the position on a week-by-week basis and taking whatever measures we need to sustain and improve performance. Jobcentre Plus has stipulated that, for every site operating on clerical contingency, there must be a management action plan to map out the return to operation on the full CMS system. Across the east of England region, those plans are in place for each site. I hope that my hon. Friend will be reassured to know that we will be reviewing the plans on a site-to-site basis in the next month with a view to moving them to the full CMS supported process on a staged basis. The review will allow me to see performance figures from the centre in his constituency, and I will be happy to discuss them with him when he and I meet after I have had a more detailed report from the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/10">Our modernisation programme is about much more than a network of new offices. In parallel with physical upgrading of the offices, we have started to build a modern infrastructure, including new contact centres supported by new IT systems. CMS is an important part of the modernisation programme. It enables people to provide the information that we need to assess their benefit entitlements. By enabling our customers to provide information by telephone, we are responding to their desire to deal with us from their own home, which we learned of when we tested the use of contact centres in the ONE pilots.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/11">The introduction of new processes has not been without teething problems, as my hon. Friend and others are all too aware. However, we are working hard to deal with the difficulties, and I hope that I have been able to show that we are making real progress in improving the service to our customers. Our handling of calls is improving on a week-to-week basis, and every site now has a managed plan to return to the full CMS operation. The Jobcentre Plus management board is determined to maintain that improvement, and I assure my hon. Friend that I am determined to give it every support in achieving that objective.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.450.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="450"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h03.htm#51123h03_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.450.1/1">I am delighted to have secured this debate on the future of local and regional government. I am pleased that we can discuss such an apparently wide-ranging issue in one of our 90-minute debates. Hon. Members who want to take part in this debate will recognise the importance of establishing a clear relationship between local and regional government powers and national Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.1/2">I start by commenting on the Government's plans of the past eight years for the devolution of central Government and Government agency powers to so-called regional assemblies and how that relates to local government. I shall also comment on certain aspects of my constituency&mdash;I am sure that hon. Members would be surprised if I did not mention Cornwall a few times&mdash;including the long-term unitary authority, the Council of the Isles of Scilly, in the far west of my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.1/3">The Government have stated their intentions towards regional assemblies in various Acts governing preparations for their establishment. The Minister will doubtless have a clear recollection of the substantial defeat of the Government's proposal in the north-east just over a year ago, and I shall comment on the progress made since then and the Government's intentions following the outcome of that heavy defeat of their approach to devolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.1/4">I should make it clear that I do not question or even criticise the Government's desire for genuine devolution and for completion of the work that they started. Many hon. Members on the Liberal Democrat Benches and elsewhere strongly support, as I do, the Government's efforts, and indeed successes, in devolving power to the Scottish Parliament, to the Welsh Assembly, and to London. However, I want to tease from the Minister, as I hope others will, how the Government intend to fill the many vacuums in Government policy in order to deliver genuine devolution to the rest of the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.450.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the substantial defeat of a year or more ago was not necessarily a permanent rejection of regionalism as a concept but a rejection of the detail of the proposal that was put to the north-east in particular, as well as a lack of conviction among the electorate that there would be a genuine transfer of power and resources to the level that they were being asked to approve?</p>

	<p pid="a.450.3/1">I am not sure that I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman's analysis, although I do not interpret the north-east's rejection of the Government's approach to devolution as a rejection of the concept of devolution or a rejection of the prospect of devolved power. It was, as I just said, a rejection of the Government's approach. My criticism is that it was typical of so much of the Government's control-freak approach elsewhere, which I also criticise, whereby they insist on deciding where the boundaries are, what powers the people of that region or Government zone will have, how those powers will be dispersed and to what timetable, when the referendum will take place and under what terms, and in what context everything will be carried out. I hope that they will learn lessons from the referendum in the north-east and not hide away under a stone, wondering what on earth they should do next, although I worry that that is what they are doing. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, they should not interpret the referendum as a rejection of devolution itself.</p>

	<p pid="a.451.1/1">The hon. Gentleman says regionalism, but there is a debate to be had about what is interpreted as regionalism and what is interpreted as devolution and decentralisation. I shall come to my criticism of the Government in a moment, but it relates in part to the fact that they are concerned not with regionalism, but with attempting to establish a democratic structure in Government zones. Such zones are not regions, because there is no internal integrity in many of them. I cannot comment on the north-east, but I can certainly comment on the Government zone of the south-west. It is not a region, but a Government zone, which has been created over time not only by this Labour Government but by their predecessor Governments for reasons of bureaucratic convenience. It certainly has nothing to do with regionalism, because regionalism implies that a region recognises its own internal integrity and then seeks to achieve power for itself.</p>

	<p pid="a.451.4/1">This will be my last intervention. We can agree that reform does not necessarily involve regionalism, but does the hon. Gentleman agree that it does involve genuine decentralisation and real independence, with local accountability, local democracy, a majority of revenue being raised locally and decisions about how it is spent being made locally? How can we raise revenue in that context, given, not least, that the Liberal proposal for local income tax went down like a lead balloon?</p>

	<p pid="a.451.5/1">I do not want to be diverted on to the issue of the rights and wrongs of local income tax, although I dispute the hon. Gentleman's interpretation that it went down like a lead balloon. It obviously went down like a lead balloon with him, but that was not the case for a lot of others, who recognised the inequalities of the council tax system and the farce of the Government's attempt at revaluation, which I notice has been put in abeyance.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.5/2">In a debate on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-12">12 July</phrase> in this Chamber, I raised the issues before us with the Minister's colleague, the Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase>. In summing up what point the Government had reached, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.451.5/3" class="indent">&quot;We will decentralise and devolve power where we can.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Westminster Hall, </i><phrase class="date" code="2005-07-12">12 July 2005</phrase>; Vol. 436, c. 236WH.]</p>
	<p pid="a.451.5/4">In recent years, however, we have seen not devolution but further centralisation of strategic planning and learning and skills. The same is about to happen to fire control, the police and, to a large extent, housing. Those are all moving from local authority influence to Government zones, Government quangos and non-accountable bodies.</p>

	<p pid="a.452.0/1">I very much appreciate my hon. Friend's points about the proposals for amalgamating and centralising various public services. Does he agree that that is happening at a time when we are already the most centralised member state of the European Union in terms of the amount of tax revenue that is collected and disbursed centrally? On the latest figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 94 per cent. of all tax revenues go to central Government before being disbursed, on occasion, to local authorities. In only one of the 25 EU member states is that proportion higher. That state is Malta, which has a population only a little larger than the London borough of Croydon. Does my hon. Friend agree that the figures are compelling and suggest that we are excessively centralised, and that the Government are heading in the wrong direction, rather than attempting to decentralise?</p>

	<p pid="a.452.3/1">Sorry, obviously more people have left the island since I last heard about it. One could draw a number of conclusions from my hon. Friend's intervention. I am sure that the Minister will bear that in mind in his concluding remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.3/2">The issue is not just the centralisation of important local government services which local authorities have discharged effectively for decades. Bearing in mind the Government's proposals for local education authorities and the big question mark over the relationship between social services and various health quangos, we can see coming down the track a further siphoning away of local government powers to quangos, to Government zone bodies with appointed Government placepeople, or to Departments. That is the inevitable result of the direction of Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.3/3">What have we seen as a result of the North East assembly referendum last year? Basically, the Government have demonstrated paralysis; they appear to have no idea. A year on from the outcome of the referendum, there has been no comment and no proper assessment. There is no sign that the Government are prepared to debate the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.3/4">Before this debate, I reminded the Minister that on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-11">11 November 2004</phrase>, when he was Deputy Leader of the House, I asked him when the Government would recall the Regional Affairs Committee, which was established to fill the vacuum created by the lack of any debate about the regional dimension to Government policy. The Regional Affairs Committee last met 18 months ago. As I recollect, it met to discuss a relatively unimportant matter relating to &quot;The Northern Way&quot;&mdash;I am sure that it was important to the north, but I am talking about Government strategy and Government positioning on the important issues of the day. That Committee, which was set up to undertake an important task, has not met since.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.3/5">I asked the Minister, who was standing in for the Leader of the House on that occasion last November, when the Government would take the opportunity to review their policy following the north-east referendum. He replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.452.3/6" class="indent">&quot;The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point, which he and other hon. Members have made before. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House will want seriously to consider that matter on his return, so I thank the hon. Gentleman for the question.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, </i><phrase class="date" code="2004-11-11">11 November 2004</phrase>; Vol. 426, c. 935.]</p>

We are still waiting to hear whether the Regional Affairs Committee will ever meet again to discuss the issue.

	<p pid="a.453.0/1">May I help the hon. Gentleman with this part of his argument? The reason why the Government do not recall the Committee is that they have no need to, because they have already made up their mind about what they are doing. I draw his attention to what the Deputy Prime Minister said in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-08">8 November 2004</phrase>, just after the referendum result, when he made his intentions clear:</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/2" class="indent">&quot;We will keep the regional assemblies, the regional development agencies and regional government. The regional dimension will form an essential part of this Government's policy to correct the economic differential between the north and south of this country.

	<p pid="a.453.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. It is helpful, but it is also worth pointing out that on that same occasion, when the Deputy Prime Minister was answering questions following his statement, he went on to say in answer to my question on democratically accountable regional government:</p>

	<p pid="a.453.2/1">With the Government's plans for regional assemblies dead in the water, we are left, as my hon. Friend has said, with the centralisation of services from fire control rooms to secondary education and much else besides, plus a regional tier that is unelected, unaccountable and, frankly, extraordinarily bureaucratic and inefficient. Is it not true that the only way to rescue that is to revitalise the process of democratisation of regional and local government by making it closer to the people and allowing them the opportunity to take the decision to have assemblies that are genuinely accountable and local? We are told that the Government have considered that idea for urban areas. I hope that they have. They should certainly be considering it for rural communities that have a genuine sense of identity. What is wrong with the Government's plans is that their regions have no proper identity.</p>

	<p pid="a.454.0/2">I will come in a moment to the solutions that I think the Government have to pursue. They do not need a control-freak approach, which seems to assume or misunderstand that devolution is about holding on for dear life and controlling the agenda down to the last tee. Devolution is fundamentally about letting go and giving people in the regions as defined by them the opportunity to bring forward their business cases. They should be able to select from a menu of powers and take their cases to the Government, urging support for them, not the other way round. That is why the Government have catastrophically failed.</p>

Gentleman and the Minister that a lot of resentment is felt in Shropshire, particularly by our chief constable, Paul West, who has stated that he does not want the West Mercia police authority to be amalgamated with four other police authorities?

	<p pid="a.454.2/1">I am not sure that it is regional government by stealth. It is the bolstering of an unaccountable Government zone, potentially supported by various cronies and placepeople and certainly not accountable to the zone&mdash;the south-west is not a region, as far as I am concerned, and I cannot talk about Mercia&mdash;that it is supposed to represent. The issue that the hon. Gentleman talks about needs to be drawn out, and the Government need to reflect on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.2/2">The debate in this Chamber on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-12">12 July</phrase> and the paucity of the Government's response to the vacuum in policy demonstrate that the Government appear to be on the nursery slopes of the debate. They are not engaging in the debate: they do not wish to. If they do engage in it, they demonstrate that they are still on the nursery slopes by coming out with the same twaddle about needing economies of scale. One needs only to lift one's eyes beyond the narrow horizons of the Government's view of what Britain should be like to the wider world, and to look at regions and provinces in other countries. Those grown-up countries do not take the view that they need economies of scale in order to deliver services, and they do not take the view that they need to dictate to those regions and provinces what size&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.455.1/2">I will be coming to the question of how these things relate to the apparently leaked memo&mdash;I believe that the Minister will say that it was a letter&mdash;from the Minister of Communities and Local Government to some of his governmental colleagues. The important issue is the order in which reorganisation takes place, if it is to take place. I am sure that the leak leaves a number of people with the clear sense that merely cynicism lies behind the alleged proposals for local government reorganisation and that they are not part of an intelligent, thought-through policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.455.2/1">Before the hon. Gentleman moves on, is he aware that Northamptonshire now has a grotesque structure called a sub-region? The Milton Keynes and South Midlands sub-region has published its own spatial strategy and encompasses counties that fall into the east midlands and the eastern and the south-eastern regions of England. It has taken from the counties' structure plans responsibility for planning thousands of new houses in the shire counties.</p>

	<p pid="a.455.3/1">I am sure that the Minister will take on board that plea on behalf of the area that the hon. Gentleman represents.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.3/2">Many of the proposals and the spatial strategies emanating from those bodies are particularly ghastly documents, and those local authorities that wish to engage with them find it extremely difficult to do so. There is very strong objection to the way in which such documents have been drawn up and about the fact that they fail properly to reflect some of the strategies and intentions of the local authorities with which such bodies are engaging.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.3/3">Having said all that, it is rather sweet of the Government to respond as they do whenever I raise the issue of the Cornish dimension to devolution. Despite the fact that a large number of people aspire&mdash;I would argue that it is the settled will of Cornwall&mdash;to modest powers devolved to a regional assembly that covers the local authorities of Cornwall and of the Isles of Scilly, the Government take the view that they know better than the people of Cornwall how to run their affairs. It is extremely kind of them, but we could do without that level of intervention.</p>

	<p pid="a.456.0/1">Let me reinforce my hon. Friend's point. Does he agree that the English regions of which the Government seem so enamoured are extraordinarily large? My region, the south-east, has more than 8 million people and is covered by 83 Westminster constituencies. Every English region apart from one&mdash;the north-east&mdash;is larger than the Republic of Ireland. Therefore, we should consider much more substantial decentralisation than merely to the regional level on which the Government are so keen.</p>

	<p pid="a.456.1/1">Let me correct my hon. Friend: he cannot say regional level and must get used to the term Government zone level if we are to do this right and use the proper terminology for the debate. However, he rightly points to the need for a constructive proposal to fill the vacuum in Government policy. I hope that the Minister is listening. If the Government follow the principle of letting go rather than that of holding on for dear life, they should end up taking a grown-up but more passive approach to devolution. They might recognise that it is possible to achieve devolution and decentralisation in the over-large Government zones by waiting and allowing local authorities, community groups and others to make a business case for the definition of their own regional boundaries, and to demonstrate how they would run their region and which powers they would wish to take on initially&mdash;recognising that it is a process and not a single event&mdash;from a menu that the Government would, I hope, be prepared to offer them. Referendums are far more likely to be won if the people in the regions are involved than if the terms appear to be imposed by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/2">With regard to local government reorganisation and the Whitehall memo that was apparently leaked to the press at the weekend, let us put aside the claims that it is all part of a scurrilous and cynical Government ploy to deal with the problems of Tory shire counties. We need to take care that it is not part of another cynical ploy&mdash;a tactic to divert us from the important task of addressing the deficit in the definition of devolution from central Government, particularly when so many powers are being syphoned away from local authorities and so many statutory responsibilities have been loaded on to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/3">Such authorities are given no choice other than to be Government agents rather than genuine local government making its own decisions, so the whole exercise becomes rather fatuous. It is like asking an engineer to start building a bridge from the centre or, in the context of the syphoning away of powers that I have described, like rearranging the deckchairs on HMS Local Government before it finally goes under. One has to start with a clear vision of what the Government want to achieve with the devolution of power, and of their strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/4">Finally&mdash;this is the Isles of Scilly interlude in the wider debate&mdash;the Government should take care with the uniform application of national policy and its impact. The Isles of Scilly have a population of 2,000 people and a small local authority with a range of responsibilities covering not just county and district council matters but others such as water, which was never privatised, and the running of the airport and the port.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/5">Either because Government Departments like visiting the Isles of Scilly, which is possible, or because they fail to understand the nature of the responsibilities of the council of the Isles of Scilly, in the past year there have been 31 inspections from different Departments, by inspectors who stay in one of the many swanky hotels on the island and meet officers. Some 113 days of the four chief officers' time has been taken up with receiving and meeting those guests and answering questions, although each chief officer has only a total of 220 days each year. When one takes into account all the time that they have to put into the preparation of the case and answering inquiries, one sees that more than 250 days of chief officer time is taken up with addressing the problems of inspection. That is neither best value for local government resources nor proportionate. I hope that the Minister is keeping a watching eye on that and considering the cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/6">I have had to fight the best value inspections. We have managed to negotiate the number of indicators that have been used from 140 down to 75, but there were times when the local authority was asked to undertake a best value analysis for grave digging, trading standards and traffic wardens. In fact, on some occasions the best value analysis cost more than running the service. That is a bizarre situation on which I hope the Minister and the Government will reflect when they review how to deal with such matters&mdash;and I hope that they will not always assume that all local authorities are large metropolitan areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/7">Finally, the civil contingencies budgets were apparently enhanced for this year. Under the new formula, the civil contingencies budget for the Isles of Scilly was cut from &pound;54,000 a year to &pound;1,800 a year. That is some enhancement. That amount hardly covers the cost of the officer responsible for that service travelling to meetings in the so-called region&mdash;in Exeter and other places&mdash;and his telephone bill, let alone his other costs and expenses. Clearly, the Government need to reflect on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/8">I apologise to all those present for taking up so much time, but I understood that more people wished to intervene than to make speeches, so I have taken that into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/9">I hope that the Government will not hide and become paralysed. Although in Liberal Democrat terms I have been brutal with the Minister in my comments, I hope that he will not become paralysed, because some of us are keen to engage with a Government who demonstrate that they are genuinely eager to deliver devolution and decentralisation. That cannot be done if they keep retreating into their shell.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/10">We want to help. I hope that the Minister is listening to the debate, is prepared to take note and will debate the matter further and often.</p>

	<p pid="a.458.0/1">Perhaps I should declare an interest from the start. I have been a Member of the Welsh Assembly for the past six years, despite the fact that I campaigned and voted against it. If I had the opportunity to vote in another referendum, I would probably vote for Christmas, unlike the proverbial turkey. I went into politics because I believed that it should be about low taxes, high quality public services, low taxation wherever possible and building a sense of cohesion. The Welsh Assembly, and regional government in general, undermines those key principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/2">We saw a huge rise in the costs of government from the moment that the Welsh Assembly was set up. One of the first decisions taken was to build ourselves a brand new building, which originally cost &pound;6 million and is now running at &pound;66 million. That money is coming straight out of the block grant for the Welsh Assembly, or regional government, which could be spent on other matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/3">There are also Welsh embassies all over the world&mdash;or, rather, in the more exotic parts of the world&mdash;<i>[Interruption.] </i>I am happy to give way to anyone who wants to ask me about that. I have tried to find out the costs of the embassies. I know that they run into millions; the embassy in New York is in the Chrysler building. I am unable to give a definitive figure because, despite asking a series of written questions on it, the Minister has not been able to give me a proper cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/4">There has also been an expensive reorganisation of the quangos, which brings me to public services. One effect of regional government is a tendency among those running it to try to do things differently, even when there is no real reason to do so. I have been critical of this Government in Westminster and their handling of the health service. However, they are doing a far better job of running the health service than their colleagues in the Welsh Assembly are. Perhaps that is because the Government have a slightly more pragmatic approach or because of the relatively lower costs of having a larger health service in England; I do not know the full answer. The health service in England is far better than the one in Wales.</p>

	<p pid="a.458.2/1">Indeed. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing out some of the many irregularities caused by the fact that we no longer have a national health service; we have a regional health service.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.2/2">On education, it concerns me that there is now talk of developing separate qualifications that might not be recognised in the rest of the United Kingdom. On agriculture, we saw the effects of the difficulty of getting the level of expertise needed to deal with complicated cases during the foot and mouth crisis. That was demonstrated when somebody from the Welsh Assembly agricultural department rang up one of my constituents, who had asked for a movement licence on a bull, to ask what sex the bull was. That is a true story.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.2/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">The hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> mentioned taxation. Under the current models, regional governments are not given powers to raise taxes&mdash;quite rightly too. As a result, where they have had responsibility for local government funding there has been a tendency for them to use that to raise taxes through the back door by increasing council tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.2/4">As I mentioned, in a debate on local government the relevant Minister was criticised for council tax rises of between 74 and 90 per cent. I think I said that we would be having parties in the street to celebrate if our council taxes had risen by only 90 per cent. or so in Wales. In my constituency, the figure is more like 130 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.2/5">I am proud to be Welsh, particularly on international days, and I am again very much looking forward to the game against England this year. I am also proud of the fact that I am British. There is currently a great danger&mdash;a tendency to encourage people to define themselves by the region that they come from, by their ethnicity, by their religion or by any one of a number of other distinctions, whereas we should encourage everyone to define themselves as British.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.2/6">We have to build a strong, cohesive society. To do that, we should say to people that they should be able to celebrate whichever culture, religion, ethnicity or regional identity they feel that they have; that is fine. However, we also need to encourage people to celebrate something that is a little different and that can unite us all. That argument is currently being won on both the left and the right.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.2/7">I want to draw my remarks to a close, to give others a chance to speak. I can see some advantages in regional government. Regional government representatives and Assembly Members&mdash;whatever we want to call them&mdash;are local. They are back in their constituencies most nights and are therefore easier to get hold of. It is easier to get hold of Ministers in the Welsh Assembly Government than to get hold of Ministers in Westminster. That was said without any disrespect to the Minister present today, because there are more regional representatives and they are more local. It is also easier to raise matters in the local press, because they tend to be based in the areas where regional governments are based.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.2/8">I do not believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. I accept that there is now a question, because we have a Parliament in Scotland, which has tax-raising powers and primary legislative powers, an Assembly in Wales with secondary legislative powers and, theoretically, no tax-raising powers&mdash;although I would argue that it has them&mdash;and an assembly in London. I shall not even go into the complexities of Northern Ireland. We have different systems of government throughout the United Kingdom. That was not thought through sensibly. The population of Scotland is of course twice that of Wales, which is twice that of Northern Ireland. The question arises of our perhaps setting up an English Parliament or regional governments, or simply preventing Welsh and Scottish Members of Parliament from voting on matters that affect only England. That is a matter for the English to sort out. However, I strongly suggest that the answer to the question is not more politicians, more taxation, lower public service levels, or anything that undermines the principle that all of us are British.</p>

	<p pid="a.460.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> on securing an important and timely debate. In preparation for it, I thought about who I would consider the most influential figure in recent local government history, and I concluded that it was probably not anyone pictured in the halls around Westminster, but Derek Hatton, or &quot;Degsy&quot;, as he is known in Liverpool, who managed not only to be a b&ecirc;te noire of Labour and the Conservatives but to be not much liked by Liberal Democrats. He was the last person I can recall who set municipal power into deliberate conflict with Whitehall power.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.0/2">When Derek Hatton came to power, the Government had already decided, post-Toxteth, that local government could not really be trusted, and had tried to emasculate or sideline it by creating other agencies. The Greater London council and metropolitan counties had already been abolished. Certainly, Mr. Hatton played a pivotal role in a hardening of Whitehall thinking which, I should say, spans different Administrations.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.0/3">The strategy that I have described has not been reversed. Those of us who have observed local government in recent years have noticed a reduction in its functions, a limiting of its role as a provider, a capping and controlling of its budgets, with, on balance, a preponderance of its funding increasingly being provided from the centre, and the loss of business rates. The Government have gone so far as to determine the structure of council meetings, with the imposition of the cabinet system.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.0/4">To be fair, the Government would probably claim, by contrast, to have given local government some new powers. However, when those powers are examined in detail they tend to emerge as powers to enable rather than provide, powers that, often, are shared with other partners, or what I might call short-straw powers, such as the power to impose congestion charging or administer the Licensing Act 2003&mdash;unattractive numbers that central Government do not fancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.0/5">We must accept that the great days of civic power are some way behind us now, with the not unexpected result that turnout is down and local government is by and large left as a useful whipping boy or, occasionally, bogey man, whereas in reality genuine power has shifted massively to the centre. I should go so far as to say that local government is not only no longer an autonomous unit, but not any more even a trusted partner.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.0/6">Centralisation, however, goes only so far. There comes a point at which centralisation assumes a burden that it can no longer carry. It has thus been necessary for the centre to create various satellite agencies, such as the development agencies and the Government offices that inhabit the regions like colonial viceroys, and to try through them to administer the region in various ways. Such agencies certainly father, in conjunction with regional assemblies, a host of varied strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.0/7">I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives that there is paralysis; I think that there is progress, because we all know that a range of interesting strategies are at the moment cooking in the bowels of various Government offices and development agencies&mdash;spatial strategies, housing strategies, transport strategies and economic strategies. All those are influential or bound to be influential. They are consulted on in a brief and perfunctory pattern, but I do not think that anyone would recommend them as genuine, ideal democratic products.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.0/8">Perhaps I can give two local examples from the region that the Minister and I inhabit. A north-west transport strategy is being developed. That is basically a 10-year transport plan for the entire north-west. It is being produced fairly quickly, with a deadline of around January for the region and around March for the Government. It is proposed that &pound;1.4 billion of public expenditure will be committed or prioritised. Included in that strategy there will obviously be some schemes that many Members of Parliament would like; but other schemes that they would like may well not be there. Key decisions are being made with inordinate haste. The whole process is veiled, by and large, from council leaders, certainly in part from Members of Parliament, and certainly from much of the business community. None the less, it will undoubtedly be fairly influential.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.0/9">The region that I share with the Minister comes under the Northwest Development Agency. It often says that it has a three-year strategic plan that identifies which projects it will and will not fund, but I invite Members just to try to get it off them&mdash;they will find it fairly difficult. They would also find that not even the Freedom of Information Act 2000 will prise the plan from the agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.0/10">I think that there is an appalling democratic deficit, and most people would say that that was the case in the example that I have just given, but the situation is complicated by haste and the genuine lack of regional government. Whatever we think about it, there is now some regional decision making by our regional government. That, coupled with the regionalisation of emergency services&mdash;something mentioned by other Members&mdash;and of the health services, is not so much a democratic deficit as a complete democratic vacuum. That is one reason why the Select Committee on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will look into regionalisation over the next few weeks or months.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.0/11">I turn to the poor old counties&mdash;I say &quot;poor old counties&quot; because they have essentially been stripped by the regional bodies of their strategic transport role. Roads are no respecters of council boundaries; I accept that. Counties have been largely stripped of education, and are simply a postbox for educational funding. Social services are, by and large, shared between counties and health bodies now, and so the counties act in partnership rather than autonomously. In fact, it has to be said that they are now an extra layer in a world, largely, of unitaries. As function and structure are intimately related, if all those changes in function are made, some change in structure will inevitably be suggested at some point. Therefore, the leak from the Minister for Communities and Local Government the other day was heard with a sense of inevitability by some of us, because it follows logically and consecutively from the Government's prior plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.0/12">However, I do not want to get into a debate about the structure of local government, or even to suggest an ideal template to hon. Members. The fundamental issue, as was highlighted in the introductory speech, is the democratic deficit. The question is how we get public ownership of local and regional decisions, and how we persuade people that it makes a real difference to vote for any local or regional body.</p>

	<p pid="a.462.0/1">It was always ridiculous making <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1646" name="John Prescott">the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott)</phrase> the Deputy Prime Minister, because the Government then had to create a whole Department for his entertainment. Having created the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, they then had to find something for it and its junior Ministers to do. All they have managed to do is meddle; there is compulsive meddling on the part of this Government. Oxfordshire is about to lose its fire control centre; the Home Office is deciding whether Thames Valley police should join Hampshire police to form a new force; and there is a comprehensive reorganisation of primary care trusts only a few years after they were introduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.0/2">However, I do not think that the Government have any noble intent in suggesting a reorganisation of local government. It is a ploy; they know that next year there will be some very difficult local government elections for them&mdash;in London, in the unitary authorities and in a number of the shire districts. They know that they will get squeezed by Conservatives and Liberals, and I suspect they will find themselves in a very humiliating position. This proposal is a distraction from future election losses and a distraction from the extent to which, under the Government's stewardship, council tax has gone up and continues to go up. Last year, the Government injected a one-off &pound;1 billion into council tax&mdash;a pre-election give-away that clearly will not be repeated this year. As I shall later say, we are likely to see an average increase of &pound;100 in council tax because of the Government's actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.0/3">We do not need to look too closely, because we know from the experiences of history what happens when one seeks to reorganise local government. As Sir John Banham, who undertook the last consideration of reorganisation, said only the other day on &quot;The World at One&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="a.462.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Any reorganisation costs more, takes longer and delivers less than any proponents of change ever thought. Everyone needs to be very careful before they undertake further disruption.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.462.0/5">However, that is what the Government want to do in rural England: to be disruptive and expensive and to deliver less. When I go down the high street in Banbury, I am not stopped by people who say, &quot;We would really like to see Oxfordshire county council abolished. We would love to see a unitary authority here.&quot; What they are really concerned about is the collapse of the NHS in Oxfordshire and the fact that their council tax bills are going through the roof.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.0/6">When the council tax was introduced in 1993&ndash;94, it averaged &pound;456; today it averages &pound;1,009. Sir Jeremy Beecham, the vice-chairman of the Local Government Association and a Labour councillor, said only the other day that the LGA is hoping for a substantial sum from the Government along the lines of last year's one-off &pound;1 billion payment, because if it does not get that there will be a shortfall that could mean an average &pound;100-a-year increase in the council tax this coming year. That is not because local authorities have been wasteful, irresponsible or profligate or because they have been tearing up &pound;5 notes and throwing them into the River Thames; it is because authorities across England face extra costs of &pound;2.8 billion to cover the new responsibilities imposed by Whitehall. Those are Sir Jeremy Beecham's figures.</p>

	<p pid="a.463.0/1">Even the Local Government Association does not say that the figure to which the hon. Gentleman refers is made up of supposed new burdens.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.463.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" speakername="Tony Baldry" colnum="463"  time="15:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h03.htm#51123h03_spnew34">
	<p pid="a.463.1/1">That is the reported figure. Perhaps the Minister will give the new burdens figure when he winds up; we look to having the whole of that incorporated into the local government settlement. That settlement will be difficult not only because of council tax, but because we will be hammered in Oxfordshire on the supporting people budget. It is wholly unsatisfactory that councils should regularly have to plead for one-off cash handouts, rather than having a stable and predictable source of income from the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.1/2">What is also particularly distressing about the ever-increasing hikes in the council tax bill&mdash;which are, of course, a very effective stealth tax because they result from the Government's shifting of burdens from central Government to local government without proper funding&mdash;is that the people who get really hammered are those on fixed incomes such as pensioners. Council tax has risen and continues to rise by far more than prices and the state pension rise. We have seen the council tax go up by nearly three times the inflation rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.1/3">There is another particularly stupid aspect of the proposals for reorganising, merging or scrapping Oxfordshire county council or other tiers of local government. In its reports, the Audit Commission shows that in the south of the country, for example, local authorities&mdash;many of which are Conservative-controlled&mdash;are better than any other part of the public sector in delivering efficiency savings and are persistently among the best performers in the Audit Commission league tables. If parts of central Government were as effective as local authorities such as Oxfordshire county council and Cherwell district council at delivering efficiency savings and doing more for less, public finances would be a lot better and there would not be that sizeable black hole in the Government's finances.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.1/4">The whole debate about the reorganisation of local government is a deliberate distraction on the part of the Deputy Prime Minister and Ministers. They want to attract attention away from the substantial hikes in council tax that we will see as a consequence of this year's local government settlement, which always comes up just before Christmas in the hope that the Christmas break will also somehow distract people's attention. They want to distract people's attention also from the devastating local government results that will occur quite rightly next May.</p>

	<p pid="a.463.2/1">I speak as somebody who has been an elected member of a local authority for some 30 years, and who led one for some 17 years. On many occasions during that time, I found myself on the receiving end of changes in structure and in Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/2">I can look back during that period at a significant change to the way in which the public view local government and local government views itself. We have seen public esteem for local government and the morale of those involved in local government&mdash;particularly elected members&mdash;diminish during that period. Members of all parties will acknowledge that the link between the level of spending of individual local authorities and the level of taxes levied by them was lost in many people's minds, and that it became confused and opaque. We have discussed on other occasions the gearing effect of how things work at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/3">I shall keep my remarks brief and look back to the damage that was caused in the 1980s with the confrontation between central Government and local government&mdash;the attack on services, the erosion of powers and the way in which local government's legitimacy was undermined. I shall also look forward to the Lyons review of the structure and the purpose of local government and its function.</p>

	<p pid="a.464.1/1">No, time is about to expire, so if the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I shall not give way.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.1/2">We must look forward with some optimism to that review, and look for genuine devolution and decentralisation to arise from it. I hope that through the review and in the Minister's contribution towards its thinking he agrees that some significant issues need to be tackled. Most particularly, there is the issue of the funding of local government to ensure the availability of a broader range of funding sources and genuine accountability by local government for the level of spending, which is then linked back to the level of taxation.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.1/3">I hope that the Minister agrees that there is a need for a review of the remnants of the two-tier system. It was partially addressed by the abolition of the metropolitan councils and the establishment of some unitary authorities, but it must now be addressed throughout the remainder of the UK. The system remains wasteful, and unnecessary duplication is built into it.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.1/4">I hope also that the Minister agrees that there is a need to look again at the way that in practice the cabinet and scrutiny systems have worked, recognising that although there have been some benefits, in many areas it has led to increased confusion rather than transparency about where decision making takes place, and that the role of scrutiny is not always 100 per cent. successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.1/5">Finally, I hope that now and as part of the review the Minister will consider ways in which it is possible to restore the morale of members of local government, recognising that for all parties there is a real issue about attracting a high calibre of person to local authorities, and, once they are elected, retaining those members. Far too many of them will serve one term and decide that they are going to go away and do something useful with the rest of their life. We need to restore the legitimacy and the prestige of those who, as members of local authorities, serve us. We must recognise that there is a job to be done to restore local government as an essential part of our democratic structures.</p>

	<p pid="a.465.0/1">I start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> on securing this debate, which is on an important and timely topic. I agree with him especially on two points. First, I agree with his preference for power to be held at the most local level possible. If that turns out to be regional, or zonal, as he puts it, that is fine, but it strikes me&mdash;as I think it strikes him&mdash;that that will be quite a rare occurrence. Usually, power can be held at a level more local than the large zonal level to which he refers. The second point implicit in what he said was that power ought to be built up from the bottom rather than imposed from the top. That leads to my, and I think his, preference for joint working and joint commissioning of services as a way of overcoming the problems of economies scale, rather than starting with gigantic authorities built around the principles that sometimes quite rare services must be delivered in the most efficient way.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/2">It strikes me that the regional level might be suitable, say, for strategic planning and some aspects of transport&mdash;although even in respect of transport, sub-regional levels are often better&mdash;but that there are otherwise few natural functions for it. As my hon. Friend said, however, as long as regional offices exist, and as long as regional quangos multiply, there is a serious democratic deficit to be dealt with in our approach to regional government. It is important to review the way in which existing regional assemblies work to ensure that they are properly accountable, and we should be thinking about looking for ways in which to make them more clearly accountable downwards to local government, rather than upwards to national Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/3">The situation of local government following the leaked memo to <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> is interesting. The Lyons review started as a review of finance. Then the Government announced that it was to be expanded to look into function. Now it seems that we are to have a review of structure as well. Add those three things together, and we are in the midst of a general review of local government. Albeit perhaps by accident rather than by design, that is the point that we have reached. If so, this is the right time at which to return to first-principle thinking about local government, and for the Government to publish a White Paper outlining their view of the whole relationship between central and local government, rather than tackling the question in parts. For Liberal Democrats, the basic principle is localism.</p>

	<p pid="a.465.1/1">From the Minister's body language&mdash;I saw him smiling at his civil servants&mdash;it appears that the Government propose to bring forward a White Paper along those lines. I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that later.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.465.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" speakername="David Howarth" colnum="465"  time="15:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h03.htm#51123h03_spnew40">
	<p pid="a.465.2/1">I would be happy if that idea had occurred to the Department and the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.2/2">For us, the basic principle is localism. Power should be exercised at the most local possible level. However, it is important to understand not just the principle but the reasons for it, as they may determine a lot of policy direction. The Minister has heard me say this before, but perhaps other hon. Members have not. We have three distinct reasons for being in favour of localism, which lead to distinct conclusions in their own right. One is that power should be dispersed, rather than being too concentrated in too few hands, and that local government has a constitutional role to play. The second is that there is a need for diversity and experimentation, both in government and in society, and that local government can play a role in that as well. Thirdly, there is a need for democratic participation, and it is important that local government should be seen as a way in which local people can participate in the democratic process. I do not have time to go into those three reasons at great length, although I am sure that Ministers would be happy to respond on the reasons for localism, rather than simply stating conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.2/3">The most important aspect of our belief in the dispersal of power is that we think that local government should be about local politics, not about local administration. Part of the problem is central Government's view that local government should be their agent rather than a source of political legitimacy in its own right. We should look forward to a situation where national Government respect the powers of local government within its sphere and a financial structure is in place to back that up, and where, when national Government want local government to act for them, they have to negotiate with local government about accepting extra responsibilities, rather than simply imposing them through legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.2/4">The central point about experimentation and diversity is that local government should be able to experiment not only with the delivery of policies but with what policies to deliver. National Government should content themselves with minimum standards and providing information about performance and practice. The crucial difference is that the implied national policy for decades has been that public services should be delivered in the same way throughout the country. That is implicit in the local government financial system. As a matter of principle, we should move away from the idea of uniformity to one in which local government is encouraged to have different policy aims from national Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.2/5">The most important of the three points concerns democratic participation. It is necessary to the survival of democracy itself that as many people as possible have direct experience of the democratic system. By that, I mean not only voting but standing in elections, serving as a representative, making decisions and being held accountable for those decisions. We cannot afford a further development of a small and separate political class&mdash;an isolated clique of leaders who are divided from a resentful mass whose only experience of democracy is being governed by someone else. The best defence of democracy is the widespread experience of democratic politics.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.2/6">The theme that lies behind what is said on many sides, including in the leaked document in <i>The Daily Telegraph, </i>is that it is a good idea to reduce the number of councillors just for the sake of it. I oppose that. By international standards, we are not over-represented in this country. The Government might quite rightly&mdash;this relates to a point raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1675" name="Peter Soulsby">the hon. Member for Leicester, South (Sir Peter Soulsby)</phrase>&mdash;be worried about the quality of local government councillors, and think that one way of addressing that could be to reduce the number of councillors and to use the money that would otherwise be spent to increase allowances to make attractive salaries. However, that is the wrong way to attract talent to local government. The best action to take would be to increase the powers of local government and to free it from national control, so that councillors can achieve something for their communities. Freedom for councils means better councillors.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.2/7">It seems that one of the Government's reasons for unitary councils is a reduction in the number of councillors. I would not accept that. I also reject the idea of a single system of local government throughout the country. A single system is wrong; there should be various ideas of how to run local government. There is immense geographical diversity in the country and what might be appropriate for a rural area might not be appropriate for an urban area. As another former council leader, I am much attracted to single-tier local government, especially in urban areas. The present system leads to immense confusion and failure among the various levels of local government to take responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.2/8">It is difficult for the electorate to believe that the county council is responsible for all the roads, even in an urban district, or that one council deals with waste collection, while another deals with waste disposal. I remember from my time as a council leader that the local population always thought that I was responsible for all the county's services, including part of the health service. That lack of clarity is a real problem for democratic accountability.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.2/9">If <i>The Daily Telegraph </i>leak is right, I strongly advise the Government to think carefully about the way in which they propose to go about the reform. They risk repeating some of the mistakes of the Banham/Grant commission. That went for speed. Its remit was limited to building new authorities out of existing authorities, and not crossing county boundaries. In many areas, including mine, those two rules by themselves meant that no agreement was possible, because fears of dominance of town over country or country over town, or the existence&mdash;in my area&mdash;of several important towns close to county boundaries made the creation of a rational system of unitary authorities impossible.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.2/10">I advise going for a slower, but more thorough process that allowed more radical solutions and that sought ideas not only from existing councils, which are bound to reflect their institutional interests, but from a wider community. Structure is probably the last thing that must be decided after function and finance, and it is important for the Government to return to that.</p>

	<p pid="a.467.0/1">Welcome, Mr. Illsley, to the third and probably spikiest of an occasional series of seminars on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, ably run by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">the Minister and the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase>. Although we have less time than normal on this occasion, what has been packed in has certainly been up to the quality of our previous sessions.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">the brutal hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> on securing this debate and leading off. He gave a series of illustrations of how the present burden of waste and bureaucracy is causing nonsense and managed to put the words &quot;cynical ploy&quot; and &quot;this Labour Government&quot; in the same sentence. I suspect that if that were tapped into Google there might be more than one reference to those words being linked.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" name="David Davies">My hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies)</phrase> told us about his experience of the Welsh Assembly and of how costs can rise. He spoke endearingly of Welsh embassies around the world but, frankly, with the Welsh rugby team and Katherine Jenkins, I do not see that anything else is needed to advertise Welshness anywhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">The hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> drew attention to another modern problem connected with local government: the plethora of bodies that are now involved in some way in partnerships or stakeholding so that any consultation must be rushed before information comes back. That led him to the conclusion, as it would have led me, that the only winner in such a system is the sole partner with a fixed and single view: the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">My hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> in a series of devastating attacks clearly pointed out the damage done by the waste, bureaucracy and nonsense that characterise local government today. He rightly referred to the quotation of John Banham about how the costs of restructuring are always well beyond anything that is contemplated. He put his finger on the elephant in the room: the leaked letter of the Minister of Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1826" name="David Miliband">the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Miliband)</phrase>, which was a ploy to divert attention from impending huge council tax increases and to set Tory against Tory&mdash;a ploy with which we will not comply.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1675" name="Peter Soulsby">The hon. Member for Leicester, South (Sir Peter Soulsby)</phrase>, with almost a slight deviation to the 1980s which might not have been necessary, made a significant and well measured contribution on the problems of attracting people into local government, of public esteem and of establishing proper links between what is raised and what is spent. Although it has taken him 30 years to decide to leave local government and get a life, we are delighted that his experience is so well put to effect in a debate such as this.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/7">The hon. Member for Cambridge in his usual persuasive and homely way gave us another master class based on his experience of local government. I particularly agree with and support his point that if we want to enhance local authorities in this country we do not need gimmicks. We need to restore their power and accountability, and then the sort of people who made local government great in this country will again be attracted to work in that area. There are already good people in local government, but too many have slipped away because they feel that they could do something elsewhere. We want them restored to local government.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/8">I remember that as a child when I passed churches, and being a good follower of Jesus, I read the little homilies outside. One I particularly remember said accusingly, &quot;If you were charged with being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?&quot; I have lived with the guilt of that ever since. I could turn that around today and ask the Minister whether there was sufficient evidence to convict him and his colleague of making a complete Horlicks of local government in England and Wales. I suggest that the answer would be yes. Based on that evidence, we have heard today all the problems with which he is rightly charged.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/9">There is continual tension in the United Kingdom between the powers of central Government and the needs of local government. That waxes and wanes over the years depending on the Government, and there is never a fixed point at which there is a settlement. The nation feels that this Government are central and controlling and the lack of trust in them is strongly reflected at local level. If there is to be a better future for regional and local government in England and Wales, three problems must be addressed and put right.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/10">First, the Government must stop undermining local accountability. New taxes and burdens are imposed on local government, but it is not given the funds to pay for them and the public become confused about the responsibilities of their local authority and of the Government. New burdens in recent years have included the landfill directive, the directive on disposal of white goods and electronics, asylum seeker dispersal, care standards, emergency planning, homelessness and licensing. All were placed on local authorities without money to pay for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/11">Beyond that, there is a growing sense among those at senior level in local government that, these days, they must look up to Whitehall for their careers and future, not out to the community that they are supposed to be serving. They feel that they are the local arm of central Government, and that is not what local government should be. In my area, that led to the nonsense of rate capping. Mid Bedfordshire council had the 10th lowest charge in England, but it cost &pound;85,000 to re-bill ratepayers, all to save them an average of 15p per week. That is an example of domination by the Government going too far.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/12">Secondly, the Government must stop undermining local responsibility by moving powers to various boards and partnerships. We all know of examples. The clearest one is moving powers to regional offices which do not, in fact, deliver the goods. They now have responsibilities for transport, housing and planning that have been taken from democratically elected bodies. If regional offices worked, that would be something, but the report yesterday from the Urban Task Force neatly illustrated how they fail to get things right. In describing the problems of delivering regeneration, the Urban Task Force stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/13" class="indent">&quot;The plethora of overlapping, but differently funded and monitored, area based regeneration bodies has reduced the delivery effectiveness of public sector led regeneration schemes. This has been exacerbated by the disconnection of regeneration expenditure between Government Regional Offices, Regional Development Agencies and English Partnerships and the huge number of new ineffective partnerships at local and sub-regional levels&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/14">That is how the new bodies and the new partnerships do not deliver on just one aspect of government&mdash;the vital one of delivering regeneration. They do not do the job and are not effective in crucial areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/15">Thirdly, the Government must sort out and stop the incessant drive to regionalisation. The preamble of the leaked letter states:</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/16" class="indent">&quot;As you know, over the last year, we have been engaged in a wide-ranging debate about the future of local government. In the context of that debate and of the proposed significant organisational changes under way in Police and Health services it seems to me&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/17">that is, the Minister of Communities and Local Government&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/18" class="indent">&quot;that we have an unprecedented opportunity to consider together the structures that are in place to provide services to local people and to improve partnership working.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/19">If that is to be done in the context of police and health, we know what it will be. It will be regionalisation, as that is where restructuring goes and it is the declared aim of the Government. We know exactly what we will get if local government reorganisation follows that pattern.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/20">A better approach for the Minister for Local Government to take would be, first, to restore local authority powers and responsibilities. Powers should be gathered from the top down and sideways from the various boards. That would lead to an increase in interest and participation.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/21">Secondly, the Minister should encourage the voluntary coming together of areas where there is a natural congruence, because the regional boundaries as currently devised simply are not adequate. For example, there is more congruence among south coast towns than there is in any structure that links them with places many miles to the north or inland.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.0/22">Thirdly, the Government should be an enabler and ring-holder, and not enforce from the top down. Fourthly, it is better to build from the bottom up, and to ensure that councils at district, county, borough and metropolitan levels pare costs, share facilities and look for a consensus on what is delivered and how it might be done. Finally, the Government should pare down partnerships and make their responsibilities clearer so that they can deliver. That is a better recipe for local government growth and development in this country than continuing along the failing lines that I fear the Minister and his colleagues will enforce on us all.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.470.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1752" speakername="Phil Woolas" speakeroffice="The Minister for Local Government"  colnum="470"  time="15:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h03.htm#51123h03_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.470.0/1">I thank hon. Members for a very wide-ranging debate. The title of regional and local government allows comment on just about anything. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> on securing the debate and on giving us the opportunity to share different policy ideas and strategies. I also thank him for asking questions about his constituency. I am grateful for the advance notice that he gave me, and for the spirit in which he approached the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/2">I reject the central charges that hon. Gentlemen have made against Government policy. There have been caricatures of policy, repeats of urban myths and some slight exaggerations. We have also been accused of control freakery yet again. This Government, who devolved power to Scotland, to Wales and to London, and who have pursued a policy of freedom and flexibility towards local government, cannot fairly be accused of control freakery, especially when contrasted with the Government of the 1980s and early 1990s, a period to which some hon. Members referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/3">We have also been accused of regionalisation. That is unfair, and I shall try to explain why in the brief time available to me. The debate in Government and in Parliament was whether transport, for example, should be regionalised down from Whitehall, not up from local authorities. Some functions, such as those performed by regional fire control centres, are performed well at regional level. Emergency numbers have worked very well indeed in London for most of the past 100 years, and have the support of most fire officers across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/4">I shall try to answer as quickly as I can some of the specific points made by the hon. Member for St. Ives, because it is his debate. He called for a new meeting of the Regional Affairs Committee. The Government are open to that suggestion, but I remind him that only eight Members responded, if my memory serves me correctly, when the views of the House were canvassed on whether it should meet again.</p>

	<p pid="a.471.0/1">Perhaps I blinked when that happened, but just so that I did not miss it, will the Minister say how the House was canvassed on whether the Regional Affairs Committee should meet again?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.471.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1752" speakername="Phil Woolas" colnum="471"  time="15:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h03.htm#51123h03_spnew43">
	<p pid="a.471.1/1">If my memory serves me correctly&mdash;I shall correct myself if it does not&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase> canvassed the House, and the Leader of the House was presented with the result of the canvass just before he asked his question in the House. That, I remember, was part of his consideration. The point is that the Committee exists. I should have thought that the House would want to consider the possibility of its meeting again. I am certainly not standing in the way of it doing so. Indeed, I believe that it has the power to meet outside London.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/2">The hon. Gentleman made some points about the Isles of Scilly. The per capita ratio of senior officers to population is pretty high compared with my local authority, but he has a point, on common-sense grounds if in no other way, and I am pleased to report to the Chamber that Departments, agencies and the council have started to work together under voluntary arrangements to plan improvements, particularly to the inspection regime. Indeed, a meeting is scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="">19 December</phrase> to take that forward. I am very conscious of the fact that applying the funding regime to the Isles of Scilly does produce unintended consequences that can be disruptive for them, and I thank the hon. Gentleman for making that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/3">May I hit on the head the point about county councils versus districts, and the suggestion that that was a cynical ploy on the part of a Labour Government? I do not concede that, because I do not concede for a moment that all counties and districts are held by the Conservative party. If we took <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the point made by the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> and picked, say, Durham and Lancashire, we would find that the situation was different. Although it is not, of course, the Government's policy to comment on leaks, a close reading of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> shows that the options were simply put forward and no conclusions were drawn. It is hardly a secret&mdash;indeed, it is an open debate in local government&mdash;that the issue has been considered not least by districts and counties. However, Government policy on the issue shows no predilection towards counties or district&mdash;or, indeed, towards taking action on structures at all.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.472.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" speakername="Alistair Burt" colnum="472"  time="15:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h03.htm#51123h03_spnew44">
	<p pid="a.472.0/1">I am extremely grateful to the Minister for giving way in such a tight debate, but can I press him on the issue of context? The point made by the Minister of Communities and Local Government at the beginning of his letter is that the debate on restructuring should be seen in the context of the structural changes being made to the police and health services. Those are being redesigned on a regional basis, which therefore gives rise to the supposition that that will also be the context for the changes in local government. Can the Minister respond?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.472.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1752" speakername="Phil Woolas" colnum="472"  time="15:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h03.htm#51123h03_spnew45">
	<p pid="a.472.1/1">I can respond and I am glad to have the opportunity to do so, because I think that the hon. Gentleman is misreading things in that respect. No regionalisation of primary care trusts is being proposed; it is the strategic health authorities that are being considered for regionalisation, and I remind hon. Members that they were regional not too long ago anyway. As I said, the decision on fire control is a sensible management and logistic decision, rather than a policy or political one. Similarly, the proposals for the police, which have been considered and consulted on, are not prescriptive or universal across the country. Amalgamations are proposed where clear benefits to the service can be brought about. The Government's policy is service improvement-led; it is certainly not about regionalisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.1/2">I am squeezed for time, although I am glad to be so, because it is good to see hon. Members taking part in the debate. None the less, let me say that I hope that the hon. Member for St. Ives appreciates that the Liberal Democrat party is in favour of elected regional assemblies. In this debate, however, he has said that very few powers could reasonably be held at regional level, and I do not quite see how the two policies square. At <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" name="David Davies">the same time, the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies)</phrase> has said that he is not in favour of devolution and that it has all gone wrong. Therefore, the hon. Member for Monmouth is against devolution, the Liberal Democrat party and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase> are apparently in favour of devolution to the regions, but do not know what the regions should do, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase>, who speaks for the official Opposition, accuses the Government of centralisation. The words &quot;pot&quot; and &quot;kettle&quot; come to mind.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.472.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" speakername="David Davies" colnum="472"  time="15:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h03.htm#51123h03_spnew46">
	<p pid="a.472.2/1">I actually said that devolution did not work&mdash;I said nothing about the shire counties. In fact, I would be very much in favour of taking further powers from central Government and giving them to county councils, although not to regional assemblies.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.472.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1752" speakername="Phil Woolas" colnum="472"  time="15:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h03.htm#51123h03_spnew47">
	<p pid="a.472.3/1">Again, I thank the hon. Gentleman. As I have told many conferences of local authority leaders in recent weeks and months, the introduction of local area agreements and the pooling and aligning of Government central funds at local level, with local authorities acting as first among equals in respect of other public sector agencies, are some of the most significant acts of devolution in this country for many a year. I therefore reject the notion that this is a centralising Government and that we are implementing a stealth policy of regionalisation. In fact, as our manifesto declared, and as can be seen from the freedoms and flexibilities, local area agreements and other policy measures that we have introduced, our policy is one not only of decentralisation of function, but of devolution. Let me take the example of the licensing law. The licensing law is an act of devolution; it passes powers to local authorities, although one would not know that.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.3/2">On the point about the new burdens, the Government are committed to dealing with that. The Local Government Association says that there are &pound;72 million of extra costs, but I have not had one letter pointing out the savings that will be made through that act of devolution.</p>

	Cyber Security
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.474.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" speakername="Mark Pritchard" colnum="474"  time="16:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h04.htm#51123h04_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.474.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to bring an important issue before the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/2">There are four types of cyber threat&mdash;worms, viruses, trojans and spyware, which can also appear in combination. Worms are self-replicating programs designed to spread through networks and cease operations. Viruses are usually files that attach themselves to other programs and spread themselves into other programs or computers with which they come into contact. A trojan is usually a program that disguises itself as helpful, but then proceeds to replicate itself throughout the computer network, allowing external control as well as user debilitation. Spyware is a type of trojan usually attached to another program which when downloaded is used to record activity on a computer, and is then accessed by the originator.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/3">Today I will consider the national security and economic implications of the advent of new and more aggressive breeds of virus and cyber security threats to Government and the private sector. It is noteworthy that the United States Department of Homeland Security records that the number of cyber attacks increased from 10,000 in 1999 to more than 400,000 in 2004. We are all aware of major incidents that have taken place in recent years. In May 2000, the &quot;I love you&quot; virus, a macro virus that overwrites key computer files, caused some $10 billion-worth of damage across the globe. In September 2001, the &quot;Nimda&quot; virus&mdash;a worm and virus&mdash;which spread throughout north America in just one hour, attacked more than 8 million computers and took weeks to eliminate. It was spread by e-mail attachments and copied itself to mailing lists and networks.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/4">In November 2004, the &quot;Agobot&quot; virus, a dormant virus that replicated itself throughout computer networks, hit the world. It is still dormant in many computers across the globe. Nine million computers have been affected, and that figure is rising as people discover the virus on their systems. In March 2004, &quot;Mydoom&quot;, the appropriately named combination of a trojan and a virus, spread to more than 1 million computers in just 56 hours, thereafter infecting another 4 million computers. The US State Department has suggested that there has been a 300 per cent. increase in trojans in the past year alone. More worryingly, those viruses have been introduced not by amateurs&mdash;although they have been involved in some cases&mdash;but by professional hackers.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/5">The rise of the professional hacker has serious implications for the UK, particularly in relation to national defence. I would be very concerned indeed if my constituents, or anybody in Britain, felt that our intelligence and defence systems and networks were being penetrated by viruses. There is also the danger that potential enemies of this country might spy on vulnerable and security-restricted areas of the internet. We know that that does occur; it has been confirmed by Governments around the world, including that of France, and, again, the US Department of Homeland Security. We hear little from the British Government, and I hope that the Minister will be able to throw some light on what Britain is doing about protecting our national security systems from such viruses and cyber security threats.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/6">I recall that in July 2001 a worm targeted a weakness in the White House network. That had serious implications for the running of the White House. All users who attempted to access that server were attacked. More than 250,000 computers were affected in three hours. It was code red.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/7">Key national infrastructures, such as energy, transport, finance, telecoms and aviation, rely constantly on an exchange of information, primarily through computer networks. A penetration of any of those networks would be a serious threat to national security, not least when it comes to the potential to access Britain's 14 nuclear power stations. I hope that if the Government decide on new nuclear power stations as part of the current energy review&mdash;clearly, there is a bit of confusion, but the Prime Minister has hinted about going new nuclear&mdash;the software and the systems involved in running new nuclear power stations will be fully protected from cyber security threats. It is interesting that the imprisoned al-Qaeda members have admitted that their organisation has been attempting to&mdash;and no doubt is still attempting to&mdash;develop cyber threats to strike western Governments.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/8">There are other issues, such as Government databases&mdash;especially those proposed for the national identity card scheme, which would contain biometric data. They have been identified by <i>Infosecurity</i> <i>Today</i> online magazine as potent targets for hacking, possibly allowing massive levels of identity fraud. That brings me to the issue of identity fraud. It is reported that more than 200,000 cases of identity fraud on the internet were recorded in 2004&ndash;05, at a cost of nearly &pound;60 million to the UK economy alone. That is in spite of the launch by Companies House of Monitor, which seeks to secure company details&mdash;never mind the details of individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/9">There is an added cost in the form of people who would shop online and access services and products&mdash;either wholesale or retail&mdash;in that way, but who are put off by the risk of being exposed to fraud. Online credit card fraud has also increased by about 29 per cent. over the past year alone, at a cost to UK businesses of at least &pound;16 million and a cost of &pound;260 million worldwide. That is a small proportion of the total and ever-increasing fraud on the world wide web.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/10">I have mentioned America and the French and now I should like to mention the Japanese, being a member of the all-party group on Japan. I am supporting not just Japan's rugby bid, but its anti-corporate-espionage activities. It is leading the way in preventing corporate espionage, including the theft of patents, scientific research data, business strategies and client information. In fact, the Japanese Home Office has estimated that there has been a 200 per cent. increase in corporate espionage over the past year. That could have limitless implications for British businesses and entrepreneurs.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/11">So, what can be done? The US has a unified agency called the National Cyber Security Division to assess and respond to cyber-threats. The computer emergency readiness team is a sub-agency of the division and its role is to inform the private sector of any threats and to co-ordinate private sector action and responses. The US Government have also taken several other measures to reduce the rise in cyber threats, such as a regular exchange of information between the state and the private sector to alert one another to such threats. Known threats are analysed and strategies to deal with them are developed. Software is updated and protected against the latest threats. The private sector is encouraged to develop contingency plans should the internet and computer systems, networks and servers fail. However, it is incentivised for doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/12">The rise in aggressive viruses and cyber security threats is a clear and present danger to Britain's national security. It is also a threat to Britain's economic well-being. More than 90 per cent. of cyber threats have a major impact not only on the originating country but across the globe. Britain is the international hub for banking, finance houses and many other businesses, so if we get it wrong it will have implications for many other countries as well as ourselves; yet we have no international treaty or convention to deal with cyber crime. We have only a series of bilateral engagements and extradition laws. The Americans, however, extradited someone from the UK, perhaps because their laws are more robust than ours.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/13">That leads me to my questions for the Minister. Would Her Majesty's Government consider strengthening domestic laws to ensure that penalties are severe enough to act as a deterrent for all those caught and convicted of cyber crime? Would the Government work with the international community and the World Trade Organisation towards creating a standard or uniform legal approach at a global level on such issues?</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/14">Would the Government consider doing what the United States has done, and establish a cyber security week or cyber security day? That would provide a platform to promote awareness and understanding of cyber security issues, and the potential damage to Britain's economy and national security. It would help if the Government were to deal separately with the impact on the private and public sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/15">Would the Government consider forming a unified national cyber security agency, which would take a lead on their behalf and be a single point of cyber security information, guidance and advice for the nation? What are the Government doing to ensure a robust and co-ordinated response to cyber threats in the UK and among our allies? Viruses can often get through weaker systems. If we, with improved cyber security measures, share intelligence information with nations that do not have similarly robust firewalls&mdash;what I might call added-value firewalls&mdash;our systems will still be vulnerable. We need to be aware of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/16">Will the Government please consider those matters urgently? I have spoken this afternoon about defensive measures. I hope that we shall have time in the House to speak about offensive measures&mdash;about how to avoid wars and confrontation by disabling our enemies' systems before they can push the button on missiles that might strike our shores. The House should have the opportunity to debate offensive cyber-security issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/17">I hope that the Minister agrees with his noble Friend Lord Harris of Haringey, who said only a few months ago that the Government should consider appointing a cyber security tsar. I have expressed personal views, but there is cross-party support for them. I hope that the Minister will look upon my proposals and questions favourably.</p>

	<p pid="a.477.2/1">Secure networks are absolutely vital, not only to ensure that data held by public and private bodies are not compromised or lost, but to build the element that is essential in any commercial or financial market: consumer confidence. If consumers do not have confidence in their ability to transact online business in safety, they will not transact online business at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/2">The Government take such issues seriously. Although my Department's responsibilities focus primarily on the business community, I can outline progress in a range of activities across Government. The strategic focus of Government is co-ordinated through the Cabinet Office. Its primary concern is to ensure that the Government's information assets are properly secured. It is recognised as of vital importance that work in Government is informed by and informs developments in the private sector. For that reason, we see the question of communication between Government and business and end users as vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/3">There is now a sense of ownership for the issue among Departments, and a recognised community of senior risk owners who are responsible for promoting best practice. The Cabinet Office is also taking a far more forward-looking approach to future risks and acts as the Government's customer for expert work in devising common-good solutions to emerging information security problems. The budget for the vital investment in software and hardware to protect Government information in the current spending round amounts to some &pound;30 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/4">The Cabinet Office has also tried to simplify basic security requirements for the entire public sector by producing guidelines on secure e-government. They are supported by a new initiative that will help by the simple method of verifying security claims made for a product. All parts of Government make informed purchases of information technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/5">All in all, I believe that the importance of cyber security is now embedded in Government thinking. Hon. Members will have noted that it was one of the key features highlighted in the recent &quot;Transformational Government Enabled by Technology&quot; strategy paper. Government can effectively be moved online only if it is consistently available and, as I said before, has the confidence of its users.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.2/6">My second point is about the work that we have done to protect our critical national infrastructure. With the emergence of the threat of a remote attack on information systems, the Government have placed particular importance on protecting the systems that are critical to maintaining the energy, communications, water, transport and government systems that are crucial to our way of life. For that reason, in 1999 the Government developed a policy on protecting those systems and created the National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre, NISCC, to implement that policy. NISCC can draw on nearly 100 experts from agencies and works in close partnership with the police and other parts of Government that have an interest in protecting the critical information infrastructure.</p>

	<p pid="a.478.0/1">The Minister is absolutely right that that organisation exists. Bringing that organisation on line, if the Minister will forgive the pun, was a major step forward for the Government. However, it only has an advisory role and the threat should be managed more robustly.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.478.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" speakername="Barry Gardiner" colnum="478"  time="16:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h04.htm#51123h04_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.478.1/1">I understand the tenor of the hon. Gentleman's remarks. However, NISCC has established good working relations with the management of public and private sector owners of the infrastructure. It discusses with them, as a trusted partner, how those systems are secured against a constantly changing threat paradigm. It has established communities in the relevant sectors called information exchanges, where front-line security specialists can talk frankly about emerging problems and solutions. There are active information exchanges in the financial and communications sectors. In terms of this aspect of Government policy, we are one of the world's leading nations. The UK experience is seen as important, particularly as the EU gets to grips with the issue in the context of new threats to our security.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/2">Of course, the business community understands that the move to the information age will function only if there is confidence in systems and networks that are resilient and that do not pose a risk to the privacy or the pocket of the user. We all know that mistakes have been made in the past and that, in the rush to get the world connected, security was perhaps sometimes traded off against functionality. Those days are long gone and there has been a move by vendors to work towards a much more inherently secure generation of both hardware and software. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the trusted computing initiative, which brings together the leading technology vendors in a joint enterprise to address the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/3">That, of course, reflects an increased concern by Government that technology should develop in a way that is inherently more resilient. The continued resilience of the internet was one of the underlying public policy concerns that drove the recent world summit on the information society. I am pleased to say that, difficult as it was, we have an outcome in terms of future stakeholder engagement on these issues that is a step forward. I can report that we have had notable success and have agreed that the way forward from the summit will address cyber security and spam. The summit constitutes a call for further co-operation by all stakeholders, and for Government and industry to move forward in partnership.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/4">While the business community is addressing the issue, we must accept that there remain several important roles for Government. At this stage, we have not sought to go further than is necessary down the path of regulation. The relevant regulation in this area is rightly lean and focused. Those who process sensitive personal information are bound by the Data Protection Act 1998 to apply appropriate protection to ensure that such information is not inappropriately accessed. There are fairly broad requirements on those who provide communications services to ensure that they are secure.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/5">There is a role for Government and business to work together in a non-regulatory way. I have mentioned the work undertaken as part of our national security agenda and the collaboration with technology vendors in relation to the Government's own requirements. We are also working with technology vendors and service providers to deal with the new generation of malicious software, which first became a problem as those who pushed out spam sought to conceal their activities by colonising the computers of other internet users to pass on their products. That led to an explosion of criminal activity based on the ability to dupe innocent users into giving up personal information or downloading software that, through constantly changing technology, seeks to extract personal information or passwords in order to access online accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/6">The new generation of malicious software, by which I mean spyware, keyloggers, adware and the like, is requiring new defences to work with the approaches developed to combat the virus and worm attacks that there have been since the late 1990s. The Government have been among the leaders in trying to develop a multifaceted approach to the problem, looking at a toolkit of regulatory technological processes and awareness-raising tools.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/7">One of the issues emerging is the pressing need to find a solution to the problem of identity online. The failure to have certainty about the identity of the person or body that one is dealing with is at the heart of many of the problems. I am glad to note that the question of electronic identities is moving up the agenda for further work in the EU, and the thinking on our own identity card will be informed by the need for greater certainty about online identities.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/8">My Department can make an important contribution to the future of cyber security through the work that we support in the research community and through our existing programmes to support innovation. I remind hon. Members that Lord Sainsbury of Turville, who is responsible for the Office of Science and Technology, commissioned a major piece of work in 2004 under the foresight programme. It was called cyber trust. It took a long-term, scenario-based approach and identified possible directions for technological and sociological work in this area. The Department's innovation programme is reflecting that thinking and work is under way to improve the way in which the UK's supplier base can improve its performance in adopting new ideas.</p>

	<p pid="a.480.0/1">I just wondered whether the Government would consider, as Lord Harris suggested&mdash;and we agreed&mdash;appointing a cyber security tsar and having a cyber security day or week, which would include the private and public sectors.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.480.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" speakername="Barry Gardiner" colnum="480"  time="16:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h04.htm#51123h04_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.480.1/1">I have noted the hon. Gentleman's comments and his strong recommendation that we should do that. Obviously, he would not expect me to make any announcements at this stage, but the Government should consider those sensible suggestions and arrive at an appropriate conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/2">My Department has had a long-standing role in identifying and promoting best practice in information security, with a particular focus on the needs of smaller businesses. The hon. Gentleman will be aware, I am sure, of the Department's biennial information security breaches survey, one of the best of its kind in the world, which looks at the changing pattern of security problems as they are experienced by UK companies. The last survey reported some positive developments in relation to how the subject was being treated by companies&mdash;some 75 per cent. of managers thought that information security was a high priority&mdash;but it still found a worrying lack of awareness and preparedness. Only 20 per cent. of respondents had a business continuity or disaster recovery plan. I suspect that the next survey, on which the fieldwork is under way as we speak, will give us a good insight into how business is responding to the current surge in malicious software.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/3">The survey assists us in many ways&mdash;and I should say in passing that sponsorship and input from business make it a great example of public-private partnership. It has allowed us to focus our outreach efforts to small business against a clear understanding of their problems. Let me illustrate that. UK industry classifies 51 per cent. of its information as highly sensitive, but small business spends less than 1 per cent. of its IT budget on protecting that asset. It is clear that investing in IT security is perceived as a burden by that group, especially as identifying a return on the money invested is so hard to calculate. Yet it can cost upwards of &pound;10,000 to rectify a security breach. We aim to get the message across that a small investment in appropriate systems and products will increase security exponentially.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/4">The material that my Department has produced for smaller businesses is rightly regarded as among the most effective in the EU. My Department looks to work with high profile partners to support the dissemination of these ideas. We are fortunate in having recently completed one successful project with the Institute of Directors and there is another one with the CBI and Ernst and Young, which is due for launch in the new year. That project will seek to use the supply chain as a method for reaching smaller businesses and will involve a series of regional roadshows.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/5">The survey also allows us to measure how businesses are treating information security as a business issue. It has always been the Department's objective to put information risk at the heart of the UK business approach to risk management. To that end, the Department has collaborated with businesses in the production of information security management standards, and we have worked together to produce two key standards: a guideline document and a specification for an information security management system. I am glad to say that both those UK initiatives have been recognised by the international standards community and have been adopted as international standards. The publication of the information management systems specification took place as recently as <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-15">15 October</phrase>, and there is every prospect that it will become a major tool for businesses that wish to deal with information risk systematically.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/6">I am mindful that we need to promote good practice to support e-business&mdash;of which I understand the hon. Gentleman has personal experience&mdash;and I assure him that the Government remain committed to promoting a vibrant e-business community with confidence in its ability to work securely. As I have explained, it is not the Government's role to manage the internet, or regulate how business is conducted through it. We need to regulate to allow e-business to flourish and, through laws such as the Computer Misuse Act 1990, provide a deterrent to those who would seek to conduct crime online.</p>

	<p pid="a.482.1/1">I am conscious that I have about three hours of material to cram into 15 minutes. It is a great pleasure to speak in a debate with you in the Chair, Mr. Illsley, and to see the Minister for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1763" name="Kim Howells">the Middle East, my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells)</phrase>, who has a great and long-term commitment to middle east issues, not least those affecting Israel and Palestine.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/2">I declare two interests at the outset: first, that I am an executive member of Labour Friends of Israel, and, secondly, that I am patron of the friends of the parents circle and bereaved families forum, which works with communities on both sides&mdash;Israelis and Palestinians&mdash;who have lost sons, daughters and relatives in the continuing conflict. A fortnight ago I was at Atlantic college in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1895" name="John Smith">the constituency of our hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (John Smith)</phrase>. I addressed a meeting of about 80 students, from Jordan, Oman, Israel and the west bank and other parts of the Gulf and the Arab nations. They were highly articulate, and I expressed some optimism to them, as I frequently try to do on such occasions. How could I know, however, just how much would change&mdash;as things always do in the middle east&mdash;in only a fortnight?</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/3">I want to rattle through some issues, on which the Minister will, I hope, have time to respond. As to Gaza and Rafah there have been immense developments that hold out positive messages for the future. In short, the breakthrough on the Gaza-Egypt-Rafah border crossing, which is due to be opened on <phrase class="date" code="">25 November</phrase>, is of huge significance. The Palestinians will for the first time ever have a border of their own to control. Israel has agreed that the EU will have the authority to ensure that the Palestinian Authority complies with the regulations set out in the agreement. Not only are the Palestinians to be in charge of the border, but the EU has for the first time become involved on the ground in Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/4">We hear more day by day about provision being made for further developments, including the opening of a seaport, a cargo customs crossing, the reduction of road blocks in the west bank and&mdash;most crucial, so that it does not perish&mdash;allowing immediate export of the 2005 harvest. I rushed through those items, but it is important to examine the terms of the agreement, because they are historic milestones. The text includes the words:</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Rafah will be operated by the Palestinian Authority on its side, and Egypt on its side, according to international standards, in accordance with Palestinian law and subject to the terms of this agreement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/6">It would be easy to understate the significance of the move in the direction of legitimacy and authority within the Palestinian Authority, which is recognised by not only Palestinians but the international community.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/7">As to security, the agreement states that the Palestinian Authority</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/8" class="indent">&quot;will act to prevent the movement of weapons and explosives at the Rafah crossing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/9">How far have we travelled in recent times, away from complete distrust on the Israeli side of any of the Palestinian Authority's attempts to impose its own security, through rapid improvements in recent months, to, now, a statement that on the Rafah border the Palestinian Authority will determine security and deal with preventing the transfer of weapons and explosives!</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/10">The agreement also states that security services from Israel, the Palestinian Authority, the United States and Egypt</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/11" class="indent">&quot;will continue to coordinate on security issues and will participate in the security working group.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/12">I stress those matters because now there is proper co-ordination. It is not unilateralism or one side making decisions on the others' behalf, but, in a very tense and difficult situation, where we still have far to go, all sides working together&mdash;the international actors and those on the Palestinian and Israeli sides.</p>

	<p pid="a.483.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate. As he has mentioned security, does he agree that security is the key to a lasting middle east peace settlement? One reason why so much progress has been made recently is that the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinians are finally beginning to recognise that.</p>

	<p pid="a.483.1/1">The intervention is wise. That could not have happened unless the Palestinian Authority and the Israelis had been willing to work together on the issue. I am convinced that the Palestinian Authority are committed in a way that they have never been to tackling security, but they will continue to need cross-border intelligence and logistics support from not only the Israelis but the international community to aid them in any way that they can. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that security is pivotal.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/2">Equally, I want to touch on the question of the economics of the region&mdash;in Israel and in the Palestinian territories. In terms of the much talked about economic road map, led by the UK there is now an international commitment to Palestinian economic rejuvenation, based on James Wolfensohn's recommendations for the viability of a Palestinian state.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/3">The Chancellor of the Exchequer's report&mdash;an economic plan&mdash;should accompany the political road map to which the Israeli Government, the Palestinian Authority and the international community have committed themselves. It is a fundamental step forward that goes along with security, political impetus in the region and economic necessities.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/4">I shall read from the statement that the Chancellor of the Exchequer made last week. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/5" class="indent">&quot;So my message is one of hope: that there is an economic prize before us, a double dividend. By ensuring that people&mdash;who, because they have a job and a livelihood, to support their families&mdash;have hope and a stake in a peaceful future. And also by ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are so great, that people see that the unacceptable cost of returning to violence is not only a loss of security, but also of prosperity.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/6" class="indent">Prosperity through peace. And peace through prosperity.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.483.2/1">May I register an interest? I am chair of the Labour Friends of Israel. On my hon. Friend's point about the need for economic prosperity, does he also recognise that the new leader of the Israeli Labour party, Amir Peretz, is going to move the focus towards tackling the big problems of poverty and social deprivation in Israel? That will help reduce turbulence in the middle east.</p>

	<p pid="a.484.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Illsley. I am conscious that my three hours has been extended to three hours and a few minutes. However, I shall try to keep a close eye on the time, because I want to hear the response of my hon. Friend the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.1/2">We should not discount the reality of the situation that was touched on by the Chancellor when he talked about the gap between the $800 a year typical income in Gaza and the $18,000 a year typical income in Israel. We can drive forward the economic road map only if we are willing to address that issue, and I think that we are committed to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.1/3">I shall touch on how the Chancellor said he would take the issue forward. First, the report will be followed by meetings in London with the G8, the EU and Israeli and Palestinian Finance Ministers. I applaud the Government&mdash;No. 10, No. 11 and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&mdash;on that, because they have driven forward many of those issues, sometimes dragging the international community along behind them.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.1/4">There will be a final conference on <phrase class="date" code="">13 December</phrase> hosted jointly with the World Bank, bringing together Israeli and Palestinian business men to promote private sector growth. I was sitting at a lunch three weeks ago with Israeli business men on either side of me. Although they applauded the political engagement of this Government and the international community, they were adamant that nothing would be done unless the private sector on the Palestinian and Israeli sides was brought on board to drive forward the area's economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.1/5">Also, there are European Commission plans to double aid to the Palestinian Authority; I shall return to them. The EU has already made available &euro;60 million for quick-start projects, including &euro;25 million for a new cargo terminal at Gaza airport. In addition, as many Members know, in July 2005 the G8 pledged an extra $3 billion in aid to the Palestinians. There are many positive messages at the moment, but it would be completely remiss to have a debate of this nature without tackling the issue of the fence, wall, barrier, or whatever.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.1/6">In my short tenure as an MP, I have visited Israel and the occupied territories on three occasions, with Labour Friends of Israel and with the Labour Middle East Council. Anyone who saw Israel's security barrier would be completely struck with sadness that it had ever been built, but we have to remember that the barrier is not the cause of the conflict, but a direct consequence of it. It is unlikely that the withdrawal from Gaza and a small part of the northern west bank would even have been countenanced without the improved security afforded to Israelis by the security barrier.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.1/7">The Israeli Labour party was, of course, a supporter of the barrier before the idea was even brought forward. The Israeli Labour party wrote to Labour Friends of Israel last year:</p>
	<p pid="a.484.1/8" class="indent">&quot;The barrier is undesirable but it is a non-violent . . . measure that has saved lives on both sides.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.484.1/9">The Israeli Labour party then talked through the figures. It said that there had been a 90 per cent. drop in attacks by terrorists since the barrier was begun, a 70 per cent. decrease in the number of Israelis murdered and an 85 per cent. decrease in the number of wounded, and so on. However, it acknowledged that the route of the barrier is hugely contentious and arguable, and that it is not the long-term solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.1/10">Hon. Members, myself included, have rightly raised concerns about the exact route of the barrier, especially in and around Jerusalem, and the humanitarian impact on Palestinians. We would all agree that the barrier should not be used as an excuse to unilaterally pre-empt a negotiated settlement or agreement about the future of Palestine or any final borders. It is of paramount importance that that principle is accepted in Israeli law. Hon. Members may be aware that, in a series of judgments, the Israeli High Court established the precedent that it is legal for the Israeli Government to build the wall only where that is a proportionate response to the security threat posed.</p>

	<p pid="a.485.0/1">I saw the barrier with my own eyes last week. If we are to accept what my hon. Friend says about it, can he explain why it is not built on the border, and why up to 10 per cent. of Palestinian territory is now behind the wall?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.485.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" speakername="Huw Irranca-Davies" colnum="485"  time="16:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h05.htm#51123h05_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.485.1/1">That is the very point that I was making. I accept that the route of the barrier is contestable, but the statistics on what it has done to give security to the Israelis are incontestable. I am looking forward to the awaited Israeli High Court decision on the route through Jerusalem, as are many people.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/2">On Hamas, we are heading towards legislative elections to the Palestinian Authority in January. That is another landmark in extending democracy throughout the Palestinian Authority. The Hamas charter still calls for the destruction of the state of Israel and opposes all peace conferences. If Hamas is to be accepted into the Palestinian political process&mdash;I do not rule that out in any way, because we have seen, in conflict zones around the world, the advantages of bringing in those who have at some point seemed irreconcilable to peace, and bringing them in pays dividends&mdash;the international community must constantly demand that Hamas accepts the principle of a two-state solution and completely renounces violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/3">Let me touch briefly on the political changes that have happened in recent days and weeks. First, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase> said, the new Labour leader Amir Peretz has a very progressive foreign and domestic policy&mdash;something for which many of us have been waiting for some time. He is determined to keep up the momentum of disengagement, and is already submitting a Bill offering compensation to west bank settlements if 60 per cent. of residents agree to leave voluntarily. He believes that the peace process is linked to the welfare reform package, and he is much more inclined to move towards final-status solutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/4">Only a week ago, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-16">16 November</phrase>, Jonathan Freedland described him in <i>The Guardian </i>as</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/5" class="indent">&quot;the man who could bring about a revolution in Israeli politics&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/6">A week on, Ariel Sharon steps down from Likud and we move towards a complete shake-up of Israeli politics, beyond the role of Peretz and the Labour party. On leaving, Mr. Sharon said:</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/7" class="indent">&quot;After great hesitation, I decided to leave the Likud. The Likud in its current format cannot lead Israel to its national aims . . . Remaining in the Likud means a waste of time in political fighting.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/8" class="indent">&quot;The task in front of us&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/9">says the great warrior, the man who built the settlements,</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/10" class="indent">&quot;is to create a base for a peace agreement in which we will create the permanent borders of the state while demanding the cessation of terror. The disengagement from Gaza gave us a historic opportunity. I don't mean to miss it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/11">I am sure that the Minister already has the endless press cuttings, some of them cynical and sceptical about Sharon's motives and asking, &quot;Is he building a legacy; is he serious?&quot; In the classic phrase, the kaleidoscope has been shaken. My message to the Minister, with all his experience, and given his recent and future visits to the region, is to continue to press, not only with Peretz and the Labour party but with Ariel Sharon and others and with some of the minority parties, for a situation in which, when the kaleidoscope settles, it settles on something that is tied more closely to the aspirations of the Palestinian people as well as the security needs of the Israeli and that is based firmly on a two-state solution. At the moment, the process has all the potential to go very right, but similarly all the potential to go very wrong indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/12">I had intended to discuss the wider issues, but I see that the Minister is running out of time in which to reply as I aim towards my three hours. Let me set out some things that Labour Friends of Israel would want to happen in terms of both the Israeli and the Palestinian agenda. First, we want to see international development in which technological and agricultural expertise in Israel alongside its diplomatic and political relationship with some African countries could play a significant role. Secondly, UK-Israel joint research and development projects should receive specific encouragement&mdash; and as the Minister knows, there are already strong links with our Israeli counterparts. Thirdly, we seek greater security and counter-terrorism co-operation, building on the trust already developed by the Gaza-Egypt border control. There is more potential there.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/13">At EU level, we should be looking for other ways in which terrorism can be combated in the interests of supporting the peace process. In particular, we should look again at the UK's proscription of Hezbollah being matched in the EU lists. In respect of Palestinian development, we want to see a country assistance plan for Palestinians that looks at redrafting the common agricultural policy to reflect the disengagement and the increased Palestinian Authority capacity, so that more money goes directly to the Palestinian Authority. I am sure that the Minister has seen the documents&mdash;which I will share with him afterwards, as I have no time now&mdash;touching on the very sensitive issue of whether the money that goes to the Palestinian Authority has all been used for the right and appropriate purposes on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/14">Finally, we seek micro-financing for Palestinians. Funding should be put aside for a Palestinian equity fund directly to support those small businesses and agricultural projects. That is exactly the message that has been given to me by business men.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/15">As patron of the friends of the parents circle and bereaved families forum, and as a Member of the UK Parliament, I think we owe it to those families who have lost relatives and those who are living through these times of conflict to drive this agenda forward. I know of the Minister's commitment to this project, and I look forward to hearing from him how the UK Government at all levels intend to do that.</p>

	<p pid="a.487.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase> on raising this issue. It remains, as he said, a huge international challenge to make sure that things take a turn for the better, not the worse. Now is a unique moment. My hon. Friend and I are neighbouring MPs and we know about territorial disputes. I have the magnificent Royal Glamorgan hospital in my constituency, while he has the hospital car park. Our equivalent of the River Jordan is the River Ely, but I shall not go into that now.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/2">My hon. Friend concentrated on some important issues. I have never been one of those people who believed that Gaza was a hopeless case. On the contrary, anyone who has gone into Gaza and walked through the fields knows that they are good for growing all sorts of vegetables. It is good agricultural land as well as good for building on. When walking to the beach, we are on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean, which should be enough of a sign of what is possible. The area ought to be a tourist paradise. It could become one.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/3">He did not say it as directly as I will, but the most important point that my hon. Friend made in his speech is that it will not do the people who live in the area any good to have on their doorstep what amounts to a basket case of a country. They want a vibrant economy. The population of Gaza is young. The west bank has a young population.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/4">My hon. Friend touched on some interesting issues, not least of which is communications. He drew attention to the welcome developments on the Rafah crossing, as well as on other crossings. Now is a great moment of liberation for the people of Gaza. They will be able to move back and forth to Egypt. I was in Cairo recently and I know that Egypt wants to play its part. The Jordanians want to play a part, too. They are happy with recent developments and want their borders opened up. As my hon. Friend said, now may be a real turning point. I certainly hope that it is.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/5">We need to go further. We welcome the fact that bus convoys will take the people of Gaza and the people of the west bank to visit each other. We cannot have a situation similar to that in the two Germanys before unification took place; that is absurd in the 21st century. There must be proper communications, such as a specially designed road, a railway line or both. At present, we are building the world's most sophisticated railway line into St. Pancras. I hope that we can use our expertise to help Jim Wolfensohn and his team take his project forward. That would be marvellous.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/6">My hon. Friend described vividly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1637" name="Tom Levitt">the continuing problems. My hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt)</phrase> spoke of the wall. I do not know which part of it he saw; I saw the part that was in and around Jerusalem. It is a horrifying sight. It is 28 to 30 ft tall. Architecturally, it is certainly no great wall of China. It is ugly. It stands as a reminder to all of us that such a solution will only be temporary, until the two countries see their economies grow and realise that they need each other. There is a symbiotic reciprocity between the countries, which was understood in the early days of Israel. There is no question about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/7">I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore; I went to a kibbutz on the old Jerusalem road a month or so ago and, although the left wingers there were reluctant to admit it, they said that life had become immeasurably easier since the barrier went up. That should tell us something&mdash;we do not have to agree&mdash;about the psyche and the mood that it has generated.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/8">I went to see a Palestinian who is living in Jerusalem and is married to a British citizen. He works in a hospital just up the road from where he lives in a nice house. He is a hard-working doctor and instead of getting to work in four minutes, it will take him 40 minutes.</p>

	<p pid="a.488.0/1">Does my hon. Friend accept that if the High Court decision in Israel suggests re-routing or even dismantling part of the wall, again the Israeli Government should respond favourably?.</p>

	<p pid="a.488.1/1">That is the strength of the Israeli state. Palestinians told me that their greatest weapon at the moment is the Israeli High Court, and we should remember that.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.1/2">The debate inside the Palestinian Authority at the moment is interesting because there has been a feeling that Palestinians should not use the Israeli legal system. I think they should certainly try to use it if it enables them to obtain some justice in the routing of the barrier.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-23a.488.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1663" speakername="Roger Berry" colnum="488"  time="16:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051123/halltext/51123h05.htm#51123h05_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.488.2/1">In relation to the barrier and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">the reference that my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase> made to economic development, does the Minister acknowledge that the barrier in separating Palestinians from their land and preventing people from moving&mdash;I was with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1637" name="Tom Levitt">my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt)</phrase> and the Palestinian Authority last week&mdash;does not just delay them, and that many have lost their job because they can no longer get from Bethlehem to Jerusalem? The extremely time-consuming road blocks that we experienced on occasions are not just an inconvenience for Palestinians; they are a real humiliation. Those are obstacles to the development of the Palestinian Authority. Should they not go as quickly as possible, to enable that development to take place?</p>

	<p pid="a.488.3/1">Yes, that was a very fine speech. The obstacles should go as quickly as possible. I know that the United Nations has a mission in Jerusalem that is looking at the matter, but we must be careful. I tried to illustrate the effect of the barrier on Israeli psychology. It is no use assuming that if one side does something, the other will follow. We must take everyone along. It is disgraceful that people have lost their livelihood and the ability to come out of their home and stroll in areas where they have loved to stroll in the past. That is a disgrace; there is no question about that. I would like to see everyone press as hard as this Government have done to get that barrier re-routed. We will not back down on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.3/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore could have mentioned the real problem of a north-south division of the west bank and of the whole area. That is something about which we will keep banging away.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.3/3">In the moments left to me, I want to thank my hon. Friend for raising the matter. His work in the middle east to try to bring reconciliation and peace to an area that has been so terribly torn by war and conflict is well known and much appreciated. We should all be grateful to him, and especially for his work with the parents circle and bereaved families. All too often we forget the victims, some of whom are British. Some fine people have been killed in Gaza and the west bank who were doing very good work, and we should not forget them.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.3/4">We now have a moment when we can perhaps start to take the process forward to much better times. I hope that everyone approaches that with the best will in the world and tries to bring about changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.3/5" class="indent">It being Five o'clock, the motion for the Adjournment of the sitting lapsed, without Question put.</p>
