<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-22a.360.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1671" speakername="Fabian Hamilton" colnum="360"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080122/halltext/80122h0001.htm#08012265000491">
	<p pid="a.360.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. As I shall describe, many of the more unscrupulous employers frequently force their workers to take on self-employed status, but their situation is clearly nothing like being self-employed. I have been self-employed and know that the self-employed have a lot of control over their lives. They may not have the benefits of being employees, nor a lot of employment protection, but they have much more control over what they do, when they do it and how much they charge for their labour. The big difference for those who are really home workers but are designated as self-employed is that they have absolutely no control over what they charge, when they do their work, how quickly it must be done, or how or whether they advertise. I therefore think my hon. Friend's proposal is very helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/2">If unscrupulous employers try to avoid their obligations to employees, they can be challenged only at tribunal. That uncertainty can make it difficult for home workers to assert even their most basic rights to the national minimum wage and holiday pay. Workers can be deterred from demanding those rights through the very real fear that they may lose their work as a consequence. Without employment contracts, they have little protection against that sort of victimisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/3">In 2002, the Government conducted a consultation exercise, asking whether</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/4" class="indent">&quot;there are any categories of working people currently excluded from statutory employment rights who require the protection provided by some or all rights and how they would benefit.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/5">Amongst many others, the National Group on Homeworking responded. It argued for the extension of all existing employment rights to all workers, particularly home workers who are not genuinely self-employed. Unfortunately, although the consultation raised hopes that the Government were intending to take action, their response, which was delivered only on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-30">30 March 2006</phrase>, was extremely disappointing. In the &quot;Success at Work&quot; strategy paper, the Government rejected calls for a change in the law. Furthermore, that 58-page document, which was intended to protect so-called vulnerable workers, made no specific mention of home workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/6">The current situation is hugely complex and confusing, and the unpredictability of tribunal rulings on status benefits no one. Home workers have to negotiate their way through a maze of legal arguments, tests and obstructions, simply for a chance to gain the rights to which other employees are automatically entitled. The Government need to take swift and decisive action to grant full employment status and rights to all UK home workers who are working for another person and not genuinely in business on their own account.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-21">21 November</phrase> last year, together with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1659" name="Ann Cryer">the Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer)</phrase>, I hosted in the House of Commons the launch of a report entitled, &quot;Subject to Status&quot;. It was written and researched by Nesta Holden and was published by the National Group on Homeworking, which is based in Leeds. It is the only national body that supports and helps home workers. Accompanying staff from the organisation and the author of the report were several home workers who came to Parliament to tell their stories in their own words to Members of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/8">One home worker's story concerning her status amply illustrates the issues, which the report so ably highlights. Pamela James took her employer to a tribunal to establish that she is not self-employed nor does she have the rights and benefits of an employed worker&mdash;she falls between the two. But let her speak in her own words:</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/9" class="indent">&quot;I have nothing to advertise, I have no customers, I have no trade name, I am provided with work and I am told how to do it. I work as a courier by delivering parcels on behalf of a multinational company. The company tells me that I am self employed and that I need to use my own car and phone. Because of these costs I receive less than the minimum wage and I have never received an increase in my pay rates since I started with them, over five years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/10" class="indent">I have tried looking for other work but being a lone parent I need some flexibility especially during school holidays. It's not easy to find a job when you live some distance from the city, there are limitations, and I could never afford a childminder. Yet at present I feel that something is better than nothing.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/11" class="indent">According to an article in a national newspaper the company whom I work on behalf of made a one billion pound profit&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/12">&pound;1 billion&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/13" class="indent">&quot;in 2004. That year I earned comfortably less than &pound;3 per hour, if not &pound;2 per hour, yet the company kept telling me that I am self employed and it hurts because I am struggling and they won't listen.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/14" class="indent">Recently I took the company to the Employment Tribunal. There was a preliminary hearing to discuss my status. This hearing lasted 5 hours. In the courtroom the clerk put the Bible in my hand, I became distressed. I thought, does this mean that everyone in my position has to go to court to seek something so basic as the minimum wage? Other people have an automatic right to this, why can't I?</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/15" class="indent">If I was genuinely self employed I would have my own control, I could negotiate rates, I could advertise, I would have my own customers and my own profit and loss account. Despite all of this I lost the court case. This was mainly because of a small clause in the contract. Presently I am making an appeal to the courts because accordingly the clause is not genuine. I feel that the clause was a false label with the intention to save the company costs. A clause to enable them to offload their obligations onto others.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/16" class="indent">Even though I felt shut out the NGH have been of much valued support to me throughout all of this and they are still doing everything they can to help. I truly can't imagine how I could have otherwise coped on my own.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/17" class="indent">An email response from the DTI&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/18">the Department of Trade and Industry, as it was then called&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/19" class="indent">&quot;with regards to the loophole in the law, states that a change to the legal framework could damage labour market flexibility and result in a reduction in overall employment. I am wondering if they mean that if everybody paid as much money as the minimum wage would there be no employment? It is not consoling for myself or others like me who are locked out because of this loophole. It is also not consoling when the company whom I work on behalf of wrote a letter to the Inland Revenue which stated, 'We do not believe that the minimum wage is appropriate for this population of workers.'</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/20" class="indent">I assume they mean this population of workers are the loyal homeworkers whom do work on their behalf. My children are important to me, I believe that it is unfair that the minimum wage is not considered appropriate for us, and I know there are thousands out there like me who feel the same as I do. If I do belong to this population of workers, then I wish them to know that we are real people and I ask you to please help us and support our campaign to close this loophole in the law. I believe that every single homeworker deserves at least the basic employment rights.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/21">That powerful plea was made before Pamela's most recent tribunal hearing, which took place at the end of May last year. Eight months later, she is still waiting for a decision. It would be helpful if the Minister, who I know cannot interfere with tribunal decisions, used his influence to get that decision, whatever it may be, as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.372.0/1">Does the hon. Lady agree that in addition to that clear description she gave&mdash;it was helpful extremely helpful&mdash;sometimes, the home worker is expected to provide their own machinery, especially in the sewing industry? I cannot think of a better description of that than the one in Monica Ali's book &quot;Brick Lane&quot;. The machinery is supplied, serviced and looked after by the home worker. The home work can only be done with the right equipment, but the employer pays nothing towards its costs. Does she agree that that is another abuse of home workers?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-22a.374.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1574" speakername="Eleanor Laing" colnum="374"  time="010:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080122/halltext/80122h0003.htm#08012265000507">
	<p pid="a.374.1/1">I think that some of my colleagues have also said what I said about the minimum wage. I certainly believe it.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.1/2">I met the National Group on Homeworking some time ago, when they brought a large delegation of people to the House of Commons. In all truth, not only was I interested in the issues that arose from that meeting but I was genuinely shocked to discover the employment conditions under which large numbers of people work in Britain today. They are not the type of bad employment conditions that existed 100 years ago, or indeed those found in India and China at present&mdash;I am not being insulting to those countries, but we must recognise the reality and truth of the situation there. However, although the current employment conditions of large numbers of home workers are not as bad as low-paid workers once had to endure, they are still bad enough to require our attention and the Government's attention as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.1/3">The hon. Member for Leeds, North-East highlighted the heart-rending stories of some people who were brave enough to put their heads above the parapet and allow their circumstances to be used as important examples. It is quite unacceptable that a tribunal decision should take more than eight months to come out. That is simply unfair and I hope that somebody somewhere will take note of that fact this morning and deal with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.1/4">In general, however, we must recognise that people do not usually work from home, or want to work part-time or need flexibility in their working environment because they choose to; nor is it because, as some employers and some other people would have us believe, they are housewives earning a bit of pin money. That view is an insult&mdash;an absolute insult. The reason why people work from home, or need flexibility in employment or to work part-time, is that they have other family duties, whether it be looking after children or looking after elderly or sick relatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.1/5">Furthermore, we as a society not only recognise that that situation exists; we encourage it. We need people to do two jobs, especially women&mdash;let us not forget that more than 80 per cent. of home workers are women&mdash;but also men in some circumstances. We need them to bring up families and look after the elderly and sick but we also need them to be economically active, because we need their input in the economy. Our economy would not work without people doing those part-time jobs. Such work is not a luxury or an add-on, nor is it about pin money; it is absolutely essential. Given that we expect people, especially women, to organise their lives so that they can work, be economically active and pay taxes, and look after their children and elderly relatives at the same time, we ought to recognise their work and give them the respect they deserve for doing lots of different jobs at once.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.1/6">Bringing up children is not an add-on luxury; it is an absolute necessity. Looking after the elderly is not an add-on luxury; it is the most difficult job there is. Where people are also trying to earn money at the same time, they ought to be given respect and support.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.1/7">Flexibility is absolutely vital. I see from <i>Hansard </i>that I had an interesting exchange with the then Minister for Women, now the Secretary of State for Transport (Ruth Kelly), in the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-08">8 June 2006</phrase>, when I was shadow Minister for Women. We agreed with one another about the importance of encouraging flexibility. I was arguing that the right to request flexibility should be extended, a point to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1823" name="Lorely Burt">the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt)</phrase> alluded a few moments ago in her excellent speech. At present, the right to request flexible working is extended only to some people in the working population; like the hon. Member for Solihull, I argue that it should be extended far more widely.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.1/8">I say that because children do not stop being an enormous responsibility when they reach the age of six or seven; actually, they become more difficult then. Sometimes, people do not understand that. A baby can be put in a corner to sleep, but that is not possible with an eight-year-old child. Children of eight, nine or 10 and especially teenagers need their parents even more than small children do.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-22a.375.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1574" speakername="Eleanor Laing" colnum="375"  time="010:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080122/halltext/80122h0003.htm#08012265000509">
	<p pid="a.375.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct. I do not have time to go into that aspect in great detail right now, but I am sure that the Minister will be well aware that when one studies the effects of flexible working one finds that many of the best, most profitable and most employee-friendly companies in Britain have introduced flexible working or have experimented with it, and the vast majority of them have evidence that not only has flexibility improved the morale of their work force but, as a result, their profitability and the general well-being of the company, in economic as well as social terms, has improved, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.1/2">Not so long ago, when people made an excuse to be away from the workplace it would be anything but, &quot;I have had to go and pick up my child from school&quot;. I have done it myself. I have not dared to say that I could not be at such and such a meeting because I had to go to school; I did not dare to say that because I thought that I would be looked down on. However, in the last few years, since we have brought the subject right to the front of the political agenda, I am no longer afraid to give that reason.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.1/3">The important issue is that many men in the political world have come to respect the position of women who are looking after children. I honestly pay tribute to the men who dared to stand up for the employment rights of women who have to look after children. I do not know whether that means that there are lots of &quot;new men&quot; in the House of Commons. I do not really care what they are called; all I care about is that we are addressing the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.1/4">My son, who is aged six, saw me on television asking a question about the issue at one point; he had seen me say something about it. The following day, I explained to him that I could not be there at bedtime because I had to vote at 7 pm. He said, &quot;Well, Mummy, I want David Cameron to become Prime Minister, because he said that mummies should spend more time with their boys&quot;. I was very proud of my little son for having the political message so neatly wrapped up.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.1/5">It is true that the Leader of the Opposition gave that message, but the real point to be made right now is that when we address the general issue of the gender pay gap the end of the market that we should concentrate on is not where we see glamorous, City executives earning hundreds of thousands of pounds per year; it is the other end of the market, where the gender pay gap between part-time workers is more than 40 per cent. It is the fact that most part-time workers and home workers are women that causes that enormous gender pay gap.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.1/6">When we talk about the importance of bringing equality to the labour market, we must not ignore the position of home workers, because the gender pay gap would probably become much smaller if they were taken out of the statistics. I am not saying that they should be, but that somebody somewhere should examine what the gender pay gap would be if home workers were not in the picture. I do not have the resources to do so, but somebody somewhere has, and that would let us see how difficult the position of home workers is.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.1/7">I shall conclude without saying all the other things that I could say about this important and wide subject because I want to give the Minister plenty of time to reply to the debate. Given that the Government have taken great steps forward on the minimum wage, equality and flexible working, I am genuinely surprised by their attitude to home workers. Of course, I recognise the difficulties in current employment law, which affect employers, employees and home workers alike, but I am genuinely surprised that the Government have not tackled the issue, so along with everyone else who has spoken, I want to hear what the Minister has to say.</p>

	<p pid="a.381.1/1">There can be no more important issue affecting the lives, and quality of life, of our constituents, than the regional planning strategy that is now set out in what is described as the regional spatial strategy. It has a big impact on every constituency in what I like to call the west country. The west country has a population of more than 5 million&mdash;on a par with Scotland&mdash;which demonstrates a substantial democratic deficit. Today's debate should represent the beginning of detailed parliamentary scrutiny of the regional plan for the south-west before the Secretary of State takes any decision on its contents and proposed modifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.381.1/2">Last Thursday, I asked the Leader of the House</p>
	<p pid="a.381.1/3" class="indent">&quot;what role she envisages the Minister for the South West playing in&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.381.1/4">today's debate,</p>
	<p pid="a.381.1/5" class="indent">&quot;and what other opportunities there will be for a debate in Government time&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.381.1/6">on this highly contentious strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.381.1/7">The response by the Leader of the House bears repetition:</p>
	<p pid="a.381.1/8" class="indent">&quot;The Minister for the South West is my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" name="Ben Bradshaw">the Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw)</phrase>. We are developing the role of the regional Ministers<i>&mdash;[Laughter.]</i> Regional Ministers are a new innovation. I think that they are doing a very good job on behalf of their regions and that we can build on that role. What we need to do next&mdash;we are looking at this in the Modernisation Committee&mdash;is to consider how to develop a system for regional accountability to the House. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will contribute to that inquiry.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-01-17.1090"><i>Official Report</i>, 17 January 2008; Vol. 470, c. 1090</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.381.1/9">I am happy to contribute to any inquiry, within reason, but I hope to hear from the Minister today how the regional spatial strategy will be held accountable, which is so important.</p>
	<p pid="a.381.1/10">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-18">18 July 2007</phrase>, in answer to a question from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> about</p>
	<p pid="a.381.1/11" class="indent">&quot;what assessment the Minister for the South West has made of the regional strategy&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.381.1/12">the Minister for the South West replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.381.1/13" class="indent">&quot;I will advise the relevant Secretary of State on the approval of regional strategies&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-07-18.360"><i>Official Report</i>, 18 July 2008; Vol. 463, c. 360W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.381.1/14">That is not a system of regional accountability to this House. Will his advice be based on the views of west country Members of Parliament? Will his advice to the Secretary of State be published? When will it be issued? What about the regional Select Committees, which were promoted by the Government to address the democratic accountability deficit, but which now seem to have been shelved? Have they been conveniently shelved until debate on the regional spatial strategy is over?</p>
	<p pid="a.381.1/15">The strategy was put on deposit between June and August 2006 and generated 1,982 responses and 14,786 representations. However, fewer than one in 10 of those responding were invited to appear at the examination in public, and despite the plethora of objections and representations, nine key matters only were selected for debate. The process at the EIP was seriously flawed, as I spelled out in a letter that I sent to the panel chairman in December 2006. In that letter, I stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.381.1/16" class="indent">&quot;if this Plan is introduced unamended, it will result in substantial detriment to the built and natural environment in my constituency and will damage the quality of life of large numbers of my constituents. That is why as an elected representative in Parliament, I wish to have the opportunity to give oral evidence during the Examination in Public.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.381.1/17">My request, and those of other Members in the west country, was turned down, on the basis&mdash;I suppose&mdash;that we were not sufficient stakeholders. Who could be a bigger stakeholder than somebody who needs electing to this Parliament? Instead of the elected representatives, we have a plethora of officialdom and quangodom.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-22a.392.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" speakername="Steve Webb" colnum="392"  time="011:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080122/halltext/80122h0006.htm#08012265000535">
	<p pid="a.392.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" name="Christopher Chope">the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)</phrase> on securing the debate. I asked for one on exactly the same topic last week, so I was delighted when it came up. I shall, inevitably, raise a few local points, but some of the issues I raise will be of general interest, and I hope that the Minister will respond to a few of my points about procedure and going forward to the next stages of the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/2">My constituency falls under South Gloucestershire unitary authority. The original RSS proposed an extra 23,000 houses over a 20-year period, and the panel came back with 30,800&mdash;an increase of one third. That takes South Gloucestershire to a very unwelcome second place in the rather dubious league table of all the unitary authorities and district councils. We are second only to Swindon. Our area has already had phenomenal growth in housing numbers with very little infrastructure to go with it. We are worried that the growth is simply unsustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/3">I shall try to give people a feel for what 30,000 houses will look like. Just as newspapers enjoy talking about a country the size of Wales, we have a local unit called a Bradley Stoke. Bradley Stoke is a large new town in our area, and a Bradley Stoke unit is about 7,500 houses. To give my constituents a feel for what is planned, it is four Bradley Stokes, or an extra Bradley Stoke, compared with the last plan. We are worried that we cannot cope with development on that scale. I do not dispute that we need more houses, including affordable houses&mdash;indeed, I have twice led debates in this Chamber on affordable housing in South Gloucestershire. This is not nimbyism. It is not about saying no to development but about saying that we need sustainable, manageable development and more affordable housing for local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/4">The biggest change affecting my constituency is the extra 5,000 houses north of Yate. Yate town council made representations to the panel, but was not allowed to make oral representations. Even the developers asked for only 2,000 houses north of Yate, but the panel said, almost out of the blue, &quot;No, we think there should be 5,000.&quot; It is a regional strategy, not a site-specific local proposal. If the proposal in the original plan had been for 5,000 houses, there would have been a huge response locally, but now it appears to be too late for that. I hope that the Minister will clarify, first of all, what happens inside the Department between now and the Secretary of State giving her response? In other words, is now the best time for the people of Yate to feed in what they think, or should they wait for the Secretary of State to give her response and comment in the consultation period? Clearly, the sooner we feed comments in, the better. The people of Yate want to reopen the process of giving evidence to the panel, because they were denied the opportunity to do that. They had no idea that this was coming and it was a complete bolt from the blue.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/5">What are the problems? First, transport infrastructure is a problem. The situation is laughable. The document, at paragraph 4.1.61, says of Yate that</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/6" class="indent">&quot;The settlement is also well linked to other parts of the conurbation by public transport.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/7">We have a rather poor and expensive bus service, and a train service that is so poor and unreliable that people drive from Yate to the north fringe of Bristol, so the idea that that is the basis for 5,000 more homes seems absolutely incredible.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/8">What about health care for these people? The local hospital is actually being closed, on the basis of population projections that are out of date. What will happen there?</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/9">What about drainage? Downstream from Yate, we are already getting substantial flooding. Where is the evidence that this number, which really feels as if it has been plucked from the air, will not make things worse? The document says:</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/10" class="indent">&quot;A Strategic Sustainability Assessment was submitted as a supporting document. This document was submitted in relation to a proposal for 2,000 dwellings...but in our view there is considerably more scope for development and we propose a total of 5,000 dwellings.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/11">That is it. Where does that number of 5,000 come from? It has just been plucked from the air and thrust upon us. What I fear is that, when we come to planning applications two or three years down the track and the people of Yate say, &quot;We don't want this&quot;, I will have to say, &quot;It's too late. The die is cast. Some panel you have never heard of in some hearing that you were not allowed to go to has decided, and that is it.&quot; Where is the local accountability in that?</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/12">The key question is this: why is what is supposed to be a strategic regional assessment giving these very detailed local proposals and how do local people now have their say?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-22a.398.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1449" speakername="Eric Pickles" colnum="398"  time="012:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080122/halltext/80122h0007.htm#08012265000544">
	<p pid="a.398.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" name="Julia Goldsworthy">the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy)</phrase>. This is the first time that we have spoken together in a debate. I congratulate her on her new appointment. I thought that her speech was passionate and impressive. I also congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" name="Christopher Chope">the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)</phrase> on securing this debate. I have seen him in various ministerial guises and have always found him immensely courteous and keen to listen to what local people have to say. He never needed a stakeholder or a panel of experts to tell him what to do. He had a great deal of common sense and listened to what local people wanted. We could do with more people like him in Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.398.0/2">I feel enormous sympathy for the Minister for Housing who has sat there in splendid isolation. She has had a Parliamentary Private Secretary for company&mdash;he no doubt wishes that he had something better to do with his time&mdash;but no regional Minister. I am not entirely sure what the Minister for the South West does. [Hon. Members: &quot;Not a lot.&quot;] That is not entirely fair. This grand panjandrum clearly has a role. He appears to be a highly decorated postman. If one sends a letter to him, he passes it on to someone else. If one expresses a view, he asks someone else for the answer. When the hon. Gentleman comes to write his extensive memoirs, his time as Regional Minister for the South West will not make more than a footnote. I hope, however, that he will pay some attention to the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.398.0/3">I turn to the independent panel's reluctance to listen to elected politicians. That is entirely understandable because those folks are entirely unrepresentative. They are not elected by anyone, and, therefore by the nature of things, will find elected politicians intimidating. To see an elected politician would symbolise to those good folks exactly how much democratic legitimacy they lack.</p>
	<p pid="a.398.0/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch talked about the simplistic approach of project and provide and said that it had been replaced by an even more simplistic policy. We have some indication of that in the fact that the Government seem hellbent on increasing housing targets. &quot;Let us build 23,000 homes,&quot; they say; &quot;No, let us make it 28,000. Let us build 38,000. No, let us go even higher.&quot; One can almost imagine the brickies standing by their hobs: &quot;Comrades, let us put up some more. Off we go.&quot; Actually, they probably would not say &quot;Comrades&quot; but &quot;Tovarishchi&quot; because they almost certainly will be Polish plumbers and brickies. Let us meet this Government's target. We know what their response has been. Last week, we heard that there has been a 5 per cent. drop in new house buildings. Another projection for this year is that it is going to drop even further. The Minister, with the help of her Parliamentary Private Secretary, might as well take her chair outside, stand it on the piece of land on the other side of Black Rod's garden and command the Thames not to rise, because although she may increase the figures, nothing will happen unless people are prepared to build houses. There is complete detachment from the reality on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.398.0/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> spoke about the country bumpkin lane that is close to his local airport. The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne spoke about the lack of infrastructure. We have representatives from a more local level who are very close to the people. The Launceston mayor, Mr. Eric Chapman, says that schools are absolutely bursting and it is difficult now to get an appointment with a health centre. He says that we would welcome houses provided that the infrastructure is provided at the same time, but unfortunately that is never the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.405.1/1">Thank you, Miss Begg. I am pleased to have the opportunity to consider a very serious and troubling case from my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/2">Let me start by outlining what happened. In 2005, three men were stabbed&mdash;one fatally&mdash;and the man found guilty of the murder subsequently committed suicide in custody. That was a complete waste, and the family of the stabbed man want to ensure that lessons have been learned, so that no other family must face the loss and heartache that they have faced. Specifically, family members want to see changes in the way in which the police handle situations of escalating violence and in the interface between the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. They believe, with good reason, that their relative would still be alive if both those bodies had operated differently.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/3">Time constraints will not allow me to cover the inadequacies, as the family see it, of the Independent Police Complaints Commission inquiry or the way in which the judicial system treats victims; suffice it to say that the family believe that they have not been well served in either case. Let me spend five minutes, however, outlining the background to the murder.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/4">My constituent, Mr. Darrell Burrows, set up a haulage business with his brother, Clive Hoyland, in 1974. The business, which was based in Ravensthorpe in the constituency of the Under-Secretary of State for International Development, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1542" name="Shahid Malik">the Member for Dewsbury (Mr. Malik)</phrase>, flourished, and other members of the extended Burrows family, including Darrell's son, David, joined the work force.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/5">The family remember few, if any, problems before 2001, when Mr. Gavin Hogg rented a work space near the business. Within two years, however, the situation had changed dramatically, as the family's firm, along with several others on the industrial estate, started to be subjected to a campaign of intimidation, damage and antisocial behaviour by Gavin Hogg.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/6">Matters came to a head in April 2005, when the company gained planning permission for an extension to its premises. The proposed development enraged Mr. Hogg, and there were several incidents involving threats and intimidation, which culminated on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-09">9 May</phrase>, when he blocked access to the site with a JCB and a car. The police were called for the second time in a matter of weeks to deal with the situation and they believed that they had resolved the problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/7">Later that day, however, Mr. Hogg told another neighbour on the estate that he intended to kill Darrell Burrows the next day and make it look like an accident, and that is exactly what he attempted. As Mr. Burrows arrived for work on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-10">10 May</phrase>, he was greeted by Mr. Hogg, who punched him in the face and pulled him from his car before dragging him across a works yard and down a set of steps to a canal, where he intended to drown him. By pure chance, however, Mr. Hogg, not Mr. Burrows, fell into the water, which allowed Mr. Burrows to make his escape.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/8">According to police records, Mr. Burrows was left with a bruised and swollen right eye with a cut above it, four grazes and cuts to his right forearm, cuts and grazes to three fingers on his right hand, grazes to both knees, cuts to fingers on his left hand, bleeding around a fingernail and both elbows grazed and bleeding. As one can imagine, he feared for his life. His trousers and sweater were also in tatters, his watch was damaged and his car, which had careered off when he was dragged out of it, sustained &pound;13,000 of damage.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/9">Obviously, the police were called again, but the neighbour to whom Mr. Hogg had outlined his intention to kill Mr. Burrows had himself been subject to two years of intimidation by Hogg and refused to sign a statement without police protection, but that was refused. The investigating officer heard his account, however, and it was included in information provided to the CPS later that day.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/10">Despite two years of police involvement in the case, despite the fact that the police database showed Hogg to be a violent man and that at least one independent witness had said that the attack was a premeditated attempt at murder, and despite the injuries sustained by Mr. Burrows&mdash;a man in his 60s&mdash;Mr. Hogg, who was in his 30s, was later charged with a section 39 common assault and with criminal damage to the car.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/11">As can be imagined, the family were distraught at that turn of events, not least because Mr. Hogg was bailed to continue his threats and intimidation. A month later, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-10">10 June</phrase>, Mr. Clive Hoyland had a long conversation with the police to discuss the deteriorating situation. He is adamant that the police officer whom he spoke to agreed to visit the site to talk to the other factory owners, but that officer did not arrive and later claimed that no such appointment had been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/12">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-13">13 September</phrase>, Hogg was found guilty in the magistrates court of the charges of common assault and criminal damage and was bailed for sentencing the following day. Later that day, however, he again stalked and intimidated Mr. Burrows, who made two telephone calls to the police in the evening to request help, because he believed that Mr. Hogg was breaking the conditions of his bail. Nothing happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/13">The following morning, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-14">Wednesday 14 September</phrase>, Mr. Burrows attended a local police station, accompanied by a work colleague and his solicitor, to outline the intimidation that had taken place on the previous evening and to ask the police to act. His request was refused on the officer's mistaken belief that Hogg had not broken the terms of his bail.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/14">At lunch time that day, Hogg crashed his car into that of Mr. Burrows, which was parked outside the family's premises. When Mr. Burrows and colleagues went outside to investigate, Mr. Hogg stabbed him, Clive Hoyland and Darrell's son, David. David, a father of two, died soon after, and Mr. Hoyland, having missed death by half an inch according to the hospital consultant, was hospitalised for two weeks, while Mr. Burrows senior was hospitalised for a lesser period.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/15">In essence, therefore, the situation worsened greatly over two years, and the police were involved on at least seven and, by some accounts, many more occasions. None the less, a man lost of life, and several families have been devastated.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/16">Perhaps we should just accept that that is the way things worked out and that bad things happen in life. Psychiatric reports that were produced on Mr. Hogg at his trial suggested that he suffered either from a mixed personality disorder of some severity or a schizotypal disorder, and he had had a psychiatric assessment as early as 1992. He was paranoid and apparently suffered depression for many years, and professional reports variously described him as suffering from social phobia and as being a</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/17" class="indent">&quot;bomb waiting to go off&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/18">Well, the bomb went off on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-14">14 September 2005</phrase>, with devastating results for the Burrows family.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/19">Family members believe that the events could have been avoided if a different course of action had been taken on any one of the many occasions on which they contacted the police to seek help. Specifically, they believe that, if the attempted murder of Darrell Burrows had been seen for what it was and treated as such, Mr. Hogg would not have been at liberty to kill David Burrows.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/20">The family also believe that, if the police had been more persistent in working with the witness to Hogg's premeditated threat to kill Mr. Burrows, there would have been sufficient evidence for the charge of attempter murder, instead of the derisory charge of common assault. Even a section 47 assault might have made bail less likely. The judge at Hogg's subsequent trial, however, was quite clear that there had been an attempt to kill.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/21">The family specifically believe that an unseemly rush to clear up matters&mdash;no doubt with one eye on the expectations of the public and the media&mdash;meant that there was a consistent tendency on the part of the police to underplay the seriousness of what was a steadily worsening situation. Several times, the IPCC reports uses the phrase</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/22" class="indent">&quot;the police were called and the matter was resolved&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/23">Well, the matter was not resolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/24">The family also specifically believe that finding a series of individual officers guilty of various failings in their duty, as the IPCC report does, misses the point. There appears to be a systemic problem with the way in which the police operate in such situations, with each incident apparently being treated as though there was no context. As a result, its seriousness and significance are missed.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/25">I shall refer at this point to the Peter Woodhams murder of January 2006, in the constituency of the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase>. Exactly the same series of events seems to have happened, with the same response from the police force in question. That two officers were required to resign as a result of the inquiry misses the point, which is the apparent inability of the police system to intervene in such situations before a fatality takes place, despite many warning signs about the danger to the victim and the oft-stated view of the victim and his family that his life was under threat. Darrell Burrows told the police officer in the police station on the morning of the 14th&mdash;the morning of the murder&mdash;that if action were not taken, there would be a fatality.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/26">I now want to deal with the involvement of the Crown Prosecution Service, which directed the police on the appropriate charges after the attempted murder of Darrell Burrows in May 2005. As we know, and as I have said, its advice was to proceed with charges of common assault and criminal damage. What hon. Members might not know is the process by which that decision and other such decisions are arrived at.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/27">First, there was no face-to-face meeting between the police and the CPS representative, who sat in a call centre in the midlands and had information faxed and e-mailed to him. That is CPS Direct. That was then followed up by a telephone conversation between the police officer who completed the paperwork and the solicitor who acted for the CPS. However, the police officer who conducted that conversation was not the officer who investigated the crime and had not visited the scene or spoken to any of the other parties involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/28">The CPS representative accepted that the case was one of premeditated violence against Mr. Burrows&mdash;that is apparent from the record sheet&mdash;but suggested a charge of common assault, in the face of an apparent refusal by the one witness to sign a statement to attest to premeditated attempted murder. Why was Hogg, I wonder, not bailed for further investigations, rather than being charged with two minor offences?</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/29">The CPS officer made his decision, as is again apparent from his record sheet, without reference to the full police files in the case. It is unclear whether he had police files on Mr. Hogg at his disposal either, although that also appears unlikely. As I said at the outset, the view of the family is that, if an appropriate charge had been brought at that juncture, Mr. Hogg would not have been at liberty to kill David.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/30">What cannot be denied is the flawed nature of a system of long-distance liaison between the CPS, in the person of a solicitor who apparently had not obtained access to the full background details of the case, and a police officer who had to relay third-hand information given to him by the colleagues who had conducted the investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/31">As a result of what I have described, I have four or five questions for the Minister. The family believe that it is reasonable, in situations that develop over a period of time&mdash;in this case two years&mdash;and in which the police have several involvements, to expect the police to act proactively and not just to react to each incident in an atomised fashion. First, if the Minister agrees with the family about that, what changes can be made to police operations to encourage and support that approach? Secondly, has the pressure for results and for crimes to be cleared up reached the point at which, for both the police and the CPS, there is a tendency to downplay offences?</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/32">Let us remember a police officer was told by a credible business man that he was told by Hogg that he was going to kill Darrell Burrows. All the evidence was that he attempted to carry out that threat, but because the witness refused to make a written statement without some support that was dismissed as no longer relevant. Thirdly, should more efforts be made to secure a statement in such cases, as was suggested, again, by the trial judge in Hogg's case?</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/33">Fourthly, does the need to clear up cases get in the way of overseeing matters, which might have led to a more proactive approach in this case and in the saving of the life of a quiet family man, killed in his prime? Fifthly, what responsibility do the police have for liaison with mental health services? Both services had been dealing with Mr. Hogg since 1990. Finally, the family want to know what changes have taken place in police and CPS operations since the deaths of David and of Peter Woodhams, to ensure that such things never happen again.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-22a.413.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" speakername="David Heath" colnum="413"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080122/halltext/80122h0009.htm#08012265000577">
	<p pid="a.413.1/1">The total capacity is 10,200 kg per hectare, which is why we are left with the excess total of 2,240 kg. I do not want to over-state those particular figures, but they do illustrate the problem. What options are open to Mr. Griffin if he is to comply with the regulations? He could reduce the size of his herd by about 25 cows, but that is an unappetising prospect for any dairy farmer, given the lost milk revenue, which he estimates at &pound;55,000; he could buy more land, but again that would be expensive and possibly impractical, or he could export his manure to another farm, although I cannot imagine that neighbouring farms will be desperate for excess manure given the overall situation. If the proposals are passed, they will pose a real conundrum on the running costs of such businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.1/2">I would accept quite a lot of control if I felt that it was having a lasting and beneficial effect on the environment. However, it is extremely difficult to believe that the proposals will result in benefits in any way commensurate with the cost to the industry, and some would argue that they will result in little benefit at all. I have always felt that, in years gone by, the principal cause of nitrate leachate in our watercourses was the overuse of commercial nitrate fertiliser. However, it is no longer overused, and, arguably, as a consequence, levels of nitrate in our watercourses have reduced markedly in some areas of the country. I realise that those figures are disputed, and I do not have access to all those available, but certainly in some parts of the country it is clear that there is either stasis or a reduction in nitrate levels. Certainly there is nothing to suggest that this very expensive and overburdensome regulation will have a desirable effect in anyway commensurate with the cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.1/3">It could be argued that the practical consequences of what farmers will be required to do in order to meet the regulations will have a detrimental effect on the environment. Slurry is a natural product that provides the nutrients that the soil needs for growth. If it is not available, substitutes, such as artificial fertiliser, will be used, which I believe to be of more concern for the environment than the spreading of slurry. I find it difficult to understand the justification for the regulations. Will the Minister expand on that? Furthermore, why is it not possible to undesignate nitrate-vulnerable zones? That is completely illogical. If the risk has passed, owing to action taken, and there is no longer a problem, processes should be in place for undesignating particular areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.1/4">The closed periods for spreading will present practical difficulties for many working farmers. What determines when it is appropriate to spread slurry? Rainfall is a major factor: one does not want to go out and spread slurry when it is pouring down with rain, as it is in Somerset at the moment&mdash;we are under monsoon conditions. Let that be an illustration, because when would have been the best time to spread slurry in the fields in Somerset? Back in November and December it was unseasonably dry and we had a real opportunity then, but under the proposals it would have been the closed season. The open season for spreading would have started in mid-January. Ever since the date from which spreading would have been allowed, it has been teeming down with rain. Any farmer that spreads under those conditions would be doing no good to their land, it would all run off into the rivers&mdash;exactly where we do not want it&mdash;and it would be rank bad husbandry. Any farmer left with a need to spread slurry on land would not be able to do so, sensibly and reasonably, during the current spreading season.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.1/5">The difficulty is that if there is a long period of wet weather, which there tends to be nowadays at certain times of the year&mdash;not the same times as we used to have them, presumably because of climate change&mdash;as soon as there is a dry day, every farmer in the area will need to spread the maximum amount of slurry to meet requirements, without having any choice in the matter. Again, that will be bad farming practice, probably over-dressing the fields in that brief period, and there will be a synchronicity that has not been properly assessed in its environmental effects. Every farmer will be spreading slurry on the same day, and apart from creating the most awful smell across Somerset and a large part of the western counties of Britain, which will not do a great deal for our tourist industry, it will presumably have a cumulative effect of run-off into watercourses. Again, there will be an unlooked-for anti-environmental disbenefit rather than a benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.1/6">Another weather problem is temperature. The proposals make no reference to it, but farmers take note of it in deciding when to spread nitrate&mdash;slurry or artificial fertiliser. A difference in temperature results in a difference in take-up by the growing crop or grass. Unnecessarily reducing the days available for spreading to days when the temperature is not optimum will again produce an agronomical and environmental disbenefit. That cannot be the purpose of the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.1/7">Mrs. Caroline Gent of Brottens Lodge in Doulting wrote to me about the matter. I do not think that she farms, but she is concerned about the matter. She raised the issue of organics. The proposals show no understanding of organic farming and the particular constraints of organic farmers, yet the Government say that they want to promote that sector. The proposals will have a hugely detrimental effect on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.1/8">Tenant farmers must be considered. Where will the capital come from for slurry storage for tenant farmers, who do not own their farms? Why should their landlords put in the necessary capital investment for something that will be of no benefit whatever to them? If tenant farmers cannot get that capital investment, how will they survive?</p>
	<p pid="a.413.1/9">I was not going to mention cover crops, as they were dealt with in the debate the other day. They are not a particularly strong problem in my area, but, as the Minister knows, they are elsewhere. There certainly seems to be an inconsistent approach, which brings us back to ground cover and the environmental benefits that we want.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.1/10">We know that Ireland, Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands have sought derogations. I am not clear about the Government's position on that; perhaps the Minister can explain it.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.1/11">Capital grants will not be available for investment in slurry stores, yet they will require huge capital investment. It is paradoxical and unhelpful that that coincides with the abolition of the agricultural buildings allowance. Many farmers in my part of the world look across the Bristol channel and say, &quot;Why is it different in Wales? Why is it different in Scotland? Why do they have different regimes, which will give farmers in those areas a competitive advantage over English farmers in Somerset?&quot; I noticed that in the debate the other day, there was a reference in <i>Hansard </i>to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase> talking about &quot;deferential rates&quot;. I think that it was intended to be &quot;differential rates&quot;, but I like the idea that we are deferring to the Welsh and Scots in the provision of grants.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.1/12">There is the general matter of red tape. The compliance regulations pile yet more bureaucracy on farmers who could do without it. I had a real cri de coeur from my constituent Mr. Walford, of Upton Bridge farm in Long Sutton. I shall send his letter on, as it refers mainly to a different matter&mdash;it appears that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is telling him that he cannot shoot pigeons, contrary to any law that I am aware of. He started his letter:</p>
	<p pid="a.413.1/13" class="indent">&quot;I can no longer put up with the continuous flow of paperwork from DEFRA without protesting in the most vigorous manner&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.413.1/14">which he then does in the course of the letter. He is right to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.1/15">I wish to give the Minister ample time to respond. I examined carefully his response to the debate two weeks ago, and it seemed that he was not entirely closing the door to further discussion and progress on some matters. He indicated that he was not entirely committed to the date of <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-06">6 April</phrase>, for instance, which we had assumed was the date intended for implementation. There are so many question marks about the proposals, and so many implications for working farmers in the cost of slurry storage and the changes to working practices, that we need at least a postponement for further consideration and for the Minister to take account of the representations that he will have received from not only the industry but colleagues in the House, who have raised the matter with him many times. I hope that that will give him the opportunity to make changes. My preference would be to take away the proposal and accept that it is not necessary for achieving the Government's objectives, but if he does think that it is necessary, he can improve the design of the regulations and make them much more friendly to our farmers. They have had a difficult few years&mdash;he knows that, and I know that. I do not want to make it even worse and lose yet more of our dairy farmers in Somerset.</p>

	<p pid="a.419.1/1">This is the first time that you have presided over a debate in which I have taken apart, Miss Begg, so it is an honour and a pleasure to serve under you. May I put on record my gratitude to Mr. Speaker for granting me this debate? It is about a subject that is close to the hearts of my constituents in East Cleveland, especially those in Loftus.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/2">I should like to discuss a set of archaeological finds that were uncovered in the countryside of Street Houses near to the market town of Loftus. I will stress the importance of keeping those treasures on Teesside for my constituents. That would be of great benefit to local people, particularly schoolchildren, as a reminder of the distant past of the area in which they live.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/3">The find was an Anglo-Saxon cemetery near the coast, outside Loftus. The dig was conducted by local archaeologist Steve Sherlock with help from the Teesside Archaeology Society and local volunteers. The discovery is regarded by all the archaeologists who have seen it as one of the most important discoveries in the old kingdom of Northumbria. To set the find in its historical context, it dates from the era after the departure of the Romans from Britain, which left our shores and internal borders defenceless. By 450 AD, the Anglo-Saxons had begun their invasion of the north, colonising all the land north of the Humber in the area they called Deira, which was probably an adaptation of a Celtic tribal region or kingdom. The invasion was led by the Saxon warrior, King Ida the Flamebearer, and spread further north up to the valleys of Tyne, Wear and Tees. That was the early foundation of what was to become the great kingdom of Northumbria.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/4">Spectacular gold jewellery, weapons and items of clothing found at 109 grave sites are believed to be from around the 7th century. The value of the artefacts suggests that they belonged to a member of the Northumbrian royal family. The team's first clues to the site's existence came from an aerial photograph showing evidence of iron age activity, but they did not expect to find a royal Anglo-Saxon site, as they are usually found only in the south of England. Steve Sherlock has long worked in the area, and realised the significance of the site from its size. Excavation began in 2005, when 30 graves were found. Another 13 were found in 2006, including the most northerly example in this country of a Saxon bed burial.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/5">Excavations in the summer of 2007 revealed the full extent of this nationally significant royal cemetery. The team eventually uncovered an area the size of half a football pitch. No human remains were found because of the acidic soil, but a range of high-status jewellery survived, as well as glass beads, pottery, iron knives, chatelaines and belt buckles. Five of the graves contained gold and silver brooches, and one grave had a seax&mdash;a type of Anglo-Saxon sword. The site included a low burial mound, which is considered an indicator of high status, and an unparalleled arrangement of graves. The graves were laid out with measured accuracy in a square around the bed burial, which shows the planning and order involved in creating this marvellous cemetery. The cemetery also features a Saxon grubenhaus&mdash;a building with a sunken floor that is found rarely in cemeteries&mdash;which may have been used as a mortuary.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/6">Among the find are three spectacular gold brooches, one of which has red garnet settings and is believed to be an unparalleled example of Anglo-Saxon jewellery. Its workmanship has been compared with finds in the Sutton Hoo royal cemetery. Steve Sherlock, who has extensive experience, believes that such an item must have been commissioned from the best craftsman in Anglo-Saxon England, and he firmly believes that it would have belonged to an Anglo-Saxon princess.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/7">In addition to those spectacular finds, other items of particular interest and value were discovered, including a triangular gold pendant and two silver coins that would have been worn as pendants. The coins were from the iron age, from a tribe that was known to live in what is now Lincolnshire. Mr. Sherlock believes that there may be a connection between the grave and St. Hilda, the abbess who founded the famous abbey at Whitby in 675. He has dated the jewellery back to around that time, when most of Anglo-Saxon Northumbria had converted to Christianity. He speculates that the owner of the jewellery, the princess, and St. Hilda could have known each other.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/8">Amazingly, the site became a double top for Steve Sherlock and the Tees archaeology team, as it was found also to have been a site of habitation in the iron age. Evidence of houses and flooring materials has been found, and a number of iron age artefacts were unearthed and recorded. The fact that both sites survived intact for nearly two millennia is unprecedented. It is amazing to think how much time has elapsed since the princess and other members of Northumbrian communities were buried in those graves. Over the centuries, the graves have survived great upheavals in the world. They provide us with a link to our history and tell us about the order of society in the dark ages. They also show us that those people, far from being remote from us, felt some of the same emotions that we do and had the same sense of curiosity about the world around them and their place in it.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/9">Those are the reasons why my constituents want the discoveries to stay on Teesside, as close as possible to East Cleveland, especially Loftus. The objects are being kept by an independent organisation until their ownership can be determined by a court&mdash;in this case, a coroner's inquest. After the inquest, the coroner will have to ask an independent panel of experts to place a value on the relevant objects. The people who decide such matters are usually academics, museum curators and antique dealers who buy and sell similar objects. I understand that the process is overseen by the British Museum, as an agent for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. When a price is set, the purchasing museums service, in this case Redcar and Cleveland, will have a set period of time to raise the money&mdash;usually about three months. The owner of the land on which the dig took place has said that he will make no claim on the artefacts, and that he would like them to be kept locally and safely.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/10">The Kirkleatham museum, the nearest museum to the site, is more than suitable to house the collection. It has a fairly eclectic collection of approximately 100,000 objects with key themes including industrial heritage, rural life and social history. The museums service has worked closely with the Teesside Archaeology Society for many years. Together, they have found and collected many objects ranging from second world war aircraft remains to dinosaur fossils, and have made a great contribution to many fine exhibitions. They have skilled and dedicated curatorial and display staff, and I have every confidence that the artefacts would be safe if they were placed there.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/11">Redcar and Cleveland borough council, which owns the museum, the Teesside Archaeology Society, Steve Sherlock and the landowner all support the artefacts being kept at Kirkleatham museum. They want the objects to be displayed locally for everyone to see, free of charge within a designated, secure exhibition area. The find has been described by the museum's curator, Alan Pearce as potentially containing the most iconic objects the museum would have. He is already receiving inquiries from Germany, France, New Zealand and America about the finds. Their monetary value is currently unknown, but their acquisition, conservation, restoration, interpretation and exhibition may cost around &pound;150,000 to &pound;200,000.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-22a.421.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" speakername="Margaret Hodge" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport"  colnum="421"  time="013:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080122/halltext/80122h0010.htm#08012265000584">
	<p pid="a.421.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate. Like him, I am excited by the excavations near Loftus in his constituency and what we are finding through them. I believe that it was somebody in his constituency who rightly described the objects as iconic, and those that have been discovered at the site are fascinating and beautiful. They certainly play a key role in helping us understand and link ourselves to our identity, history and culture.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/2">The fact that this site is the first royal burial ground from the period to have been discovered in the north of England is particularly exciting, and, as my hon. Friend said, the excavations give us an unprecedented insight into the lives of the Anglo-Saxons who ruled that part of the country in the 7th and 8th centuries.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/3">I congratulate Mr. Steve Sherlock, who my hon. Friend mentioned in his contribution. Mr. Sherlock is the archaeologist leading the excavations at Loftus with the support of the Tees archaeology team and local volunteers. They are doing a superb job in helping us better to know and understand a key part of our history. Mr. Sherlock and his team have been digging at the Loftus site for the past three summers, and I look forward with great anticipation to what they will find when they start unearthing the next phase in excavations this year. Who knows what they will find?</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/4">My understanding is that the reports that the archaeologists have compiled about their finds at the site so far have been verified by experts at the British Museum and, as my hon. Friend said, are now with the local coroner. The coroner's inquest will make the formal ruling on whether the objects from Loftus are treasure, although there seems to be little doubt as to what the ruling is likely to be. Assuming that the objects are determined to be treasure, they will then go to the Treasure Valuation Committee, which is an independent panel of experts who will recommend a value for them to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. Once a value has been determined, museums will be given the chance to acquire the objects.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/5">Like my hon. Friend, I look forward to seeing the objects from this burial site in a museum. I am thrilled by the thought of members of the public, young and old, being able to enjoy the beauty of the objects and learn about their history from them. I believe we all agree that a museum is the best home for objects such as these. A museum with the necessary facilities and expertise is the right place to ensure that objects are appropriately displayed and interpreted for the enjoyment of the public and for the education of our children, that they are preserved for future generations and that they are made accessible for any future academic research.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/6">When the Treasure Act code of practice was originally drafted in 1996, the usual practice was to offer treasure finds to the appropriate national museum for acquisition before offering them to regional and local museums. Today, a much more collaborative approach is taken, and the national museums always act in close consultation with relevant local museums over acquisitions of treasure. Indeed, the British Museum, which, as my hon. Friend suggested, would be the most appropriate national museum to acquire the objects in this case, makes its position on acquisition absolutely clear. If he would like to see it, it is available on its website. The policy states:</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/7" class="indent">&quot;the Museum normally expects Treasure finds from England to be acquired by regional museums and, in general, will acquire Treasure finds either when those museums are unable to proceed with the acquisition or, in the case of finds of major significance, only with the support of the appropriate regional museum.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/8">My hon. Friend will see that the British Museum has confirmed that it has always been its understanding that the objects from the Loftus excavations would be acquired by a local museum, so I can assure him that the path will be entirely clear for a museum in Cleveland to acquire the objects.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/9">I agree with my hon. Friend that Kirkleatham museum, which has already had some involvement in the excavation project at Loftus, would make an excellent home for the objects. The artefacts would be a notable addition to its extensive and diverse collections. They will help to show the significant part that the Anglo-Saxons played in the area's rich history. As he will remember, the Treasure Act code of practice states that ex gratia rewards for treasure finds are not payable to archaeologists. In the case of the Loftus treasures, therefore, the acquiring museum will have to pay only the landowner's reward. I note what my hon. Friend said about the landowner not seeking a monetary financial reward for the finds on his land, but, even were he to do so, the code of practice means that the acquiring museum has to pay only half the market value of the objects.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/10">There is further good news for my hon. Friend about the sources of potential funding available should local museums have to find money to acquire the objects. For smaller items of treasure, grants are available from the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council and Victoria and Albert purchase grant funds, and from the Headley Trust. For the purchase of larger items of treasure, both the Art Fund and the Heritage Lottery Fund will consider applications for funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/11">I hope that all that illustrates how well the UK's treasure system works. Indeed, it is a system that is highly regarded internationally, as my hon. Friend will know. Our approach of encouraging finders to report items of treasure, having them independently valued and then paying both the finder and the landowner an equal reward means that more and more items of treasure are being declared each year. If I may give my hon. Friend some statistics, in the period from 1988 to 1997, under the old treasure trove system, 256 items of treasure trove were reported in total. Since 1997, and probably thanks to some of the work of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase> when he held my post, and with the introduction of the Treasure Act 1996, from 1997 to 2007 a total of 4,180 items of treasure have been reported. In crude statistical terms, that is an increase of 1,500 per cent., so there has been a massive improvement.</p>
