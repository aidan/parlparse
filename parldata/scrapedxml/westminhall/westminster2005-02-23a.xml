	<p pid="a.71.3/1">I remind the House of its rule that debates on the Adjournment should not relate directly to proposed legislation. A Bill about the second Chamber of Parliament has been published and is scheduled for debate, possibly in the near future. I invite hon. Members&mdash;I shall insist if necessary&mdash;not to focus on that Bill in discussing House of Lords reform. More general references to reform proposals, from whatever source, will be in order.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/2">The Chair has received notification of five right hon. and hon. Members who will seek to catch my eye, and three Front-Bench spokespeople will speak. I therefore appeal to everyone, including the Member introducing the debate, to bear those points in mind when making their contributions and accepting or responding to interventions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.71.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" speakername="Robin Cook" colnum="71"  time="009:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h01.htm#50223h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.71.4/1">I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for selecting this topic for debate today. It could not be more timely, because on Monday several of us, including many who are currently in this Chamber, presented a combined report on the way forward for reform of the House of Lords. Our package has attached to it a draft Bill; I am mindful of your comments, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It is fair to say on behalf of all of us who presented the Bill that we do not have a lively expectation that it will be passed in this Parliament, but we did it as a contribution to the debate, and it is in that spirit that I shall proceed with my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.4/2">Before going any further, let me say that we very much appreciate the financial sponsorship of the Rowntree Trust, which made it possible for us to produce both the report and the Bill. We also acknowledge the active support of the Constitution Unit, particularly the work of Dr. Russell, who turned our imprecise ideas into the lucid prose in the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.4/3">It is a cross-party report, and I am pleased that hon. Members from all parties who support it are present. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister will forgive me, however, if I begin with a shamelessly partisan observation. At the last general election, he and I stood on a manifesto that promised the nation a more representative and democratic House of Lords and the removal of the remaining hereditary peers. He will be as aware as I am that the remainder of this Parliament can be measured in weeks and that we have only a short time in which to fulfil that manifesto obligation. I hope that he will find the report a helpful way of covering the final furlong of the progress that we promised. The package would deliver both objectives, starting with the removal of the remaining hereditary peers.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.4/4">We are now well into the 21st century. It is possible for the Americans to put a man on the moon and to get him back again; it is possible for us to put Beagle 2 on Mars, even if we cannot get it back again. It is extraordinary that in this era we still have sitting in either of our Chambers of Parliament people who are there because they come from the political class of hereditary peers. Some obtained their title and privilege as a result of services provided by their male ancestors in the middle ages; a few did so because of services of a different kind that their female ancestors provided during the Restoration. We know of only one other country in the world in which hereditary chieftains still have a guaranteed place in Parliament&mdash;Lesotho. It is time that we took Britain out of that slightly embarrassing bracket. Everyone now agrees that we should break the link between heredity and the House of Lords. One change that has happened during my period in Parliament is that there is no longer any substantial body of opinion in any of the parties in Parliament that defends the hereditary principle for the House of Lords. The perplexing thing is that although everyone agrees that the hereditary peers should go, apparently no one knows quite how to achieve it.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.4/5">At Prime Minister's questions a couple of weeks ago, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister maintained that there was &quot;no consensus&quot; on the way forward for reform of the House of Lords. I hope that the report will help to meet that argument and show that there is such a consensus. It is signed by senior figures from all three parties, including four former Cabinet Ministers from Governments of different colours and two former leaders of the major parties&mdash;the party in Government and the party of the official Opposition. The key to the consensus that it expresses is our belief that the majority of Members in a reformed second Chamber should be directly elected. As I am conscious of the distinguished presence with us in this Chamber, I stress the word &quot;directly&quot;. Some have argued that it might be possible to take the votes for a general election and to convert them indirectly into the composition of the second Chamber. I fully understand the good faith in which that is put forward as a compromise proposal, but all of us who signed this package are firmly of the view that if we want to have a democratic second Chamber, the people of Britain must have a vote for it&mdash;their votes for the Commons cannot be taken and translated as if they had been voting for the second Chamber at the same time.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.0/1">May I act as devil's advocate for a second? What does my right hon. Friend think of the idea that the merit of the proposal that he mentions is that it would achieve the consensus that has eluded us thus far?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.72.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" speakername="Robin Cook" colnum="72"  time="009:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h01.htm#50223h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.72.1/1">I understand that that is the spirit in which the proposal is presented and that it has that objective, but I am not sure that it quite commands the consensus that was its objective. Indeed, in putting forward our proposal, we agreed that for us&mdash;I should like to think that we represent a significant slice of cross-party opinion&mdash;any realistic consensus must be built on direct elections, partly because any consensus must carry the public with it. We know from all the opinion poll surveys and investigations that 80 to 90 per cent. of the public want a vote for the second reformed Chamber. Our proposal also locates what I once described as the &quot;centre of gravity&quot; in the Commons.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/2">I will probably carry to my grave the memory of <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-04">4 February 2003</phrase>, when the House of Commons voted on seven different options. As a passionate parliamentarian who will stoutly defend the Commons in all quarters, I must admit that it did not distinguish itself on that night. None of those seven options commanded a majority, but it is clear from an examination of the Division lists that a clear majority of Members of the House of Commons&mdash;336 in total&mdash;voted for a 60 per cent. elected House, an 80 per cent. elected House or a wholly elected House.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.0/1">I was one of those who voted for an 80 per cent. elected House. My right hon. Friend may&mdash;to return to the comments of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1056" name="Andrew Love">the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love)</phrase>&mdash;underestimate the consensus on the indirect election model, which, among other things, enshrines and preserves the primacy of the House of Commons. That is a weakness in the report's proposals. Can he be sure that a proportionally elected Lords would not threaten Members of the Commons, who are more personally and individually accountable to their electorate?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.73.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" speakername="Robin Cook" colnum="73"  time="009:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h01.htm#50223h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.73.1/1">I concur with my hon. Friend on the importance of preserving the primacy of the House of Commons. I have been in this place for more than 30 years, and I am passionately attached to it. I have no intention of doing anything to undermine its supremacy or of ending my days in the House of Lords&mdash;although given my conduct in recent years I have small chance of doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/2">I put it to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/766" name="Andy Burnham">the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase> that whatever we do to entrench the supremacy of the Commons, we should not do it by denying legitimacy to the second Chamber. There are many other ways in which one can ensure that the lower House is the superior one&mdash;indeed, Britain has done so all around the world. In our retreat from empire, we covered the face of the globe with bicameral Parliaments where we ensured in the constitution that the lower House was superior. It is curious that now that we have retreated to Britain we have forgotten how to do what we did in so many other countries. I am confident that as long as the Government are formed from Members of the lower House and can be dismissed by them, the lower House will, rightly, remain the superior body.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/3">I agree with my hon. Friend on one point. If the two Chambers are to be distinct and different, it is important that the second Chamber should not be elected on the same basis as the Commons. That is why we propose that the second Chamber should be elected on a regional basis using a form of proportional representation. We are not dogmatic about what that should be, although on balance we prefer the single transferable vote system because it would avoid the difficulty of party lists, which could quickly take us back to the same problem of patronage as exists under the appointments system. I am confident that such a Chamber, with a regional rather than a constituency basis and a proportional rather than a first-past-the-post election system, would be very different from the Commons. In those circumstances, it would be up to the Commons to preserve its present supremacy by showing that it provided a more intimate relationship with and service to its Members' constituents.</p>

	<p pid="a.74.0/1">Does my right hon. Friend agree that a significant attraction of what we will shortly be able to call the Billy Bragg proposals is that people would be encouraged to vote in greater numbers in constituencies where the result was probably a foregone conclusion because they would be confident that their vote would count indirectly towards a secondary mandate for the House of Lords?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.74.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" speakername="Robin Cook" colnum="74"  time="009:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h01.htm#50223h01_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.74.1/1">My hon. Friend touches on the important issue of encouraging more people to turn out on general election day. We propose that the second Chamber should be elected on the same day as the Commons in a general election because that is when the highest turnout tends to occur, although I share my hon. Friend's concern that it is not as high as those of us here today would wish. I believe that our proposals would help to increase turnout because electors would have an opportunity not only to vote for a representative in the House of Commons, but to know that their votes would shape a second Chamber in which, because of the proportional system, no one party would have a guaranteed majority.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/2">In response to the specific question posed by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1271" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, if we are to argue that general election day is important because electors can shape the second Chamber, it is unanswerably the case that they should be given a second vote to shape that Chamber. Indeed, if there were only one vote for both Chambers, electors might well have difficulty in deciding which party to cast their vote for. For the sake of argument, I shall use the example of the Green party, as it is not represented in the Chamber and therefore nobody can take offence. There may be members of the public all over the country who are inclined to vote for the Green party but, on a constituency basis, are minded to vote for their Labour MP because there is no prospect of a Green MP's being elected. If we said to such an elector, &quot;The vote that you cast for the Commons will also count towards the composition of a second Chamber&quot;, they might vote Green to maximise the chances of having a Green representative in the second Chamber. I see no reason why we should oblige electors to make that judgment and to cast their vote according to which Chamber they want to influence most. Surely, if we are going to say that a person's vote in a general election will determine the make-up of the second Chamber, the logic is to give them a second vote on the same day to do precisely that.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/3">I shall return to my argument, as I am conscious that several colleagues wish to speak and I do not wish to detain the Chamber indefinitely. We propose that a majority, but not all, should be elected. We are anxious to build the broadest consensus, and I think that we have been moderate in proposing that 70 per cent. of the second Chamber should be elected, with other routes of entry into it. That is why we propose a statutory appointments commission to appoint independent members of ability and why we recognise, in the spirit of trying to find a broad consensus, that some bishops should remain. In what is possibly an excess of moderation, we also argue that the Prime Minister should have the right to make a small number of nominations, who would comprise the Ministers in the second Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/4">Nevertheless, the organising principle must be that the majority of the second Chamber is elected. In a free society, legitimacy comes from the consent of the public, which in modern times is measured through the democratic process of votes in a ballot box. If we want a second Chamber that is taken seriously, it must be taken seriously by the Government because it represents not their appointments but the choice of the people. Over the past few months, I have noticed that &quot;choice&quot; has become a very important Government buzzword, and it is impossible for a Minister to make a speech without using that word at least once, if not multiple times. No choice could possibly be more important than the public's choice of who represents them in Parliament, so if we are serious about having a modern second Chamber, it should be one in which they have that choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/5">I have sketched out the major principles of the package, but I would not do it justice if I did not say that this is a comprehensive report that addresses many questions of detail, some of which took up an amount of time out of all proportion to their importance. Having agonised over the name of the second Chamber, we came to the common-sense view that it would be sensible to call it the second Chamber, although we are open to other suggestions. However, that is not a matter that should determine whether we go for reform&mdash;what the Chamber does and who sits in it are much more important than what it is called.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/6">I am conscious that the Parliament that is about to be elected in the next few months will run almost until the centenary of the Parliament Act 1911. In the preamble to that Act, Lloyd George wrote that it was necessary to regulate the relations between the two Houses because it was &quot;not immediately practical&quot; to constitute the House of Lords on a more popular basis. I rather suspect that it never entered his head when he wrote those words that 100 years later it still would not have been constituted on a more popular basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/7">The reform of the second Chamber has been the longest running soap opera in the west end, and it is time that we brought down the curtain. I do not imagine that the Minister will be able to do that today by endorsing our proposals; indeed, I would worry for his future were he to be so bold and innovative. I hope, however, that he will be able to welcome them as a serious contribution to the debate. I hope, too, that in future at least no one will be able to say that there is no consensus on a way forward if they really do want to find it.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.0/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" name="Robin Cook">the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)</phrase> on his choice of subject for this morning's debate and on the way that he introduced it. There is an opportunity now to show that there is an all-party consensus on the way forward. There is not unanimity&mdash;I respect the fact that there are dissentient voices in all parties&mdash;but there is a consensus that will break the deadlock of the past couple of years. I hope that the debate will give the Front-Bench spokesmen of the three main parties an opportunity to download their House of Lords speeches, freshen them up and explain their party policy on this important issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/2">I hope that the Minister, whom I welcome to the debate, is not going to tell us that there can be no progress on composition until we have resolved the issue of powers. That would be universally seen as a cop-out, and our report would have landed on a snake rather than a ladder. We have had extensive reviews of the second Chamber and there has been remarkably little dissent about the powers. The difficult question has been that of composition. So, I hope that he welcomes the report and agrees that it shows the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/3">I hope, too, that we will be spared one sentence that appeared in the Government's post-Wakeham White Paper, which is straight from &quot;Yes Minister&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/4" class="indent">&quot;There are however a number of areas where further consideration of the practical effects of certain recommendations has led the Government to consider some modification of the precise recommendations so as to ensure implementation of the Commission's principles in the most effective way possible&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/5">To give the debate an historical context, it is worth remembering that in 1998 the Government told us that stage 2 would be approved by Parliament by the time of the last general election. Indeed, Lord Wakeham assumed that the first round of elections to the reformed upper House would take place in June 2001. To have gone through not one but two general elections before achieving stage 2 has something of Lady Bracknell about it. Her husband was, I am sure, a distinguished Member of the unreformed upper House.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/6">Whoever said no stage 1 without stage 2 was absolutely right: at the beginning, the fear was expressed that if we had stage 1 the momentum would stall and it would not carry through to stage 2, and a working, if imperfect, model would be destroyed. The interim House&mdash;the wholly appointed House&mdash;would, by default, become the long-term solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/7">When I pressed the Government on the matter at the time, I was told by the then Leader of the House that breaking the process into two made it more likely that stage 2 would be embarked on. We were told that the 92 hereditary peers would be the grit in the constitutional oyster that produced the pearl of reform&mdash;a colourful metaphor, but one that was entirely inaccurate.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/8">There is a second important lesson to be learned from what has happened so far. Although we should be clear where we want to end up, we should also be flexible about speed and transitional arrangements. That is reflected in the report that the right hon. Member for Livingston referred to and to which my signature is appended. It is more important to secure agreement on what sort of House we should end up with than to try to get there too quickly. Indeed, we are more likely to secure that agreement if we are flexible about how we get there.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/9">The main Conservative objectors to a predominantly elected House are in the House of Lords, and we should try to carry them with us. Several hundred people have been made life peers; they believed that that meant what it said. We should avoid another unceremonious dumping of the hereditaries, which was undiplomatic and discourteous. Even if it makes the journey a bit longer, we should be flexible and generous with the existing life peers, as our report proposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/10">I strongly endorse what the right hon. Gentleman said about the opponents of reform, which is that they tend to treat the debate as a one-dimensional contest: if one House gains in legitimacy, credibility or authority, by definition the other must lose. It can be compared to the annual House of Commons-House of Lords tug-of-war on the Green, which the lower House has won ever since the virile young hereditaries were banished from the upper House.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/11">The reality is that the two Chambers are partners in a joint endeavour to hold the Executive to account. Lord Wakeham put it well in his report:</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/12" class="indent">&quot;Our ambition for the reformed second chamber is that it should enhance the overall ability of Parliament as a whole to hold the Government to account. It should do this by using its particular strengths to develop arrangements which complement and reinforce those of the House of Commons.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/13">I want briefly to address the two main arguments on what we propose&mdash;what I call the rival mandate argument and the British Rail argument, which is, &quot;It will produce the wrong sort of politician.&quot; The rival mandate argument alleges that a predominantly elected second Chamber would challenge the supremacy of the House of Commons, a point mentioned by the Prime Minister shortly before the vote in 2003. However, the second Chamber is clearly defined as complementary and in the end subordinate to the Commons; its powers are those that are given to it by the House of Commons, which is pre-eminent, and they cannot be unilaterally changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/14">There is a related argument that that settlement might be subject to a moral challenge if the upper House contained an elected element and there could be tension between the two Houses if both claimed democratic legitimacy, especially if the lower House was approaching an election and the Government were unpopular.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/15">I disagree with that analysis. In the Commons, we are all elected on the same day for one Parliament after a vigorous campaign on the basis of a party manifesto. We are elected to the pre-eminent House that sustains the Executive and produces the Prime Minister, and we submit ourselves collectively for re-election, at which point the nation passes its verdict on us.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/16">None of those conditions would apply to the second Chamber proposed in our report, so the premise for a moral challenge does not exist. Many of its Members would not be elected at all and would have no mandate. Those who were elected would be elected at different times and on different mandates, and it would be impossible for one party to claim that it had control of the upper House. The notion that electing some or even most Members could lead to the conversion of the upper House into a rival Assembly, where one party claimed a competing mandate, is simply unsustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/17">The second argument is the British Rail argument that electing two thirds of Members would produce the wrong sort of politician. There is a view in the upper House that it does not want the rough trade from the other end of the building. Lord Wakeham said in his speech on the matter that elections would produce</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/18" class="indent">&quot;a second Chamber that was a clone of the other place, full of professional politicians&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2002-01-09.582"><i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i>9 January 2002, Vol. 630, c. 582</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/19">I am not sure how he classified himself in making that comment.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/20">The late Earl of Longford made the point less tactfully five years ago:</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/21" class="indent">&quot;We would get the dregs.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2000-03-07.955"><i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i>7 March 2000, Vol. 623, c. 955</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/22">Again, I do not agree. Behaviour in our House is less a function of the sort of people we are than of the conditions under which we operate. We are Members of Parliament in a highly political, dominant Chamber, to which we have to be re-elected. When we move from the charged environment of the lower House to the calmer one at the other end of the building, our behaviour changes. Perhaps the best examples of that are Lords Wakeham and Hurd. While MPs in our current environment, we behave as MPs, but translated to the reflective atmosphere of the upper House, where, crucially, one does not have to be re-elected and the Whips have a looser grip on discipline, people behave differently. They make shorter, more courteous speeches that are less flavoured by political invective. I disagree with the rival mandate argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/23">Let me conclude with a question to the Minister. Four weeks ago, we had the bombshell from Lady Amos in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>. Asked whether the long-awaited plan on future composition would be in the manifesto, she said:</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/24" class="indent">&quot;No. I think there is still more work to be done because if you put four different people in a room, regardless of which party they come from, there will not just be four different views but you'll probably get eight different views about composition.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/25">Will there really be nothing in the Labour party manifesto about House of Lords reform? If there is to be a vacuum in that chapter of the manifesto, I can think of no better way of filling it than by endorsing the report introduced by the right hon. Member for Livingston.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.78.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1341" speakername="Tony Wright" colnum="78"  time="009:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h01.htm#50223h01_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.78.0/1">Whatever else our little group of reformers can be accused of, we cannot be charged with being premature. As my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" name="Robin Cook">the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)</phrase> said, in 1911 MPs were told that the Bill being introduced was simply a transitional measure that would be in place until they arrived at a fully popular House, yet here we are in 2005, producing yet another report on how we might reform the House of Lords.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/2">I was talking last night to the Father of the House, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/838" name="Tam Dalyell">the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell)</phrase>. When I asked what he thought about all this, he said that he made a vow 40 years ago to have no engagement with House of Lords reform. When I asked why, he said, &quot;I was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Richard Crossman when he tried to reform the second Chamber, and I saw what happened to him.&quot; He was deserted by colleagues, and people did not go near him because of his endeavour to reform the second Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/3">My right hon. Friend the Member for Livingston has experienced not the same thing, but something not exactly unlike it. Instead of recoiling from the issue, to have emerged as the leading continued advocate of serious reform is something that we should all acknowledge and commend.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/4">One thing that dogs the argument and confuses our discussions on different preferred schemes is the lurking feeling, certainly in our Chamber, that whatever we do must not damage the primacy of the House of Commons, and that anything that even begins to suggest such a consequence is to be resisted. That is a fundamentally misconceived argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/5">I apologise for doing so, but I shall quote just one section of a report&mdash;not the one we are discussing today, but one that the Committee that I have the privilege of chairing produced on these issues almost exactly three years ago. We tried to nail the issue fairly comprehensively:</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/6" class="indent">&quot;Reform is not a zero-sum game in which advances for one chamber are inevitably threats to the other . . . We believe that the real task is rather to increase the effectiveness of both chambers in holding the Government to account for its actions and policies. The focus should be on the capacities of the institution as a whole.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/7">We need to understand that, and to understand what is the particular deficit in our governing arrangements that needs to be filled. It is simply this: for all sorts of reasons that we know, we have&mdash;and have traditionally had&mdash;a system of what is familiarly called strong government. The Government can pretty much do what they want, as long as they can get enough warm bodies through the Division Lobby, as someone once said.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/8">That produces a huge scrutiny deficit and, if we are honest, we do not remedy it very well in our side of the business. We have to match a system of strong government with one of strong accountability. We can do that only if we use all the resources at our disposal in both Houses. Among other things, that means attending to matters in our Chamber too, but we are also required to find a way to give our second Chamber sufficient legitimacy to enable it to help to remedy the scrutiny deficit in our system. If we understand that, and realise that we are engaged in a common enterprise, some of those difficulties begin to fall away.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/9">That&mdash;if I may say so in the margin&mdash;is the fatal difficulty with the so-called secondary mandate idea. I commend my friend Billy Bragg for his enthusiasm in promoting House of Lords reform over the years. He has made a huge contribution, but the fact is that the secondary mandate idea confuses the notion of a House of government with that of a House of scrutiny. Also, it assumes that a person can vote&mdash;at the same time&mdash;for two Houses with different but complementary purposes. That is a fatal flaw in that approach; the idea would collapse once it was tested. It is not appropriate to ask voters to cast the same vote for different institutions that perform different but complementary purposes. There is simply no way round that argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/10">So, we must return to the fundamental point: we need an effective House of scrutiny. That House will essentially be the House of Lords, which will complement the scrutiny work that we do here. We are at the rough end of the trade, as I have often heard <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1344" name="George Young">the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> say. We need a different bit of the trade down there to complement the work that we do here, so that together we can do the job of providing the strong accountability that is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/11">On any test, we are talking about the biggest bit of unfinished constitutional business there is. My Government have a proud record of bold constitutional reform to their credit. I am bound to say that we did not achieve that record by giving people free votes. That is not how we got devolution for Scotland and Wales, the Human Rights Act 1998 or freedom of information; we got them by having a coherent position that we believed in and that we argued for. The truth is that we do not have that on second Chamber reform. Until we do, that reform will not come.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/12">I am heartened that the Lord Chancellor&mdash;the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs&mdash;said recently that he thinks reform will have to end up taking a democratic, elected direction. If that is to be our destination, let us at least begin the journey. I think we have shown how that journey can be started. It is no longer the case that we do not know how to do that; now, we must consider the question whether we have the political will to start that journey seriously. I think that the report that a number of us have produced enables it to be confidently begun.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.0/1">I share the views of those who have spoken so far with whom I collaborated on the project. I am surprised that we are still debating such a subject in 2005. I was a student of politics when Harold Wilson's Government agreed with Edward Heath, the then Leader of the Opposition, on an approved package of reform of the House of Lords, and I watched with amusement when I saw it destroyed by a strange combination of Michael Foot and Enoch Powell, who did not agree on the ultimate fate of the second Chamber. However, I, like those members of the public who think about such matters, expected that the process would have been resolved, and the anomaly of the present House of Lords dealt with, long before the end of the 20th century.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/2">Given the way in which this Parliament started in 2001, I thought that it would see the whole matter completed. At the time, all three political parties stood on platforms that commended, in slightly daring terms, the election of an upper House and the final reform of the House of Lords. Such reform was particularly urgent because the first stage that was carried through before 2001 had left the House of Lords in, if anything, an even odder position than it was before.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/3">I was one of the few Members of Parliament who voted against the extraordinary arrangement brilliantly negotiated by my noble Friend Lord Cranborne, whereby we still had an hereditary element in the upper House but they were elected hereditaries. As we have seen from various by-elections for that distinguished position, we have created something that is even more Gilbert and Sullivan than the original notion of hereditary membership. It seemed obvious that we were about to go on to the second stage, and it is very much to be held against this Parliament that we have not completed it, given that we are about to have another election.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" name="Robin Cook">The right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)</phrase> was a reforming Leader of the House who gave a strong lead on the matter in line with the policy of the Government of whom he was a member. I agreed to join a Joint Committee of both Houses, which we were satisfied would pave the way for a consensus to emerge on a Government Bill in due course. The whole process was then halted in an extraordinary way by the vote in the House of Commons, which did not distinguish itself and failed to produce a majority for anything. I must confess to playing a part in that. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/930" name="William Hague">the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague)</phrase> and I were abroad at the time, in different countries. Had we been here to take part in the Division, the 80 per cent. option would have been lost by a majority of one.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/5">The idea that because of that vote the process should be delayed&mdash;or, if we were not careful, suspended&mdash;did not cross my mind even then. It has been said that there was no difficulty in proceeding and that, if the momentum of reform had picked up, our House would have reached a conclusion. The problem was, however, that the Prime Minister astonished all his colleagues by revealing hitherto unexpected serious reservations about whether he wanted an elected House. However, I shall not inject a partisan spirit into the debate; the Prime Minister is certainly a parliamentary democrat, and perhaps subconsciously feels that a stronger upper House might be something that he would like to see after his own period of office and holding of Executive powers.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.0/1">No doubt my right hon. and learned Friend acknowledges that the Prime Minister wanted such a process before he became Prime Minister, as he said in a major speech in 1994:</p>

	<p pid="a.81.1/1">I am sure that people who have the opportunity of exercising great power see the case for restraining such power more strongly before they take office and again when they leave office. Several of us in this Chamber have held office, and I am sure that we have all experienced frustration when those who hold us democratically accountable do not properly understand what we are trying to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/2">I strongly suspect that the Prime Minister is in a minority in his own Government. Conservative Members have been restrained by the understandable reluctance of life peers from our party to contemplate such matters, at too early a stage, as the end of their being legislators for life. As my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1344" name="George Young">the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> explained, they will be phased out generously and their distinguished position in the Chamber will not be seriously threatened in the short term.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/3">The purpose of producing the pamphlet and the draft Bill to which passing reference has been made was to breathe life into the subject and, most immediately, to ensure that the three political parties reaffirm their commitment to a democratic upper House during the next general election. Whoever wins that election, I hope that this unfinished business will be completed and that our constitution will be sorted out during the next Session.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.3/1">The pamphlet tries to address both those relevant points. As I said, in the past the country could hardly be accused of rushing to reform the upper House. It is true that phasing in a fully reformed House of Lords with 70 per cent. of its Members elected and the remaining Members appointed would mean that it would not come fully into effect for 12 years. However, there are some merits in a transitional period. Not least, too rapid a change might affect the best qualities of the House's traditions and the amending powers that it tries to exercise at present. There is no doubt that the current life peers are distinguished people who have many years of public service before them, and it is not necessary to embark on the precipitate removal that occurred in the case of the hereditaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/2">I said that one purpose of the pamphlet is the immediate one, but I wish to remind hon. Members of much more important purposes that ought to inspire us: the strengthening of Parliament; the restoration of a proper system of effective democratic accountability for the Executive of the day, whichever party is in power; and the restoration of public confidence in our political system and the belief that the public must have that there is a proper system of checks and balances, as well as various ways in which, by voting, they contribute to its being affected in the right way.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/3">The modern Executive are becoming more powerful year by year, and there is a greater need to ensure that    proper democratic constraints are in place. Undoubtedly, the role of Parliament in our public life has decreased in recent years. As a revising and delaying Chamber, the upper Chamber is an important aspect of effective parliamentary control, but its authority is fatally weakened by doubts about its legitimacy and the continuing lack of any direct link with an electorate of its own. Although there is agreement on the general principles, it seems that delay must continue as there is still work to be done on its powers and difficulty in reaching a consensus, as illustrated by the recent comments of Lady Amos that were quoted by my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/4">The existing powers of the second House are perfectly satisfactory and could be exercised with more legitimacy and effectiveness were its membership improved. They are being exercised more than they were in the past because without the hereditaries the semi-reformed House of Lords feels more confident in doing so. We will discover in the next few days whether it will exercise any restraint on the Government on a very controversial matter, but it will be constrained&mdash;and no doubt criticised, if it pushes its powers too far&mdash;by its lack of basic legitimacy. An elected House would still have only delaying powers, because the Parliament Act will remain in place. It would not be able to block Government business, but would perform an even more valuable function when exercising its powers if it had a different membership.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/5">We sought to achieve consensus in the publications that we have put before the House. Although not all the proposals will attract universal consent, there is a consensus that would easily get a majority in principle from the present House of Commons, and probably from any House of Commons that is likely to be elected in May this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/6">The Billy Bragg solution suggests that it might be preferable to appoint people in line with the vote on general election day. That argument is open to serious objection. Reform should set out to create a different type of Member of the upper House. They should not be people who can go straight to the House of Commons when they have finished their period of office; indeed, there should be a delay before they are even eligible to go to the upper House to ensure that they are not just trying to find a way into the Commons. They should be people who are a little apart from the party game, and not pursuing ministerial careers but interested in the public service of having a platform to hold the Government to account and to delay legislation where necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/7">A separate ballot paper would give people the opportunity to reflect on who they wanted in the upper House and would attract a different sort of candidate who was not dependent on party patronage. On the eve of the election, I might point out that it is always a mistake to treat the electorate as though they are complete idiots. Many people would contemplate dividing their vote if there were two separate ballot papers. Perhaps they would look for a different sort of personality in their regionally elected representatives in the upper House as compared with those whom they were electing to the Commons. Someone with the sort of personality not to make a natural, party political, House of Commons man might be able to emerge through a separate ballot held on the same day in a way that would not happen if there were one vote and the parties nominated a particular set of people to take the places in the upper House.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/8">I commend reform to the House as, no doubt, have hundreds and hundreds of Members of Parliament over the years. I am astonished that it has taken so long. The most important point is that we are not just tidying up an historical accident. We are not merely dealing with an anomaly or undertaking a routine piece of modernising reform&mdash;it is an important step towards strengthening Parliament at a time when our parliamentary democracy as a whole is in a fairly unhealthy state. Public confidence is at a very low level, cynicism is widespread and all three of the political parties are among the most unpopular institutions in the United Kingdom. No one knows quite what kind of political institutions they wish to see or what kind of politicians they want to re-inspire their confidence. Sorting out the institution of the upper House will be an important step in sorting out parliamentary democracy and making it more capable of holding the Government to account and securing public confidence.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.84.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/766" speakername="Andy Burnham" colnum="84"  time="010:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h01.htm#50223h01_spnew18">
	<p pid="a.84.0/1">As a former Government special adviser, and the perfect embodiment of the wrong kind of politician, it is perhaps appropriate that I have a chance to contribute. I welcome the debate and the report. What is encouraging, as evidenced by so many Conservative Members speaking up in favour, is the fact that a democratic solution is where the momentum is, and there is clear travel in that direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/2">We have an opportunity to carry through Lords reform because there is more that unites people who want a more democratic House of Lords. We must not allow that opportunity to be broken down, leaving us unable to find the compromise that has eluded us. Compromise is the watchword, because everyone will have to compromise eventually if we are to have a workable solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/3">Even since the vote in the House that has been mentioned, feeling has swung decisively against an appointed House, which is clearly no longer an option. The broader context involves asking why this matter is important, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/802" name="Kenneth Clarke">the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> referred to that. Some people say, &quot;Why is House of Lords reform important? There are more significant issues to deal with.&quot; However, it is right to put things in that broader context.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/4">We live in an increasingly anti-politics era. There is a feeling out there that this place is not particularly well connected to the constituencies that we represent. The north-east vote on a regional assembly is the most obvious demonstration of that fact: people do not want more politicians, political institutions or structures; they want those that they have to work much harder and more cleverly for them. Everyone in this House and in the other place has to think about that and about how what we do here in going forward can be much more connected to the people who we seek to represent. If we fail to do that, it will damage our democracy in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/5">We need a second House that is fit for purpose. I am absolutely confident that we could get much better value for money from the &pound;66 million a year in tax pounds that we spend on running it if it was more democratic and regionally constituted so that the voice of the regions rang out through this place.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/6">I am wholly committed to a more democratic second Chamber, and I am committed to one that may unsettle the way that we operate in the Commons&mdash;a Chamber that may push us and challenge established practice. Such practice can be flabby and some things that we do in the Commons can be too disconnected. Such change would be a good thing. This is the nub of the question that we are considering and which reformers have to deal with.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/7">There is consensus in favour of election and in favour of preserving the primacy of the Commons. There is probably also consensus on the powers as they stand today being roughly appropriate. The issue involves the relationship between the two, and the way that Members are elected to the Lords will dictate how that relationship plays out.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/8">Five parliamentarians or more have put their names to the report, and there are others here today who have far more experience of this place than I have. Reference has been made to people leaving office, but I would say to those who made that point that I have hopes to be in this place for some time yet and I do not necessarily want to be a Member of a House of Commons that is undermined, challenged or perhaps constantly threatened by the House of Lords. I refer people to page 11 of the report that has been issued this week, in which the committee acknowledges this point:</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/9" class="indent">&quot;However, there has been concern amongst some that the second Chamber could become 'too' legitimate, with the result that it challenged the House of Commons too frequently. Despite the existing safeguards to Commons' primacy, we acknowledge there is some foundation to these concerns.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/10">The proposed system threatens to destabilise the balance and threatens the primacy of the House of Commons. People could argue that it would be more proportionate and, therefore, more democratic&mdash;that it would more reflect the will of the people. Therefore, when votes were passed in that place, they could be considered more legitimate. That presents problems to us as politicians, individually and as people who are accountable to their electorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/11">The Achilles heel of the system we are considering is that it seriously threatens the primacy of the House of Commons. Any compromise solution must deal directly with that point. As I said in my intervention on my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" name="Robin Cook">the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)</phrase>, I believe that the secondary mandate solution is the right compromise around which people can unite and that there is more support for it than has perhaps been reflected in the comments made so far in today's debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.0/1">I am following what my hon. Friend says with care. Does he understand that a number of objections that many of us have to the secondary mandate principle, although we appreciate the sincerity of those who make that proposal, relate to the fact that it does not represent election at all? It represents a system of appointment, whereby the proportions in which people are appointed are decided through a vote, but there is no election at all, direct or indirect.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.1/1">I do not believe that that is necessarily correct, because it would be for the parties to decide which of their members was placed on a list of candidates. The challenge for our political parties is to ensure that the right kind of people&mdash;not the wrong kind&mdash;are on those lists and that they are elected to this place. That is a challenge to the political parties to strengthen the vibrancy of their internal democracy to ensure that there is good competition and a healthy vote on putting people in a certain order on the parliamentary list for the second Chamber. I do not accept my hon. Friend's argument at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.1/2">I do not accept some other arguments made against a secondary mandate, either. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1341" name="Tony Wright">the Member for Cannock Chase (Tony Wright)</phrase> made a point about the two institutions, but let us think about that for a second: we are electing Parliament, which does the job of passing legislation, and we could argue that it is one institution. There are two separate parts to that institution, but we elect one Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.1/3">On tactical voting, I think that what I am proposing would make it much more likely that people used their votes more wisely and thought even harder before casting their vote, so I do not accept that argument either. <i>[Interruption.] </i>I see Mr. Deputy Speaker looking daggers at me, so I shall conclude.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.1/4">We must not let this opportunity pass; as democrats, we must seize the opportunity to create a more democratic House. My final plea is that we should let the Commons decide on three options: appointed, indirectly elected&mdash;according to the secondary mandate&mdash;or directly elected. Then we would have our answer.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/766" name="Andy Burnham">The hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase> has been grappling with one of the real difficulties, but I think I will be the only dissenting voice in today's debate. I take some comfort from the fact that there is another dissenting voice, which is that of the only person who really matters in this argument&mdash;the Prime Minister. As long as the two of us agree, we will probably get our way. I am sorry to dissent from a list of people with whom I normally agree, but I take that as proof that if one puts a group of incredibly clever people together they can come up with a pretty ridiculous answer from time to time.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/2">One talks about horses designed by committees, but this camel seems to have wings and flippers, and it can lay eggs too. It has a little something for everybody. We want an elected House of Lords, but one that is just 70 per cent. elected. There is a very good argument for not having any Ministers in there, but we will let them stay. The Prime Minister should not have the power of appointment, so we will let him appoint four people. There is no real argument for there being any bishops in there, but let us just cut the number from 26 to 13. As for the Law Lords, perhaps they should stay, but perhaps they should not.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/3">There is a strong argument for a wholly elected House of Lords and a strong argument, which I shall try to put, for a wholly appointed House of Lords, but there is no argument for a halfway house compromise of this kind whereby we try to give a little to everybody. There are some fundamental problems with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/4">The hon. Member for Leigh is right: an elected House of Lords&mdash;one that is 70, 80 or 100 per cent. elected&mdash;would challenge the legitimacy of the House of Commons. There would be times when it was more in tune with public opinion, perhaps when it had a more democratic mandate at the fag end of the term of an unpopular Government who were trying to push through controversial legislation. In the long run, such a second Chamber would not be satisfied with the powers proposed for it, but my real objection is to the way of electing Members to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/5">Proportional representation leaves the lists in the control of parties. Is that what we really want&mdash;a second Chamber full of people who make it on to a party list? Two characteristics that we say we want in the House of Lords are independence and expertise. It has those, I would argue, although it does not have legitimacy and it is not representative. Parties do not put such people on their lists. The former Foreign Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" name="Robin Cook">the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)</phrase>, would not get on his party's list, nor would the interesting people in the House of Lords get on a party list.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/6">Also, those on a list would be people who cannot get elected to the House of Commons for their party. The standard of intelligence&mdash;or of industry and ability&mdash;needed to get into the House of Commons are not of Olympic proportions, as we all know. So, the people who would get into the House of Lords, or whatever we were to call it, would not be good enough to get into the House of Commons, but who had the <i>Good Housekeeping </i>seal of approval from their party.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/7">The argument for a democratic House of Lords, which sounds wonderful in theory, falls apart when we think about how we would elect it. Of course, if we did not have proportional representation and people were elected in single-Member constituencies using first past the post, the second Chamber would look exactly like the House of Commons and we would say, &quot;What on earth is the point of having it?&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/8">That is the main, fundamental objection to such a system, but I also hate the idea of an appointments commission. Why should legislators be appointed by some committee of former permanent secretaries and senior partners in KPMG, or whatever the Government would come up with? I would rather the Prime Minister did it. Then at least we would know who was making the appointments. If he appointed people who gave his party a lot of money or his drinking buddies or complete cretins, we would know who was responsible for it. If we ended up with some committee of the great and the good, nobody would be responsible and it would come up with even more milk-and-water people than parties would for their lists.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/9">I do not believe that there can be two classes of Member: either people are democratically elected or they are not. If there were two classes of Member in the House, one group would have a democratic mandate and people would start to add things up. They would say, &quot;Okay, there was a majority in the House of Lords. Was the majority of the elected Members or did it rely on the Prime Minister's appointees, the remaining bishops or whatever?&quot; There would be two classes of Member with different degrees of legitimacy. Sooner or later, it would challenge the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/10">There is an argument for a fully appointed House of Lords, which I have made on many occasions, including this one, albeit briefly. There is also an argument for a fully elected House of Lords, but may I make this plea? If the Prime Minister and I eventually lose the vote&mdash;we will not lose the argument&mdash;and we are to have an elected House of Lords, let us make it both fully elected and a proper legislature. Let us have no Ministers there; let there be no patronage.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/11">The two things that the House of Commons does not do well are detailed examination of legislation and holding the Executive to account. We are too busy to carry out detailed examination and we do not hold the Executive to account because most Government Members who are not in the Government want to be, so they are reluctant to hold the Government to account. Those are things that would be done by a wholly elected House of Lords, so if we are to have an elected House of Lords let it be wholly elected and let us ensure that there are no Ministers there so it behaves like a proper legislature.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/12">The problem with the House of Lords is that it works in practice but not in theory. That is anathema to intellectuals so they have to come up with an alternative, but it works pretty well. I once met an American scientist, a physicist, who said that he could prove pretty conclusively that anything that had the shape and configuration of a bumble bee could not fly. Fortunately for the bumble bee, it could not understand the equations and it happily flew away. The House of Lords is in that category as something that works. Let us not fix it.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.0/1">This has been an interesting debate, and I hope that those who signed up to the report, which includes people who are listed here as well as the five of us, feel fully justified in&mdash;we hope&mdash;renewing interest in the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1094" name="John Maples">The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Maples)</phrase> described our committee as having designed a camel. He went slightly further and described some of the camel's characteristics. I must plead guilty, in that I was the facilitator for the group and I brought together my four colleagues from the different parties. I feel fully justified in so doing, not because we have designed a curious animal, but because at long last we have got this subject back on the agenda. The contributions made today, not least that from the hon. Gentleman, show how important it is to try to clear the field of some misnomers and misunderstandings that have surrounded the issue for so long.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/3">Let me address one point that the hon. Gentleman made: we do not advocate a list system and we do not advocate giving patronage to the parties. We advocate STV precisely because it takes power away from the parties and gives it to the elector; the elector has a great deal more choice. The chances of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" name="Robin Cook">the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)</phrase> going to the reformed second Chamber, should he wish to do so, would thereby be greatly increased, as would be those of the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon. There is no question of adopting a list system. Unfortunately, far too many people think that proportional representation means list systems and that list systems mean proportional representation. That is not true and we address that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/4">My principal contribution today is to be brief, because so many of the arguments have been so well handled by my colleagues, but perhaps I can deal with one or two myths. The first, which has been perpetuated quite regularly, is that the House of Commons came to no conclusions whatever and could never achieve a consensus on this issue. It is true, as has been said, that in February 2003 we did not manage to go through the same Lobby on the same issue, but there was a consensus in favour of majority election to the second Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/5">I plead guilty, as I was a member of the Joint Committee that decided it was necessary to put a number of options to the House of Commons. Clearly, that was not the best way to achieve any consensus or conclusion. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/766" name="Andy Burnham">The hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase> is right: there must be some opportunity for the House of Commons to express its support in principle for what is to happen to the House of Lords, before we go on to the second stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/6">It is also true that on that fateful evening the House of Lords achieved no consensus whatever. There are Members of the House of Commons who retreat behind the idea that, despite the need for pre-eminence of the Commons, the House of Lords should somehow or other be enabled to retain its veto over any reform. I do not believe&mdash;I hope that all Members of this House agree&mdash;that turkeys should have a veto on the timing of Christmas. If we believe that the House of Commons should be the predominant House, it should have the last word on this issue. It would be ridiculous to allow the vote of the House of Lords to be pre-eminent.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/7">The pre-eminence of the Commons is a constant concern, which we address in the report. I fully accept the point made by the hon. Member for Leigh, who said that we should examine that concern carefully. We did. Gathering together four very distinguished Members of the House of Commons and acting as their convenor taught me a few lessons about how the House of Commons operates. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no question of those four Members, or those on the long list of other distinguished Members, seeking in some way to subordinate the House of Commons to a new second Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/8">We propose an election system with a very limited regional link, rather than a constituency link. Some Members&mdash;particularly, perhaps, those from Scotland and Wales&mdash;have understandable anxieties about there being two layers of Member for a constituency. However, I believe that that would be an important distinction between the two Houses and would enable the Commons to retain its pre-eminence.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman not think that the secondary mandate would make people think harder when they cast their vote at a general election? Does he accept that one potential weakness of his system is that the vote for the second Chamber could become a real repository for frivolous protest voting and that that Chamber could end up being strangely constituted?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.89.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1297" speakername="Paul Tyler" colnum="89"  time="010:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h01.htm#50223h01_spnew24">
	<p pid="a.89.1/1">As a democrat, I have some difficulty with the concept that the elector who makes a choice that does not suit the conventional party machines is being frivolous.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/2">I shall come to the point about the so-called secondary mandate in a moment, but for now I shall continue to point out the difference between the two systems. There would be continuity, as under our proposals the second Chamber would be elected in three tranches. There would be no sudden swing from one party to another and the second Chamber would have no role whatever in the selection of a Government. The point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1341" name="Tony Wright">the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Tony Wright)</phrase> is absolutely right: the two Chambers have two distinct roles, as is true of most bicameral systems throughout the world. I strongly endorse the point that we need two Houses that work in co-operation, rather than competition, and enhance the strength of Parliament as a whole to hold the Government to account.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/3">I have real problems with the so-called secondary mandate. Anyway, that is a misnomer: if somebody is forced to do two things with one vote, that is a primary, not a secondary, mandate. We would be trying to persuade the elector to do two quite distinct things at the same time, on the same day, in the same circumstances and in the same polling booth. That seems to be a recipe for voter schizophrenia.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/4">It would be extremely difficult for any member of the public who sought to use his or her vote intelligently for tactical voting for the Commons to know what to do. Once we had tried to adopt the principles of a secondary mandate, it would be extremely difficult to argue against having two ballot papers. If we are to have two ballot papers, why not go the whole hog and adopt the system we suggest?</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/5">The secondary mandate would inevitably give more power to the parties and more patronage to the party leaders, who would effectively be able to say precisely who would be on which list, in which region and at what point in that list. That would damage the process that we are trying to enhance.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/6">I am grateful for the thoughtful contribution made by the hon. Member for Leigh, who said&mdash;I paraphrase him&mdash;that consensus requires compromise. I agree; I have compromised. I think I can speak for all those who have signed up to the document: in different ways we have all compromised, because that is the parliamentary tradition. I am very surprised at the reaction of the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon, who seems to want either a fully appointed or a fully elected House. He wants perfection in one leap.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/7">The hon. Gentleman is a Conservative&mdash;I am not&mdash;but as a reformer I simply do not believe that that is how Parliament works. My background is in history, not political theory. I have studied the history of Parliament, which has developed by a slow process&mdash;a very slow process, in this particular case&mdash;by compromise and by developing consensus. That is what we did in the group.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/8">I have not achieved in this document everything that my Liberal Democrat colleagues and I would wish to achieve, but I believe that the report has provided the centre of gravity that the then Leader of the House, the right hon. Member for Livingston, was seeking two years ago. I believe that all those who, in the best traditions of Parliament, want to try to secure some agreement and progress can focus on it as a way forward. The current House of Lords is a halfway house and, in effect, illegitimate. It will do the health of our democracy no good if it remains in that state for much longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/9">I pay great tribute to the right hon. Member for Livingston for how he introduced the debate and for keeping the issue alive, inside and outside Parliament. He referred to this as a long theatrical performance. It is indeed a Whitehall farce that has gone on for 90 years. It should be brought to a conclusion before it reaches its centenary.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.0/1">I start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" name="Robin Cook">the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)</phrase> and his colleagues on their initiative, which I welcome. He was right to say that it is extremely helpful in trying to build a broad consensus on the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/2">It has long been my view that a smaller substantially elected second Chamber is the way ahead. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1094" name="John Maples">the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Maples)</phrase> was rather unfair on the camel, which is a highly sophisticated, useful animal. If it had the wings and flippers that he suggested as well, it would be a fantastic beast.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/3">The Conservatives propose 80 per cent. directly elected Members for long terms, with no re-election and no right to proceed to the House of Commons. It is important to ensure freedom from the insidious pressures of deselection and the Whips, and to have the independence that my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon mentioned. The important scrutiny role requires expertise, too, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1341" name="Tony Wright">the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Tony Wright)</phrase> made that a feature of his remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/4">Let me consider the principles that we think important. No reform is acceptable unless it carries consensus. The House of Commons let down the right hon. Member for Livingston in 2003 when he pushed forward with proposals that seemed the right way ahead. A reformed House must be at least as effective as the present one. We would wish the Executive to be held fully to account, which means that although there should not necessarily be new powers for the other place, there should be no loss of its the existing powers. It requires broad public consent in using its powers, and that would happen only if there were a direct election for the substantial body of the new Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/5">A largely elected House of Lords would not take away the right to cast a vote in person for which generations fought and died. It is on that basis that the Conservative party proposes 80 per cent. direct election, with long terms and no re-election. We do not suggest that the proposals should necessarily come in at one go; there is a case for the transition period to which my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1344" name="George Young">the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> referred. It is important that the Cross-Bencher element of the House of Lords should remain.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/766" name="Andy Burnham">The hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase>, Billy Bragg and others have suggested an indirect election, but that would create confusion. Billy Bragg and, perhaps, the hon. Member for Leigh are supporters of tactical voting, and it is difficult to see how there could be effective tactical voting in a general election for the House of Commons with a regional party list system in the same election. That does not take full account of the role of independents.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.2/1">I do not have time to take an intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.2/2">One need only think of what happened in Wyre Forest in the last general election to see that an independent candidate can gain considerable support. In such circumstances, those votes would not necessarily count for the party that an individual voter supported for the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.2/3">The hon. Members for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden) and for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) mentioned the different considerations between the two Houses, which is important. We would certainly not support an indirect election and would have considerable doubts about proportional representation, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon said.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.2/4">Personally&mdash;this is not party policy&mdash;I think that there is a lot to be said for having a franchise based on counties and cities. People say that America has a very strong Senate, but there is much to be said for the American system. For a start, there is less legislation. We push through vast reams of legislation these days, much of it of poor quality. The United States has managed to be quite a powerful country while having a pretty bizarre mathematical franchise for the Senate. We should consider the way in which people identify with particular areas and regions. Many people in this country have a much more genuine recognition of the city or county in which they live than of some region. In the eastern region, as it is known, Hertfordshire has little in common with some of the other counties, particularly those to the far east, and I think that that is true of other regions&mdash;people do not identify with them. In building a consensus for the proposals that I have outlined, there might be a case for a Speaker's Conference.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.2/5">As my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire said, we are determined that Lord Irvine's commitment that the remaining 10 per cent. of hereditaries will go only when stage 2 has taken place should be adhered to. We would not want anything less than that.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.2/6">I want to say something about the Prime Minister's position. Before he became Prime Minister, he was very clear that the House of Lords should be replaced by an elected second Chamber. We are now told that he is not in favour of that and that the matter is subject to Cabinet battles in which the Leader of the House and the Chancellor are in favour of an elected second Chamber and the Prime Minister and others are against it. It is worth reflecting on why the Prime Minister might have that attitude. He has created a House of appointees and has made it clear that he wishes to have a mainly appointed House; one need only consider the fact that he has personally appointed two thirds of the Labour peers and 310 peers overall&mdash;that is, 45 per cent. of the other place. Henry VIII would have been proud of a record like that. It is not surprising that the Prime Minister, who has enjoyed and still enjoys all that patronage, wants to continue with it, but it is not the best way forward for our country.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.2/7">I would be suspicious if, in addition to what has already happened, the Prime Minister continued with his recent policy of appointing even more Cross Benchers. That is causing wide concern. Can the Minister confirm that there is a firm limit on the number of Cross Benchers that the Prime Minister will appoint in addition to the Labour nominations? If not, a bad trend could be made significantly worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.2/8">I welcome the initiative and say all power to the elbow of the right hon. Member for Livingston.</p>

Friend has been passionately supported in the debate by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/802" name="Kenneth Clarke">the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1344" name="George Young">the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1297" name="Paul Tyler">the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler)</phrase>, all of whose views are on the record. On this occasion, they are supporting the document published on Monday, but they have contributed to the debate over many months and years. We also heard my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/766" name="Andy Burnham">the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase> speak in support of the secondary mandate; and even though he numbered only one, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1094" name="John Maples">the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Maples)</phrase> made the case for an appointed Chamber with much force.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/3">My right hon. Friend said that one of his main purposes was to stimulate debate in advance of the expected general election. Clearly, the number of Members who wanted to contribute today&mdash;and, I suspect, in the days remaining as we head towards a general election, whenever it is called&mdash;suggests that the document and the debate will do that. I very much welcome the considered and measured tone of the paper published on Monday, which recognises the difficulty of the issues that need to be addressed and the way in which others, including the Government, have wrestled with them.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.1/1">My hon. Friend knows that it would be wrong of me to pre-empt any part of the manifesto. However, he contributes to those discussions, as do I and all members of our party, and we look forward to seeing the manifesto when it is produced.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/2">My right hon. Friend the Member for Livingston and his colleagues have produced a serious contribution to the debate which deserves, and I am sure will get, appreciative consideration even from those who do not agree with its conclusion. My hon. Friend the Member for Leigh was right to say that we have to move forward on the basis of consensus. I do not think that my right hon. Friend would seriously expect me to say that the Government can commit themselves to the proposals that he has put forward, and I am grateful for that. However, we have made it clear that we will return to the subject in our manifesto.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/3">The proposals have the support of hon. Members across all parties. That is important. One ongoing difficulty is that House of Lords reform does not divide opinion on party lines. It would probably be possible to put together a cross-party coalition in support of an alternative set of proposals, including proposals for a wholly appointed House, but it is important to have regard to the seniority of those who have endorsed the recommendations before us. I note that the hon. Member for North Cornwall has introduced a private Members' Bill to give effect to the proposals outlined by my right hon. Friend the Member for Livingston.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/4">The starting point for the proposals, as one would expect from Members of this House, is the need to ensure that the reform of the Lords does not undermine the primacy of the Commons. Members also recognise that it is important not to undermine the relationship between each MP and his or her constituents. The two Chambers of Parliament must be distinct, and the one must not simply be</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/5" class="indent">&quot;a pale imitation of the other&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/6">to quote from my right hon. Friend's paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/7">The Government entirely agree; indeed, how best to reform the House of Lords and still respect those propositions lies at the heart of the debate about the composition and powers of the second Chamber. It is important that increasing the powers of the House of Lords is not done at the expense of those of the House of Commons. It is also important that the powers of the second Chamber are given to it by the Commons and cannot be changed unilaterally by the second Chamber, although they can be changed unilaterally by the Commons. Another point made in the paper is that even after reform, the second Chamber will continue to respect the primacy of the Commons because its electoral mandate will be much more dilute than that of the Commons. My right hon. Friend underlined the point that the way in which the second Chamber operates will continue to be less political than the Commons because its atmosphere will continue to be different.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.3/1">I did not want to be too partisan, but I agree with my hon. Friend. Much has been said about the powers of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, but much could also be said about the official Opposition's recent position, which they were not prepared to take on hereditary peers. Let us try to continue the debate in a mode of consensus.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/2">Such a radical change in composition will undoubtedly have some effect on the second Chamber, so the critical issue is getting the change right. The statutory powers of the House of Lords are not the issue. Of course, those powers are less than those of the Commons and the Lords cannot increase them unilaterally, but it does not use them much and rarely presses an issue to the point at which they become relevant. If it did so routinely, the business of the Government would soon become impossible. The Lords normally operates under voluntary and non-statutory constraints&mdash;those, not the Parliament Acts, make the system work. The potential vulnerability of those constraints to a radically changed composition needs to be taken seriously. Will a House that is 70 per cent. elected take the constraints of the Salisbury convention as seriously as an appointed House, even if some of the elections took place 11 years previously? If it will not, is the answer to let it exercise more power, or is it to do what every other country with a bicameral Parliament does by spelling out in detail, and in statutory form, the powers that the second Chamber should have? If we did that, how far away would we be from a written constitution?</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/3">As for how political the second Chamber will be, there is a legitimate question about whether those of its Members who had to get the approval of their party to be put forward for election will be inclined to adopt the gentlemanly behaviour of the Lords, especially if they were elected by single transferable vote. The hon. Member for North Cornwall said that this is not about the list system, but the fact that candidates would have to fight for first preference in their party would lead to certain kinds of Member. That gives rise to legitimate questions about how the nature of the people who end up in another place might change.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.3/1">I see that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1263" name="Gerry Sutcliffe">the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe)</phrase>, is in his place. I look forward to his contribution and trust that it will be positive. I also recognise that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1344" name="George Young">the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> is in the Chamber. If he wants to, he can intervene at any point in the debate, because I know that he has a constituency interest in the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.3/2">By way of background, I shall say something about the gardening industry in the United Kingdom. It may come as a surprise to many people to hear what the industry is worth. It has a turnover of some &pound;5 billion a year, so it is a buoyant and&mdash;if hon. Members will pardon the pun&mdash;a growing industry, employing some 200,000 people. In addition, 20 million people in Britain regularly participate in gardening. That industry and recreation is enormous and growing by the year; growth looks set to continue for many years to come, as more and more young people become interested in the pastime of gardening. It is therefore highly important to look at the question of consumer protection and the safety of gardening equipment in a different light.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.3/3">I have said on many occasions that the industry is a sleeping giant that requires a voice, and I hope that right hon. and hon. Members can start that process in the Chamber, and show that there is a need to focus attention on safety in gardening. It would be right, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for me to declare an interest: I am the secretary of the all-party group on gardening and horticulture. I am, some say, mad, but I am a keen gardener&mdash;so keen that I was out cutting my grass at the weekend, unlike, I would have thought, many other Members&mdash;and that gives me first-hand knowledge and information on how urgent the issue is and why focusing attention on consumer protection and safety of gardening equipment must be debated.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.3/4">The purpose of the debate is to ask the Minister for reconsiderations and suggestions, as well as to look afresh at some of the initiatives that have been taken in his Department. One such initiative was the introduction some years ago of a statistical evaluation of household and gardening safety&mdash;known as HASS, which stands for home accident surveillance system. I know many people in the industry who were extremely disappointed when, in May 2003, the Department of Trade and Industry announced that it would no longer collect such statistics, and that that work was being terminated and passed out of the Department. That is, quite simply, wrong. I cannot understand the decision to terminate what was almost the bible of the industry, particularly given the increased activity in gardens across the land.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.3/5">I do not like to use a lot of statistics, but sometimes, as in this case, they are important. Let us consider the fact that 1.5 million householders in 2005 will attempt to cut their hedges using a ladder as a work platform, probably with a powered cutter but without acknowledging any safety requirements. I would argue that that is a dangerous practice. The statistics show that at least one person per week is likely to die as a result of falling off a ladder, and urgent action on that is required. If hon. Members consider that 337,000 individuals in one year have attended accident and emergency units because of accidents in the garden, they can understand some of the reasons behind my arguments. The use of powered equipment is growing. If we consider that hedge-trimmer accidents have increased by more than a half in the past five years&mdash;that is shown by extrapolating old statistics&mdash;we start to see the problem that I am trying to address. I would not argue that we should unnecessarily introduce any level of the nanny state.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.1/1">The list is endless; my hon. Friend is right. As he was at the vanguard of the campaign on the issue of high hedges&mdash;legislation has now been introduced, which I will touch on later&mdash;he is aware of some of the inherent dangers in cutting down high hedges. I know that he secured some debates around the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/2">In 1996, the Department of Trade and Industry undertook a garden safety campaign and produced a leaflet on the question. It was a fantastic leaflet, embracing all the hazards that one could find in the garden. My hon. Friend has already asked where else there would be accidents. As well as step ladders, there are all sorts of new electrical tools, while barbecues take place in almost every garden in the summer. There are swings in gardens, and fences&mdash;the list goes on and on.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/3">I ask the Minister at the very least to have his Department consider reinstating the leaflet and putting it in all garden centres. To back that up, it is also important for the home accident surveillance system statistics to be reinstated. Instead of being reactive, the Department should become proactive on the subject of garden safety. There is no doubt that there is a need to protect the public. The DTI is responsible for public safety, but it does not seem to demonstrate itself. The data that we had, which were useful in the Department and even more useful outside, would be used by many in the industry. They highlighted some of the dangers in the garden, but the focus of that has been lost. What we are getting is a growing number of people in danger.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.2/1">I want to clarify the position on the HASS statistics. They have not ended, in the sense that the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents is now taking over the responsibility. That is in light of work carried out in the Department of Health. I will mention that more in my speech, but I did not want my hon. Friend to run away with the idea that the statistics are no longer available. They are available, but not through the DTI.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.98.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/860" speakername="Brian H Donohoe" colnum="98"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h02.htm#50223h02_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.98.0/1">But sometimes if we pass on information such as that, it tends to get clouded and lost. It is that aspect that we need to address, and that I ask the Minister to address. There does not seem to be a proactive approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.0/2">The use of ladders in gardens will inevitably increase. I mentioned the legislation on high hedges that will be introduced in the autumn; such hedges mean that the use of ladders&mdash;a dangerous practice&mdash;will become more likely. If people prop up a ladder against a hedge, pick up a hedge trimmer that needs two hands to operate, balance on the ladder, and then lean back to cut, that is an illustration of all the things that are wrong and that need to be addressed. It is crazy for people to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.0/3">I believe that the Minister was involved in industry, as I was. I started as an apprentice in 1965 in a shipyard and was educated about the need to wear a hard hat and gloves, and tight clothing. All of that was drummed into people. Increasingly, however, young people have never been in that sort of environment. In the 1960s and 1970s the people who gardened may have been from the shipyards, the dockyards, the mines and the factories, but we are now dealing with a public who, for the most part, had never had a tool in their hands before they started gardening. Moreover, they have had no instruction in how to use such tools; no one takes them on courses. It is that fact, more than anything, that leads me to suggest that tighter regulation should be introduced and applied. I do not want restrictions to be placed unnecessarily on the individual. However, for common-sense reasons, we must examine the industry and its practices, as well as the householder who uses the equipment. Change is required, but the whole issue must be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.0/4">In conclusion, I will make a few pleas and ask a specific question. There should be an obligation on the DTI and the Government to ensure greater protection of consumers in this area. I ask for a reinstatement of the Government use of the HASS statistics and an assurance that the statistics are to hand in-house. I would like the garden safety leaflet, which was issued so successfully in 1996, to be reissued, and I would like the Department to take a more proactive stance on the whole issue of garden safety.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/860" name="Brian H Donohoe">the Member for Cunninghame, South (Mr. Donohoe)</phrase> on securing the debate, and welcome the fact that he has brought this matter forward. It is an important issue, and he eloquently made clear the effect on our constituents. As the Minister responsible for consumer affairs, I am greatly interested in the points that he raises. I may not today be able to give him all that he seeks in relation to the issue of garden safety, but I will certainly take away and consider many of the things that he asked me to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/2">We should reflect on my hon. Friend's important airing of this issue in the context of his involvement in gardening throughout his time as a parliamentarian. Hon. Members will know that gardening is a subject that is close to his heart. He helped to ensure that the BBC's &quot;Gardeners' Question Time&quot; was broadcast from the House of Commons Terrace and, in 1997, he named a new variety of rose after the then Speaker, Betty Boothroyd. He is also, as he said, the secretary of the all-party group on gardening and horticulture. I recognise the good work that he does to foster better communication between the industry, Parliament and our constituents. He was right to point out the effect of the industry&mdash;it adds &pound;5 billion to the economy&mdash;and the employment opportunities that it creates.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/3">The timing of the debate is appropriate. As we move towards the end of February, many people's thoughts inevitably turn away from winter, when we are more inclined to survey our gardens from the comfort of our own homes, and towards the warmth of spring, which is a time for preparation and sowing&mdash;and ultimately to summer, when we can enjoy the fruits of our work. Already, here in London, we can see the first shoots of green that will, in a short time, become bright yellow daffodils. As nature refreshes its own palate, the gardeners among us look forward to the next project in our everlasting quest for the perfectly manicured lawn, the neatly coiffured hedge and the reddest roses&mdash;although, as I represent a Yorkshire constituency, perhaps that should be the whitest rose.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/4">As my hon. Friend said, the garden is a place to be enjoyed, a place to leave behind the stresses of day-to-day life and, given the time, a place to snooze with the Sunday newspapers&mdash;not that my hon. Friend would do that. As he said, the lawn does not cut itself, the hedge does not get trimmed by looking at it and the roses need regular tending. Regular maintenance is not seen as a chore by the gardener, but as part of a relaxation process. With common sense, all those jobs can be undertaken swiftly and safely by the enthusiastic amateur, and a whole industry has grown up, as my hon. Friend said, around the activity to supply the right tools, the hardiest and most beautiful plants and any manner of garden accessory that it is within the capability of man to design.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/5">Despite the idyllic picture, it is sadly a fact, as my hon. Friend says, that accidents in the garden can and do happen. Based on the most recent available figures from the home accident surveillance system data, it is estimated there were about 2.7 million accidents in homes in the UK in 2002, some 300,000 of which occurred in the garden. Approximately half of those accidents involved people aged between 15 and 64 and about a third involved children aged up to and including 14 years old. By cause, the highest proportion of accidents&mdash;about two fifths&mdash;involved slips, trips and other falls. About one quarter of injuries in the garden occurred as a result of being struck by a moving or other object, and three in 20 resulted from pinches, crushes, cuts, tears or punctures.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/6">As I know that my hon. Friend is particularly interested in ladder safety, let me record that the proportion of garden accidents resulting from falls from ladders was minimal at around only 2 per cent., or approximately 6,000 accidents, which in the context of a population of 60 million is one person in every 10,000. However, I am aware of the horrendous cases that have come before us regarding how people use ladders and it is right that my hon. Friend raises that issue with us.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/7">Generally, it is estimated that about 15 per cent. of all garden accidents&mdash;44,000 in total&mdash;involve the use of garden tools or equipment, and high on the list were lawnmowers, strimmers, hedge trimmers, spades, shovels and forks, secateurs, shears and even the humble flowerpot. Detailed research undertaken in 1996 showed that few accidents involved the use of garden chemicals. It is estimated that in 2002 poisoning and the effects of chemicals accounted for just over 1.5 per cent. of all home accidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/8">It is easy to get carried away with such statistics. The fact that HASS recorded injuries from hedge trimmers and flowerpots in the same categories shows the enormously wide range of accidents that can occur, from the potentially dangerous to the not very serious. Raw numbers do not tell the whole story. Some of the accidents in the statistics reflect the fact that children at play will and do fall over and bang into things, and that will continue regardless of the precautions that are taken by the most safety conscious parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/9">Some accidents in the garden, as in all walks of life, are avoidable and stem from the adoption of poor behaviours and bad practices. Garden accidents are thankfully mainly minor, with the most serious generally being fractures sustained during a fall. However, there is no doubt that the greater use of gloves would avoid some of the cuts and abrasions and other injuries, as would protective footwear.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/10">The nature of a small number of garden fatalities, which are predominantly among young adults, varies from year to year. Many of those result from the use of accelerants on bonfires and barbecues, but some involve tragic child-drowning accidents in garden ponds and pools. My hon. Friend is right to raise such issues from the aspect of consumer protection and it is in that vein that I will be considering the many things that he raised with me.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/11">My hon. Friend wrote to me last year, enclosing a letter from Mr. Kitching of Haygate Engineering Co. Ltd, manufacturer of the Henchman range of access platforms, who expressed concern about a fatal gardening accident that was reported in the <i>Daily Mail</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-05">5 August</phrase>; that was a particularly horrific accident involving a chainsaw and a ladder. A man with a chainsaw still running fell from a ladder on to his wife who sadly died of her injuries.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/12">Mr. Kitching has also been in direct contact with the Department about advertising for ladder safety devices that shows ladders being used in the garden to gain access to the top of hedges for the purpose of pruning them with two-handed power cutters, which he maintains is an unsafe practice. Like my hon. Friend, he argues that the Department should reissue the guidance and notes that it previously published on the safe use of ladders and stepladders.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/13">I have personal experience of cutting the hedge with a power tool while on a ladder. Had it not been for the safety circuit breaker, I might not be here to respond to my hon. Friend. Clearly, I am concerned about how accidents can occur in the simplest of situations. The message in the 1996 basic safety guide remains the same, and the &quot;Ladder User's Handbook&quot; and its companion &quot;Stepladder User's Guide&quot; are both still available on the Department of Trade and Industry website. Again, I shall consider what my hon. Friend has asked me to do in respect of that.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.1/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for making that point. I shall come on to the role of producers, shops and so on. He is right&mdash;that route should be considered, and every product should be sold with safety advice on how to use it.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.2/1">This morning, I took the opportunity to go on to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents site. I spent a good half hour looking for the information and statistics but have still to find them. I was able to get them dead simply on the DTI website, but it is almost impossible on ROSPA's site.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.101.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1263" speakername="Gerry Sutcliffe" colnum="101"  time="011:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h02.htm#50223h02_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.101.3/1">I am sorry to hear that. The decision to move the HASS statistics was based on a resource issue when the Department of Health was producing statistics about hospital and doctor visits. Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents wanted to take on HASS. In the spirit of my hon. Friend's request, I shall investigate further and find out what the problem is.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/2">I hope that I, as the Minister with responsibility for consumers, and the all-party group on gardening and horticulture will develop a relationship and deal with some of these issues in a practical way that helps consumers and the industry. I agree with my hon. Friend that we do not want to issue regulations that burden and restrict the industry, that stop people enjoying their gardening or that prevent products that people want to use from being introduced. I know that he wants to strike a balance.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/3">I was talking about the handbooks that are available on the DTI website, which I am sure my hon. Friend will access straight after the debate. As I said, they were not designed to deal with every specific use of ladders but are general guides that bring together expert advice on choosing and using ladders and stepladders. They aim to lessen the risks to individuals from ladders and other products in the marketplace&mdash;for instance, the other options that were available to the constituent who had the nasty accident.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/4">In particular, the guides set out the importance of choosing a ladder that is the correct height and strong enough for the task being undertaken. They point to the benefit of leaving one hand free to hold on while working, and to the dangers of over reaching, to which I referred earlier. The guides also focus on the importance of proper setting up to ensure that the ladder or stepladder is in the correct position and that it is secured, generally by tying it to a stable fixed object. They are a useful tool for the public, and we must ensure that there is maximum awareness of the issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/5">Several guides that cover safety in the garden more generally are available on the DTI website. &quot;Guide to DIY Safety&quot; and &quot;Painless DIY&quot; are two publications that offer helpful advice on, for example, the use of residual current devices that will protect the user&mdash;me, for instance&mdash;from an electric shock in the event of accidentally cutting through a trailing electric lead with a lawnmower or other cutters. There is further guidance on ladder safety and on the use of chainsaws, hedge trimmers, shredders and brush cutters, and there are pages on &quot;Gardening without Tears&quot;. &quot;Sowing the Seeds of Safety&quot; identifies 10 tips for keeping children safe in the garden, and our garden safety guidance offers more hints and tips, in particular on the safety benefits of keeping the garden tidy, putting tools away after use, locking the garden shed and maintaining pathways, and on the risks associated with barbecues, bonfires, ponds and paddling pools&mdash;all of which people would want to use but which can be dangerous if not used properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/6">In this area where ultimately guidance and the Government can go only so far&mdash;safe behaviour cannot be learned from a quick flick through a leaflet&mdash;common sense has to come into play. Guidance helps us, as do safety instructions provided with the tool or ladder, but we cannot pretend that the DTI issuing leaflets will lead to an end to accidents in the garden or in the home. It will not. We must accept that only through changed behaviours and the responsible use of equipment are we likely to see a reduction in avoidable accidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/7">We must ensure that consumers have rights and that they are protected. We also need to ensure that consumers understand that they have responsibilities too. However, I accept that some gardening accidents may result from products that are inherently unsafe. All consumer products placed on the market are required by the General Product Safety Regulations 1994 to be safe in normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use in keeping with the characteristics of the product. The regulations also require that warnings are provided where the risks that the product presents are not obvious.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/8">Enforcement authorities, which are usually local authority trading standards departments, can act to suspend unsafe products from the market and prosecute the producer or distributor for the breach of the general safety requirement. We are currently consulting on revised regulations that implement the 2001 EC directive on general product safety. One of the main changes is that in future the authorities will, as a last resort, be able to order the recall of dangerous products from consumers. In future when any product, such as a tool, that is designed for professional use comes on to the general consumer market, its safety in a consumer's hands will be judged against the General Product Safety Regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/9">That covers the point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1344" name="George Young">the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> raised that producers of tools should be more aware of the information that consumers need. The DIY leaflets at B&amp;Q, for example, show how to deal with a tool in a particular circumstance. I suppose that we should try to move towards safety leaflets being available alongside tools that are for sale in such outlets. That is where the development of consumer protection will move forward. My hon. Friend may be aware of Consumer Direct, which is a telephone hotline. I attended the opening of its call centre on the island of Lewis. People can ring for advice about products, product safety and consumer rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/10">There are already moves in the DTI to highlight the issue of safe products and consumer safety. That reflects the changing role of the DTI. I do not want to score any political points or to make this matter partisan, but other parties want to end the DTI. That would be a bad step for consumers. We have changed the role of the DTI in consumer protection over the past two years. From 1999 to 2002, the Department mounted a major safety campaign, &quot;Slips, Trips and Broken Hips&quot;, highlighting the problems of falls, particularly of elderly persons, and worked to raise awareness of the risks and consequences. That work was taken over by Help the Aged, with seedcorn funding from the DTI in 2002. There are also our annual firework safety campaigns.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/11">The spirit in which my hon. Friend has raised the issue will get us to look again at certain matters. I am not sure that the HASS statistics can be reinstated. I will be happy to meet my hon. Friend to talk through the reasons why we did what we did on that and where we believe the figures are available, notwithstanding his comments about the ROSPA website. We will look seriously at the question of the leaflet. There may be resource issues, but there may be other ways of achieving the same end. Again, we will explore what can be done. I agree with my hon. Friend that we have to be proactive rather than reactive.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.1/1">This is an occasion on which I must apply Mr. Speaker's recent ruling that, when topics are of a particularly local nature, the time for wind-up speeches by the main Opposition parties' spokesmen is reduced from 10 minutes each to five minutes each. The Minister still retains his right to 10 minutes, which may not please him. One of the Conservative Members must inform their spokesman if, and when, the hon. Gentleman arrives.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.2/1">I am grateful to be able to bring this issue to the attention of the House today. I am glad that my hon. Friends the Members for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous), for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed) are here, as well as the hon. Members for Milton Keynes, North-East (Brian White), for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) and for Bedford (Mr. Hall), who also represent the affected area. I welcome the Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/971" name="Phil Hope">the hon. Member for Corby (Phil Hope)</phrase>, to the debate. He can claim to be wearing two hats today: that of the spokesman for his Department and that of a local constituency Member, although he is probably not allowed to speak in the latter capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/2">Two years ago, the Government published their sustainable communities plan, which designated four regions of south-east England for large-scale residential and other development. The term &quot;Milton Keynes and south midlands sub-region&quot; was invented to describe what I still regard as a pretty disparate area covering most of Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. As the panel appointed by the Government to assess their sub-regional strategy commented,</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/3" class="indent">&quot;The area chosen for the Sub-Region was somewhat arbitrary&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/4">The most recent figures to have emerged from the Government's planning process predict that, under their sustainable communities plan, there will be a further 169,800 new homes in the Milton Keynes and south midlands area by 2021 and, more provisionally, an additional 103,100 new homes in the subsequent decade to 2031. It will come as no surprise to the Minister that I have been sceptical about the Government's approach from the start, but I want to make it clear to the House that I am not opposed to all development. In fact, it is difficult to find anyone, even among conservation organisations, who claims to be against all development.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/5">One of the ironies about the debate is that places such as Aylesbury, Milton Keynes and Northampton were already, before the sustainable communities plan was published, planning at local level for significant new housing and commercial development in the years and decades to come.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.104.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/743" speakername="Tim Boswell" colnum="104"  time="014:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h03.htm#50223h03_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.104.3/1">Like some professional commentators, I have found the whole process bedevilled by the need to unpick the figures for planned and incremental growth. It has been difficult to work out from the overall aggregates how much development was already in the pipeline and how much the present initiative has added to it.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.105.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1049" speakername="David Lidington" colnum="105"  time="014:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h03.htm#50223h03_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.105.0/1">My hon. Friend puts the point well. In recent months, that complication has been aggravated by the publication of the Barker report and the south-east England regional plan when, once again, we have to distinguish between new growth already in the pipeline, growth provided for by the Government under the various stages of the sustainable communities plan, and   growth planned now under the post-Barker recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.1/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept that one of the reasons why the Government, rightly, tried to bring some order to the matter is that, had it been left to them, market forces would have forced development on the areas that he is talking about? That is why infrastructure is so vital.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.105.2/1">I do not wish, and never have wished, to leave things entirely to market forces. I would rather put my trust in local communities through their elected representatives, who, particularly in the areas that we represent, have shown themselves able to judge correctly the balance between growth and conservation that is suitable for their town, district or county. They do that much more skilfully than the regional or central bodies that have been given so much power in recent years.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.3/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that if local authorities of any political colour do not meet their local housing need, they will not be re-elected? The Government do not seem to realise what pressure there is on Tory local councils to meet housing need. Those councils want to meet it.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.105.4/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.4/2">I find it odd that the Government have sought to address the challenge of high housing costs in the south of England by concentrating development&mdash;it seems to me&mdash;in towns where house prices have been in general lower than average for the south-east region.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.5/1">The hon. Gentleman spoke about trusting local authorities. What would be the situation in my constituency, where the local authority has run out of land and will have to build or find housing outside the borough? That cannot be done without mutual agreement between authorities or some kind of Government intervention.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.105.6/1">The hon. Gentleman puts his finger on it when he talked about the need for mutual agreement between local authorities. It seems to me that we need to have a sensible coming together between those authorities that want to provide additional housing and those that are responsible for the transport and public services that will be required if such housing is to lead to successful and sustainable communities. That has not been happening during the Government's implementation of their sustainable communities plan.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.0/1">I understand the hon. Gentleman to be saying that growth is expected to occur in places where house prices, as he pus it, are lower than average. Is he aware that the Housing Corporation says that an income of &pound;40,000 is required to afford a house in Milton Keynes? Does he think that that is acceptable? What would he say to the many people in my area who have incomes well below that?</p>

	<p pid="a.106.1/1">I have never denied the need for more affordable housing. My point was that the areas in the south-east of England singled out by the Government for concentrated growth are not those where housing costs are highest. As I shall explain, one consequence of that approach is the real risk that the proposals will generate not sustainable communities, but a lot of extra road-carried commuter traffic, taking people from the new developments to work in other areas where housing costs remain high.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/2">One of the things about the proposals and the Government's approach that I worry about is that the focus on building on the edge of existing towns risks not only drawing resources away from inner-urban regeneration, but making many villages even more exclusive than they are at the moment. I have a lot of time for the proposals coming from the Rural Housing Trust: one of the things that we need is small-scale developments in a large number of English villages of a type that suits the needs of those parishes and local communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.2/1">Is the hon. Gentleman not aware that one of the reasons for locating growth in urban areas was the fear that otherwise lots of villages would get swamped by development? Is that not what the hon. Gentleman is advocating?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.106.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1049" speakername="David Lidington" colnum="106"  time="014:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h03.htm#50223h03_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.106.3/1">No, I am advocating what the Rural Housing Trust has been advocating: if small-scale developments were made possible, in some cases there could be as few as six, 10 or 12 additional homes in small villages. Those homes could be for people with a local link&mdash;perhaps they are employed in that village or have family members who are employed there. The villages would be sustained as balanced communities and we would avoid the need for so many people to drive in and out of them. We would be able to keep the countryside as a place where people are able to work and not just as a place to which well-off people are able to retire.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.3/2">However, I want to concentrate not so much on those objections of principle, which I wanted to make clear in advance, but on whether the plan as it has developed in the past two years is likely to achieve what Ministers said they wanted to happen. From the start, the Deputy Prime Minister claimed that the sustainable communities plan is about far more than just more house building. The White Paper of February 2003 stressed the need for a flourishing local economy, good transport systems and high-quality public services. The Government assure us that they are determined not to repeat the planning disasters of the 1960s&mdash;indeed, the term &quot;sustainable&quot; implies that the development will be qualitatively different from and better than past growth, and in particular that development will reflect environmental limits and not just economic pressures.</p>

It is undeniable that the plans for the Milton Keynes and south midlands area will lead directly to the loss of greenfield land, and in some areas&mdash;south Bedfordshire is a case in point&mdash;to the loss of green belt land. The development proposed in the sub-regional strategy for the area to the south of Aylesbury threatens to build on green fields and lead to the coalescence of the town with villages such as Wendover, Weston Turville and Stoke Mandeville. In Kettering, about 80 per cent. of new build will have to be on greenfield sites and in Northampton about 27,000 out of 49,000 homes will be built on greenfield sites. I believe that the plan for Milton Keynes is to build not just within the existing urban area but on greenfield sites on the edge of the city.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.3/2">The second issue is that of pressure on areas of particular environmental importance and sensitivity. I will speak at greater length in a moment about the Chilterns area of outstanding natural beauty, which covers a large part of my constituency, and the wider Chilterns area. The impact of these plans on the Nene valley in Northamptonshire is something that has caused anxiety to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/3">Inevitably, housing growth on the scale proposed will lead to an increased tension in rural neighbourhoods between the demands of conservation and those of recreation&mdash;each a legitimate demand. The strain will become greater. There is also the matter of the indirect environmental impacts of the proposals, which include the traffic generated by the new growth; the carbon dioxide emissions that the study commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs found would be one result of the Government's house building plans; the added burden of refuse collection and disposal; and the impact on water supply and sewage treatment.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.4/1">Although I do not dispute that development has an effect on the environment, has the hon. Gentleman seen the interesting survey of Milton Keynes' biodiversity compared with that of the low-grade agricultural land that preceded it? There is greater diversity of flora and fauna in Milton Keynes than there was before, which shows that building does not necessarily damage the environment; it can create good, new, managed environments.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.0/1">The hon. Lady has just added an interesting item to my long reading list. I do not quarrel with her basic point, but, first, the forthcoming reforms of the common agricultural policy are in part designed to restore biodiversity to rural areas; and, secondly, one consequence of the Government's decision to encourage greater density of house building, which was taken for understandable reasons, will be to limit biodiversity in areas where there are plenty of green spaces and gardens within an urban development.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/2">The hon. Lady's comments bring me to the third point that I wanted to stress in my remarks&mdash;the need for an environmental assessment to be done. The Government have hitherto refused to carry one out. If one considers what various agencies have said&mdash;I am not talking about Opposition politicians but about the Government's own watchdogs&mdash;there is no doubt that there is real concern about environmental impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/3">In September last year, the Environment Agency's annual report on the state of the environment in south-east England said that development plans</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/4" class="indent">&quot;could set off an environmental time bomb&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/5">The agency's director for the Thames region, which covers much of the area that we are discussing, declared that</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/6" class="indent">&quot;in some parts of the region we are reaching our environmental limits. Unless the environment is built into plans for development now we will seriously threaten the quality of life in the South East.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/7">I therefore find it dismaying that the Government have still not carried out any serious assessment of the environmental impact of their plans. Back in April 2003, the Select Committee on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister called for such a review. All that has been done is that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs commissioned one consultancy study, which had to be completed within six weeks. That is a completely inadequate response to proposals that will generate change of the order that we are debating today.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/8">A report published last month by the Environmental Audit Committee was frankly damning. I remind hon. Members that that Committee has a majority of Labour members. Paragraph 47 said:</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/9" class="indent">&quot;ODPM seems to have taken the approach to sustainability and the SCP that by simply calling it 'sustainable' and mentioning the environment occasionally . . . the Plan is inherently and obviously fully compatible with the principles of sustainable development. This is clearly not the case.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/10">Paragraph 52 stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/11" class="indent">&quot;It would appear to us that many of the efforts directed towards achieving sustainability within the SCP are little more than a window-dressing exercise. This is unsatisfactory and bound to have severely detrimental consequences in the long term.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/12">I ask the Government to do three things. The first is to carry out, even at this stage, a proper environmental assessment of the sustainable communities plan. Perhaps it could follow the approach outlined in the EU strategic environmental assessment directive. The second is to secure explicit recognition in the plan of the need to protect the special qualities of areas such as the Chilterns area of outstanding natural beauty The third is to acknowledge, to a greater extent than Ministers have done so far, the relationship between the environment and the plans for housing, jobs and transport. The Chilterns is obviously the area of which I have the greatest knowledge.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/13">The Secretary of State's proposed changes to the sub-regional strategy, especially paragraphs 48 and 59, imply that housing in Milton Keynes and the south midlands will help to meet demand among employees working in the Heathrow area and the western corridor. If that is the right interpretation of the Secretary of State's proposals, it would mean a massive further increase in commuter traffic along the inadequate roads that run right through the middle of the Chilterns area of outstanding natural beauty. It also places a question mark over the Government's claim that the plan will deliver employment as well as new homes.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes the point based on his experience of Milton Keynes. Looking at my constituency, Aylesbury already has a serious imbalance of housing over jobs. The number of jobs in the town has fallen in recent months and I think that the same is broadly true of south Bedfordshire. However, the latest version of the Government's plan includes figures that show a lower ratio of jobs to homes&mdash;at least for the Aylesbury area&mdash;than in the proposals as they were first published. I urge the Minister to look again at this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/2">There is real concern about infrastructure and public services, even among those people and organisations that are less sceptical than myself and generally support what the Government are trying to do. In September 2002, an independent study by Roger Tym and Partners predicted that &pound;8.3 billion would be needed to provide the roads, railways, water and sewage treatment and public services to cope with the Government's development plans for the Milton Keynes and south midlands sub-region. A more recent study of the Aylesbury area by the same company last October concluded that for Aylesbury alone&mdash;the town and its surrounding area, not that part of Aylesbury vale district that abuts Milton Keynes&mdash;those costs would be in the region of &pound;768 million. The original Tym study in 2002 stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/3" class="indent">&quot;unless an adequate programme of funding is programmed it is doubtful whether the scale of growth envisaged should be contemplated at all&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/4">Let us consider what is, or is not, happening in respect of particular needs, dealing first with transport, specifically railways and the east-west orbital rail link. The letter that I received from the Minister's colleague, Lord Rooker, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-29">29 October 2004</phrase> made it clear that the Government do not regard the orbital rail link as a priority for public funding, despite the fact that the local authorities in the areas affected by it believe that the development of that route is critical to the future transport infrastructure. Lord Rooker wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/5" class="indent">&quot;we must look to alternative funding routes to contribute to East-West and other infrastructure projects in the growth areas. Developer funding is clearly a critical area and this needs to be fully investigated, alongside the other calls on it and we would also expect a contribution from local authority resources.&quot; &quot;Local authority resources&quot; tend to be a euphemism for a further rise in council tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/6">Let us consider the rail link from the centre of Aylesbury to the Berryfields development to the north of the town. A letter to me from the managing director of Chiltern Railways, dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-01">1 December 2004</phrase>, made it clear that some public funding would be needed if the project was to go ahead, but that the company was still in discussions with both local authorities, the Strategic Rail Authority and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to try to identify possible sources of funding. I hope that the Minister will give me some good news today and say that he has been able to knock heads together to ensure that this much needed and much wanted scheme can now go ahead. It is ironic that, at a time when we are talking about the need for enhanced rail services, the development of the sustainable communities plan has coincided with severe cuts to commuter rail services in Milton Keynes. I am sure that the two Members of Parliament for the city are able to confirm that.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/7">On roads, I make my pleas again for my local area. We will need bypasses for villages like Wing and Rowsham, yet according to the Government's projections, the upgrades needed for roads like the A418 and for the M1 near Milton Keynes are not likely to happen until after the additional houses have been built. Little thought seems to have been given to the high-capacity road links that will be needed to cope with the extra freight and business travel that the development will engender&mdash;for example, there will have to be some link between the Aylesbury area and the M40, for which various options and routes might be considered. I thought that I was pretty unshockable after 13 years in this place, but I was shocked when I contacted the Highways Agency about its 10-year route strategy for the M40 and was informed that it was completely unaware that that was an issue and did not really think that it was relevant to its strategy document.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/8">As for water and sewage treatment, Thames Water tells me that the sewage treatment works in Aylesbury will struggle to cope with the expansion set out in the local council's plan, let alone the sustainable communities plan. There is no money in Aylesbury's Ofwat allocation for new technology in the area until 2010 at the very earliest, and if a new sewage treatment works is needed, it will probably not start operation until 2016 or 2017. It is little wonder that the director of the Thames region of the Environment Agency wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-09">9 December</phrase> last year to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/9" class="indent">&quot;We have looked at the impact of the Government's plans for additional housing. As a result we have serious concerns about accommodating growth at Aylesbury in an environmentally sustainable manner.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/10">He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/11" class="indent">&quot;We are presently pursuing Government funding to carry out this work, which is additional to that covered by our current budget.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/12">I emphasise that that is a Government agency&mdash;one that happens to be chaired by a former senior Labour councillor, and one whose chief executive takes the Labour Whip in the House of Lords. It is the Government's official watchdog and enforcement body on the environment that is commenting in those critical terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/13">On public services, I have heard the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West say before that Milton Keynes general hospital is pretty stretched to deal with the existing population of the city, let alone the additional population that would come under the Government's plans. In Buckinghamshire, the Vale of Aylesbury primary care trust, like all other PCTs in Buckinghamshire and Milton Keynes, is running at a significant financial deficit. In education, it seems likely that there will be a gap of between 18 months and two years between houses being built and new schools opening.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/14">That does not add up to development that can legitimately be described as sustainable. The time scale for the planned development does not match with that for infrastructure and services and there is no clarity about levels or sources of funding. Frankly, the idea that &pound;8.3 billion or anything like that will come from developer contributions is fanciful. I can find no serious observer on any of the local councils, from any political party or from an outside agency who thinks that developer contributions of that scale are possible. The Government need to engage in some joined-up thinking.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the difficulties in the whole scoping of this exercise has been the Government's tendency to assume that developers are a given and will simply come forward? If the plans are to succeed in any sense and are to become genuinely sustainable, is it not essential that there be a real demand on the part of developers, and that they can carry out their development and get returns from it? That is not assured merely by Ministers saying that they want that to happen.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.3/1">If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I want to conclude my remarks. Then he and others will have a chance to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker eye.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.3/2">Underlying the problems is the undemocratic nature of the entire exercise. Power has been taken from local councils and given to regional bureaucracies or bodies such as English Partnerships, which are accountable directly to central Government. If the Government are determined to pursue their policies through the planning structure that they recently created, they should be able to do far better in terms of public consultation. From what I have seen, consultation as it affects my constituency has been rushed and scanty. Most parish councils and local community groups, for example, were excluded completely from the panel hearings on the plan that were held in Northampton last spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.3/3">There is too much central prescription of the detail of the Government's plans, even if we accept their basic structure. For example, the plan says that new development around Aylesbury should be to the south of the town&mdash;the implication being that it should be on greenfield sites between Aylesbury and Wendover and based around a southern relief or distributor road. However, those matters should be entirely for the local council to determine. If the Government want to win over sceptics not only in Parliament but in the communities that we represent, they must show that they trust local communities and are prepared to change their plans from time to time in response to strongly felt and well argued local opinion.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.2/1">In view of the time constraints, my contribution will be somewhat telegraphic. I am confident that if my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1313" name="Brian White">the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Brian White)</phrase> is called, he will fill in the gaps that I leave.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/2">I am proud to be one of the MPs who represent Milton Keynes, which is a highly successful example of planned growth. It has a hugely dynamic economy and a pleasant environment, as everyone who lives there knows. Milton Keynes has excellent facilities, notably, our theatre, indoor ski slope, the first multiplex cinema&mdash;it has now been superseded by another&mdash;the Milton Keynes Dons football stadium and the shopping centre. Enormous numbers of people come from the surrounding region to use those facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/3">Everyone in Milton Keynes&mdash;the business community, the general population and the council&mdash;understands that further expansion of Milton Keynes is essential. It is essential for two reasons. First, there is an excess of jobs relative to the number of houses available for people to live in, such that, according to the 2001 census, the net number of people commuting in daily is 16,000. Many of those people would live in Milton Keynes if they could afford to do so. Businesses frequently complain to my hon. Friend and me that they cannot expand as fast as they want to because they have extreme difficulty in filling vacancies as there are not enough people available.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/4">The second issue is the lack of affordable housing. I alluded to the Housing Corporation claim that a salary of &pound;40,000 is required to be able to afford to buy housing in Milton Keynes. I suspect that that figure is slightly out of date. Many constituents complain to me about the lack of affordable housing to buy or rent. Consequently, many people live in overcrowded and unsatisfactory accommodation or live outside Milton Keynes and commute in because they cannot afford to buy there.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/5">Most people in Milton Keynes&mdash;certainly the business sector and the council&mdash;therefore welcome expansion and the fact that it is to take place within an overall planning framework. They broadly welcome the structures that the Government have set up: the Milton Keynes partnership and the inter-regional board, which will oversee that growth and try to ensure that all the public bodies that will be affected by the expansion build the necessary provision for it into their forward plans. People welcome the commitment that has been given by Lord Rooker on many occasions that infrastructure will be provided in parallel with the new housing. All that is broadly welcomed, although there are many disagreements on detail, which I do not want to skate over, but which I shall not go into in the short time available to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/6">It is not surprising that many people in Milton Keynes remain suspicious about whether infrastructure will be provided in parallel with housing. That suspicion is largely based on their experience, accumulated mostly under Conservative Governments. There was huge underinvestment and poor performance by the Conservative Governments in providing infrastructure. I need cite only the hospital to demonstrate that: everyone in Milton Keynes knows that what was planned was not delivered. That is the root of the many problems that we have had thus far, and we have been able to catch up with the population growth only recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/7">I am not surprised that people who have had such experiences remain suspicious of whether the infrastructure will be provided. They also recall that during the entire period of Conservative Government, the funding for the national health service and local government lagged behind the population figures. I was incredibly pleased to hear in the recent announcement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health that NHS funding for Milton Keynes and other growth areas will be provided on the basis of population projections. That is the first time that that has happened, and it has happened under a Labour Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/8">Also under the present Government, significant capital sums have been spent on upgrading provision at the hospital, including at the beginning of this year the opening of the &pound;12  million treatment centre with its four extra operating theatres, which has won plaudits from all and sundry, including unsolicited letters in the local press. There has also been provision of new GP surgeries on the eastern and western sides of the city, where growth is happening, and in the older parts, as well as funding for a new health centre at Wolverton.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/9">Contrary to the experience alluded to by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1049" name="David Lidington">the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase>, since the Labour Government were elected, the local council, whether it has been Labour or Liberal Democrat controlled&mdash;as it is now&mdash;has never made a request for money for school building that has not been met. On some occasions, the request has come through a bit late, which is why the funding has been late. I suggest that if the hon. Gentleman is having problems, he speaks to his local authority and asks it to get its planning in sync so that it knows when to ask the Government for money for new schools, instead of just complaining when it does not turn up. The local authority has received an extra &pound;9  million for growth and the third largest increase in percentage terms of any local authority in England both this year and last.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/10">The first issue that I want to highlight is rail. There is a problem with commuter services on the west coast main line, which I have been working closely with the new rail user group, the partnership board and the council to address. I am confident that Ministers will respond soon to the bid to put in an extra platform at Milton Keynes Central station, which will deal with the overall problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/11">I am glad that we have already built more than 1,000 affordable houses over three years, 516 of them for key workers, and I want that development to continue. I have major concerns about the detail of the local plan process and how it is being handled by the council. In particular, I am concerned about the quixotic decision by the local inspector to include area 11 and exclude area 10.4 from the local plan for 2001 to 2016. I am very annoyed that the Liberal Democrat-controlled council went along with the decision when it had perfectly good planning reasons to ignore the inspector. I will continue to work with local residents on that issue to ensure that we get back to what the local plan said and do not go with it as it is at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/12">My final point is about the extraordinary suggestion by the hon. Member for Aylesbury that all the growth can be contained by expanding villages and providing jobs in them. How many of the firms in Milton Keynes is he proposing should move out into villages around the city? How many villages will have to be expanded to make up the houses needed for the 16,000 jobs already in Milton Keynes that are filled by people from outside?</p>

	<p pid="a.114.0/1">May I first congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1049" name="David Lidington">the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> on securing the debate? Like many of us, he is aware of the sheer anger felt locally at the Government's plans. I am sorry to say that I do not think that the Government are aware of it. My hon. Friend talked about Government plans up to 2030. Fortunately, by then there will have been a series of Conservative Governments who have listened more carefully to what local people have to say and have not ridden roughshod over their views.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/2">I intend to confine myself to the rather narrow margin of the next decade. Even now, the Government are planning some 67,000 homes for the Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes area by 2015, and the Deputy Prime Minister has said that it may be appropriate to revise those figures upwards. Some 40,000 of those homes are planned for just north of Luton. In one very small, already congested area&mdash;from Milton Keynes to Woburn, Aspley Guise and Toddington&mdash;3,230 homes are proposed. That does not make sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/3">I realise that there is pressure for homes: there are changing living patterns and a lack of rental accommodation, which is much more suitable for many people. However, the Deputy Prime Minister's motivation should be called into question. When he first talked about his plans, he said that one of the problems was that people in the north-east and north-west of England could not find jobs there, but that there were jobs in the south-east, so we should build more homes in the south-east to attract people from the north-east and north-west to leave their homes there and come down here.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/4">Such a proposition is back to front, like some of the Deputy Prime Minister's sentences. He has got it wrong. What he should have said is, &quot;Let's provide more work in the north-east and the north-west of the United Kingdom&quot;, but he did not do so. We must consider why so many people in Milton Keynes are interested in expanding towards the south and the south-east of the town, when there is already a considerable development area further to the north and north-east. We know that if the town developed towards the north and the north-east, that would be welcomed by people in Rugby and Warwickshire, who are undoubtedly worried about the sink effect of Milton Keynes attracting industry and commerce away from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/5">Why are the plans being proposed at all? Why are they being proposed for an area where they are opposed by the East of England Development Agency, which is a Government quango? Why are the Government deliberately misinterpreting the regional development plans and ignoring&mdash;despite what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1249" name="Phyllis Starkey">the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> said&mdash;the need for affordable housing by expanding into an area that is the most expensive part of the expansion area of Milton Keynes? Why are they ignoring the already overstretched infrastructure, as well as local opinion? The answer is very simple: the reason is money. If Milton Keynes develops towards Aspley Guise, Woburn and into the vale of Aylesbury, where land values are high, property values will be high; as a consequence, the community charge take by the local authority will be higher. Local authorities will receive more income. That is why the Government want the expansion there.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/6">The hon. Lady said that there are more jobs in Milton Keynes than homes, and I accept that that is the case. She also talked about very high house prices in Milton Keynes. If house prices are very high in Milton Keynes, the answer to that is to build where house prices would be lower because the land cost is lower. That is not to the south and south-east of Milton Keynes, but to the north and north-east. If there are more jobs in Milton Keynes than homes, and if more homes need to be built, they should be built to the north and north-east, rather than the south and south-east. The plan is deliberately designed to increase local authority council tax take and to provide commuting jobs in an area from which commuters travel to London, and where infrastructure is already overstretched. The easiest way for people to oppose the Deputy Prime Minister's plans is to get rid of him and the present Government.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.115.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1313" speakername="Brian White" colnum="115"  time="014:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h03.htm#50223h03_spnew29">
	<p pid="a.115.0/1">A key point in answer to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1365" name="Jonathan Sayeed">the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed)</phrase> is that market forces are driving investment in the area. If one did nothing, that investment would still happen. Milton Keynes has been a success because it was planned. If housing growth is unplanned, we get housing without infrastructure, as happened around Bracknell and Basingstoke. At junction 13, in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, the Tory-controlled local authority is putting in businesses, expecting Milton Keynes to sort out housing, and then complaining that there is growth. The authority is trying to have its cake and eat it, as the hon. Gentleman tried to do, but that will not wash. His comments do not add up.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1249" name="Phyllis Starkey">the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> has covered a large number of the issues. Other key factors are time scales and, more specifically, the number of houses built per annum. I am concerned that we keep to a level of housing growth of about 2,000, which is what Milton Keynes has been able to deliver. I urge the Government to aim for and accept that activity level.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/3">There is a problem with the interaction of the different political parties, in that regional planning is controlled by the Conservatives and the local authority is controlled by the Liberal Democrats. However, beyond that there is a key role for developers, and the role of English Partnerships in delivering the Government's agenda has to be addressed. It is important that the Minister gives clear guidance to English Partnerships to operate in an environmentally sustainable way, so that issues such as zero-carbon houses are taken seriously. The transport issues that my hon. Friend referred to in relation to railways, which would apply equally to roads, should also be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/4">If my hon. Friend the Minister needs money, he could get it by scrapping the widening of the M1. He could invest that money in the infrastructure of Milton Keynes and the south midlands. I strongly urge him to do so, but I suspect that he will decline. Widening the M1 will not solve the problem, but if that money were used to widen the A421 from Bedford to Milton Keynes and to invest in local infrastructure, it would help with the existing development plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/5">One of the problems with English Partnerships, local authorities and regional government is the way in which they communicate, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1049" name="David Lidington">the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> mentioned. A large number of those bodies communicate in professional language&mdash;professionalese&mdash;that goes over the heads of ordinary people. For example, developers put out a development brief on an estate in Caldecotte in my constituency; they thought that they had reached an agreement, but in fact the language had gone over the heads of the residents. When local people saw what was happening on the ground, the developer encountered a massive reaction against it. That happened because the developers, the local council and regional bodies used planning language instead of plain English. It is important to use planning language when developing an interaction, but getting ordinary people on board and explaining what is going on is critical to success. I have suggested that the Milton Keynes partnership committee holds a daily blogging exercise through which people can interact with it. However it happens, the language must be right and information must flow.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/6">There has been much concern about high-density development, mainly because in the 1960s it was associated with poor-quality development, but that does not have to be the case. I urge the Minister to say specifically that high density must be high quality. There are a number of issues relating to the local plans on the eastern flank, but it is not appropriate to raise them now as other hon. Members wish to speak. There are issues relating to the infrastructure. We have to get the development briefs right and not wait for the detailed planning permissions; we have to get the developers on board at an early stage, so that the genuine fears in the community can be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/7">Most people want the 1,500 families in Milton Keynes who are in temporary accommodation to be housed. They want their children to have houses and jobs. Those are the people whom the plans will benefit. Local people also want the rural areas in the north of my constituency around the Ouse valley to be protected, which is why it was made an area of attractive landscape. I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire suggest that there would be no problems going into the Ouse valley. In fact, there would be real problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/8">There are a number of important issues, but there is not sufficient time to go into them in detail. Milton Keynes can deliver on the Government's sustainable agenda if the support mechanisms are in place. The different levels of government must get it right, the communication has to be right, and growth must be backed up with the infrastructure money that is starting to come through and must continue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.117.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1216" speakername="Andrew Selous" colnum="117"  time="014:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h03.htm#50223h03_spnew30">
	<p pid="a.117.0/1">I recognise that there is local housing need in my constituency and I defer to no one my desire for it to be met. All my colleagues who have problems with the sustainable communities plan want their local housing need to be met, but they disagree with the scale of the actions that the Government have proposed. I have wide cross-party support in my constituency. A petition was presented, signed by 17,000 people, backing our local objections to the plans, and leading Labour and Liberal Democrat councillors supported it.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/2">I shall talk first about local jobs. The problem in south Bedfordshire is the reverse of the situation in Milton Keynes. Only half the residents of south Bedfordshire have jobs within the county: 12,923 people commute out and 1,083 are unemployed. The Government's figures predict that by 2031&mdash;admittedly quite a way ahead&mdash;an extra 100,000 people will come to south Bedfordshire, bringing about 70,000 cars. The Government want to turn south Bedfordshire into a dormitory town for London and elsewhere. That is the wrong approach. The Government are ramming far too much housing into the four areas in the south-east. A more organic approach is needed. It would be better to spread growth more widely.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/3">If we have those numbers of jobs, people and cars, our already poor transport infrastructure will be further burdened. Our trains are full to bursting going south. The M1 is gridlocked, and even with the fourth lane it will still be blocked. The Translink proposals have been forced upon us by the Government and we have lost the opportunity for a proper east-west link across south Bedfordshire, perhaps going from Leighton Buzzard all the way to Welwyn Garden City.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/4">Bedfordshire county council has calculated on a very scientific basis that for every extra 1,000 houses built, the Government should provide &pound;38 million of infrastructure support. We have nothing like that on offer. The East of England regional assembly&mdash;a body that I will not be sad to see disappear&mdash;has itself criticised the Government's plans for the whole of the east of England as wholly inadequate in terms of infrastructure and transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/5">I have several specific questions to ask. For some 20 or 30 years, Leighton Buzzard, my largest town, has been trying to get a community hospital. It is one of the largest towns in England not to have a hospital facility. I ask time and time again whether all the extra housing will mean that Leighton Buzzard gets a community hospital, but the answer I receive is no. The people of Leighton Buzzard think that the Government's promises are hollow.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/6">A bypass is being built around Linslade. It has been planned for a long time and there is bitter controversy about it. I have problems with the route&mdash;I think that it is too close to Linslade&mdash;but what are plans for housing around it? All too often, new roads are used as an excuse to ram a massive amount of extra housing into areas where it is not appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/7">Reference has also been made to the lack of local democracy. It is ridiculous that Members of Parliament are the only people able to hold a Minister to account about essentially local issues. Trust the people, please. Conservative councillors will get thrown out if they do not provide adequate housing for the families and young people in the districts that they represent. That will happen; it is how democracy works. What the Government are doing to local democracy is scandalous.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/8">On the environmental front, there are massive concerns. Two Labour-dominated Select Committee reports have heavily criticised the Government's plans on the environmental and transport fronts. I noticed the headline in <i>The Guardian</i> of <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-14">14 October</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/9" class="indent">&quot;Homes plan 'will swamp' countryside. Building 500,000 new houses risks water and roads crisis, says report.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/10">The Government are being criticised from all sides&mdash;from the East of England regional assembly, <i>The Guardian</i> and elsewhere. Criticism is certainly not coming just from the Opposition Benches.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/11">There is an alternative to the plans: scrapping regional planning and bringing back local control. We should not ram all the housing into four areas around London, but spread it more widely across the south-east and London. We should also, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1365" name="Jonathan Sayeed">the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed)</phrase> said, consider rebalancing the whole of the infrastructure across the United Kingdom. We could also look at shared ownership, to bring housing affordability back to many of our constituents who have genuine difficulty getting on to the housing ladder in our constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/12">I say to the Minister that there is very real anger and concern. Seventeen thousand people is only slightly fewer than elected me to this House in the first place. I hope that the Minister realises that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.118.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/933" speakername="Patrick Hall" colnum="118"  time="014:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h03.htm#50223h03_spnew31">
	<p pid="a.118.0/1">I shall confine my remarks to a fraction of what I would have said if I had had the time. I am glad that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1049" name="David Lidington">the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> has raised these issues, which are of great importance to his constituents, to mine and to many others, as can be seen from the number of people in the Chamber. He is right to express concerns about the delivery of the growth area and about infrastructure. I, too, wish to see the proper provision of road and rail investment. However, I also want proper provision of health and education services, police, leisure and jobs. All that has to go together. The balance between homes and jobs is crucial. If we get that right, we will be able to diminish reliance on commuting, which is one of the most unsustainable features of modern life.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/2">The hon. Gentleman is honest about his views. He says that he supports some locally determined development, but that he does not support the growth area concept with its national and regional strategic dimension. I happen to think that those dimensions are crucial. Any Government would have to address them. Although I join the hon. Gentleman in wanting the necessary investment in infrastructure, I differ from him in principle because I support the growth area as the practical way of delivering what is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/3">I believe that the growth area is necessary in our part of the world to meet not only population growth, but the increase in the number of single households that means that household growth as a strong feature of modern life will continue. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1249" name="Phyllis Starkey">the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> said, it is also needed to give more people the chance of an affordable home to buy or rent. There is a shortage of housing for rent and of social housing. We need more homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/4">The truth is that many of the plans embraced within and enlarged on in the growth area are not new. This should not be seen just as a narrow party political battle, as too often it is, because that stops people listening to the serious issues that affect everyone's quality of life. Some of the plans have been around for a long time&mdash;in structure plans in Bedfordshire and Marston Vale, under different party political influences in the Government and in Bedfordshire county council. It is therefore unfortunate that there has been an attempt to stir up negative and emotional fears among local constituents. If we approached matters differently, our constituents would be willing to look at some of the issues&mdash;which I accept are difficult&mdash;and might see that doing nothing is not a solution. That was not quite what the hon. Member for Aylesbury said, but it is not a proper approach to say that growth can happen, but not in our area.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/5">I see the growth area not as a threat, but as an opportunity. We would all be wise to look at it in that way. There are, of course, challenges and difficulties, but it should be an opportunity not just for the new communities that move in in the future, as is planned, but for the existing communities&mdash;the people whom we already represent. If we are to have new villages and towns in the area, that will put demands on the existing facilities, such as Bedford town centre, which needs to prepare. Indeed, those matters are being considered, and I am pleased that there are a number of initiatives&mdash;I am not pleased, however, that I do not have time to mention them now.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/6">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1313" name="Brian White">the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Brian White)</phrase> mentioned that it is better to adopt a planned approach than to pretend that planning is not a good thing, which was the ideological position of the Conservative Government in the 1980s. At that time, development was delivered, but usually by councils refusing planning applications for housing estates and the applications then being granted on appeal, with the planning inspectorate having only a weak ability to add legal agreements. The conditions imposed were unsustainable and not balanced, and all sorts of opportunities were missed through that approach. I believe that the current approach is much more positive.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/7">There needs to be leadership in difficult matters. People might initially say, &quot;Oh, we don't want this&quot;, but we have to carry such matters through, even though sometimes that is not a popular or easy task. We have to do it for the benefit not only of those who are yet to come, but of those who are here already. We should take that important aspect into account when we consider planning.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/8">In Bedfordshire we have some positive news on roads. In December, there was the announcement of the A421 dualling between the M1 and the A1, which is essential for the eastern part of the growth area. We have a refreshing initiative on the funding of the Bedford western bypass&mdash;a pump-priming agreement, with most of the money coming in later from the private sector. There is some disappointment&mdash;if my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/972" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins)</phrase> had been able to speak today, I am sure that he would have mentioned it&mdash;about the east Luton corridor. That is very important for the region, for Luton post-Vauxhall and for the development of Luton airport. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister will acknowledge that disappointment and be prepared to think again.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/9">My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West mentioned the totally new approach to funding health services, which involves looking ahead rather than playing catch-up, as has been the traditional way. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take on board that enlightened approach from the Department of Health, for which his Department has been working hard, and apply that approach to capital and revenue funding for education, police and leisure services.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/10">I also ask my hon. Friend the Minister not to regard the concerns of residents about quality of life, environment and biodiversity as nimbyism. Nimbyism exists, but people are right to have concerns about quality of life, their economy and their environment. We are all entitled to have such concerns. Issues such as water supply must be taken seriously, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will address them today and on other occasions. This is an opportunity to be positive, not negative.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.120.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/743" speakername="Tim Boswell" colnum="120"  time="015:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h03.htm#50223h03_spnew32">
	<p pid="a.120.0/1">In a recent debate on the establishment of the West Northamptonshire urban development corporation, my position was surprisingly accurately and rather felicitously described by the Minister for Housing and Planning as one of pragmatic acquiescence. That same is true of the two district councils in south Northamptonshire and Daventry that I represent. We have an interest in making sure that, if development is coming to our area, there is a proper provision of infrastructure. That was emphasised by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1049" name="David Lidington">the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> in his masterly introduction to the topic; I merely re-emphasise it to the Minister today.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/2">I wish to suggest a technique to the Minister. Each time there is an announcement, such as the recent welcome announcement about primary care services, it is important that Ministers not trip themselves up by not explaining how the additional need that they are creating by that announcement is designed to be met. They may give some thought to the idea of an annual expression of an infrastructure budget for the region that could be explained to people and which we can take to our constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/3">I now have some brief comments to make on some of the specific impacts that might not have received the attention that they should have received. They were not dealt with in the Department's initial planning, but still need to be taken into account. The first impact to which my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury referred was that of water resources. I return to that point because it is important to remember not only the capital cost, but the land budget for the provision of reservoirs and the whole process of planning and its acceptance.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/4">I have an interest in the second impact of flood defence. Believe it or not, I was the Minister with responsibility for flood defence immediately prior to the present Minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. We have had lethal floods in Northampton, and our significant local problems will obviously be expanded by additional development. The Minister will be familiar with the study carried out by the Association of British Insurers entitled &quot;Making Communities Sustainable&quot;. I have carried out a quick head count on its calculations in respect of the major towns in the region that we are discussing this afternoon. It suggests that more than 4,000 houses would be built</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/5" class="indent">&quot;in significant flood probability areas&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/6">which is something that will have to be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/7">My third observation concerns the supply of aggregates. The second draft of the Northamptonshire minerals local plan is under review and will be contentious. One of its aims is to protect the Nene valley, to which my hon. Friend, has referred, by moving into glacial deposits, which is highly difficult because of environmental sensitivity. Given that the new proposals are not explicitly keyed into the plan, the danger is that we will end up with both the exploitation of glacial deposits and further works in the Nene valley.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/8">I have two final and more general points to make, one of which is prompted by my discussion about aggregates. My constituency has an immediate boundary with that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1249" name="Phyllis Starkey">the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> and my gravel deposits are next to her city. If we are considering the matter globally, it is a little difficult to see how such matters can be conducted in silos between the various local authorities, as if the rest of the region did not exist. I have merely flagged up the matter as a concern; it is certainly not an offer or a bid. I suffer such an experience bitterly and constantly. Being from the same long and thin county, the Minister and I both know that everything is on the boundary of somewhere. We cross three regions. There are other important regions such as the west midlands on my boundary. The Minister needs to assure us today and during his continuing dialogue with us that cross-regional issues are being dealt with properly.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.0/1">Is not the point of my hon. Friend's argument the fact that so many concerns have been expressed and that it is the process by which the decisions have been reached as much as the individual decisions that have caused those concerns? More time and more consideration, as various reports have asked for, would do much to help the Government's case rather than doing it damage as is happening now.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.1/1">My hon. Friend is, as ever, spot on. I shall conclude with a positive remark, which I offer to the Minister for nothing. I have&mdash;again in a previous capacity&mdash;some experience of national forest and community forest. I hope that, even within a structure that should not be driven by a huge planning mode, the Minister will consider, working with local authorities and the agencies that he has available, whether we can achieve some positive and fairly high-profile environmental impacts. I hope that he will also address the concerns that we all rightly share.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1049" name="David Lidington">the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> on securing the debate. It is important that regional planning matters are fully debated. One of my criticisms is that, by and large, they are dealt with away from the public eye by quangos and other partly elected groups rather than by democratically elected groups. Pleasing him on that point is about as far as I am going to go.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/2">My constituency is in glorious Devon, but I know the area that we are debating because I used to live in Oxford and my wife used to work in Aylesbury. We drove up to Aylesbury regularly and from there went to Northampton, where we had friends. I am not too sure whose constituency it is in, but I remember that there is a village called Hinton-in-the-Hedges. It is in a beautiful place and quite clearly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/743" name="Tim Boswell">the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell)</phrase>&mdash;although he did not use this line&mdash;is trying to illustrate that soon it will no longer be Hinton-in-the-Hedges but Hinton-between-the-brick-walls.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/3">Local people obviously have such fears when any development is proposed, but that is the point at which I begin to disagree with the Conservatives. They argue, &quot;Leave it to our local authorities. Everything will be all right. If we do not provide housing for the homeless, the Conservative councillors will be thrown out.&quot; I have been in politics a long time and I know that it does not work as simply as that. When a development is planned, an action group is instantly formed to oppose it. In my constituency there are proposals for developments and an action group to oppose each one. I agree that most of them have valid arguments and I have ensured that their cases have been properly put. We have a vast amount of growth in our area and there is an argument that we do not need any more. Where there are action groups, the difficulties come with the fact that a few votes may be lost on the homelessness side but a lot more will be lost if one stands up and says, &quot;I want to build houses on this green field&quot;, because the number of people affected is greater.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/4">We are in part debating the decision-making process. Clearly, decisions should not be made by quangos. I do not believe that the Government have gone about their plans in the right manner or that there has been adequate consultation with the public and adequate public debate. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1216" name="Andrew Selous">The hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> made a comment about regional assemblies. They are deeply flawed, but if we had democratically elected bodies where people could debate such matters on a regional or sub-regional basis, we could have full public consultation and proper debate and we could come to a democratic decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.123.1/1">Our party fought to ensure that county councils retained their voting and debating rights on planning matters, which the Government were going to take away from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/2">When discussing infrastructure, the hon. Member for Aylesbury hit on a good phrase. We do things the wrong way round&mdash;back to front. Common sense and good planning dictate that we should put the infrastructure in and then build to it. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1313" name="Brian White">The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Brian White)</phrase> made that point too. We do not do that&mdash;we say to developers, &quot;We want to build some houses. We will allow you to build them and we will then charge you for section 106 agreements. You will pay us the money and we will then do the road improvements.&quot; That is a deeply corrupt and immoral way of dealing with the matter. It is also the wrong way round. If we want to develop an area, we should say what the infrastructure needs are, debate them, whether they be extra rail links or hospitals, and ensure that the investment is there to develop them. We cannot have the situation, which we have had too often in the past, in which development is allowed to continue without adequate schools, hospitals, roads or rail networks being built.</p>

	<p pid="a.123.2/1">I am delighted to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1345" name="Richard Younger-Ross">the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross)</phrase> because it gives me the opportunity to put on record a proper interpretation of what he said. He thinks that he knows better than the Members of Parliament present about what is better for their area. He wants a mechanism so he can impose his decision through an unelected regional chamber instead of leaving it to the local representatives who are democratically elected to serve their communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/2">I will take a slight risk and mention my own constituency. I have a Conservative council in Colchester, which has provoked a major row by imposing a small-scale development of social housing in a village. That has caused a lot of controversy, but it is an example of a local council taking responsibility, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1216" name="Andrew Selous">the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> mentioned. If people are given the responsibility, they rise to it. However, what we are debating is not just one, but three regional assemblies&mdash;which underlines the ludicrousness of the process&mdash;imposing their will on the communities that they pretend to represent but do not because they are not democratically elected.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/3">The regional agenda continues to be pursued by a Government who have had it roundly rejected in the north-east. They thought that that would be the area in which an elected regional assembly would be most popular, but it turned out to be deeply unpopular, rejected by 78 per cent. to 22 per cent. None the less, they are continuing to pursue regional structures so that central Government can take more and more decisions away from local communities. If there is one fundamental difference between the Government and the official Opposition, it is that they will carry on creating a regional bureaucracy so that Ministers and officials in Whitehall can impose their decisions on local communities, whereas we will scrap the lot, save the money and give the power back to local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/4">On a more conciliatory note, I shall briefly draw the threads of the debate together. I have not heard one hon. Member speak today who is not concerned about the issues facing their local communities. That includes a desire in all parties for social housing and proper development. I have heard no hon. Member say that they are against development in principle, and I advise the Minister against picking a fight with the Opposition over social housing. I could mention that the Conservative Government had a much better record on building social housing in England than the present Administration, but I will not mention that, because I want to concentrate on what unites us, which is that we are all fundamentally concerned about the same things. What divides us is the constitutional question of who decides.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/933" name="Patrick Hall">The hon. Member for Bedford (Mr. Hall)</phrase> said that we can solve the problems only if there is leadership, but where does that leadership come from? Does it come from some eagle's lair at the top of a Government Department where a Minister and his officials decide, or do we look to try to create a society in which leadership comes from the local community? I am the first to accept that the trend of removing civic leadership from our communities has a long history, going back a hundred years in which the ability of communities and their elected councils to lead their communities and take decisions has been removed. There are stories of planning applications being turned down by local councils that are then overruled by public inquiry and a Minister's diktat&mdash;that is not the way forward. No other country in Europe sets national housing targets or creates a national planning framework in the same way as we do. We live in the most centralised country of all the European states, and if we are going to be&mdash;dare I say&mdash;a modern country, we need to consider radical decentralisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/6">The flaw in the Barker process is glaringly obvious if we consider what it is: a Minister appointing an economist to plan where people should live and what sort of houses they should live in, based on a spurious analysis of the most vague collection of statistics. Not even Stalin would organise his agriculture or tractor production on that basis. Why should we have Gosplan for housing in the south of England and a housing policy based on expanding housing provision in the south and contracting it in the north in order to attract even more economic overheating in the south of England than we have at present? That is the rut that the Government have got themselves into. The next Conservative Government must give power back to local communities so that the society in which we choose to live reflects what our local communities want.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.3/1">On the fundamental question of who decides, I was a county councillor before becoming a Member of Parliament. I remember the 7 per cent. cut in grants that we had to endure under a Tory Government. There was little decision making, other than on making cuts because of the failure of the Conservative Government to fund local authorities. The &pound;35 billion cuts that the Conservatives announced will decimate council services or push council tax through the roof. I do not need to take lessons from the Conservatives on who decides and on support for local government.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.3/2">Returning to the Milton Keynes and the south midlands growth area, let me try to deal with the important points raised by hon. Members. First, there has been a thorough democratic process of consultation over the past three or four years. I will not rehearse all the details, but it included an independent study by Roger Tym and Partners in 2002, which made it clear that the area had potential for growth. Other independent growth area assessments were published in 2003 for all the towns where it was recognised that there was potential for growth, including Aylesbury. There was a 12-week period of public consultation, ending in October 2003, on the regional assembly's draft planning document, and the independent panel was appointed to conduct an inquiry and a public examination of all aspects of the proposals. That took place over an unprecedented five weeks during March and April 2004. The independent panel report endorsed growth for Aylesbury and other towns and made recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.3/3">The Deputy Prime Minister expects to publish the final sub-regional strategy and alterations to regional planning guidance in the spring. I am trying to point out, in a few seconds, that there has been substantial opportunity for the local authorities and communities in the area to express their concerns before the strategy is finalised. It will then be for local councils to produce detailed proposals to implement a sub-regional strategy through their local development documents. If we left it only to local authorities and did not have a sub-regional strategy, we would not be able to cope with the issue of boundaries between different local authorities. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/743" name="Tim Boswell">The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell)</phrase> was absolutely right to suggest that we needed a regional or a sub-regional strategy to deal with boundaries and connections between different authorities within the growth area.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.3/4">It is important that the growth area policy deals with the serious under-provision of housing&mdash;no one disagrees with that. Every hon. Member present has said that there is a lack of housing, especially affordable housing, in their constituency because of the high demand. The question is how we solve the problem. Do we let market forces do so, or adopt a planned approach that takes into account the need for sub-regional infrastructure?</p>

	<p pid="a.126.5/1">No. The hon. Gentleman spoke in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.5/2">There has been a systemic failure over the past 18 years and it is important that our approach puts that right. The idea that the strategy is only about growth in Milton Keynes and Northampton is clearly wrong. It is absolutely important to have adequate housing, good-quality jobs, and good infrastructure for all areas throughout the sub-region, to ensure that we build sustainable communities. That is the essence of what we are trying to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.5/3">I shall pick up on two or three other key points raised in the debate. On health funding, there has been an amazing and important announcement from the Government in the past couple of weeks. There has been excellent news for health planning for my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1249" name="Phyllis Starkey">the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase>, taking into account projected population growth to meet both capital and revenue funding needs. That is an important step forward to ensure that our communities see that the infrastructure&mdash;health infrastructure in this case&mdash;is there to match the population growth that goes with housing and jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.5/4">The subject of the environment was highlighted, particularly by the hon. Member for Aylesbury. Let me be clear about that: there was extensive environmental assessment throughout the planning process. Indeed, it was a key feature of the process that I hurriedly sketched out a moment or two ago. The original studies that informed the strategy considered the possible impact of growth on the environment, and a sustainability appraisal was prepared alongside the development of the draft strategy. The five-week period of public examination in March and April last year considered possible impacts on the environment. Crucially, we are committed to protecting our countryside and green spaces. We looked at brownfield sites before greenfield sites and we examined how good design&mdash;an important point raised by one of my hon. Friends&mdash;and higher densities could reduce the land take of any growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.5/5">We have already met our target of building 60 per cent. of additional or new housing on previously developed land, and densities are increasing in the south-east. It is important to point out that we have added 19,000 hectares of green belt since 1997 in Great Britain: that is a huge contribution. There are some green-belt reviews proposed in Bedfordshire&mdash;that is recognised&mdash;but if any green belt is lost, an equivalent area of green belt will be required to replace that loss. That is an important part of not allowing the markets to rule, but having a planned approach that delivers what our local communities want.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.5/6">The hon. Gentleman also described concerns about whether it was fanciful to say that the developer contributions would arrive. The newly created delivery vehicles, such as those operating in Milton Keynes, are working on a more strategic approach to securing section 106 contributions. They are a key element of the planning process, ensuring that we capture from developers and from increases in the value of land opportunities to provide infrastructure. That will be developed in Milton Keynes through a long-term framework. Developers are actively participating in discussions, recognising the benefits of long-term certainty. We look forward to Milton Keynes and other areas realising the benefits of enhanced section 106 contributions towards infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.5/7">I realise that I have not been able to address all the points that hon. Members have raised. We are particularly keen to build sustainable communities. Our aim is not solely housing growth: we shall not repeat the mistakes of the 1960s, or ignore the problems of the 1980s. Our approach will build housing for the sons and daughters of our communities who need somewhere affordable to live, with education, health, and transport infrastructure provided alongside a planned approach to protect and preserve the environment. I believe that that is the best way forward.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.128.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1324" speakername="Roger Williams" colnum="128"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h04.htm#50223h04_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.128.1/1">I am very pleased that we have the opportunity today, albeit in a short debate, to discuss the important issue of forestry. I thank the Minister for attending and contributing to the debate. In terms of land use, forestry is probably second only to agriculture. This debate is important and timely given the current Forestry Commission consultation, the quinquennial review of Forest Enterprise and other political parties' proposals to alter the structure of our national forests and how their governing bodies operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.1/2">Forestry has always been important to the UK. When the defence of the realm was dependent on the construction of ships of oak, timber was at a premium and there was always a concern that there was not enough of good enough quality with which to build those ships. It was said at that time that the final contribution that retired admirals could make was to go round with bags of acorns and plant them in the hope that they would grow into trees of the size and quality necessary to build ships. In the first world war, it was regarded strategically that we did not have enough timber to produce pit props and as such the coal production that was necessary for the war effort was being curtailed.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.1/3">Things have moved on, but forestry is still important. There has been a considerable amount of political upheaval and change and some financial difficulties for the forest industry lately. I welcome the devolution of responsibility to the nations, but even with that we still trade across the borders. One of the most important saw-mills in my constituency&mdash;BSW Timber in Newbridge&mdash;sources its timber not only from Wales but from throughout the south of England. The policies that the Forestry Commission and Forest Enterprise are operating in England are important for the devolved authorities, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.1/4">Forestry is also an important industry for my constituents, a number of whom are timber producers in the sense that they own forests and woodland, and for those who are involved in extracting and processing timber from those forests. I have, from time to time, heard complaints locally that Forest Enterprise does not operate its business in a way that helps those small businesses on which the rural communities are so dependent. Some of the complaints have been about contracts being offered in very large amounts of more than 5,000 tonnes, which the smaller gangs find it difficult to cope with and which brings in the multinational companies with their more industrialised type of harvesting. Such harvesting may bear down on costs per tonne, but it does not necessarily lead to better quality logs being presented for processing. Some of the smaller saw-mills say that timber is coming to them in a worse condition now than for many years. I will talk more generally about Forest Enterprise in a minute or two.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that one reason why this is such an important issue in our shared county of Powys is that much of the local economy depends on small and medium-sized businesses, which are disproportionately affected when the large companies come in and effectively squeeze them out of the forestry business?</p>

	<p pid="a.129.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for making those comments, and I associate myself with them. It is sometimes said that Wales is the most efficient spruce factory in the world, as growing conditions are very good. The small companies and businesses in the timber business are very important to supporting the rural communities in England and Wales that they serve.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/2">A great feature that has affected not only Forest Enterprise and the state forest but private timber-growers has been the collapse of commodity prices in recent years. Some of the best logs at roadside would have reached perhaps &pound;55 a cubic metre in the past, but are now selling at roughly &pound;33 a cubic metre. The private and public sectors have had to take account of the reduction in commodity prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/3">I welcome the fact that a number of the Baltic nations have realised the recklessness of their activity in the world market, and want to go up a quality and not just compete on price. They are looking again at their trading relationship with Britain and considering whether it can be put on a more commercial basis, instead of their dumping timber in this country at very low prices. I am concerned at some reports from Russia about forests not being managed sustainably. There are reports that certain harvesting has taken place to release cash for people who have come back into land after the fall of communism. Some people have come into private ownership but have no traditional skills in forestry management, and as such have seen the harvesting as a cash benefit. The Government should take countenance of that, and ensure that the timber coming into this country has been produced from sustainable sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/4">Given that background, it has been difficult for the Forestry Commission and Forest Enterprise to balance the social and environmental side of their remit with the obvious need for economic viability. I have some sympathy with them; that is not an easy balancing act. I commend much of the work that has gone into producing the public goods&mdash;that is, the work that has gone into access, recreation and conservation issues. In light of the recent pronouncement of the Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality on the use of mechanically driven vehicles on public footpaths and rights of way, perhaps forest land could be a suitable place for those more intrusive types of recreation.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/5">It is important to note that although current timber prices have hampered both public and private forestry, the UK timber industry comprises producers and processors employing nearly 30,000 people. It is estimated that &pound;2 billion will be invested in saw-mills and paper and board-mills in the next 15 years, and that will add to that employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/6">Investment is taking place in my constituency, and the firm involved informs me that it really values the presence of Forest Enterprise, as it guarantees a flow of product into its saw-mills. A number of people question the way in which Forest Enterprise is managed, and I have no doubt that suggestions will have been made. Some have suggested to me that Forest Enterprise should be privatised, and could be run better by private individuals or companies. When the UK Forest Products Association met recently, it certainly reinforced the view that Forest Enterprise plays a valued role in providing continuity of supply of commodity and therefore enables saw-mills and other processors to plan their investment on the basis that they have assured throughput. That is the conclusion that I have come to, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/7">The social and environmental benefits of forests are clear. Research carried out for the Woodland Trust in its report, &quot;Making Woodland Count: its Contribution to our Quality of Life&quot;, shows that forest areas meet 11 of the 15 Government headline quality-of-life indicators for sustainable development. They provide opportunities for recreation, wildlife and physical activity, which are so important to making our young people fit and healthy.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/8">It is also important to consider UK forestry in economic terms. It is right that the Forestry Commission is partially funded through the sale of timber from public forests. However, it is important that Forest Enterprise takes into account the effect that its sales will have on the market price for domestic timber producers. Given the already depressed state of timber markets, it is vital that the market price is not adversely affected by sales from Forest Enterprise that are designed to balance its own books. It is important that efficiency is not confused with the over-simplistic goal of turning a short-term profit or short-term cash flow. The criticism has been put to me that Forest Enterprise has been going into stands that are not mature&mdash;not ready for felling&mdash;and as a result producing timber of not very good quality, which further depresses the commodity price.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/9">The Forestry Commission has recently increased its emphasis and spending on non-core business activities while neglecting, some would say, its core business of timber production. It must consider commercial timber production as a key element, because we will not be able to finance the public goods unless the core business is profitable. The situation that I have described is down to the direction of Government. I support the intentions of the policy, but its implementation has sometimes been counter-productive. It is vital that a real commitment remains to supporting domestic commercial forestry, as that is the surest way of achieving the social and environmental aims of the Forestry Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/10">I welcome the proposals to reform the powers of the Forestry Commission. The strengthening of ties with the private and voluntary sectors is vital for the health of the industry. That will allow for the provision of public goods, rather than leaving the fate of the industry to depressed timber prices. The issue of restocking orders is also important for sustainable practice. I draw the Minister's attention to the excellent work carried out in that regard by the Welsh Minister for Rural Development in 2003. He made the important point that the quality of restocking should be considered with particular emphasis on the expansion of ancient woodland, especially in areas where that would have a direct effect on local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/11">Having said that, I have heard criticisms about the proposals to have at least 50 per cent. of land in continuous cover&mdash;that is, people do not go in and clear-fell but have trees of different age groups in a plantation. This issue is of great importance. We believe that rushing into that will have a deleterious effect on the quantity of timber produced and the continuity of supply, so we would like it to be considered again.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/12">In the few minutes remaining to me, I shall outline the Liberal Democrat proposals for the future of Government involvement in forestry in the UK. That can have only limited scope in the recommendations for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. First, it is vital that a viable and sustainable public forestry service is maintained. That not only preserves the valuable public assets of woodlands and forests but benefits the industry as a whole&mdash;processors and saw-mills. The role of the service should encompass acting as a facilitator to private forest concerns through the grants system operated by the Forestry Commission and through the responsible activities of Forest Enterprise. Short-term losses should not lead to panic decision making; rather, it is through considered strategic thinking that the Forestry Commission will best serve the needs of the industry and the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/13">Timber growing and processing is vital to the economy of the UK, but it is also important for communities and the environment. Competitiveness is compatible with sustainability, and the Government should be playing their part in ensuring that the forestry in this country achieves that.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1324" name="Roger Williams">the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> on securing this debate. We do not often have debates on forestry or the Forestry Commission, and I hope that I can address some of the points that he raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/2">In the hon. Gentleman's opening remarks, he touched on the history of the Forestry Commission and how it developed originally from a wartime need over many centuries to provide wood for our ships. When the commission was established in 1919, the commissioners were charged with the general duty of promoting the interests of forestry, the development of afforestation and the production and supply of timber. Later, a general duty of promoting the establishment and management in Great Britain of adequate reserves of growing trees was added to the commissioners' duties.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/3">In 1967, the Forestry Act consolidated previous legislation and is the basis of the Forestry Commission's activities today. It was not until only 20 years ago that the commissioners were required to achieve a reasonable balance between the creation of new forests, the management of existing forests, the production and supply of timber and, most importantly, the conservation and enhancement of natural beauty and the conservation of our natural environment. After more than 60 years of focus on timber supply, the commission had a duty to change, which it has embraced with ever-increasing enthusiasm. Today, the Forestry Commission, in both organisational and activity terms, is unrecognisable from what it was only 20 years ago. I know that some people are still trying to catch up with the dramatic change that has been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/4">The woodland resource created in the last century now has the capacity through enlightened management to deliver a wide range of social, economic and environmental benefits and make a positive contribution to sustainable development. The pace of change has increased, and today forestry is a devolved issue, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned. The Forestry Commission is responsible separately to Ministers in England, Scotland and Wales, and collectively on Great British functions. The current structure of the commission reflects those changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/5">Much of the commission's work is with private woodland owners, to whom it provides grants and advice, but a significant part of its work is delivered by the commission's Forest Enterprise agency. More than three quarters of the commission's staff based in England work for Forest Enterprise, and the agency is the manager or steward of the national forest estate. It is a unique national asset. Its current range of activities vividly illustrates how much it has evolved, and I will give some examples of how it has developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/6">The agency is England's largest provider of countryside recreational opportunities. It offers a vast range of activities, from open access for walkers and cyclists on all its freehold land to activities such as horse riding and motor rallying in selected woodlands. Forest Enterprise manages more than 100 self-catering cabins in woodland sites, which make a significant contribution to local economies. In 17 campsites across England, it provides nearly 5,000 pitches, generating additional income of more than &pound;2  million a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/7">The cabins at Keldy in the north york moors have recently received a major facelift in Forest Enterprise's largest ever investment in recreation. Some 62 superb new cabins are equipped to top-quality self-catering standards and built from sustainably produced timber, over half of which was grown in the UK. They will provide an additional 50,000 bed nights each year, as well as contributing &pound;1.5  million to the local economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/8">The business overall is profitable. In 2002&ndash;03, it showed a net surplus of nearly &pound;800,000 and earned a real rate of return on capital invested of 8.5  per  cent. In 2003&ndash;04, the surplus rose to &pound;1.3  million. The commission is now developing a public-private partnership that will ensure that the returns on the investment can be sustained at no cost to the taxpayer. However, it is not only in fields of recreation and leisure that Forest Enterprise has been playing a leading role. The public forest estate has been independently certified for sustainable timber production. Indeed, it was the first state forest service anywhere in the world to have its operations certified in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/9">Enhancing biodiversity has equal importance to timber production. Great efforts are being made to improve the ancient woodland on the estate and to bring all 41,000 hectares of sites of special scientific interest on the public forest estate into favourable condition. That was the point that the hon. Gentleman was making about clear-felling. Clearly, different management systems are now required to meet the aims and obligations. In England, clear-felling and continuous forestry systems have their place, but they should be site-specific. The precise choice is for the managers in the region, taking account of the relevant environment gains and standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/10">The process of dedicating the whole of the freehold national forest estate to public access under the provisions in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 is under way, and will be completed next year. That will help to ensure that public access will continue to be available in perpetuity. However, it is not just in our countryside that the Commission's expertise is providing real benefits. It has also been very active in delivering social, environmental and economic benefits for our towns and cities. It is at the forefront of work to restore former industrial land, and to create a green infrastructure for future developments.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/11">There have been good examples of this new role in three of the 12 community forests. In Thames Chase to the east of London, in the Red Rose forest near Manchester and in the Mersey forest, a &pound;9 million Treasury-funded capital modernisation fund project has enabled Forest Enterprise to create 1,300 hectares of new woodland. Forest Enterprise has bought land, planted trees and created footpaths through the new woodland. Local people have enthusiastically played their part, helping to design and develop the new woodland. There are many more similar projects right across England.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/12">If the commission is to continue to be an effective delivery body, it needs to operate within clearly defined policy frameworks. In our rural strategy, published last year, we made a commitment to transfer responsibility for strategic forestry policy in England to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and that has now been done. That is allowing the Forestry Commission to broaden its responsibilities as the lead delivery body for forestry; that includes taking on responsibility for community forestry and the farm woodland premium scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/13">The new forestry policy unit in DEFRA will act as an advocate for forestry in Government, contributing to all the cross-cutting policies in which forestry does, or could, play a part. One of the first tasks of the policy unit will be to undertake a review of the England forestry strategy that we published in 1998. The strategy set out a five to 10-year vision of our priorities and programmes for forestry and has been a very successful framework for support for forestry in England. However, with the changing policy and delivery landscape, now is an ideal time to refresh the strategy. The new forestry policy unit and the commission will work closely with each other.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/14">We are not, however, looking at forestry in isolation. One of the key elements of the draft Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill, published two weeks ago, is the establishment of an integrated agency to help protect and improve our natural resources. The commission will become a close working partner of the new agency, ensuring that there is a comprehensive and coherent approach to land management, whether woodland or not. That alignment of the Forestry Commission will build on the success of partnerships that the commission has established with English Nature, the Countryside Agency and the rural development service.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/15">The Forestry Commission provides grant support for the management of existing woodlands and the creation of new woodlands through the woodland grant scheme. Owing to exceptional demand the commission closed the scheme to new applicants in June last year, and an additional &pound;3 million of funding for the current year was announced last October on top of the &pound;18.5 million already in place. The success of the scheme means that more than 24,000 hectares of new woodland was established between April 2000 and March 2004. The Forestry Commission is well on the road to meeting the England rural development programme target of 30,000 hectares of new woodland in the seven-year period ending in 2006. The replacement England woodland grant scheme is expected to open for applications in July and will provide a framework for the delivery of public benefits through incentives for the stewardship of existing woodland and the creation of new woodland.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/16">The hon. Gentleman made a couple of points about timber markets and imports, and it has been suggested that Forestry Commission timber production is depressing the timber market for private growers. The Forestry Commission regularly publishes production forecasts and details of its planned production. That assured supply has been one reason for continued investment in the UK processing sector. One of the hon. Gentleman's points was that that supply is seen by many producers, particularly processors, as the basis for their investment and future investment. About 85 per cent. of the UK's wood supply comes from imports. Timber from UK sources has to remain competitive with those imports, which could easily increase. That means that the world market, and not the level of Forestry Commission production, sets prices for UK-grown timber.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/17">By their very nature, the economics of forestry arouse a great interest in many people. It is a complex area in terms of assessing the relative costs and benefits, which are often interdependent. That is the nature of multi-purpose forestry&mdash;action taken to implement one objective frequently delivers benefits for many objectives. They are complex matters that I cannot do justice to in this debate. In April 2003, an economic analysis of forestry policy was commissioned by DEFRA and the Treasury. I will arrange for a copy of the final report to be sent to the hon. Gentleman and for copies to be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/18">We have a sustainable procurement policy supported by the UK Timber Trade Federation, which implements a responsible purchasing policy through its members. I am pleased to note that all Forestry Commission woods are certified together with an increasing number of owners' woodlands. We estimate that more than 70 per cent. of all wood produced from UK forests is now certified, and 50 per cent. of the output from UK saw-mills is also certified. That independently verified assurance of their sustainable management provides a real advantage in the competitive marketplace.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.0/1">I thank the Minister for the points that he is making. However, it is sometimes said to me by timber growers that certification is an expense: it produces public goods but little economic benefit for the timber producer, because people pay nothing more for it. As there is a public good, would the Government consider subsidising or paying for certification of private woodlands?</p>

	<p pid="a.134.1/1">As the hon. Gentleman knows, there are various farm assurance schemes for agriculture, which are in the interests of the producer. The Government do not subsidise farm assurance schemes, and I cannot see their subsidising timber production at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/2">The hon. Gentleman raised a good point about the size of contracts for felling and clearing timber. I know that the issue is being examined, and I will bring his comments to the attention of the chief executive to see whether we can make further improvement and make smaller contracts available for smaller, local businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/3">The Forestry Commission has a long and varied history, throughout which it has demonstrated that it delivers the policy priorities of the day. As the needs of society have changed, so has the role and structure of the Forestry Commission. As we enter an exciting period for delivery of rural policy, with the publication of the draft Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill, I am sure that the Forestry Commission will continue to adapt to the changing demands placed on it, and I am equally sure that it will continue to deliver good value for our country.</p>

	International Criminal Tribunal (Former Yugoslavia)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.136.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1088" speakername="Alice Mahon" colnum="136"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h05.htm#50223h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.136.1/1">I asked for this debate for three main reasons. When the tribunal was established, I was firmly of the view that it would not heal wounds or bring people together. On the contrary, I thought that it would drive communities in the former Yugoslavia further apart, that it would be conducted on a low threshold of evidence and that it would pit neighbour against neighbour.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/2">I have travelled extensively in the former Yugoslavia, before the various wars and since. I took a great interest in the truth and reconciliation commission established in South Africa. My second reason for securing the debate is that it seems to me that after something as vile and vicious as apartheid, or as vicious as a civil war, such a commission is more likely to succeed than a criminal tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/3">My third reason for asking for the debate is that it is time to draw a line under the tribunal at The Hague and allow individual countries to arrest, charge and punish their citizens if they believe that they have committed crimes against the community. I notice that the occupying coalition in Iraq, led by the United States, has decided to allow the Iraqi people to try Saddam Hussein and his former Government; there are to be no charges against the warlords and no tribunals in Afghanistan. Yugoslavia seems to be singled out for this kind of treatment, and one must ask why. The United States was one of the main countries to set up the tribunal, and it gives the tribunal money, yet it refuses to sign up to the International Criminal Court. So a lot of double standards hang around the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/4">I have followed the tribunal at The Hague very closely. It is my belief that it delivers a biased system of justice and that the decisions taken by the chief prosecutor are largely based on the nationality of the accused, rather than on what evidence there is against them. In short, the tribunal has turned out as I said it would: it is a victors' court, set up mainly to punish one nationality&mdash;the Serbs.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/5">A few years ago, I visited the tribunal with Mark Littman QC, a Serbian colleague who opposed, as I did, the illegal bombing of Yugoslavia. I am pleased to say that we were granted an interview with Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor. We were able to raise some of our concerns about how the indictments had been issued and why there was such emphasis on the Serbs. After all, there had been a civil war in Yugoslavia. When I went to The Hague, I had just returned from Croatia, where I had been looking at the plight of Serb returnees. We were shown mass graves there. In Operation Storm, there had been a lot of fighting; the Croatian army had driven out about 200,000 Serbs, and that was the first mass ethnic cleansing of the various wars. I was very up to date on what had gone on there, and I raised the issue of the mass graves with the prosecutor. We took photographs that matched up with the people who were missing. Carla del Ponte was not interested and said that she was short of resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/6">I also raised the issue of Nasser Oric. With another organisation&mdash;not the NATO Parliamentary Assembly&mdash;I went to the siege of Sarajevo and visited not only the Muslim areas but some of the predominantly Serb villages. All the evidence there was about Oric and his raiding band, and how they had killed lots of people. He was, by any standards, a war criminal and there were videotapes and lots of evidence. Members of this House who went to the same area also know that. The chief prosecutor said that she had no plans to indict him and would not discuss the issue. However, she admitted that the whereabouts of that man were known. Only now, in the face of overwhelming protests and as a result of people putting evidence forward, has he been arrested. He has now been sent for trial at The Hague, but until then he had led rather a pleasant life. I think that there were double standards operating in that case.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/7">In the same year I visited Banja Luka with the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. I was chair of the sub-committee at that time. We talked to many people and, in particular, to a policeman who worked for the chief prosecutor at The Hague. Interestingly, the policeman came from Preston, in the north of England, not very far from where I live. When he was questioned closely he told us that he had instructions to go after Serb war criminals only. Moreover, on the wall of the office of the prosecutor at The Hague&mdash;she is supposed to be impartial and to look for war criminals from every ethnic group in the former Yugoslavia&mdash;there was a big cartoon showing Serb criminals wanted for war crimes. Those war criminals probably do need to end up in The Hague, or being tried in their own country, but it seemed to us that the prosecutor showed an overwhelming bias.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/8">We asked about the crimes of one or two of the Kosovo Albanians&mdash;Hashim Thaci, Agim Ceku and Ramush Haradinaj, who is now the Prime Minister of Kosovo&mdash;but no indictments have been published for them. Everyone agrees that those people took part in some very unpleasant practices during the bombing of Yugoslavia; newspaper articles are written about it, and no one bothers to deny it.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/9">The Croatian general, Gotovina, has recently made it known that he has no intention of surrendering himself to the tribunal at The Hague, although he is willing to appear in Zagreb and be questioned by the tribunal. It is clear that there are laws for some participants in the civil war and not for others. Let us imagine the outcry if Belgrade had hung on for so long to a war criminal or an indicted person who was living openly in Belgrade or one of the other cities. Let us imagine what would have been said in a case similar to that of the general.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/10">The more closely one examines the decisions taken by the chief prosecutor and the conduct of the hearings at the tribunal, the more it becomes clear that the tribunal is not a triumph for law and justice. It is a court founded by the west, funded largely by the west, and staffed at very senior levels by the west.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/11">Many senior professors of law and others take the same view as me; I shall quote only one of them because I have so much material from people who share my view. Robert M. Hayden, from the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars, in the United States, commented, in relation to the tribunals, on the</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/12" class="indent">&quot;failure of the ICTY Prosecutor to indict NATO leaders for the use of cluster bombs. This prosecutorial standard was set in July 1995, when Milan Martic, president of the self-proclaimed Serb Republic in Croatia, was indicted for violations of the laws and customs of war on the grounds that he had ordered the May 1995 missile attack on Zagreb.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/13">He continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/14" class="indent">&quot;According to the indictment, what made the bombardment a war crime was that the missiles had been fitted with cluster warheads. Seven civilians were killed and many more wounded, and damage was done to a home for the aged and to a children's hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/15" class="indent">Why, then, have there been no indictments of NATO's May 7 attack on the city of Nis, where cluster bombs fell on the market, killing fifteen people, and hitting also the city's main hospital? It is not acceptable to say that NATO was only aiming at military targets and missed; after all, Martic maintained that he was aiming at military targets in Zagreb . . . While the Prosecutor says that Martic targeted cities intentionally, this is also true of NATO generals, especially the American ones, who were even complaining that French politicians did not permit them to attack more sites in Yugoslav cities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/16">I stood on the last bridge over the Danube&mdash;the railway bridge&mdash;at Novi Sad the night before it was bombed by NATO. That was a civilian target, because the bridges bring water supplies and other things across to the other half of the city. There was no doubt that that was deliberately targeted by NATO&mdash;it took out all the bridges. I visited the Crvena Zastava car and tractor factory and spoke to the workers just a few days after they had been bombed. That civilian target was hit by 21 cruise missiles. Many people were injured and I have photographs in which there is blood on the floor from the sit-in. The workers did not want to be bombed and they sent their stated position to every country in NATO. I do not know how they survived&mdash;people were only injured and not dead&mdash;because it was such a complete mess after the bombardment. From my hotel bedroom window I watched NATO bomb the oil refinery at Pancevo. I visited people who were grieving for colleagues who died. There are no charges against NATO for any of these offences. NATO took action that did not have the approval of the United Nations.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/17">In late 1999 the tribunal prosecutor said that she was investigating NATO's conduct during the Kosovo war, including the question of the use of cluster bombs, but within days she produced a preliminary document that to my knowledge has never been published&mdash;and I have been trying to get hold of it. There was a press release, of which Robert M. Hayden said:</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/18" class="indent">&quot;The prosecutor had said that if the report indicated that NATO broke the Geneva conventions she would indict those responsible; however, four days later she issued a press release stating that NATO is 'not under investigation by the Office of the Prosecutor . . . There is no formal inquiry into the actions of NATO during the conflict.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/19">It was never going to happen. Carla del Ponte, like her predecessor the Canadian, Louise Arbour, is a creature of NATO. Just listen to what Jamie Shea, the official press officer, said in answer to a question about NATO's liability for war crimes before the court at The Hague:</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/20" class="indent">&quot;NATO is the friend of the Tribunal. NATO countries are those that have provided the finances to set up the Tribunal, we are among the majority financiers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/21">The ICTY was set up to try to convict Serbs. Serbs resisted the western Governments who had taken sides.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.0/1">Does the hon. Lady agree that whatever the motives for setting up the tribunal, it is now perceived in the region&mdash;particularly in Serbia&mdash;as more of a hindrance to advancing democracy, because of the feeling of victimisation?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.139.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1088" speakername="Alice Mahon" colnum="139"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h05.htm#50223h05_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.139.1/1">I certainly do agree with that, and I will be coming to that. The decision was taken that the Serbs had to be punished collectively and that a veneer of legality would be provided by&mdash;in my view&mdash;an incompetent tribunal, not one where justice is handed out freely and fairly. If the people in South Africa, Iraq and Afghanistan can try their own people, why cannot the people of the former Yugoslavia do exactly the same?</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/2">I turn briefly to the ongoing trial of Mr. Milosevic, and note that paragraph 58  of the newly produced Foreign Affairs Committee report on the western Balkans says:</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/3" class="indent">&quot;we also heard that the badly run Milosevic trial permitted the former leader to present himself as a martyr for Serbia.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/4">Whether he does that or not, I agree with the comments about the trial being badly run; anybody who follows those events will be horrified.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/5">Mr. Milosevic wants to conduct his own trial. The right for somebody to conduct their own defence is a basic right in all our national systems, it is identified as a basic human right in most international conventions and it is explicitly granted in the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. There is a precedent for imposing legal counsel when people are so violent that they would disrupt proceedings. However, there is no precedent for imposing legal counsel for ill health. Mr. Stephen Kay, the British lawyer, has tried to get himself dismissed, but has now been imposed by the court. The whole matter has developed into a farce.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/6">Mr. Milosevic, who has been preparing his case for almost two years, will not co-operate with Mr. Kay. Most witnesses refuse to co-operate with what they regard as a fraudulent process. However, Mr. Stephen Kay, despite voicing misgivings about conducting a case against a client's will, has accepted a position of imposed counsel. Mr. Milosevic has been preparing his case with the help of two legal advisers. He has now seen the whole case handed over to a British lawyer who was not involved in the preparation. The timetable is tight. It was an unlimited timetable for the prosecution, but not for the defence. What kind of justice can anyone expect when such legal chicanery is allowed in a court to which we have put our name?</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/7">The agony for the Serbs is continuing. I have looked briefly at today's Foreign Affairs Committee report. On page 27, under the heading of &quot;Co-operation with The Hague Tribunal&quot;, it refers to criticism once again of the Government of Serbia. I desperately want the whole region to be regenerated. I want a good, safe democratic future for all the people who live in the former Yugoslavia. The tribunal in The Hague is a festering sore at the heart of Yugoslavia. It is preventing any progress from being made for all its people.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/8">I wish to quote Professor Jianming Shen at St. John's university in Canada. He argues that the tribunal system</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/9" class="indent">&quot;is a lopsided one. Whom to indict, when to indict, and what evidence to collect and use, are all under the control of one single individual&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/10">in my view, a very incompetent and biased individual&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/11" class="indent">&quot;and there is no checking and review mechanism except for the judges of the chambers of the Tribunal who in theory may reject a prosecution.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/12">He concludes that the tribunal should not be placed in the hands of one prosecutor and goes on to suggest ways in which that could be overcome. I want a complete end to this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/13">The cost of administering the tribunal is absolutely staggering. The 2004&ndash;05 budget was nearly $300 million. For incompetence and bias, the countries in the west are paying out such money. Let us just consider how much better that money could be spent regenerating the area. It should go into Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia and Kosovo, where people have been without electricity in some of the Serb villages for a couple of months. People are still being murdered there. It still has a war criminal that the tribunal refuses to indict. Much better use could have been made of the money. It could have rebuilt the bridges over the Danube that were destroyed deliberately. It could rebuild some of the hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/14">I spent the weekend in Brussels with the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. I was surprised and a little shocked when, on receiving a report on Afghanistan, senior NATO politicians and members of the military, discussing the warlords, the poppy trade and opium, said that, for the good of Afghanistan, there must be no trials, but that they must bring in the warlords. They said that those people had committed mass murders and killed thousands, and that they must be brought into the civic and political process. The double standards when applied to Serbia and Montenegro are absolutely breathtaking.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/15">The tribunal should be abolished and then all the people of Yugoslavia could start to heal the wounds that separate them. The children are now being punished. The next generation will have to bear the guilt. Let us ensure that the children&mdash;the young people&mdash;can take their place in the heart of Europe where they belong.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1088" name="Alice Mahon">the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon)</phrase> on securing the debate and on raising this important subject today.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/2">This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Dayton accords and the end of the bloodiest conflict in the former Yugoslav Federation. We should remember that in the past 10 years so much has changed for the better. Free and fair elections have been held throughout the region, large-scale conflict no longer threatens and the European Union and other international partners are united in working with the region to maintain stability and create prosperity. The dark days of the early 1990s thankfully now seem a distant memory.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/3">However, a shadow remains and will do so as long as the truth is suppressed and denied. It is cast by the war crimes committed during the bloody conflicts in the early 1990s and it will not be removed until those responsible for the appalling atrocities committed during the conflict are held to account. That is why the United Kingdom remains a firm supporter of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. We will continue to lend our political, financial and practical support for an efficient tribunal that can deliver effective justice for the thousands of victims who suffered so much during the conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/4">At the same time, we recognise concerns about the operation of the tribunal, in particular its cost, slowness and geographical distance from the victims. Others have alleged, as we have heard today, that it is biased against Serbs. I will seek to address those questions. The tribunal has so far cost United Nations member states some $860 million since its inception in 1993, of which the UK's share is some $54 million. We have taken a close interest in the efficient management of the tribunal and will continue our policy of bearing down on its costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/5">However, we must recognise that international justice is an expensive process. The complexity and nature of the cases before the tribunal make them inherently expensive. Cases arising from three separate conflicts are being prosecuted and indictees often face multiple counts. The Lockerbie trial, by way of comparison, cost UK taxpayers some &pound;60 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.0/1">I hear what the Minister is saying, but will he explain why a similar tribunal has not been set up for Iraq? Why is Saddam Hussein to be tried by his own people?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.141.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/693" speakername="Douglas Alexander" colnum="141"  time="016:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h05.htm#50223h05_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.141.1/1">It is fair to say that the basis on which the actions were taken, the nature of the conflicts and the circumstances of the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and Iraq are fundamentally different. The consequences for the judicial processes that follow on from that conflict reflect the fact that there are very different circumstances in Iraq and Yugoslavia.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.2/1">The Minister will be aware that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/807" name="Ann Clwyd">the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)</phrase>, who is now the special envoy on human rights to Iraq, chaired an organisation, Indict, which collected evidence for years with the express view of having such a tribunal. Now that prospect is gone. Why?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-23a.141.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/693" speakername="Douglas Alexander" colnum="141"  time="016:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050223/halltext/50223h05.htm#50223h05_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.141.3/1">I maintain the position that the Government have advanced: assistance is being rendered to the Iraqi authorities in bringing forward a proper system of judicial authority, which will allow in turn for prosecutions to take place, not least in relation to Saddam Hussein. I return to the substantive point that I am conscious that the issue of Iraq has divided both this Chamber and some within our party. However, it is only common sense to recognise that there are distinctive circumstances at work in the former Yugoslavia and in Iraq, which gave rise to the action that was taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/2">On fugitives from justice, we have made clear our belief that the ICTY should plan its work within the deadlines that it has set out. However, its progress is also clearly subject to factors outside its control, the most important of which is co-operation from states in the region in apprehending fugitive indictees, and providing access to documents and witnesses. The president and prosecutor have both made it clear that lack of such co-operation will affect the tribunal's final closure date. We take that lack of co-operation extremely seriously and will take action to support the tribunal. There can be no closure until all the accused have been brought to The Hague to face trial.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/3">Many of the accused have voluntarily surrendered and pleaded guilty; others have been tried and sentenced. Three individuals stand accused of ordering and orchestrating the most serious crimes: Ratko Mladic, Radovan Karadzic and Ante Gotovina. They remain fugitives from justice. The charges against Mladic and Karadzic include the massacre at Srebrenica where more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were killed in cold blood because, in the views of those who perpetrated the action, they held the wrong religious beliefs. Their refusal to surrender, while others face trial, is shameful.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/4">Even worse is the refusal of the relevant authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro to take all possible steps to secure their arrest. We have welcomed recent transfers of lower-level indictees and provided co-operation at a bureaucratic level, but there remains in the Serb body politic a refusal to face up to the past. That has tragic consequences for the people of Serbia and Montenegro and Bosnia. Their future prosperity is held hostage by a few fugitives and by their elected representatives' refusal to grasp the nettle and accept their international legal and moral obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/5">The authorities in Belgrade and Banja Luka are not alone. Croatia is on the cusp of an historic step: opening accession negotiations with the European Union. As a champion of enlargement, the United Kingdom is committed to helping all the countries of the western Balkans to take their rightful place within Europe, but that cannot be at the expense of political conditionality. All countries, including our own, are under an obligation to co-operate fully with the tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/6">Since gaining candidate status last June, the Croatian authorities have failed to satisfy the chief prosecutor that they are doing everything they possibly can to locate and apprehend the fugitive general, Ante Gotovina. The European Council conclusions in December 2004 made it clear that accession negotiations could begin only when the authorities were co-operating fully with The Hague. However, the Croatian Government seem unwilling to meet their obligations. Instead they indulge in cosmetic measures and public relations campaigns in the hope that negotiations will begin anyway. We continue to make it clear that they need to take action now to enable negotiations to begin in March. The importance of conditionality policy and the tribunal is not just about Gotovina, Karadzic or Mladic; it is about the rule of law, about European norms of behaviour and about these countries' willingness to confront the past in order to be able to face the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/7">The tribunal has brought a sense of justice to many thousands of victims across the region, guaranteeing that their suffering is acknowledged and not ignored. More than 3,500 witnesses have had the chance to tell their stories while testifying in court. For many, though not all, that has helped the process of personal closure. As we heard in the debate, the tribunal has been criticised by some for concentrating more on one ethnic group&mdash;the Bosnian Serbs&mdash;than any other. However, it is important to remember that the indictments are against individuals, not groups. The emphasis on individual responsibility dispels any notion of collective punishment of the Serbs as a group, as has been suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/8">The tribunal's influence will continue after its closure. It will have left an historic record of the atrocities and of jurisprudence. It is not possible for the tribunal to hear every case against every individual, but its experience will be an invaluable resource for the regional courts, such as the special war crimes chamber of the Bosnian state court, which will continue to prosecute suspected war criminals. Together with its sister tribunal, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, it will leave a legacy of ground-breaking case law, which is already proving an important resource for the newly established International Criminal Court.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/9">The international community has learned valuable lessons from the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. They are likely to be the last tribunals of their kind. More recent tribunals, such as the special court for Sierra Leone, are smaller and more tightly focused in terms of the number of indictees and counts, which makes for a much shorter lifespan and much lower costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/10">For the future, the United Kingdom will work together with like-minded partners for the widest possible jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court so that we can ensure that there is no impunity for those who commit the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and crimes against humanity. The court, which the UK regards as a milestone in the development of international justice, was founded in part to avoid the need to set up such ad hoc tribunals as that in Yugoslavia. We believe that over time the permanent court will develop into a powerful deterrent against would-be perpetrators of the most heinous crimes, which it is the shared responsibility of the international community to punish.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/11" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/12" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at twenty-nine minutes past Four o'clock.</p>
