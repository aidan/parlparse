	<p pid="a.202.0/1">I apologise that, due to other commitments, I must leave the Committee early. Having set up the Krebs commission when I was a Minister, I can tell the Committee that the intention of the last Conservative Government was that the Krebs report should identify radical change to deal with this matter. That was eight years ago.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-06a.204.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" speakername="Geoffrey Cox" colnum="204"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051206/halltext/51206h01.htm#51206h01_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.204.1/1">I could not agree with my hon. Friend more. It is obviously vital that all instruments and tools available to us should be examined and expanded. I understand that the recent figures show that one in seven badgers from the road traffic accident testing were infected. Plainly we need to look at those tests much more carefully and expand the testing if possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/2">On the strength of the Krebs trials, which the chairman of the Independent Scientific Group on cattle TB described as &quot;of limited application&quot;, there has until recently been no development of a coherent and comprehensive strategy for the reduction and elimination of the disease that includes the vital wildlife factor. It is not surprising that events are reaching the pass that the statistics are showing.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/3">Yet I do not want to paint a wholly gloomy picture. For on to this dark horizon, there came a ray of light. It seemed as if at last, for the Government and the Minister, the reality, although long obscured, had begun to dawn. There was the Government's strategic framework for the sustainable control of bovine tuberculosis. Many deride that document, regarding it as something that, after eight long years, is full of pious sentiments promising little in the way of immediate action. However, in the spirit that I intend to adopt for the purposes of this debate of trying to credit constructive action where credit is due, I do not think that all the criticisms are necessarily merited.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/4">Having spent the last eight years in the pursuit of sound science based on the random badger culling trials, the framework acknowledges, just as Professor Godfray had warned over 18 months before:</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/5" class="indent">&quot;In this area, scientific results are always likely to be subject to debate and variable interpretation.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/6" class="indent">Decisions may have to be made taking account of scientific uncertainty. In considering the evidence on badger controls, we will, as well as assessing the scientific merits of options, need to focus on costs, practicality of delivery, conservation implications, and take in to account wider public opinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/7" class="indent">Partnership was essential to an effective strategy. There was to be an annual conference of stakeholders. A new national advisory body and a regionally tailored approach according to disease incidence and risk. Thus where there were areas of grave and intense infection, different measures might be called for.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/8" class="indent">There was to be an overall approach to the problem. Piecemeal solutions were to be rejected in favour of a combination of measures to tackle the disease that would encompass pre-movement testing, animal husbandry and measures to reduce the incidence of bTB in wildlife&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/9">I do not believe that anybody could seriously object to any of the sentiments outlined in the framework document. Partnership: yes. We can also say yes to an overall, comprehensive approach that deals with both cattle and wildlife transmission. We can also say yes to a regionally tailored approach designed to target those areas where the infection is at its most intense, because in those areas there will be one risk assessment and in the areas that are relatively or entirely clean, the risk assessment will be different. That makes sense, and I understand it.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/10">I also understand the other sentiments in the document, which states:</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/11" class="indent">&quot;How we tackle the threat from the wildlife reservoir, particularly badgers, is difficult to resolve scientifically.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/12">It has taken the Government eight years to arrive at the conclusion that the science will not prove anything and that we shall have to proceed on the basis of scientific uncertainty. I applaud them if they have genuinely recognised that we shall have to use the best available evidence and assess risks in different areas, knowing that we cannot foresee the precise effects of the treatment that we prescribe in a particular area. As the document says,</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/13" class="indent">&quot;Scientific certainty and consensus are not always achievable. We need to find the means of interpreting science when there is conflicting advice.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/14">I have to tell the Minister that it is his job to make such judgments. As the document says:</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/15" class="indent">&quot;Sometimes decisions need to be made on the basis of the best available scientific evidence and in the light of outstanding uncertainty.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/16">The document then adds:</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/17" class="indent">&quot;It is important not to exclude the possibility of continuing to seek to control bTB through cattle based measures alone . . . In the case of bTB around 24,000 cattle are slaughtered each year to help control the disease, causing hardship to farmers and economic costs to Government and industry. We would not expect a limited/localised badger culling policy to be popular across the whole of society&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/18">Finally, the document spoke of equity:</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/19" class="indent">&quot;Government must ensure that costs of controls are fairly distributed amongst beneficiaries. This is particularly sensitive given the existence of a wildlife reservoir of disease that is not currently controlled by Government (due to the uncertainty of the evidence) and that farmers are not permitted to control themselves.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/20">In other words, the strategic document contained the clearest concession that there is an issue of equity and of basic, fundamental fairness in expecting the farming community to bear not only the cost of the pre-movement tests involved in controlling this disease, but the economic and human costs of being denied the right to defend their property and to protect themselves against a disease that, as the document said,</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/21" class="indent">&quot;farmers are not permitted to control themselves.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/22">There is an issue about allowing this situation to continue and about loading ever more responsibilities on the farmer without tackling the wildlife reservoir of disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/23">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June</phrase>, I attended a meeting with the Minister, along with constituents and representatives of the National Beef Association. The message from that meeting was unmistakable and was consistent with the strategic framework document, which said that it was important not to exclude the possibility of concentrating on cattle transmission alone. The interpretation of all those present was that the Government were moving slowly but ineluctably toward the inevitable conclusion. There was a lively discussion about the means by which a limited and humane cull might be carried out. The constructive engagement of the farming organisation was enlisted.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/24">Then there was the scientific advice that the Government received. Just a few weeks ago, in September, the Scientific Advisory Council offered this cautious recommendation:</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/25" class="indent">&quot;Infection of cattle through cattle-to-cattle transmission and from wildlife reservoirs may occur in parallel. Where this occurs, both routes may need to be addressed for effective control . . . the results of the Irish Four Areas trial are unlikely to be directly and quantitatively applicable to mainland GB but provide strong evidence that in some circumstances proactive culling may provide a substantial contribution to control . . . culling may contribute to an effective control strategy in some heavily infected and geographically distinct and isolated areas, but only when coupled with other control measures.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/26">It explained that the efficacy of culling would depend on local and geographical factors. Those are the very issues with which the national and regional policy sketched out in the strategic framework is concerned; hence the need for regionally tailored policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/27">Finally, we have had consistent assurances from the Minister since the summer&mdash;repeated in this House&mdash;that an announcement could be expected in the autumn. I am willing to call December autumn if he will make his announcement now. Timing does not matter&mdash;as we know, we can suspend it in the House&mdash;so I shall be delighted if he will do so. I plead with him to show the members of farming communities who have travelled a great distance to attend this debate that although the Government are moving slowly, they are going to take precise and specific action. Last month, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/28" class="indent">&quot;I expect that some of the announcements that we will make later this autumn will be about what more can be done to prevent the spread of TB between cattle as well as how we may address the wildlife problem.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2005-11-17.1089"><i>Official Report</i>, 17 November 2005; Vol. 439, c. 1089</phrase> .]</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/29">All those statements, and the whole current of Government policy, seem to have been leading to a measured response to the problem of uncertain evidence and the long- neglected right of farming people to have their livelihoods and property protected in a manner in which they can have confidence. I accept that it is essential to assess risk and cost when considering that necessary buzzword in administrative law&mdash;what is &quot;proportionate&quot;. The Minister has repeatedly said that that is what he is engaged in.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/30">As the Government concede, however, in a genuine partnership, basic considerations of equity and fairness are at stake. Why should farming communities have to bear the cost of new cattle control measures, such as pre-movement testing, reduced compensation and the continuing and dramatic losses and effects of BTB while unable to protect themselves, their living and their animals from the reservoir of disease that everybody accepts exists? A limited resumption of culling must be available as a tool in any co-ordinated and comprehensive policy if it is veterinary opinion that circumstances on the ground call for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/31">I accept that the Minister's Department has the spectre of a High Court judge looking over its shoulder, but I ask him to consider the terms of section 10(2) of the Protection of Badgers Act 1992:</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/32" class="indent">&quot;A licence may be granted to any person by the appropriate Minister authorising him, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Act, but subject to compliance with any conditions specified in the licence&mdash;(a) for the purpose of preventing the spread of disease, to kill or take badgers, or to interfere with a badger sett&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/33">In other words, the Act clearly permits the Minister to issue a licence for the taking or culling of badgers to prevent the spread of disease. Subsection (9) of that same section says that that consent</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/34" class="indent">&quot;shall not be unreasonably withheld&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/35">Thus, in a court, the onus would be on the Minister to prove that his consent to the licence had been reasonable.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/36">Every farmer has rights to the peaceful enjoyment of his property under article 1 of protocol 1 of the European convention on human rights. Under the jurisprudence of that convention, a fair balance must be struck between the individual and the interests of society in protecting the badger. It was never the intention of Parliament that farming communities should be denied the opportunity of dealing with the wildlife reservoir if there were a prospect that that might be effective. Given that the Government seem to be unprepared to act even in the extreme circumstances described in the SAC's advice, a blanket policy denying all applications for a licence would stand a strong chance of being found to be unlawful. I hope that such action will be unnecessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/37">Only the week before last, the <i>Farmers Guardian </i>announced that the Department had stated that the Minister's announcement could be expected today, so we have arrived at the end of a long and tortuous road&mdash;or have we? What new twist of the screw or the knife is to be inflicted on an anxious and expectant farming community? There are worrying developments, with which I ask the Minister to deal. In January 2006, the new EU food hygiene regulations come into force, which will require that dairy producers isolate and discard milk from TB reactor cows. What will that mean for producers in the south-west, where large herd breakdowns take place? We are in December, but there is no guidance from DEFRA on how to deal with the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/38">If there is to be a partnership, let there be genuine and greater flexibility to enable farmers to recover more quickly from a breakdown. Allow them to volunteer inconclusive reactors for slaughter. Where there are large herd losses, use the gamma interferon test to accelerate the diagnosis of infected cattle, and allow fast restocking. Where whole herds are removed&mdash;as has tragically been the case in my constituency and other constituencies throughout the south-west&mdash;if cattle-to-cattle transmission is the cause, fast restocking should be allowed after disinfection.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/39">The feeling of the farming communities whom I represent is running very strong. They are law-abiding, courageous and decent people whom it is a privilege to represent, but they are at the end of their tether. They are stretched in every direction by one pressure on another and they cannot endure indefinitely. The human cost and misery of the tragedy, unfolding silently, unnoticed by a wider public, throughout the countryside, can no longer be ignored. If the Government fail to fulfil the hopes of an expectant farming community that, at last, pragmatic considerations have prevailed, they will rightly think that Nero himself could not have shown more shocking indifference to the fate of farmers, cattle and badgers alike.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/40">I have received many letters on this subject from constituents&mdash;farmers, vets and others who have witnessed the burdens placed by bovine TB on farming families. I shall read only one. Mr. R. E. Colbear of Northlew near Okehampton says:</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/41" class="indent">&quot;I am writing as a farmer in the community and one who is at the present time under TB restriction. Since 1996 I have been shut down in my livestock business for BSE, F&amp;M&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/42">foot and mouth&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/43" class="indent">&quot;and now TB. On all 3 occasions the value of my livestock has decreased and my business activities have been either severely restricted or stopped, causing inability to pay my bills and trade to the best advantage . . . There have been livestock on this farm for a very long time, but the time is getting very close when that will change and I can see a time in the near future when no livestock remain.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/44" class="indent">Are the Government going to wait until the farming community become so desperate that badgers are slaughtered wholesale and become a thing of the past or are they going to rid themselves of fear of pressure groups and act? I cannot afford to wait any longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/45" class="indent">I have sought all my life to live an upright life according to Christian principles and shall continue to do so, but respect for government is waning fast.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/46" class="indent">More laws do not make people more law-abiding but more devious. If we do not see righteousness at the head of government, righteousness will not be in the nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/47" class="indent">Perhaps you could convey my circumstances to those above you in the House.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/48">I hope that, at least in discharging that duty, I have been successful today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-06a.212.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1876" speakername="Angela Browning" colnum="212"  time="010:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051206/halltext/51206h01.htm#51206h01_spnew16">
	<p pid="a.212.1/1">I apologise to you, Miss Widdecombe, and to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" name="Geoffrey Cox">the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox)</phrase> that I have to attend the Standards and Privileges Committee shortly. I shall make a short contribution because, like my hon. Friend who represents a neighbouring constituency, I have seen the situation in the west country aggravated by the spread of this disease in such a short space of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/2">One of the reasons why the previous Conservative Government commissioned the Krebs report was that we realised that there had to be a fundamental change in policy if the geographic spread of this disease was to be curtailed. It was not only present in the south-west peninsular, but had gone round the corner from Bristol and was already into Gloucestershire and Herefordshire. We have now seen the further spread of the disease in such a short space of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/3">When I was elected 14 years ago, my most northerly parish, Morbath, which borders Exmoor, had just had its first case of bovine tuberculosis. However, the disease is now well down the Exe valley. Indeed, I say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase>&mdash;he too is a neighbour of mine&mdash;that if he had farms in his constituency, I think that the disease would now be in his constituency too.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/4">The aim of the Conservative Government in commissioning the Krebs report was to stop the geographic spread; we hoped that Krebs would come up with an alternative policy that could be implemented. I understand the difficulty that the Minister has; indeed I have spoken to him privately about that and about what I believe to be necessary, and I now do so publicly. The political will is needed to do something about this disease, which affects farmers to the extent so eloquently described by my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon&mdash;the impact on farmers and their families has to be seen to be believed. It is not just about the money, although that of course is important in any business, but about the sheer desperation that people suffer when they are restricted, when they can see their whole livelihood being taken away from them and feel totally impotent to do anything about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/5">I have sat in the Minister's chair, and I know that when one is dealing with badgers, which are a protected species, one has to jump through lots of hoops. My hon. Friend mentioned the powers that the Minister has to take action. As a Minister, I issued licences for the killing of badgers but, in order to do so, I had to try to get the permission of all sorts of groups of people, such as badger groups and the official badger panel, that were set up when the species was first protected. I am sure that, at the time, their establishment was well intended. Those groups are there to introduce checks and balances on ministerial decision making but, in a case like this, they hamper the Minister in doing what is the right thing to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/6">The Minister will know, because I know that he has seen the data, that there have been experiments and trials around the world, not least the one in the Republic of Ireland, which I have visited twice, once as a Minister and once since. We do not have to reinvent the wheel in the UK. We are part of the European Union, so surely we can respect the scientific analysis of a trial carried out in another EU country, without saying that we have now got to spend years trialling the same thing ourselves. There should be a much faster process by which we can say what works and what does not. I know that, in the absence of concrete scientific evidence, the situation is difficult, but it cannot be left as it is. The disease will soon become endemic in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/7">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> said that there are just a few cases in Northamptonshire. Give it five years, and he will not be standing up here and saying that there is no public feeling for action, because we have seen the same situation in Cornwall, Devon and Somerset. As the disease has spread, we could predict what would happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/8">This debate, raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon, is timely because, after eight years, we are now waiting to see what the Government will do to make a difference to the farming community. I urge the Minister to act on this matter. If he does, he will have the support of many people in the House. I am sure that, with his persuasive powers, he can convince even the people who sit behind him in the Chamber that this is not just a slaughter policy; it is about the farming community and what it is suffering and the huge slaughter of farm animals. However, it is also about the welfare of the badger. It was once suggested to me that somehow tuberculosis does not affect badgers as it would any other species&mdash;human or animal. That is rubbish. They drag themselves around the countryside and become weak.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/9">I love British culture, but I am worried by an aspect of it to do with animals&mdash;&quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; approach to badgers. That must be changed. If people care about moles, rats and badgers, and other parts of our heritage, the well-being and health of badgers and wild creatures should matter. The Minister is best placed to make that case as the foundation for a change in policy. If that is to succeed, I am convinced that selective culling will be needed. When we commissioned the Krebs report, it was with the assumption that it would result in a need for culling to produce a cordon sanitaire around parts of the country to stop disease spreading down through the south-west peninsula or further north.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.0/1">It is a great pleasure, Miss Widdecombe, to serve under your chairmanship. I heartily congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" name="Geoffrey Cox">the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox)</phrase> not only on securing this debate, but on his splendid and robust speech. I should declare my interests as set out in the register, namely my agricultural rent. I should declare another interest: I am probably the only MP who has had one pet badger, and I can guarantee that I am the only MP who has had two pet badgers.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/2">I entirely endorse the comments of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase>, and of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1876" name="Angela Browning">the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning)</phrase>. There are real concerns on animal welfare, especially as regards badgers, and it grieves me to think that the descendants of my badgers could be suffering a hideous death due to Government neglect on TB.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/3">There has been a developing hot spot around Market Drayton in my constituency. I spoke to Heulwen Charles of the National Farmers Union yesterday, who estimates that 25 per cent. of the dairy farms around Drayton have been affected by TB. Since I became a shadow Minister, I have made it my business to go around the country. I have been to the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon, I have seen Mr Yewdall, and I have asked more than 600 parliamentary questions on this matter. I would like to thank the Minister and the civil servants for the manner in which they have answered my questions because we have flushed out a huge amount of information, some of which I shall touch on.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/4">Conservative hon. Members wish to see a healthy prosperous cattle industry alongside a sustainable, managed and healthy wildlife population. At the moment, we have neither. DEFRA's consultation document of last year stated that we will spend &pound;2 billion of taxpayers' money over the next 10 years not curing TB. In the Minister's own words, in a parliamentary reply:</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The Government recognise that eradication of bovine TB is unlikely to be achieved in the next 10 years using current control methods.&quot; .&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-01-31.1465"><i>Official Report, House of Commons, </i>31 January 2004; Vol. 418, c. 1465W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/6">The numbers are staggering. Another parliamentary reply states that, in 1997, we slaughtered 3,760 cattle. The latest figures up to the end of October show that, this year, we have already killed 25,757 cattle. By the end of the year, that figure will represent a 700 per cent. increase on 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/7">The phenomenon occurs because we will not bear down on disease in both sectors. There is disease in both cattle and wildlife. Transmission may be cattle to cattle, cattle to wildlife, wildlife to wildlife or wildlife to cattle. The phenomenon that demonstrates that is closed farms. A Mr. Evans from Yockleton near Shrewsbury sent me an e-mail last week. They have had a breakdown, with serious badger activity on the farm, and that farm has closed after operating for more than 100 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/8">I went to St. Mawes after the Royal Cornwall show. The Miles from St. Mawes have had a farm since 1966. On two sides is the sea, on one side is a village and on another side is a clean farm. They have bought in only three bulls since 1966, yet two years ago they found sick badgers on the farm&mdash;four were dead&mdash;and they recently lost half their herd. In a letter to the Minister, Mrs. Miles said:</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/9" class="indent">&quot;We are now in an impossible position. We have a business in crisis without the legal means to eradicate the likely cause of our problems.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/10">As Mrs. Charles told me only yesterday in an e-mail,</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/11" class="indent">&quot;it seems totally unacceptable to be forced into slaughtering farm livestock that have Bovine TB and yet as an animal loving country we allow badgers who we know to be suffering from the disease to live. This not only allows them to spread the disease but die a most inhumane death.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/12">The Minister told me in a written reply of the extraordinarily high level of infectivity of badger urine when badgers have renal TB. He stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/13" class="indent">&quot;Bacterial loads of up to 300,000&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/14">colony forming units</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/15" class="indent">&quot;per millilitre of urine have been measured. This suggests that inhalation of as little as 0.03 ml of the urine could result in infection.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-01-29.485"><i>Official Report, House of Commons, </i>29 January 2004; Vol. 417, c. 485W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/16">Again, the Minister told us on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-29">29 January 2004</phrase> at column 483W that TB will survive in manure for two years and on pasture for five to 11 months. He also acknowledges the cruelty to badgers. In another reply, referring to an animal that may have had late-stage TB, he states that</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/17" class="indent">&quot;there would undoubtedly be an effect on the quality of life of such an animal.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2003-12-10.523"><i>Official Report, House of Commons, </i>10 December 2003; Vol. 415, c. 523W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/18">We so nearly got rid of the problem. In the 1930s, 40 per cent. of dairy cows were considered tuberculous. By using the tuberculin test and slaughter, before we had a wildlife reservoir, we got the figure down to 0.01 per cent. of animals tested in 1972. In 1971, a badger with tuberculosis was found in Gloucestershire next to a farm where two heifers had gone down with TB.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/19">We have seen what happens where we do bear down on disease in wildlife. In another written reply, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/20" class="indent">&quot;Four large-scale badger clearances have been carried out, at Thornbury in Avon . . . Steeple Leaze in Dorset . . . Hartland in North Devon . . . and in an area of East Offaly in the Irish Republic . . . All four clearances were followed by a reduction in the incidence of TB in cattle.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-01-22.1365"><i>Official Report, House of Commons, </i>22 January 2004; Vol. 416, c. 1365W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/21">Again, in the Minister's words,</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/22" class="indent">&quot;No confirmed cases of tuberculosis in cattle in the area of the Thornbury operation were disclosed by the tuberculin test in the 10-year period following the cessation of gassing.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-01-28.385"><i>Official Report, House of Commons, </i>28 January 2004; Vol. 416, c. 385W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/23">Again, in the Minister's words:</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/24" class="indent">&quot;The fundamental difference between the Thornbury area and other areas in south west England, where bovine tuberculosis was a problem, was the systematic removal of badgers from the Thornbury area. No other species was similarly removed. No other contemporaneous change was identified that could have accounted for the reduction in TB incidence within the area.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-03-24.826"><i>Official Report, House of Commons, </i>24 March 2004; Vol. 419, c. 826W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/25">For two years, we were told to wait for the four-counties trial in Ireland. We now have the results. Removal of the badger population led to a reduction in breakdowns of 57 per cent. in Monaghan, 74 per cent. in Kilkenny, 75 per cent. in Cork and 96 per cent. in Donegal. That was confirmed by a number of vets.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/26">John Gallagher, who has huge experience in TB as a former adviser on TB to DEFRA and as the retired senior vet for Devon and Cornwall, wrote a letter to the Secretary of State in February. There are now 420 vets behind the letter. They have 150 years of experience&mdash;frankly, more experience than all the Government's scientific advisers put together&mdash;and they are disgusted that badgers are</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/27" class="indent">&quot;condemned to a worsening eternity of tuberculosis disease&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/28">Pictures were revealed by Dr. Gallagher in an article in the <i>Veterinary Times</i> showing the hideous deaths that tuberculous badgers suffer. Those vets were clear. They said that the Krebs trial, which has been referred to, is now &quot;hopelessly compromised&quot; and that it is</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/29" class="indent">&quot;a hugely expensive exercise which is most unlikely to yield any valid results. It is thus unacceptable to continue using this trial as an excuse for inaction . . . tuberculous badgers suffer a prolonged and wretched death and . . . a quarter of over 5000 badgers tested by MAFF during 1996 to 1998 were infected&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/30">Again, vets who are very knowledgeable on this disease are emphatic that TB leads badgers to die cruel deaths. They have said:</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/31" class="indent">&quot;Just killing more and more cattle was the approach we used forty years ago before we knew the badger was a maintenance host . . . Then it was understandable, now it is incomprehensible . . . We feel this charade should cease immediately allowing effective control to be started forthwith.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/32">Those vets cannot be blamed for thinking that the Krebs trials are discredited.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/33">In another reply, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/34" class="indent">&quot;Evidence from post cull surveys suggests that trapping efficiency can vary between 30 per cent. and 80 per cent.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-04-29.1189"><i>Official Report</i>, 29 April 2004; Vol. 420, c. 1189W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/35">It is not surprising that there is perturbation if 70 per cent. of badgers were so scared out of their wits that they scattered around the country spreading disease. The Minister has also told me that 57 per cent. of the traps were interfered with and 12 per cent. of them were stolen.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/36">It is clear at the highest levels of veterinary knowledge in this country what should be done. The president of the British Veterinary Association, Dr. Bob McCracken said:</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/37" class="indent">&quot;The infected badger must be controlled and removed&mdash;we are no longer debating if the infected badger should be removed; what we are debating is how to do so in an effective manner&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/38">Yet, as recently as two weeks ago, the Minister seemed to be in denial. In a written answer, he claimed:</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/39" class="indent">&quot;Eighty per cent. of TB cases are spread from cattle to cattle&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-11-17.1089"><i>Official Report</i>, 17 November 2005; Vol. 439, c. 1089W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/40">That is in total contradiction to the views of his own scientists. The central science laboratory said that the figure could be as low as 15 per cent. to 74 per cent. The Minister's claim has already been refuted in studies by Professor Wilesmith, a world-renowned expert who is convinced that there is badger transmission.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/41">I repeat that transmission can be from cattle to cattle, cattle to badger, badger to cattle or badger to badger. We have to bear down on both sources of disease, but the Minister is absolutely determined not to do so. In a reply to me, he actually said:</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/42" class="indent">&quot;It is current policy not to issue any licences under sub-section 10(2)(a)&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/43">of the Protection of Badgers Act 1992&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/44" class="indent">&quot;to prevent the spread of bovine tuberculosis.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-03-18.433"><i>Official Report</i>, 18 March 2004; Vol. 419, c. 433W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/45">He has made up his mind. He has not told Parliament why he has, in effect, repealed a section of British law.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/46">I have tried to help the Minister. I have met scientists at Warwick university, who are convinced that they can get round one of his biggest problems&mdash;his fear of unnecessarily culling healthy badgers. Those scientists are convinced that polymerase chain reaction technology&mdash;PCR&mdash;could identify sets where diseased badgers live, because badgers live in social groups and use latrines. In his reply to me, however, the Minister was looking for an excuse not to accept advances in technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/47">I went to Michigan to see how the Americans have handled TB, and they dismissed the Minister's reply as quibbling. They are convinced that there is real use to be made from identifying TB around badger setts, which could help us to take out the diseased badgers and leave healthy ones. We all agree that we want to leave the healthy ones, partly because they are a barrier to the spread of disease by diseased badgers.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/48">There are real lessons to be learned in Michigan. I was astonished by the severity with which the federal and state authorities treated the disease. The lessons are simple: bear down on disease in cattle using fast, accurate and modern means of diagnosis. In Michigan, the authorities gave cattle a skin test and used gamma interferon and PCR. They have rigidly enforced, but workable pre-movement testing and movement restrictions. I went there thinking that pre-movement control was probably a political gesture on the part of the farming community to get action from the Government on wildlife, but it is more than that&mdash;it is an integral part of the community success in getting rid of disease in cattle. The farming community recently went for two years without a single herd going down.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/49">However, the authorities also took vigorous, if unpopular, action to bear down on disease in wildlife. The white-tailed deer is iconic, but the culling of deer by means of hunting exceeds the culling of cattle. There is a huge public education programme, and the white-tailed deer population has been reduced by half. People were astonished by the grotesque level of disease in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/50">To take the necessary measures, the Government must keep the confidence of the farming community. It is vital that they do not chisel on compensation, as has perhaps been proposed with the tabular valuation. That runs directly counter to the experience in America, where farmers really co-operated. Reducing the disease is simple, and that will reduce the cost, which will help the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/51">It is not only the cattle industry, the beef industry and the dairy industry that are at risk. As the US chief vet in charge of TB said, bovine tuberculosis is a serious zoonosis, which is dangerous to humans. It has already been transmitted to dogs and cats, and some humans have picked it up from cattle.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/52">We were promised a statement on TB this autumn, but I do not count <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-06">6 December</phrase> as autumn. The Government's attitude is incomprehensible. Whatever the reason for it, Government inaction is a scandalous dereliction of their duty to protect the people, cattle and wildlife of this country from an age-old preventable disease.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-06a.233.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="233"  time="012:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051206/halltext/51206h03.htm#51206h03_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.233.1/1">While health, education, the police and local councils now all work closely together in partnership to tackle our social problems locally, one institution stands aloof, not pulling its weight&mdash;the legal system. It often uses judicial independence and impartiality as an excuse to avoid the social responsibility that we must all share. That is an attitude as damaging and corrupting of social justice as was the canteen culture of the police&mdash;which, to their credit, they are changing. The legal system, too, must change.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/2">That is felt at its keenest in constituencies such as mine and the Minister's, where despite the personal commitment and professional dedication of local professionals and practitioners, the culture of the legal system stands in the way of the comprehensive, multi-agency approach that we are all trying to build. Things need not be like that, and the Lord Chancellor needs to reposition the Department for Constitutional Affairs as a public service&mdash;customer-driven not producer-driven, freeing our talented local professionals to engage with our communities, not staff a system that looks down on them. That needs vision at ministerial and departmental level, and there are several strategies for achieving it. I want to talk about one of those strategies today.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/3">Several weeks ago I had the opportunity to visit Red Hook in Brooklyn. Having had the usual problems of overburdened magistrates, ineffective results and high recidivism rates, the deprived neighbourhood of Red Hook established the Red Hook community court in 2000. The court emphasises rehabilitation, prevention and community involvement rather than punishment alone. Defendants were brought in one after the other before Judge Calabrese, and they had a personal and direct relationship with him. What I saw illustrated the emphasis on mediation and the strong commitment to helping with the lives of those, often young, people rather than simply locking them up to reoffend later.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/4">Community courts are about taking proactive steps to prevent antisocial behaviour and criminality. Community justice involves identifying, acknowledging and addressing the range of problems that contribute to entanglement in the criminal justice system, rather than simply focusing on the crime itself. A single judge hears multi-jurisdictional cases in one court and becomes an integral element of the community. He can hand down sentences of up to one year. He goes to community meetings; indeed, he initiates them&mdash;an experience that has not ended civilisation as the judiciary knows it, or called his integrity or impartiality into question. A judge whose tiny staff take polaroids of damp and squalid housing conditions in the community and bring the municipal landlord to court is seen to be delivering justice impartially in the community. In some people's eyes, that is the first time that that has ever happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/5">The results are as follows. Some 75 per cent. of defendants complied with sanctions in Red Hook, compared with 50 per cent. at the traditional court in downtown Brooklyn, the re-arrest rate among drug offenders who had completed a community court-monitored treatment plan was 29 per cent. lower over three years, and the annual arrest rate of defendants who had completed at least 90 days of court-mandated drug treatment fell over three years from 2.3 annual arrests before the intervention to 0.9 annual arrests.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/6">Justice is seen to have a real impact on the community. The average arrest-to-arraignment time was 18.9 hours, compared with 29.2 hours at the downtown Manhattan court. The arrangements deliver justice swiftly. With results such as those, the community court movement began to expand, and the empirical research on those jurisdictions reinforces the successful data coming out of Red Hook.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/7">The Department for Constitutional Affairs conducted a study of the US community courts and released the results in May 2005. It found that the community courts had less backlog, the community was more satisfied and defendants were more compliant with sentences.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/8">The movement to create community courts in the UK is building. Lord Falconer, the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, observed:</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Involving the community in deciding the priorities of the centre will mean that local people will see their main concerns being tackled with real and visible payback for the crimes that affect their way of life in their neighbourhood.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/10">I agree wholeheartedly.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/11">That ties in perfectly with neighbourhood policing and all our other local initiatives to put a human face on public services. The public respond whenever we do that, especially in the criminal justice system. In Nottingham tenants, residents, beat officers, neighbourhood wardens, probation officers, the Crown Prosecution Service and many others to whom I have spoken welcome the idea of a community court.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/12">The very nature of community courts encourages an atmosphere in which a greater number of parties become involved in the process, and leads to wider justice for all. If a youth breaks someone's window, justice might involve getting the perpetrator to apologize to the owner and to work in community service projects to fix what they have broken. Rebuilding respect for the criminal justice system so that it is seen to deliver for people in local communities is radically different from the alienated process to which we have become accustomed in magistrates courts and other courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/13">In community courts, those who violate the law see how their actions adversely affect other members of society. In addition, members of the community are more confident about giving evidence and helping to prevent problems from recurring. I am sure that witness intimidation is as big a problem in the constituencies of other hon. Members here as it is in mine, and it has to be tackled at the local level. Once we can administer justice at that level, community confidence will begin to be rebuilt. In community courts, those who are wronged also get a greater sense of justice because they are involved with the system, and feel better compensated by the unique process that the court offers.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/14">Neighbourhoods' positive sentiments towards community courts are corroborated by the evidence collected, again, by the Department for Constitutional Affairs. The Department's research found that community residents' perceptions of safety had risen and, even more remarkably, that a majority of residents were willing to pay slightly increased taxes or to transfer money from other criminal justice agencies to fund the continuation of community courts. As a result of all that enthusiastic support for this innovative justice system, the United Kingdom's first community court opened its doors in January at the north Liverpool community justice centre. In the first six months after the court's introduction, north Liverpool experienced a decrease in crime, compared with the same time frame in the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/15">Although Judge David Fletcher, who runs the community justice centre, is disparaged by some of the more conservative elements in the judiciary, he has emerged as an engaged community leader and personifies the success of the community court. My right hon. and learned Friend the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs has described him as having</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/16" class="indent">&quot;a very unique role of building community relationships across north Liverpool, as well as passing sentences and following cases through after conviction.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/17">That personal element of the community courts prevents defendants from becoming alienated from the process and allows for true rehabilitation so that they have the option of becoming productive members of society. My right hon. and learned Friend has also said that the centre in Liverpool is</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/18" class="indent">&quot;already making a difference by listening to local people and giving them an opportunity to get involved in reducing local crime.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/19">If we are to generate capable charismatic judges who roll up their sleeves, step outside the comfort zone of a cosy judicial career ladder and are proactive in our communities, the Department needs to initiate fundamental cultural changes. It needs to start by revamping the monochrome judicial training and ensuring that judges have a lifetime engagement with the communities that they are meant to serve.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/20">Over 18 years I have put a great deal of effort into trying to meet the judiciary in my own city, and I have managed to meet judges and others on only a handful of occasions. However, within five minutes of entering the judge's jurisdiction in Brooklyn, on my way to Red Hook, I was sitting at the top table watching him administer justice. He showed photographs to a defendant who was going through a drug rehabilitation scheme, but who was wobbling and perhaps thinking of leaving the scheme to go back on to the drugs. The judge showed the defendant pictures of himself taken 40 days earlier and asked, &quot;Is that the sort of thing you want to return to? Do you really want to go back to looking like that?&quot; That sort of direct follow-through communication with defendants should be looked at and replicated in the UK. Ensuring that our judges are more in tune with their communities does not for one second mean that they are less impartial or less independent; it simply means that they are more capable of delivering the justice that we need.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/21">Community courts are gaining momentum in the United Kingdom, and many more communities, including those in Nottingham, are ready to embrace this innovative system of justice at a lower level. Although I would prefer there to be a single judge, if that option were available, we can look at other levels, too. The Salford community justice initiative recently opened, and community justice panels in Chard and Ilminster are now operational and continuing the trend of success that the community courts have repeatedly shown since their creation.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/22">We are serious about getting the legal system to be a part of Nottingham. This morning the idea of community courts will be discussed at our local criminal justice board. We have seen the adverse effects of antisocial behaviour and criminality and the need for an integrated way of tackling those growing problems. On Monday on one of my local estates we shall launch Operation Kingdom: a multi-agency approach, with the addition of dozen extra police officers, will go in to fill a vacuum created by the very positive arrests of some of the key villains in the east midlands. We are going in there with housing, social security, CCTV operatives and additional police personnel to ensure that that community can be helped to rebuild itself now that those significant arrests have taken place.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/23">That community, and Operation Kingdom, would be a classic case for assistance at judicial and legal level. But at the moment those connections are not there. What would the people on the Bestwood estate give to have an active involved judge repairing the damage done by a decade of criminality by one key family? We need such people in our communities. We need the Minister to make every intellectual effect to see how she can spread those pilots further.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/24">A community court in Bestwood, or in St. Ann's or the Meadows in the constituencies of my hon. Friends <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1746" name="John Heppell">the Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Heppell)</phrase> and for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) could be the spark that really makes our communities' fight-back unstoppable. We have had some adverse publicity in the city of Nottingham, some of it self-generated, but that would be a demonstration that Nottingham itself had thought this through, got everybody around the table and found another way to fight back and regenerate our communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/25">In October, just to show that we are serious about this idea in our city, we had the privilege of playing host to district attorneys from Red Hook, who came to examine our magistrates and exchange notes on the best ways to deal with crime. They met our chief Crown prosecutor Kate Carty, and helped us to understand the steps that we need to take to make community courts a working reality for Nottingham. I invited those two female DAs from New York to the House of Commons and we had a chat here about the exciting possibilities, and how they had changed the community in Red Hook. The Crown prosecutor and I also took our case for community courts to Baroness Scotland, who is the relevant Home Office Minister. She, too, gave us encouragement and listened carefully to our ideas about the possible way forward for community courts in Nottingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/26">I do not know whether I should have declared an interest at the beginning and I apologise if I have transgressed in any way, but I am the chairman of our local regeneration partnership in Nottingham, One Nottingham, which is the local strategic partnership charged with the regeneration of our city. Our priorities, too, tie in closely with ensuring that the legal system and the criminal justice system are a part of the revival and are not aloof and watching from afar. While maintaining their judicial integrity and independence, they should be in there with us helping us, as any other public institution would, to revive and revitalise some of the deprived areas in my constituency. The community court is a perfect fit in that regeneration strategy and it helps the legal system to play its part as a full and active partner in regenerating our communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/27">One Nottingham stands ready to hold the ring for any proposals coming forward for our city. We would be available to discuss with Ministers or officials how that might best be done. To show the seriousness with which we are preparing for that possibility, a conference will be held in March in the city of Nottingham under the umbrella of the Magistrates Association and a local trust in order to take those ideas forward. I do not know whether it is right for me to invite my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister to address that conference, but I shall ask her diary secretary whether she is available. As always, she will be very welcome. We were sad that she was unable to attend a day that we had planned for her in Nottingham; it would have included a discussion about the concept of community courts. I blame my former colleagues in the Whips Office for that misadventure, but I hope to make up for it on another occasion.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/28">It is understandable that the Government want to see the completed results of some of the UK pilot programmes. However, if she does not know already, the Minister needs to be told that we stand ready to move whenever we are given the signal. Empirical data and community feedback show that community courts are having some success. The sooner we in Nottingham can begin to take those strides forward, curbing antisocial behaviour and criminality in our communities, the better.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/29">Some may say, &quot;We can't afford a community court; we'll have to pay for a judge, and the housing and accommodation.&quot; But our communities, who already pay billions of pounds as a result of petty criminality&mdash;the costs of the police service, the Prison Service, drug rehab, the broken families, the poor, and low educational attainment&mdash;would not agree that we cannot afford those courts. They would probably say that we cannot afford not to have them. Indeed, the quality of life of those in my constituency who live in the large former council estates in the outer city is diminished daily. They live in fear of the crime caused by the local yobs and the dealers. They, too, would probably say that we cannot afford not to have those courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/30">I look forward to the day when my constituency can witness an innovative court with a spirited and positive judge like the one whom I saw in Red Hook, and probably like the one in north Liverpool. We have the support of our local community and our regeneration body, and we are supported also by the Government's vast research on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/31">Nottingham is more than ready to become a pioneer in the revolutionary field of community justice. We ask only that the Government give us the opportunity, as soon as possible, to establish a community court in Nottingham. We, too, can then begin to have a positive impact on regeneration. We do not want justice to be an alien concept unrelated to everyday life; we want justice to be delivered locally, and to be seen to be delivered locally. We hope that that will help rebuild confidence not only in our judicial system but in our social system. We believe that the courts and the law have a central role to play in the regeneration of our communities, and community courts are a key way of demonstrating that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-06a.238.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1472" speakername="Harriet Harman" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs"  colnum="238"  time="013:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051206/halltext/51206h03.htm#51206h03_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.238.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> on choosing to debate community courts. I admire the way in which he argued his cause. He made a strong case&mdash;and what we heard about in my hon. Friend's short speech is just the tip of the iceberg. I know from discussions that I and my ministerial colleagues and officials have had with him that his work on this subject is based where it should be: he listens to what people are saying in his local community. The policy development is not being undertaken in an ivory tower, but is based on what his constituents are saying to him. It is therefore hugely important.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/2">I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend's patient and measured approach. I appreciate that it must be hard for him&mdash;seeing the needs of his constituents and the downright urgency of the agenda that he is putting forward&mdash;when it sometimes takes a while to get ancient institutions to step forward and work together in different ways. I congratulate him on his patient persistence in taking this matter forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/3">My hon. Friend made a point about the culture of the legal system, on which I can only agree. It is hard to believe that if we asked members of the communities whom we represent to design a system for resolving disputes and identifying criminal responsibility, they would conjure up the current system. I think that we all believe that many changes are needed&mdash;although many are already under way. The fact that something has been as it is for many hundreds of years is not a reason not to consider what it could do better.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/4">My hon. Friend is right to say that we need to look at the courts and the legal system as a public service; the Secretary of State, Lord Falconer, strongly agrees with that point. That service is there to prevent crimes from being committed by acting as a deterrent, and to bring offenders to justice and punish them when crimes are committed. It is also there to resolve disputes within families that cannot be resolved outside court, and to resolve civil cases. Therefore it is a public service, and it needs to look outward more. That is the culture that Lord Falconer is leading forward from his position as Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/5">My hon. Friend made several points about Red Hook. His point about multi-jurisdictionality&mdash;if that is not too long a word&mdash;was well made. Why do we have such a clear sense of the different silos of the civil and criminal jurisdictions? Many of the issues about which my hon. Friend spoke stray across those jurisdictions. He talked about people going out and taking photographs of damp conditions. There might be damp conditions in a block of flats. There might also be criminality there, problems with children not attending school as much as they should, and family problems. I agree with his suggestion, and thank him for making it, that we need to consider what the problems are and make the courts work to solve them, rather than making individuals or agencies go from pillar to post.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/6">In the domestic violence court in Croydon, there are sometimes families who have family problems involving contact with children and decisions about property, as well as domestic violence issues. Why make one family go in front of two judges? Why not have all the facts go before one judge? That will happen in Croydon: one family, one judge. That idea needs to take root throughout the legal system&mdash;basing work around the problem, rather than making people go from pillar to post.</p>

	<p pid="a.239.0/1">The multi-jurisdictional aspect is not merely internal to the law. In places such as Red Hook one can get drug rehab, child care and health care in the court building, and there is a children's court there, too. All sorts of facilities are satellites round the court, because it has become such an engine for the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/2">In the UK we have the LIFT&mdash;local improvement finance trust&mdash;project in the health service, which means that a new building may contain not only a health centre, but a gymnasium and a local police station. I do not want to give my right hon. and learned Friend ideas&mdash;but on second thoughts, perhaps I do. Perhaps the Department for Constitutional Affairs should have a budget for an equivalent to the LIFT project, and consider doing similar experiments in the UK.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-06a.244.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="244"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051206/halltext/51206h04.htm#51206h04_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.244.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman is wrong about several facts, but we shall return to them. We used the process, but the Post Office refused us support for the change. That is why the democratic election choice was impossible, although we would be very happy to use it. The local council supports it, the MP supports it, which is one of the conditions, the chamber of commerce supports it, and the local community very much wants to have a ballot, as the code requires.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/2">The Minister is right to suggest that I used slightly colourful language in saying that Whitton was &quot;eliminated&quot;, and that it was probably never included in the first place, but the situation has become more serious in that increasing numbers of commercial vehicles are using the postal address file while Thomson directories' maps, for example, no longer refer to Whitton. The telephone directory gives Twickenham, a town four miles away, as the address. Local atlases do not refer to Whitton at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/3">Some of the practical problems that arise as a result are quite serious. Delivery vans often turn up in the borough looking for, say, Kneller road in Whitton, but all the directories refer to it as Kneller road in Twickenham, so they look in Twickenham, which is four miles away. Deliveries very often go astray, and a great deal of inconvenience is caused to businesses and individuals. Associated with that is a very strong sense that the identity of a community is being lost, and all the community groups are now pressing for a change.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/4">The Minister said that the local communities have not used the appropriate methods, but there has been extensive correspondence, which I can show the Minister, in which the local community associations and I have pressed the Royal Mail to hold a ballot to make the necessary change. The Royal Mail has simply refused to support the change. The reasons that it has given, which the consumer watchdog describes as inflexible, bear no relationship to the standard arguments that it advances about the need for a sophisticated computer-based sorting system. It refers to the confusion that could arise among the manual sorters. It refers to confusion that could arise among the manual sorters. It is difficult to understand the arguments. Indeed, the post office consumer body, which has no axe to grind&mdash;there is no reason for it to support us&mdash;takes much the same view. However, if the Minister thinks that all that is required is for the local community to activate the process, we shall be delighted to do that. The key bodies, the council, the chamber of commerce and I are all in favour and anxious to achieve the necessary change.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/5">To conclude, I ask two things of the Minister. First, is it possible to have some flexibility in relation to post codes and post towns, rather than the current rigid refusal to contemplate change? I understand about economies of scale and the need for standardisation, but surely some kind of cost-benefit analysis must be made. There are severe costs in some cases&mdash;the 250 homes in Twickenham road that I cited make a good example. Can we not have some mechanism by which the Royal Mail is required to evaluate costs and benefits, and to allow a process of change?</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/6">Secondly, we seem to have run into the buffers in relation to the PAFs&mdash;I mentioned the example of Whitton. There is a process for change, but if the Post Office refuses to contemplate it, it is difficult to use it. Can the Minister help by finding a way around that obstacle?</p>
