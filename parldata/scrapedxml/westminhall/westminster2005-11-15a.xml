<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-15a.195.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1939" speakername="Michael Foster" colnum="195"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051115/halltext/51115h01.htm#51115h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.195.1/1">I accept that, but I think that it varies from school to school. In my experience as a school governor, at times one was co-opting people on to the governing body, and at other times elections had to be held. That goes back to the point that I made earlier about every community and every school being different, and the need for the Government to recognise that in relation to the ideas that are put forward in the White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/2">I do not accept the argument that parents do not want to get involved, nor do I accept the argument that they want to take over schools. As a parent, I have had the frustration of seeing something wrong in the running of a school but not having the right forum in which to express my concerns. However, I have also spent quite a lot of time as a teacher at parents' evenings waiting to see the parents whom I really wanted to see about their child's progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/3">I think that parent councils will work, although I would like to see a few of them in action to make a proper assessment. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> said, the White Paper implies that they will be used for independent school trusts, but I would like to see them in all schools. They should not have the formality of a governors' meeting, but nor should they be like a parent-teacher association. I am convinced of the need for clear protocols on the relationship between parent councils, governing bodies and head teachers. Perhaps those protocols should be set out in legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/4">I welcome the plan to hold termly parents' evenings, with proper reporting on pupils' achievements. I know how valuable those meetings can be in helping teachers to learn more about particular pupils&mdash;my own teaching was greatly improved as a result of spending time talking to parents. I also accept that, if done properly, that plan will result in the imposition of extra burdens on teaching staff&mdash;particularly part-time teaching staff. I therefore have no hesitation in supporting the equivalent of Baker days&mdash;we could call them Kelly days&mdash;whereby extra days' holiday were given, at the discretion of the head teacher, for attendance at a far greater number of parents' evenings.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/5">I now turn to the choice agenda and the real political debate that is going on. Some say that all parents want is a good local school for their children; if only it were that simple. As Will Hutton pointed out in an excellent article in <i>The Observer</i> last week, some parents will go to extraordinary lengths to distinguish between schools to try to give their child the best possible chance to succeed. I know from my own experience that some parents choose the private route and pay thousands each year for the advantage that it brings their child. Others move house, incurring huge costs to get into the catchment area that maximises the chance of their child getting into a particular school. Some are known to lie about where they live; others find religion.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/6">Choice is a reality and we should not pretend otherwise. Let us have an honest debate about this but let us also accept the brutally harsh fact that it is the better-off who exercise choice. Why? They do so simply because they can. Low incomes eliminate the private solution and living in social housing does not allow for the luxury of the marketplace in order to buy and sell property. A lack of transport and family-unfriendly working hours do not allow for school runs outside local catchment areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/7">One high school in Worcester serves two diametrically opposed communities, one of which is the most wealthy community in Worcestershire where 16 per cent. of primary school pupils and 9 per cent. of secondary school pupils opt out of mainstream schools in the Worcester city pyramid. In the neighbouring ward, which is one of the most deprived in Worcestershire, only 1.5 per cent. of pupils opt out of the Worcester city pyramid of schools. That proves that the status quo is condemning less affluent families to schools that are underperforming.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.2/1">The hon. Gentleman has answered my question, &quot;How much choice?&quot; by saying that choice will always be limited by capacity; but the state can decide that capacity, so it has to make a prior decision as to how much choice it will offer. He has not really addressed that issue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-15a.197.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1939" speakername="Michael Foster" colnum="197"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051115/halltext/51115h01.htm#51115h01_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.197.1/1">That is an intriguing question, in that it relates to one controversial aspect of the White Paper. If a new school is to be set up, the White Paper envisages it as being of an independent trust nature; it cannot be a community school. It will be a foundation as opposed to community school. The Government need to examine that matter closely, but we must accept that not all local education authorities deliver perfect standards for the child through the community system. However, the hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.1/2">I want more detail on how the White Paper will support less affluent parents in making informed choices about secondary schools. If transport is a problem, bussing is, without doubt, a solution. I know that it conjures up fears about the 1960s racial divide in the United States, but bussing is a fact of life in rural and semi-rural areas. Pupils are bussed to my children's secondary school daily. If buses are used to transport the better-off as well, any social stigma attached to bussing will fail.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.1/3">Local education authorities as commissioners, not providers, can deliver parental advice, but the choice issue is about more than just social class divides. Central to the whole debate is the question of whether choice helps deliver higher standards. I asked the Library for information on parental choice in the magnet school system in the United States, and it provided an excellent response. An academic review makes it clear that there are greater opportunities to involve parents in monitoring and driving up standards when they can choose secondary schools for academic reasons than would occur if only convenience or location of the school were their motivating factor. That is an obvious but important conclusion.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.2/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the advantages that were given to some schools in the early 1990s worked to the detriment of many inner-city schools and areas of deprivation. I shall come to the very point that he raises in a minute or two, if he will be patient.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/2">Parental interest and involvement in a school can encourage teachers and managers to improve what they do. I firmly believe that the basic catchment area admission policy serves merely to trap the poor and to liberate the better-off to move away from bad schools to good ones. Frankly, there is nothing socialist about such a policy. Indeed, it is the very antithesis of what the Labour party should support.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/3">If choice is encouraged, that must be backed up by fair, simple and transparent admissions policies. We should not countenance any system that gives an in-built advantage to the middle classes. They know how to work the system now. Nor should we support types of school that favour only the middle classes. So, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, any academy created should only be for schools that are significantly underperforming&mdash;not the coasting schools, but the ones that are failing the majority of their pupils. I want to make the new schools so good that they will act as a magnet for the middle classes to aspire to get their children into, but with positive admissions policies that will ensure that the less well-off are the ones that benefit the most.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/4">Having worked in both the private and the public sector, I would urge caution on those who think along the lines of some character from <i>Animal Farm</i>, that all private is good and all public is bad. Simply, there are good managers, some in the private sector and some in the public. If we are going to get support and partners, the trick is just to pick the good partners. To reduce the fears of the public being short-changed in the long run, it would be prudent for an academy or trust to be run on a fixed-term contract. The contract might be for five years, obviously with a chance to renew, subject to the meeting of targets that were set for that trust or academy at the start.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/5">We need to be vigilant in securing the best for all our pupils. The US, hardly a socialist utopia, has countless examples of admissions policies that protect the less well-off and deters the creaming off of pupils, such as the quota or banding system that has been described in the White Paper. If middle-class or any other parents get involved in the running of schools, to drive up standards of achievement or just to improve behaviour, not just some but all the pupils benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/6">I am concerned about the way that admissions will be managed in a system of more independently run schools. The LEA has a key role to play. The White Paper, however, refers to a code of conduct of which schools should be mindful. I am not sure that that is strong enough language or would give the LEA the power to intervene if the system was not working or was being abused. Will the Government support having schools abide by, not just consider, local admissions policies? That would provide firm ground for those who have at heart the best interests of those parents who do not know how best to play the admissions system. If colleagues accept choice as a reality, equal opportunity for that choice to be exercised is essential.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/7">The reality of the situation tells me that LEA-wide admissions policies may not always be most appropriate either, given the variety of local situations. In my county of Worcestershire, we have two-tier and three-tier systems for secondary education. Clearly, those systems are not wholly compatible within the county, and admissions policies are not wholly compatible. Perhaps there should be a district-wide or school-family-wide admissions policy, such as with Worcester city and Martley.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/8">The local education authority is more likely to operate a fair admissions policy as a commissioner rather than a provider of schooling. Some colleagues are fiercely protective of the LEA role in education and see no need to change. Some fear the loss of democratic accountability, but bluntly, if the current role is working, why do the lowest socio-economic groups still suffer from the poorest outcomes? Why are the schools most likely to be underperforming more likely to be based in areas of the most deprivation? If LEAs had cracked this nut, I would be defending the status quo. They have not, and I will not. Indeed, some LEAs make the situation worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/9">In Worcestershire, under a Labour-Liberal coalition, under a Tory minority-run administration and now under Tory majority rule, small schools received overly generous financial payments, at the expense of those schools with deprivation needs. Deprivation is a real issue in urban constituencies like mine. I quote Ted Wragg&mdash;from a New Labour MP, that must be a first for him&mdash;who said that</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/10" class="indent">&quot;poverty kills educational chances by grinding the soul . . . a few thrive, despite the adversity, but most are submerged under the sheer weight of their deprivation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/11">My LEA singularly fails to respond, having other priorities. There is an argument for supporting small, rural schools, but not any small school. The LEA argues that head teachers support such a local-funding formula, but four head teachers of 150 primary school pupils, receiving a generous subsidy, will always out-vote one head teacher with a 600-pupil primary school.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/12">With the widely welcomed initiative to fund personalised learning, I beg the Minister to break the armlock that local education authorities have on funding. Schools should be funded also by Government according to the school's local needs, not just those of their authority. Small pockets of urban deprivation are masked by relatively prosperous shires, and children in my constituency and those like it suffer. Not all schools in Birmingham are in poor areas, and not all schools in Worcestershire educate the relatively well-off. It is vital to scrap the outdated funding method for core funding and top-ups based on an LEA-level assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/13">In my research for the debate, I considered the magnet school situation and a report by an academic called B.R. Clark from the United States. He came out with an interesting quotation, and I beg to ask leave of the Chamber to read it:</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/14" class="indent">&quot;When so much depends upon where you live, as in America, equal access is out, made impossible by the neighbourhood monopoly of each comprehensive public high school. To have students choose among distinctive schools, especially under broad district guidelines on student body composition, would certainly promote more genuine equality of opportunity, even as schools become dissimilar and ranked. Hence, charges of elitism made in the current debate against essential schools, magnet schools, charter schools, and other kinds of educational specialty shops have it all wrong. It is in the current structure that elitism runs rampant. Behind the bureaucratic pretense that comprehensive schools are equal schools lies the unquestionable fact that millions of students from poor and minority families living in poor neighbourhoods are held captive in schools that are nowhere near as good as those found in well-off neighbourhoods.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/15">Unfortunately, that was written in 1989. It could have been written today.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.1/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1939" name="Michael Foster">the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster)</phrase> for initiating the debate. The publication of the White Paper means that this is a timely opportunity to debate the reform of secondary education.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/2">How will the White Paper raise standards in inner-city schools, which has been the key issue in my career so far? I ask that as someone who has been a teacher for 28 years, 25 of which have been spent at inner-city schools. I was a deputy headmaster at a large secondary school for 15 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/3">The White Paper, by concentrating on structures, misses the point. The Government did much good work in their early years, when they concentrated on what was going on in the classroom, on the processes and on what they could do to improve what pupils are taught. I mention the early years strategy, the literacy hour, the numeracy hour, key stage 3, specialist schools and the leadership incentive grant, which was beneficial where I was working.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/4">The Government have now moved away from that good work. The White Paper, in contrast, talks about self-governing schools, trusts and weakening the role of the LEAs. How will those measures improve what is happening in the classroom?</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/5">I worked for 15 years in Bradford. Choice is available for the few in the inner cities. It is okay for the rich, the middle class and those in the know, but the Government are offering choice as a panacea without doing anything to improve standards, and that is totally fallacious. I worked in south Bradford, where there are six secondary schools, of which one was a city technology college. Under a Conservative Government, we had to put up with the fact that that school was given exorbitant resources and a preferential admissions policy. The effect of that policy was to weaken the other five secondary schools in south Bradford. That is not the situation now. Those six schools have been working together for the past few years. Indeed, last year I was the improvement grant co-ordinator for those schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/6">However, one of those six schools is a former CTC and three were in serious weakness or special measures last year. The problems that they faced&mdash;they faced them together because they were working as a federation&mdash;are common: the inability to recruit and retain the right staff, problems with the condition of the buildings, and so on. I read the White Paper and say, &quot;What are you doing to improve standards?&quot; I am afraid that I see precious little being done.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/7">The role of the LEA is crucial in improving standards. The Government have an obsession with the private sector; I compare Bradford LEA, which is privatised, with the LEA in my constituency of Rochdale, both of which were put on special measures at the same time. Last year, Rochdale, which is still a genuine LEA, had the fastest-improving rate of key stage 4 results and this year its key stage 2 results had the fastest improvement in the country. There are no secondary schools in Rochdale in special measures and it is introducing the &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; agenda by bringing social services and education departments together in one body.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/8">I compare Rochdale with Bradford LEA. It has academies, takes part in every experiment that the Government want and has made only modest progress. Last year, 11 secondary schools in Bradford had serious weaknesses or were in special measures. In terms of its progress, which is shown in the results table, it is in the middle of the league. The progress in Bradford is nowhere near that in Rochdale.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/9">What worries me about the White Paper is that it does not address the fundamental problems that areas in inner cities such as Bradford need to address: the need for sustained investment and co-operation, not competition. We had 18 years of competition under the Tories and it did absolutely nothing for secondary education in Bradford.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/10">I want the Government to look closely at what choice means. If it is choice for the few at the expense of the majority, or if it means even one of the six schools being left languishing and the children in them not getting the benefits of education that they deserve, and which others receive, that is completely unacceptable. The Government should be talking about schools working together to improve results, with weaker schools being supported by the stronger ones. That will not happen under these proposals for choice. We had 18 years of that, and I do not want to return to it.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.0/1">I want to emphasise a couple of points that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1939" name="Michael Foster">the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster)</phrase> made on the White Paper's agenda. I acknowledge his good work in securing the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/2">I shall take up <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> about the links between class and attainment but from a slightly different standpoint&mdash;not by taking a dogmatic approach in terms of public or private sector but by showing the empirical evidence of the work done by schools in my constituency in providing change in life opportunities for local kids.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/3">The statistics relating to the borough are relevant. London-wide, on average, about 18.5 per cent. of adult residents have a higher education qualification. In the borough of Barking and Dagenham, the average is about 3.5 per cent., and the rate of adult numeracy and literacy is the second and fourth worst nationally. The borough's track record on secondary schools is not good: in 1992, only 15.5 per cent. of pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at A* to C grades. Overall, the historic picture is of persistent low levels of attainment and educational aspiration. However, in the last 10 years there has been an extraordinary transformation in the performance of secondary schools; six of the eight or nine in the borough of Barking and Dagenham are in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/4">In 1996, 27 per cent. of the pupils obtained five or more GCSEs&mdash;18 points behind the national average, which was then 45 per cent. Last year, more than 50 per cent. secured five A* to C grades, just 3 per cent. behind the national average. That is an extraordinary rate of change in the performance of the LEAs. In the space of 10 years, that was the most improved local education authority in the country as to school attainment for secondary school kids. That cannot be ignored, not least because the GCSE results are reinforced by improvements across key stages 1, 2 and 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/5">We are witnessing a transformation of attainment and life opportunities for working-class kids in our borough. That radical change has, fundamentally, been built on the strategic leadership of the LEA and strong leadership from the schools. The hard groundwork has been established for durable change in school attainment. That has been based on a comprehensive strategy involving local schools. The corner-stone of that strategy is the principle of the local community school at the heart of each neighbourhood. I do not quite understand how this pragmatic, durable, incremental and comprehensive strategy dovetails with the strategy contained in the White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/6">In 1997, the Prime Minister said that</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/7" class="indent">&quot;what works is what counts&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/8">He also spoke of standards, not structures. However, we are seeing further local advancement for our kids put at risk because of a preoccupation with structures, forms and governance. The White Paper states that the only structure for the future is</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/9" class="indent">&quot;a system of independent non-fee paying state schools. It will be for schools to decide whether they wish to acquire a Trust . . . or become a self-governing foundation school.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/10">The White Paper removes the right of local authorities to publish their own proposals for the establishment of new community schools. It states that</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/11" class="indent">&quot;no more community schools (primary or secondary) will be established&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/12">Our local strategy has been based on the notion of the community school. It is ironic that, a few weeks ago, it was proposed that the White Paper be launched at a local community school that we had just opened, namely the Jo Richardson school at Castle Green in Dagenham. That did not happen, but it is a fantastic school, which has a revolving door in terms of people, including international visitors, coming in to look at the new building and the performance that it promises. That is a fantastic illustration of the strategy being systematically developed by the LEA. That strategy is at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/13">Arguably, this matter is more important in our community than any other because our population is anticipated to grow by some 35,000 over the next 10 to 15 years. Therefore, we are not talking about closing schools; we are talking about building more. Arguably, we shall be building schools outside the system that has delivered the fastest rate of improvement in school attainment for working-class kids in the country. We have some of the most difficult terrain in terms of the long legacy of underperformance of public services and poverty of attainment and aspiration among the working class. I do not see where that fits within the strategy outlined in the White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/14">A benign view of the White Paper is that it will allow for local conditions and may have a much more flexible introduction than we assume. Moreover, in contrast to the earlier grant-maintained schools, there will be no financial inducements. However, I am not too sure about that because I have heard that those schools that become trusts will have their deficits removed at a stroke, which, I infer, will be a financial inducement to move outside the present regime. That is in direct contrast to our local successful model. The objective is greater fragmentation at local level, not least because the White Paper gives all foundation, voluntary-aided and trust schools the freedom</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/15" class="indent">&quot;to use the approach . . . that they think will best meet their local circumstances&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/16">when considering admissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/17">My borough is interested only in increasing equity and building excellence. We have a strategy that is systematically delivering for local people in very challenging circumstances. At the moment, I cannot see how the White Paper will aid our local pragmatic strategy, I cannot see how the admissions system will deliver and I cannot see how the trusts will positively transform the picture. It will take some strong empirical evidence to convince me that the laudable aims of the Government to provide a better education for every child can be achieved by the measures outlined so far in the White Paper.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-15a.207.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" speakername="Meg Hillier" colnum="207"  time="10:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051115/halltext/51115h01.htm#51115h01_spnew32">
	<p pid="a.207.0/1">I shall address the White Paper, but I feel that it would be useful to outline some of the challenges faced in my constituency by staff and pupils in the borough of Hackney. Hackney has a high turnover of population of around 20 to 25 per cent. a year. When I visited a primary school during the summer, the head teacher told me that, in year 6, fewer than 20 per cent. of pupils had been there since reception. That highlights some of the challenges faced throughout the school system. Over 80 per cent. of pupils are from black and ethnic minority backgrounds. Half of all secondary school pupils have English as an additional language, which, compared with a national average of 10 per cent, underlines the challenges. The percentage of pupils eligible for free school meals is almost three times the national average.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/2">However, Hackney's secondary schools are among the fastest improving in the country in terms of GCSE results. Provisional results from the Learning Trust suggest that performance improved at more than three times the national rate. Six out of eight secondary schools now have over 50 per cent. of pupils gaining five A* to C grades, although in 2002, only one of the then nine schools could boast that. We are seeing a step change. Given that baseline in 2002, it is hardly surprising that Hackney's mayor, who was elected that year, the Learning Trust and the MPs have been supporters of the city academy's programme and the London Challenge, which have already made such a difference to Hackney's schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/3">We already have the over-subscribed Mossbourne academy, in a top-quality, brand new building, designed by Richard Rogers with guidance from the head teacher. It was designed to suit the pupils. Mossbourne is, along with the planned Bridge academy and Petchey academy, which are yet to be built, a mixed non-denominational, non-selective school. That is in response to a local need, and we look forward to seeing its impact as those pupils reach GCSE level. Hackney is also one of only a few boroughs where all secondary schools have specialist status, and we have seen the difference that that makes to GCSE attainment. However, despite all those achievements, we all know that there is still a long way to go. The challenges of population turnover, multilingual home environments and poverty contribute to that challenge. One thing is clear to me, as a relatively new Member of Parliament: there is no poverty of ambition in Hackney. Many constituents whom I meet are working and studying and, at the same time, supporting their children and encouraging them to do well at school.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/4">Some people have criticised the White Paper for suggesting the abolition of the LEA. I am a Labour and Co-operative Member of Parliament and I firmly believe in decentralisation, and in devolving power to the most appropriate local level. For most people who are directly involved in education&mdash;the pupils&mdash;their connection is with their school. Hackney's schools already have a great deal of autonomy and the LEA no longer exists in a traditional form, having been replaced by the Learning Trust. When that happened, the sky did not fall in. In fact, as I outlined, we have seen significant improvement in school achievement. It also placed councillors in a challenging role in taking on the strategic vision for the future of our schools; that is something that the elected mayor of Hackney, Jules Piper, has risen to, along with his council colleagues. However, it means that we need across-the-board support for councillors to take on that role. It is easy to get lost in the daily detail of running schools, and we must take that up a level.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/5">I want to touch on the issue of extending autonomy to head teachers. Although I favour it, I urge my right hon. Friend the Minister to consider two things. First, heads and governing bodies must be held firmly to account if they are to have such a level of responsibility and control. Secondly, where an LEA is doing a good job and there is no appetite from local schools to take on more, we should allow for some central support. However, that should be coupled with a pressure to devolve and appropriate responsibility for heads. It should not be an opt-out.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/6">Parental involvement is another issue, but I do not have time to go into it now. I simply want to indicate to my right hon. Friend the Minister the importance of including all parents, not just those who are in the know. There should not be carte blanche for those who can work the system. Many parents in my constituency, who do not have English as a first language and do not understand the system, feel shut out at present. If the White Paper helps them to get involved, that is a good step, but we have some way to go before that becomes a reality. I am keen to hear the Minister mention that.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.0/7">I have just a moment to mention a report that was published yesterday by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which I commend to hon. Members. I shall not go into the detail, but it highlighted the difference in achievement among certain ethnic minority groups. It concludes that they can succeed and have high aspirations. The Government have launched &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; and the youth Green Paper, and we must see a continuum from one to the other. &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; focused on children in care&mdash;the hard end of children. We must see a much wider agenda. If, in the White Paper, we are saying bye-bye to the LEA and hello to a children's authority, that can only be good. However, that authority must champion the needs of those who are most in need, commission successfully, and challenge to create the widest range of provision, youth work and other support for children, to make a real difference to every child. If the White Paper is proposing a personalised education agenda focused on the pupil and not the institution, we welcome it, with some of the caveats that I have outlined.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-15a.215.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1776" speakername="Jacqui Smith" speakeroffice="The Minister for Schools"  colnum="215"  time="10:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051115/halltext/51115h01.htm#51115h01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.215.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1939" name="Michael Foster">my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster)</phrase> on initiating and introducing the debate. He drew on his considerable experience as an educationist, in business and as a committed constituency MP. He set a useful and important context for the debate, which was followed by some important and helpful contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/2">Despite everybody giving me as much time as possible to respond in the debate, I will not be able to cover every single issue. However, I suspect that the debate is the first of many, so I am sure that, as well as responding to some specific questions, we will have ample opportunity to return to the issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/3">The challenge of secondary education reform is one we set ourselves in the context of building on the significant successes of the past eight years. We have the best ever set of results for our young people at 11, 14, 16 and 18. We have a work force who have grown in size and quality&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/4" class="indent">&quot;the best ever generation of teachers&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/5">as evidenced by Ofsted. We have significantly reduced the number of failing schools and are able to turn around quickly those that go into special measures. However, as hon. Members have identified today, there are still challenges in the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/6">Despite the fact that schools in disadvantaged areas have improved faster than others, we have more work to do to narrow the attainment gap between individuals. We have to do more to improve our staying-on rates post-16. Hon. Members rightly raised the important issue of reforms at 14 to 19. In the near future, we will bring forward the implementation plan that spells out how we will take the next stages for ensuring the right place for vocational education, for focusing on basic skills and for other important issues raised. We need to do more to improve discipline and behaviour, so that teachers can teach and pupils can learn. The White Paper is about meeting those challenges and raising our aspirations, both for individual children and for schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/7">Some hon. Members have said that the White Paper does not focus on what is happening in the classrooms, but at the heart of the White Paper is the challenge of how we personalise and tailor education for every single child and ensure that progress is being made. We spell out and will give more detail about our support through new resources; through further reforms to the work force; through developing our information and communications technology; through the opportunity&mdash;particularly in those early years of secondary, as my hon. Friend identified&mdash;for young people to catch up, where they have not got the basic skills necessary, and to have extra tuition and support through extended schools; and through expanding the gifted and talented programme. That will reach into every secondary classroom.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/8">Likewise, as my hon. Friend identified, there will be the new challenges to performance-manage teachers in a way that focuses on their teaching and learning. The new Ofsted framework and the nature of the inspections raises the bar on school improvement. We will support school leadership, through the National College for School Leadership and, particularly, through the support for those leaders increasingly leading complex schools and working in collaboration with other schools to drive improvement through the system. Many such issues are covered in the White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/9">Ensuring that we maintain the improvement on standards and make that reach every child is a big and important job. Arguably, that should not and could not be left to schools and educationists alone. That is why we argue in the White Paper for new opportunities for schools to draft in the support that they need. Our vision is of a system open to the influence and support of communities, of civic and faith bodies, of employers and of wider education institutions. The independent sector and the most successful state schools have always benefited from that type of support network. Our task is to bring its benefits to schools that have previously had to battle through alone. That is the starting point for the trust school model and why we will intervene explicitly&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1466" name="David Chaytor">my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor)</phrase> made important points on this&mdash;to ensure that there is redistribution of the broader support to those in the most challenging circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/10">I cannot answer all the detailed questions, but trust schools, while benefiting from the drive and success culture of external partners, will remain firmly part of the local authority family of schools, subject to fair admissions, fair funding and full accountability. We expect trusts to be developed by community organisations, binding the local school into its community.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/11">There has been comment on the proposal that as local authorities move to a commissioner role, they should not be promoting and producing new community schools. Let me be clear. The term &quot;community school&quot; refers only to the legal entity of that school. It is clear, as we take forward this policy, that schools are a fundamental part of their community, linked into extended services and delivering on the broader children's agenda. That is what schools, whether or not they are self-governing or continuing as community schools, should be about. In building trusts around other successful schools, universities and community organisations, we can ensure that that is embedded more clearly in the way in which our schools are run.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/12">All trusts will be required to have charitable objects, which we will set down in regulations. We shall proscribe certain individuals from being members of school trusts and ensure that no trust can be established without local consultation. I take seriously the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North about how we focus the efforts of the schools commissioner to ensure that the external support is drafted into the schools in which it is most needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/13">There was considerable discussion of choice and admissions in the debate. As my hon. Friends outlined, parents value the right to choose a school for their child and that choice cannot be driven by the ability to go into the private sector or to move house. We need to create more good school places. Although I do not have time to go into it, there is a strong emphasis in the White Paper on how we focus on school improvement and tackle school failure. As we create those places, we need to ensure that we redistribute choice. We shall achieve that by ensuring that we provide advice to those parents who need it most, not least to counter the problem of self-deselection, whereby parents are put off applying to good schools. We shall also extend the offer of free transport for the most disadvantaged pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/14">We will ensure fair admissions for all schools. Several of my hon. Friends raised that issue, and I listened carefully to what they said. We have a clear objective of ensuring that we develop the system described within a fair admissions system. It is not about returning to the divisive selection that several hon. Members identified as part of the previous grant-maintained regime. The school admissions code of practice is a device to which all admissions authorities must have regard in setting their admissions arrangements. It requires arrangements to be fair, clear and objective. We shall issue a new code in the new year, which will contain advice on reducing social segregation. The code is backed up by the schools adjudicator. However, I listened to and will reflect carefully on the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester about how we need to strengthen that process to ensure that we deliver on the objective of fair admissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/15">Several hon. Members mentioned local authorities. At the heart of the school system will be the local authority. It will play a new role, standing up for the interests of pupils and parents, rather than protecting the providers, but it will be a significant role, ensuring sufficiency and planning of school places, including through strategic capital plans. The role will also involve ensuring that the admissions code is adhered to, integrating schools into the &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; work and the broader work on children's services, engaging parents, setting the terms for new school competitions, playing an important part in 14-to-19 provision and having new powers to intervene swiftly where schools are underperforming. I hope that I have given some reassurance that this debate will continue.</p>

	<p pid="a.219.1/1">It is my privilege to have secured the debate. I am delighted that the Under-Secretary of State for Transport and two other hon. Members who represent Worcestershire constituencies, are in the Chamber, because I have become used to these debates being pretty nearly one to one without many other Members present.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/2">This subject is extremely topical for my constituents, and it will be very relevant to the Opposition day debate later today. I shall try to show that this is not only a local issue, but an example of problems that are increasingly widespread throughout the country. I shall, however, try to show that there are answers, too. My points come under four headings: the need for a review; the selection of options; the consultation process; and answers and solutions, which I really believe there to be.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/3">First, why is a review necessary? In the words of the trust, it is necessary to achieve financial balance and to secure sustainable, high-quality clinical services. We know that for the first year ever, the national health service as a whole has not achieved financial balance. Various sources disagree about the amount, but the NHS as a whole is in the red, which has led the Department of Health to instruct primary care trusts and acute trusts to fulfil their statutory duty to balance their books.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/4">The Worcestershire acute hospitals NHS trust tells us that it can break even in the year 2005&ndash;06 only with a cost-improvement programme of &pound;15 million and with the support of the strategic health authority of &pound;6.7 million. There is therefore a gap of &pound;20 million to &pound;30 million in the trust's finances. That does not include the PCTs, which also have deficits.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/5">The problem is intense because of the unknown effects of payment by results and practice-based commissioning, because of the consultant contract, which is working out to be far more expensive than anyone predicted, and because of out-of-hours care, which is also more expensive than people predicted.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/6">The trust brought in an external, independent management consultant to work out options for the review. The first thing that it discovered was that the trust is a high-cost provider compared with its peers, that the use of beds and theatres is inefficient, and that there are different deficits on different sites and among different specialties.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/7">The first actions on the list are absolutely obvious: improve productivity; reduce bed occupancy; reduce length of stay; increase theatre productivity; and review the skill mix. No one argues with that. The aim and the figures that the consultant quotes depend on reaching the upper quartile for the length of stay in the peer group for all specialties.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/8">I do not expect an absolute answer today; instead, I shall submit a parliamentary question. Will the Minister say whether the aim is feasible? Is any trust in the country in the upper quartile for length of stay in its peer group for all specialties? That is what the trust is aiming for.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/9">The trust must reduce bed occupancy to 90 per cent. That should be possible if the trust ensures that there are no unnecessary admissions and that the entire process is speeded up. It is essential to reduce bed occupancy because the people who worked out the contract with the private finance initiative hospital in Worcester allowed there to be a surcharge for occupancy above 90 per cent. It is well known that 85 per cent. is the ideal for bed occupancy in an acute general hospital. The trust worked on a figure of 90 per cent., which was unrealistic given that people now agree that there has been a reduction in the number of acute beds. The trust is therefore paying some &pound;2 million a year more simply because it exceeded 90 per cent. occupancy. Unfortunately, those who were involved in the negotiations have long since left, so we cannot hold them to account.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/10">The second option in the list is about reconfiguring and rationalising sites, particularly focusing on sites and specialties with big deficits or staffing difficulties, but they include some of the bread-and-butter things that are most important to people: obstetrics, paediatrics, accident and emergency, and cancer services. Obviously, reduction or loss of such services will be violently opposed by everybody. I shall return to that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/11">Another option is to increase trading&mdash;again, absolutely obvious. Bring back the work that is going out of the county. However, that will be harder with choose and book and with competition from the private sector, particularly if it is allowed to compete on advantageous terms. Another option is to improve income recovery&mdash;again, obvious. Get back every bit of money. That should be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/12">An ominous option is to cease trading in unprofitable activity. Thank goodness, that is not being followed up immediately. Based on the trust's own figures, unprofitable activity involves obstetrics, A and E, and cancer. Even in a health market, one cannot reduce such services. The only other option that I shall mention is refinancing the PFI contract. If, as I presume, that means lengthening the mortgage, I would be very sorry if that were to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/13">On consultation, I welcome the trust's promise that the process will be open and that decisions will not be made beforehand. At present, we are in a period of pre-consultation. I refer to the splendid document, &quot;Keeping the NHS Local&mdash;A New Direction of Travel&quot;, which was published by the Department of Health in 2003. It states that consultation</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/14" class="indent">&quot;with patients and the public, and with staff, needs to begin right at the outset&mdash;before minds have been made up about how services could or should change.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/15">The document refers to the patient principle of</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/16" class="indent">&quot;developing options for change with people, not for them&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/17">It appears that the trust is taking those points on board in its pre-consultation, but there are huge problems for the managers in charge of the consultation. It must be seen to be fair to all people. I refer to a decision in Wyre Forest in 1997&ndash;98 that was, patently, not fair. It involved robbery of one area's services to attempt to solve problems elsewhere in the county's NHS, and was brought about at the end of the consultation by a pseudo-statistical option appraisal and a vote by 80 per cent. of the county against the other 20 per cent. The result was inevitable, and, as has been shown, did not lead to improved quality of care. That is why we cannot have any more drastic downgrading. It has not saved money but has cost local people a great deal of their own money and has led to many problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/18">I have quoted this before but shall quote it again. Andy Black, the well-known health service consultant, stated in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> last year:</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/19" class="indent">&quot;If the price of moving the complex emergency to an appropriate centre of expertise is that this patient is accompanied by another nine or 10 patients who are not complex acute cases then another set of problems is launched.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/20">There certainly are problems when a patient is taken out of their own area. Sometimes it is easier to admit them than to let them go home in the middle of the night, particularly as a taxi from Worcester to Kidderminster can cost &pound;40 in the evening. What elderly person has &pound;40 in their pocket for an unexpected need?</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/21">I shall spend a few moments on answers and solutions, because I strongly believe that they exist, and again I shall refer to &quot;Keeping the NHS Local&quot;. In the valuable summary of consultation responses that came out in July 2004 we find this sentence under the heading &quot;What next?&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/22" class="indent">&quot;Keeping the NHS Local is now the core guidance to be followed by all health services planning change.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/23">It is reconfigurations that always cause the problems. As I have said, they must be fair. They must also make economies where the major deficits are and must be viewed from a county-wide perspective to ensure that what is developed is best for the county as a whole and all the people.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/24">No one is saying that we must keep everything at every site. We know that such complex procedures as cardiology and neurosurgery, transplantation, some cancer treatment and major vascular surgery are better carried out in major units. That is borne out again in &quot;Keeping the NHS Local&quot;, which says:</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/25" class="indent">&quot;Evidence from UK and US does demonstrate a close correlation between hospital volume and outcome in major surgery such as cardiology, neurosurgery, liver transplantation&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/26">and so on. However, it also says:</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/27" class="indent">&quot;Evidence from research does not support any general presumption that large hospitals benefit from economies of scale or that service concentration leads to improved outcomes for patients.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/28">That is a reference to the bread-and-butter services to which everybody should have easy access and which must be retained locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/29">That can be done by sharing and partnerships. Why have we not heard of trouble from Hexham and Bishop Auckland? It is because they have partnerships and degrees of downgrading that have worked, without causing a vast amount of strife. They have lost their A and E departments, but, in return, they have 24-hour urgent-care centres, where a doctor is always present. They can fulfil the requirement of &quot;Keeping the NHS Local&quot; to provide a minimum first port of call to assess, treat and, if necessary, transfer. They have kept medical admissions. What was so unacceptable at Kidderminster was the loss of the A and E and all acute admissions. That happened in the days when it was believed that hospitals had to have surgery if they were to keep medicine. Thank goodness that view has now been overruled, and acute medical admissions can be retained without keeping all of surgery</p>

	<p pid="a.221.0/1">The hon. Gentleman and I clearly share a great interest in this subject. Is he saying that the Alex could become one of the centres that he refers to at Hexham? Is he aware that at present about 48,000 cases go to the Alex every year and 52,000 to Worcester? Does he believe that it is remotely feasible that that could or should happen?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-15a.222.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="222"  time="13:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051115/halltext/51115h02.htm#51115h02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.222.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> on securing the debate. I also acknowledge <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1460" name="Julie Kirkbride">the presence of the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride)</phrase> and of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1776" name="Jacqui Smith">my right hon. Friend the Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith)</phrase>, who has written to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State about her concerns for the hospitals in her area. Like the hon. Member for Wyre Forest, she has been in touch with Michael O'Riordan, as far as I am aware, about concerns over the proposals. The hon. Member for Bromsgrove may also have written to him, but that has not been brought to my attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/2">These are complex issues. My primary responsibility as a Minister is public health, so I am always considering ways in which we can prevent people ending up in hospital in the first place, as far as that is possible. I also examine the scope for providing the type of services that people in the 21st century want and that meet their needs, whether in hospitals or in local community services, which I would describe as &quot;closer to home&quot; rather than &quot;primary care&quot; services. Those outside the profession do not really know what that term means.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/3">Before I deal with particular issues that the hon. Gentleman raised, I shall spend a few moments talking about some improvements that the Government have made through our programme of investment and reform, because the two go side by side.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/4">I was pleased to attend a debate in Westminster Hall on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-02">2 November</phrase> during which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1912" name="Bob Blizzard">my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard)</phrase> talked about an orthopaedic surgeon at his local hospital who performs operations back to back. That surgeon performs more operations than two other consultants in his hospital. It is interesting to hear, for a change, about a different method of working that produces significant results.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/5">We have significantly increased funding to the three Worcestershire primary care trusts of Wyre Forest, Redditch and Bromsgrove, and South Worcestershire. Hon. Members may be aware that, for the current financial year, these three PCTs have been allocated a total of &pound;509.7 million, which is a cash increase of &pound;43.1 million&mdash; a 9.2 per cent. increase. In the next two years, these PCTs will receive a further increase of &pound;113.4 million&mdash;a 20 per cent. increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/6">These record levels of investment will help to improve the standard of health care for the people of Worcestershire, but that money must be used well. The money is provided for both the short and the medium term, but it also needs to be used to underpin necessary reform of the clinical service. That is very much linked to what the community wants and to the shape of the community and its different needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/7">In March 2001, more than 1,200 patients at the Worcestershire acute hospitals NHS trust waited for between six and eight months for in-patient treatment. Almost 1,000 patients waited for more than nine months. However, by September 2005, only 154 were waiting for between six and eight months. Since March 2004, no patient has been waiting longer than nine months for treatment. So, congratulations to the planners and the staff for their role in that. Out-patient times have also been reduced. In March 2002, nearly 1,000 patients had to wait 13 weeks or more for an out-patient appointment. By September of this year, that figure had been reduced to 130. Again, good work is being done locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/8">There are more staff working at the trust now compared with April 2000, when it was first established. There are more consultants, doctors, nurses, midwives, therapists and scientists, and 134 more health care assistants. I am pleased to say that, alongside that, money has been invested in better facilities for staff, because that is important in terms of recruitment and retention. That includes &pound;87 million for the new Worcestershire Royal hospital and &pound;14 million for the new treatment centre at Kidderminster. New MRI and CT scanners have been delivered to the Alexandra hospital, as well as a new cardiac catheter laboratory. That is progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/9">I note the comments that have been made about the financial situation at the trust. Those are important matters. I do not think that the issue is necessarily something new that those locally have just become aware of. We know that with funding&mdash;I have outlined the substantial increase in funding&mdash;comes financial responsibility. It is important that all NHS organisations aim to achieve financial balance. I am aware that there have been calls for the Department of Health to intervene in cases where the local NHS is struggling to achieve a financial balance. That has happened in a number of areas throughout the country. However, the problem is that intervening would penalise those organisations that do achieve a balance year on year. In such situations, the NHS organisations concerned must work with their strategic health authorities and primary care trusts to develop financial recovery plans that will help them to achieve a sound financial footing.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/10">Comments have been made&mdash;the matter has also been raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Redditch in letters to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and to the trust&mdash;about the private finance initiative and payments to the contractor arising from the building of the Worcestershire Royal hospital. Of course, PFIs have enabled us to progress to have the largest hospital-building programme in the history of the NHS. I do not think that anybody in the areas served by the hospital would say, &quot;No, no. Have the money back. We wish that we hadn't gone down this route.&quot; However, some issues have developed with the initiative as it has grown over time. One hundred and twenty-seven new hospitals have been, or are in the process of being, delivered through this method.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/11">I understand what the hon. Member for Wyre Forest said with regard to the current financial pressures in the trust, which he and others feel are not being helped by having to make increased payments to the contractor concerned. However, my understanding is that some of the problems are created or exacerbated by the bed occupancy rates and the length of time that people are staying in hospital. The threshold is hit and suddenly the extra payments come into place. I hope that these issues will be considered closely during the pre-consultation period and also during the statutory consultation period due to begin in December. That particular aspect needs to be considered as a first requirement&mdash;in relation to links to improvements in the service, both in terms of what is provided in the community and the high level of occupancy rates&mdash;before moving on to any other areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/12">I know that there have been discussions with the Department of Health on the PFI and that questions have been raised about whether there is a possibility of changing it. All that I would say at this stage is that people should not be looking to that&mdash;I am not suggesting that the hon. Gentleman is doing so&mdash;as a solution to the problem in the first instance. Part of the solution lies in the way in which beds are used in the hospital, how long they are used for and how they link to other services in the community that could meet needs better and either stem the flow or get people out quicker into better social care settings. That is an important matter that has been raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/13">Issues have been raised about the finances on which the current proposals are being based and the options that the consultants arrived at. I know that my right hon. Friend and other hon. Members are in close discussion about how the figures were arrived at. They are scrutinising them, which is entirely right; it is a proper way to engage in the process. I am sure that other hon. Members, like my right hon. Friend, are meeting their constituents to ensure that they understand what is going on so that they can ask questions of those who have to be held to account in relation to the proposals that they will put forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/14">However, there are clearly some financial problems at the Worcestershire acute hospitals NHS trust that have to be overcome in partnership with PCTs and the West Midlands South strategic health authority, but also as part of the public engagement, which will hopefully be understood and supported by the wider community and those served by the trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/15">The hon. Gentleman has already mentioned that there was an accumulated financial deficit of &pound;23.8 million that arose over a three-year period between 2001 and 2004. I should point out that the strategic health authority anticipates that the trusts will be in a break-even financial position in 2005&ndash;06, but there is an underlying deficit of about &pound;20 million. That is why a major service and financial review is being undertaken by the trust. Its objectives are to examine how that &pound;20 million will be recovered so that the trust can be restored to financial balance from 2006&ndash;07 and to have a better look at what services are working and how services currently provided might be better provided in future. I am certainly not an expert in that area; it is down to those closest to the local communities, including parliamentary representatives, to make such representations and, I hope, engage in the discussion of ideas.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/16">The aim of the review was to identify the future size and shape of safe, affordable, high-quality secondary care services. The review is redefining where boundaries lie between primary and secondary care and how community hospital and services should integrate with the proposed future configuration of secondary care services. That is important, considering that the Department held a big consultation during the summer on what people want from health services in their community. This work concerns the provision of services that are fit for purpose and the needs of communities in the years ahead, but it also needs to be linked to sustainable financial balance.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/17">I appreciate the concerns of hon. Members, who will no doubt be worried about particular specialties that I understand are now subject to further discussions and about the potential impact on their local hospitals arising from this work. The initial work was presented to the trust board on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-06">6 October</phrase> and those options are now being discussed as part of the pre-consultation stage. I shall get back to the hon. Gentleman on his question about trusts that are in the upper quartile in relation to length of stay, and I shall follow that up with a written reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/18">The hon. Gentleman also made a point about those who are chronically ill and how they might be affected by the proposals. Any trust or strategic health authority engaged in this discussion has to take into account how it will deliver a health service for those most in need. Alongside that will be the Government's support and direction from the targets that we have set on those issues that are of most concern, such as cancer, chronic heart disease and so forth.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/19">The pre-consultation work started in early October and will continue until December. The formal public consultation document is expected to be launched in December or January. I hope and trust that everyone concerned will feel that they have an ample and transparent opportunity to have a real say in that process and that hon. Members will be kept informed, rather than having to ask to be kept informed. I have talked to representatives from the local area and asked them to assure me that that will be the case. If any objections emerge, the local overview and scrutiny committee will consider those and the matter could be referred to Ministers for a final decision. I hope that there will be a full and detailed debate on those matters, which I know are of huge concern to right hon. and hon. Members.</p>

	<p pid="a.227.1/1">My hon. Friend the Minister will be aware that I secured an Adjournment debate on this matter just 18 months ago. However, it is time to revisit the issues that I raised then. I have given my hon. Friend clear indications of the issues that I wish to raise and I hope that her response will spare me some of the ballast that occasionally works its way into ministerial responses.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport recently announced his rejection of the Leeds supertram bid. I do not wish to revisit that decision, but rather what flows from it. If my hon. Friend's response contains a lengthy discourse on the supertram, I ask that she omit it for the purposes of the debate. The supertram was never a one-club solution to the city's transport problems. I have only ever regarded it as one component of a three-pronged strategy to meet our transport needs. Any solution to the transport problems of the city must include bus and rail services, which are far more relevant to the communities that I represent than the supertram.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/3">I hope that, as one door closes, another is opening. Given my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's indication that the Department for Transport will work with Leeds on a bus solution, I hope that it will examine the role that rail can play, particularly for the communities in my constituency. I hope that my hon. Friend will appreciate why there is some scepticism in Leeds about how far buses can deliver the solution that we seek. Bus services have a major role to play, which could be even greater, not just through extra investment, but through changes to the environment in which they are planned and delivered. However, buses are not a one-club solution; rail has a major role to play.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/4">Since deregulation in 1986, bus services have faced a consistent and irreversible decline, and Pudsey is no exception. I have campaigned vigorously in Parliament for improvements to the way in which bus services are provided. Earlier this year, I introduced a ten-minute Bill designed to facilitate the introduction of quality bus contracts. Private bus operators have had 19 years to show that they can provide decent services, and they have failed. It is time that they were made accountable to passengers and communities. Since deregulation, quality and standards have fallen dramatically, fares have risen by almost 50 per cent. in real terms, and the number of passengers has fallen by over a third in West Yorkshire. In round figures, that represents about 100 million passenger journeys. Deregulation has meant that bus companies can pick and choose which services to provide. They are free to make profits while providing poor services. The result is that many people have been denied a reliable and affordable bus service for travel to work, school, college, shops, health centres and hospitals. Week in, week out, services are chopped, changed, missing or late. Passengers suffer or vote with their feet.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/5">Under the deregulated system, there is little that passengers, communities, councillors, even MPs, or Metro&mdash;the passenger transport executive&mdash;can do to ensure that private bus companies maintain or improve services. I appreciate that partnership is the Government's preferred way forward, and it works to a degree in some areas. However, where partnership works, it is often in special circumstances that cannot easily be replicated in places such as Leeds or Pudsey. Those are isolated examples where it suits the operators to engage.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/6">Passenger transport executives are totally dependent on local monopoly providers, such as First, in Leeds, to act responsibly and to take a long-term view. That is far from the norm in my experience. Venture off the beaten track where bus services operate well and the nightmare begins for constituents such as mine. Service changes have tended to concentrate on high-frequency major routes in Leeds, such as the No. 4 and No. 16 routes in my area, while frequency has been reduced on services that penetrate local housing estates and provide links to Pudsey, the Owlcotes centre and Bramley.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/7">Recent changes to services such as the No. 97, the No. 647 and the No. 651 in the Guiseley and Yeadon areas have resulted in a significant reduction in links with nearby Bradford. That has caused tremendous hardship for regular travellers who depend on those services. Reliability and punctuality have been major problems and continue to be so. In only four of the last 12 months to September 2005 have more than 90 per cent. of First bus services in Leeds been observed to run on time&mdash;that is, up to one minute early or five minutes late. Since October 2005, early indications reveal an even lower average of 84 per cent. That is clearly unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/8">Fares have gone through the roof. In the period April 2004 to June 2005, First increased off-peak fares in Leeds by 27 per cent. and peak fares by 19 per cent. During the same period the cost of living rose by only 3 per cent. The bus industry's own figures illustrate that operating costs for the period were about 9 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/9">We need partnership where it can work, and we must continue to invest in partnership where it works, with operators who are prepared to take a long-term view. However, we also need much tighter regulatory intervention. Quality contracts would specify the routes, quality and performance of bus services over a much wider area. Bus operators would have to tender for those contracts, rather than being able to cherry-pick, as they can at present. Services could then be properly monitored by the passenger transport executives and much better safeguarded.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/10">At present, the conditions that the passenger transport executives have to satisfy to implement a quality contract are far too severe. My Bill proposed that the main test should be that a scheme represented value for money in terms of &quot;economy, efficiency and effectiveness&quot;, rather than the much more onerous test of being &quot;the only practicable way&quot; of implementing policies and strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/11">Quality contracts already operate to good effect in London, as my hon. Friend the Minister is no doubt aware from her own constituency and her constituents' experience. Bus use in regulated London increased by about 10 per cent. last year, whereas outside the capital it fell by nearly 3 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/12">The results of a recent survey conducted by the passenger transport executive group are, therefore, not surprising: an average of 38 per cent. of MPs thought that their constituents were satisfied with the quality of their local bus services. There was a marked London-regional divide, with 88 per cent. of MPs in London, compared with 27 per cent. in the midlands and east, 30 per cent. in the south and 19 per cent. in the north expressing satisfaction. There was a huge disparity. If things are good enough for the Minister's constituents, they should be good enough for mine and those of other MPs who serve constituencies outside London.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/13">On average, bus companies in London make much lower profits than those in passenger transport executive areas. The West Yorkshire subsidiaries of First Bus have consistently returned profits of around 17 per cent., compared with 10 to 12 per cent. in London. The difference between West Yorkshire and the industry norm represents about &pound;6 million, which could be reinvested in services. Unfortunately, passenger transport executives such as Metro are able to influence directly only about 20 per cent. of the network that they provide through tendered services. There is little competition for tenders, so it is difficult to test whether best value is being obtained in those cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/14">Given the new emphasis on buses, it is disappointing that we have been unable to make progress on the A65 Kirkstall road quality bus initiative, which would serve part of my constituency. It is estimated that that initiative would save around a quarter of the journey time for the buses on the corridor and would have a cost-benefit ratio of about 2:1. I understand that the scheme was previously provisionally approved, but then &quot;unapproved&quot; due to changes in scope and cost. A revised scheme was submitted to the Department for Transport in July 2005. I understand that the latest position is that the scheme will have to be &quot;remitted to the regions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/15">Other, similar schemes, such as the Yorkshire bus initiative, have also been &quot;remitted to the regions&quot;. The Yorcard scheme, which would have conveyed great benefits to passengers, was approved and then had that approval withdrawn. I would welcome the Minister's comments on those bids, and hope to receive an indication that she may review them and now consider them in a more favourable light, given the rejection of the Leeds supertram proposals and the obvious emphasis that is now being placed on a bus solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/16">Even with investment and a fair wind&mdash;ideally one provided by quality bus contracts&mdash;buses have a limited role to play in some of the major corridors in my constituency, such as the A65 and the ring road. That is why rail must be closely considered. Rail users in my constituency have been ill served by privatisation. My constituency is served by three stations on three routes: Horsforth, New Pudsey and Guiseley. There have been some improvements. For example, all three stations have undergone major refurbishment. The efficiency of Leeds City station has been increased by a &pound;250 million investment that has helped to reduce congestion and delays. A rail passenger partnership grant enabled the provision of excellent new 333-class four-car rolling stock on the Airedale and Wharfedale line, which I use.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/17">Rail has potentially a much greater role to play. Between 1994 and 2000, use of the West Yorkshire rail network increased by 44 per cent. from 11.5 million to 16.6 million passengers. However, that has come at a price. The Select Committee on Transport report on overcrowding on public transport concluded that overcrowding is worse in West Yorkshire than in the south-east. The experience of my constituents backs that up.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/18">Despite the recent renewal of rolling stock, capacity on the Wharfedale line is approaching saturation point at peak times. It is under pressure from new developments such as the former High Royds asylum development in Menston, where almost 600 new homes are to be provided in addition to many others already built in the Guiseley area. The Department for Transport is currently funding eight carriages up to 2007 on the Wharfedale line. I ask the Minister urgently to review that, so that she can confirm at the earliest opportunity that that rolling stock will continue to operate beyond 2007, because that is crucial.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/19">Passengers on the Caldervale line serving New Pudsey station face significant overcrowding problems. The service is mainly operated by ageing diesel rolling stock that does not meet modern-day standards by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/20">The Harrogate line, which goes through Horsforth in my constituency, is one of the most overcrowded routes in West Yorkshire. Indeed, once the service has called at Horsforth during peak times, it regularly goes straight through into Leeds, leaving passengers standing at the two stations at Headingley and Burley Park.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/21">The Minister is obviously aware that the Northern Rail franchise is under review. It is essential that that review reflects the present demand and pressure on services and the potential for carrying even more passengers and getting even more people out of their cars. Additional units are needed not only to ease present capacity problems but to cater for future growth and especially to serve some of the priority station proposals that are still waiting on the stocks. They cannot go forward because there is insufficient capacity to meet the passenger numbers that it is anticipated will be generated by building the stations. That seems a perverse and ironic way to run any business, whether or not it involves transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/22">West Yorkshire Metro has a blueprint for increasing patronage by more than 50 per cent. over the next 10 years with what I regard, and I hope that the Minister would regard, as a relatively modest investment of between &pound;5 million and &pound;6 million per annum over the next 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/23">I want to take the opportunity, because of the Minister's responsibilities, to raise Leeds Bradford airport. Most people would accept that if an airport site was sought in Leeds today, the present site of Leeds Bradford airport would not even be considered. Its limitations are considerable, but the point on which I seek a response from my hon. Friend concerns the current process of developing the airport's master plan and how it will expand in years to come. Even at present levels of operation, there is a need for improvements to road safety and access around the airport. Transport links are poor and the roads are widely regarded as inadequate and unsafe. The implications of growth cannot be addressed without considering the impact on local communities and the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/24">When presenting the airports White Paper to the House, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State clearly acknowledged the need for a balance between growth in air travel and its environmental impact not only on climate change but on those living near airports, such as my constituents in Horsforth, Yeadon and Guiseley. He confirmed that we needed to reduce and minimise the impact of airports on local communities and the natural environment. Leeds city council's current leadership, however, recently suggested that the White Paper allows for the airport to grow &quot;willy-nilly&quot;. It is ironic, therefore, that the controlling coalition on the council is looking to sell off the airport, which is municipally owned, thereby relinquishing the total control that elected councils have over it. I suspect that the trick is to sell it off to a private partner, with a guarantee of expansion, growth and profit, and then blame any unpopular developments on Government policy. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to confirm today that it is not Government policy to allow any airport, especially Leeds Bradford, to expand willy-nilly and that the airport master plan currently being devised will strike a proper balance between growth and the impact on surrounding communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/25">As I have said, any airport planning process must be based on proper public consultation. The master plan must be underpinned by an independent environmental impact assessment, which should include consideration of the impact, prevention and minimisation of air and noise pollution, climate change and other associated issues, such as operating hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/26">The people of West Yorkshire clearly want to fly from their nearest airport at the cheapest price to the greatest number of destinations. Although my constituents living near the airport realise that there is a price to be paid for that location, they rightly believe that their quality of life should not be seriously undermined by unrestricted and excessive growth. A fair and sustainable balance must be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/27">I note that there are only 13 minutes left, so I leave it to my hon. Friend the Minister to try to reassure me on the crucial transport issues in my constituency.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-15a.233.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" speakername="Karen Buck" colnum="233"  time="13:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051115/halltext/51115h03.htm#51115h03_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.233.1/1">I do not accept my hon. Friend's description of the service. I understand that the successes in bus patronage have in many instances come about through operators and partners choosing routes that are most likely to increase patronage levels. In a trade-off when one does not have unlimited resources, there is always tension about where resources shall be committed. It makes a great deal of sense for a proportion of the &pound;1 billion that we spend on bus services overall to be devoted to increasing patronage as much as possible. It is also true that a separate social exclusion agenda is based more on meeting the needs of isolated communities. Inevitably, there are never the resources to provide all the services that we should like.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/2">Our experience throughout the country, in different areas with different conditions, has been that it is possible to make striking improvements in bus services when there is proper planning for and targeting of good routes. It will be at the local level that the companies and their partners will have to make choices and, inevitably, trade-offs about where they invest.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/3">My hon. Friend asked particularly about the issue of quality contracts. As he knows, the Transport Act 2000 provides a mechanism for introducing a quality contract scheme, although only where that would be the only practicable way of implementing the authority's bus strategy, and would do so economically, efficiently and effectively. Since my hon. Friend's previous Adjournment debate on this subject, the Department has published guidance on how to apply, the supporting evidence required and the matters that the Secretary of State will take into account in considering the merits of the case. An order has been made and brought into force, reducing from 21 months to six months the minimum time that must elapse between making a quality contract scheme and bringing it into force.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/4">As my hon. Friend was comparing and contrasting, London has had a different form of regulated transport since the 1930s&mdash;not just recently&mdash;and was not affected by deregulation in the 1980s. To introduce a regulated regime in an area that is currently deregulated raises a number of difficult issues, particularly the reduction of commercial opportunities for operators, which did not arise in London. That is one reason why the requirements of the 2000 Act are exacting. Another is that there are many places where the deregulated market is delivering high quality bus services and patronage growth. Brighton, Cambridge, Nottingham, Oxford, Telford and York are some examples. More recently, there has been impressive growth in areas such as Bedford, Exeter and Peterborough. In general, those are places where good partnership between the local authority and the bus operators is working. That is the model that we wish to encourage.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/5">As I mentioned, on the specific area of bus services, we shall shortly announce how the &pound;350 million that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced for the extension of the concessionary bus services will be distributed, and I hope that that will provide an additional boost for transport in areas such as my hon. Friend's.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/6">There are improvements planned on rail services. We are spending more than &pound;80 million a week on the railways and there are a number of examples of the benefits from that investment in West Yorkshire, where patronage has grown from 16 million to 21 million over the past five years. My hon. Friend will be aware of the recent &pound;250 million redevelopment of Leeds city station. It has seen the development of new platforms and a reorganisation of the track layout to the western end of the station. That has improved facilities for passengers, increased the reliability of services and added to the station's capacity. A new bus-rail interchange facility has also been opened outside Leeds city station, making the transfer between bus and rail services much easier.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/7">The new TransPennine franchise began in February 2004 and will deliver more than &pound;250 million of investment, with a brand new fleet of 50 trains due to be introduced in 2006. Also benefiting Leeds and West Yorkshire is a 44 per cent. increase in east coast mainline services since 1996: there are currently 53 services per day, and that will rise to 66 by December 2007. Those are substantial improvements. At a more local level, 16 new four-coach class 333 electric trains have been introduced on the Airedale and Wharfedale lines. They have seen a significant increase in patronage.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/8">If my hon. Friend will forgive me, there are many other things that I could say, and I am happy to get back to him with some detail, but I should like to spend my last few seconds on Leeds-Bradford airport. As my hon. Friend will be aware, the development of that airport is part of a strategy developed in the air transport White Paper to promote regional airports. It has many benefits for the regional economy as part of the connectivity theme, which is important foe economic growth in the area. However, I am aware that current road links to and from the airport can suffer from congestion, especially in peak hours. Fast and regular bus services now run from Bradford and Leeds city centres and provide a much improved public transport option. In addition, the A6120 study has considered how improvements to road-based access can be made. My hon. Friend has concerns about how the expansion of the airport may impact on the environment and on existing residents, but I assure him that we shall take full account of environmental considerations. We made it clear in the air transport White Paper that airport expansion is subject to environmental constraints.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/9" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/10" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at Two o'clock.</p>
