	<p pid="a.140.2/1">As a member of the Committee, may I put on the record my appreciation of the way in which the hon. Gentleman chaired the Committee during the preparation of what were extremely technical evidence sessions. We are grateful to him for doing that.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.2/2">The hon. Gentleman mentioned that the cap-and-trade scheme has the theoretical possibility of delivering results, which is why we should be doing our best to make it successful. However, he is aware, as we all are, of the danger of leakage from a cap-and-trade scheme, which means that this country could meet&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-25a.141.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1853" speakername="Tim Yeo" colnum="141"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071025/halltext/71025h0001.htm#07102555000256">
	<p pid="a.141.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his kind remarks. I appreciate the contribution that he makes to the Committee. I agree with his point, to which I shall refer specifically in a moment or two, and we highlighted it in the report that we issued earlier in the year and returned to it in our comments on the Government's response. It is true that, to make a cap-and-trade system effective, we require greater political will than has been shown so far in the EU system or any other.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/2">Certainly, we are much more conscious of climate change than we were five years ago. It is equally certain that, five years from now, international alarm about climate change will be much greater than it is today. Then, if not now, the public might be clamouring for the further, tougher and more radical steps that are needed to tackle the problem effectively. The continuing increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere might be such already that dangerous and irreversible climate change is unavoidable. Even if that is not the case, it is very likely that the steps needed to prevent it would involve far greater cuts in greenhouse gas emissions than those in the targets that have been agreed. We talk about cuts of 60 per cent., but it is almost certain that we would need cuts of 90 per cent. by a significantly earlier date, if we are to contain the risk of irreversible climate change. Of course, neither Britain nor anywhere else in the world is anywhere near being on target to achieve even the modest and, in my view, insufficiently challenging targets that we have set ourselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/3">That is the background to the Committee's report and the debate. The importance of the EU emissions trading scheme is that it is the first, and so far only, international trading system to be operating fully. The first three-year phase ends at the end of 2007, so this is a good time to take stock of progress. The importance of the scheme extends far beyond Europe; the whole world is watching to see how the EU ETS works. If it should fail or prove seriously defective, the chances of emissions trading being adopted in other parts of the world might be reduced, although in my view the momentum from the business community in the United States is such that a national US scheme will inevitably start within the next two or three years. Either way, it is vital that we learn the lessons from the first phase of the EU ETS and apply them in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/4">I hope that the Government will be honest and realistic, and not try to over-claim the results so far. Our report highlighted the need for the Government to be more transparent about emissions trading. So far, phase 1 has achieved very little: it has not cut carbon emissions, and it has not achieved a sustainable price for carbon, which would incentivise investment in low-carbon technology. It has failed on the two most important objectives. However, we must not be too harsh. The scheme, by its very existence, has done more than any other scheme elsewhere. It has shown that trading can be undertaken internationally and a market established, which, by themselves, are worthwhile gains.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/5">There are two main flaws in phase 1. First, the national caps were set far too high; indeed, only Britain had to make significant cuts in emissions from its pre-phase 1 levels. Secondly, the allowances were allocated by bureaucratic decision instead of by being optioned. The first flaw has, with pressure from Britain, been partially addressed in phase 2. After a certain amount of haggling, the national caps for phase 2, which were announced after our report was published, were set at more realistic levels, and the forward market price suggests that the reasonable expectation is that phase 2 will force some meaningful reduction in emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/6">The second flaw, however, has been largely unaddressed, because the EU has unfortunately funked the need to introduce more options. Instead, it has set a 10 per cent. limit on the allowances that can be allocated by auction. We must be clear about how damaging that is. Emissions trading will cut emissions on an economically efficient and fair basis only when the trading is on a pure market basis, but the bureaucratic allocation of allowances undermines that purity. It guarantees inefficiency and unfairness in the scheme. We must therefore move as quickly as possible to auction 100 per cent. of allowances. It should be a definite target for phase 3, and we must make progress towards it in the meantime.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/7">One advantage of a 100 per cent. auction is that it removes completely the need for national caps; all that is needed is a single EU-wide cap within which allowances can be bought by businesses in any EU country. The only issue that 100 per cent. auctions raise is what happens to the money that is paid. Business and individual consumers are understandably suspicious that it will just become a giant stealth tax. The money raised from auctioning should therefore be ring-fenced by law and returned to businesses and their customers in the form of lower taxes elsewhere. If those lower taxes were chosen to reward greener choices in the relevant industry, they could be used to incentivise further low-carbon technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/8">There is an opportunity and a challenge for the EU with the forthcoming inclusion of aviation in the emissions trading scheme. Airlines are among the most experienced and effective lobbyists of any industry, and aviation will bring American airlines and companies into the EU ETS more directly than ever before. However, there is no reason why there should not be another single EU-wide cap on aviation emissions, which would apply to all domestic flights in the EU. It could and should apply to all flights&mdash;passenger and freight aircraft alike&mdash;taking off and landing in EU countries. No allowance should be allocated by bureaucrats and none should be given free to the airlines; instead, all should be auctioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/9">Individual airlines&mdash;there are some honourable ones&mdash;that already take the need to reduce their carbon footprint seriously would have nothing to fear from the introduction of such a system. That approach would be the most effective way of using emissions trading to cut overall aviation emissions. Alas, the lobbying process and, I fear, the pleasure that some European Commission officials take in the power that they exercise when allocating allowances mean that such an approach is unlikely to be adopted in quite that form. As our report pointed out, there is a risk that, if the airlines are given the initial allowances free, they will enjoy the same windfall profits that some power companies did when they passed on the notional cost of allowances to their customers, despite having paid nothing for them. If airlines obtain a windfall advantage from a scheme intended to incentivise them to cut emissions, it suggests that neither the EU nor the airline industry is yet sufficiently serious about tackling the threat of climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/10">Reporting was another important concern of the Committee's report. Owing to the fact that the EU ETS is a trading scheme, firms can achieve their necessary targets for cutting emissions by buying allowances issued to other countries, rather than by cutting emissions. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase>, who has now left the Chamber, made that point earlier. In theory, there is nothing wrong with that situation. The purpose of a market is to allow resources to be allocated efficiently, and the purpose of the EU ETS is to cut emissions globally, as well as locally. If it is cheaper to cut emissions abroad than at home, it makes sense to do so, but we must be honest about the extent to which that is happening. In publishing figures, the Government must distinguish more clearly between actual emissions reductions at UK installations and the purchase of carbon credits by British companies to meet their own reduction targets. There was concern about that in phase 1, because of the over-allocation of allowances to other EU countries, and it impacts directly on how much the system helps us to achieve our domestic targets for emissions cuts.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/11">A related issue is the way in which emissions reductions are calculated. The Committee expressed its concern about the excessive use of business-as-usual projections to provide the baseline against which claims were made about the size of subsequent emissions reductions. The National Audit Office exposed the uncertainties attached to forecasts of future emission levels on a business-as-usual basis, and the Committee strongly believes that the only safe way to proceed is to use absolute figures for actual carbon emissions as the basis for making progress comparisons. Caps that are calculated by reference to business as usual have very little value. I hope that the Minister will persuade her Government colleagues to address the Committee's concerns about that point in future documents. The pre-Budget report, which was published only two weeks ago, contains some rather misleading statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/12">Another of our concerns is the variation in the extent to which different EU countries can use clean development mechanism credits to meet their national targets. There needs to be a consistent figure for the limit on which CDM credits can be used to meet domestic and EU targets. Again, there is nothing wrong in principle with using the CDM, but there must be a clear statement about how much it is used and a realistic limit put on the contribution from that source.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/13">The ETS also raises issues about competitiveness. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1842" name="Joan Walley">The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Joan Walley)</phrase> expressed a particular concern about that during the Committee's work. Unfortunately, she cannot attend the debate today because she is indisposed. The competitiveness concerns relate to the burdens that may be placed on a business that has to take part in emissions trading when competing with businesses in other parts of the world that may not have the same burden. I recognise that some companies have genuine concerns about that issue, but we must be careful about special pleading from vested interests. In the long term, it is in the interests of British business and individual firms for us to be in the forefront of low-carbon technology. There will be a huge advantage in 10 years' time for the firms, industries and countries that make the switch to low-carbon technology early on.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/14">I wish to touch briefly on the role that trading could play in the future. Crucial negotiations about the international response to climate change in the post-Kyoto phase are now beginning. It is vital that big emitters, such as China and America, become full participants in that phase, and the use of emissions trading is one way to draw them in. One of the most difficult issues in addressing climate change is equity&mdash;how can one fairly apportion the burden of combating a historical problem to which some countries have contributed much more than others, albeit unwittingly? That problem is made more complicated by the fact that the harmful consequences of climate change are also distributed inequitably. A landowner in the Scottish highlands may view the prospect of climate change with more equanimity that a subsistence farmer in a low-lying part of Africa or even a city dweller in Australia&mdash;at least, for a generation or two. In the end, the fairest solution must be based on contraction and convergence, as that would even out the amount of greenhouse gas emission for which different countries and individuals are responsible.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/15">Of course, it would be difficult to agree a basis and timetable for working towards a system of contraction and convergence, but the present situation, whereby per capita emissions are 100 times greater in a rich country, such as America, than a poor one, such as Tanzania, is unsustainable. Progress towards contraction and convergence could be facilitated by more international emissions trading. Unlike the alternative measures, such as carbon taxes, whose impact is essentially regressive on those who pay them, emissions trading offers a tool for tackling climate change whose impact is basically progressive.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-25a.155.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" speakername="Martin Horwood" colnum="155"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071025/halltext/71025h0003.htm#07102555000275">
	<p pid="a.155.0/1">I welcome the opportunity to serve under your chairmanship, Lady Winterton, and to contribute to a debate among so many distinguished members of the Environmental Audit Committee. I am a new member of the Committee and I was not involved in the preparation of the report, so I embark on my speech as a Front Bench spokesman with some hesitation and in the knowledge, which I have acquired from my first few meetings on the Committee, that some great experts on the subject are present.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/2">I agree with a great deal of what has been said, and the context in which the Committee Chairman put the debate is absolutely right. The overall picture on global warming and that for this country is serious. Under this Government, carbon emissions have regrettably increased rather than decreased, and the trend in emissions of both carbon dioxide and the basket of Kyoto greenhouse gases now seems to be a gently upward one. There is a risk that we are becoming complacent. Some Government Ministers&mdash;I do not include the Minister in this&mdash;have been tempted to repeat the claim that we are on course to meet the Kyoto targets. That might be technically true, given that the dash for gas drastically reduced this country's carbon emissions many years ago, but the actual current trend is now in the opposite direction, and much more drastic action is needed than is contemplated at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/3">The European emissions trading scheme was designed to fulfil the EU's Kyoto target of an 8 per cent. cut in emissions against 1990 levels by 2012. The Committee Chairman was right to point out that that has set a significant precedent for the whole world by way of an international policy mechanism that really tries to tackle climate change. It has set a particularly important precedent for the United States. I am pleased, therefore, that, although the EU position has not been comprehensively picked up by the United States Government, it has been picked up by many states and cities in the US. That is leading to clear pressure for a national trading scheme in the US as well. Logically, the schemes would link up in the end. It is good to think that the much maligned European Union has been responsible for that global step against the threat of climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/4">It has been common ground among those who have spoken so far that we must be realistic about phase 1. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1597" name="Martin Caton">The hon. Member for Gower (Mr. Caton)</phrase> rightly said that time had been wasted, that on balance the scheme had not cut carbon emissions, and that it had not established&mdash;the Committee Chairman said the same&mdash;a sustainable carbon price that can exercise real pressure to reduce carbon emissions at the commercial or economic level. We must therefore focus on phase 2, under which national caps will be lower. We hope that that will mean more scarcity and a higher price for carbon, so that there is more such pressure.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/5">However, there are flaws in that approach too, as the Committee Chairman also rightly pointed out, because there is still a limit on auctions. He is entirely in agreement with Liberal Democrat policy in that respect, which is to aim for 100 per cent. auctioning, so that the market can exercise the most efficient pressure on emissions of carbon dioxide, and possibly other greenhouse gases, if they can be included.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/6">Revenue from auctions should be ring fenced and should be used to reduce taxes or invest in low-carbon technologies. There have been other suggestions for the future of the ETS, including expansion to the aviation and maritime sectors. Road transport should be covered too. As the Chairman said, there is a lot more scope to go further and faster in the use of market instruments.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/7">There has been some speculation on the philosophical basis for such ideas from the democratic socialist and democratic conservative points of view. As a democratic liberal, I am enthusiastic about the use of free markets; they are welcome tools and are generally more efficient than Government in driving carbon reduction in the economy. However, they can have pernicious and unintended consequences, and they must be combined with other policies in order to ensure good outcomes. Trading schemes are a necessary but not sufficient part of policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/8">The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood described trading schemes as the main policy tool of the Government, but seemed wrongly to cast doubt on the principles behind them, saying that the market is artificial. I do not agree. The Stern report pointed out that the cost of carbon emissions might be a deferred one, but is real. Emissions trading schemes and pricing of carbon in general are trying to reflect in current policy and in current financial and economic calculations a price for carbon for the cost that will impinge on us all if we do not act soon.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/9">The hon. Member for Morley and Rothwell put things more poetically. He rightly said that trading schemes should not be seen as the saviour of us all, and he was right to alert us to the weaknesses. He said that clear, long-term signals were needed rather than just targets and mechanisms. That is absolutely right too. Support for and strengthening of the ETS need to be combined with real, practical policies to achieve reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/10">The contrast is with programmes such as the low-carbon buildings programme, which might be the best or worst example, depending on one's point of view. That programme is important, because households are responsible for 27 per cent. of this country's emissions. Unfortunately, the kind of &quot;stop-start&quot;, and then &quot;suspend&quot;, approach that has been adopted in that case has completely undermined the local markets for renewable energy and energy efficiency products. I am sure that many hon. Members have had experience of suppliers of such products in our constituencies who have become utterly frustrated with the low-carbon buildings programme and its predecessors. They have provided, not clear, long-term signals, but confused, short term ones. I hope that the Government are trying to address that at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/11">I have some suggestions for clear, long-term signals, which all have the virtue of being Liberal Democrat policies, so I am on safe ground. They are designed to create a policy context in which the overall targets and mechanisms are not the only elements, but in which real, practical steps are being taken. One policy has to be that of the international context. Other speakers have mentioned the importance of a post-Kyoto agreement, which is particularly significant in the context of competitiveness. If we impose a pressure on our economies to reduce carbon emissions such that there is financial cost, industries such as the aluminium industry that can relocate&mdash;the point has been discussed in this Chamber before&mdash;might be forced to move to economies in which carbon emissions do not bear the same costs. We may, in effect, drive industry from a carbon reduction regime to one without those reduction pressures, and make the situation worse by not addressing competitiveness. It is crucial that the next Kyoto phase includes economies such as the USA and Australia, so let us hope that there is progress in that direction. We may have to decide what sanctions to apply to economies that do not play ball in the international framework phases after Kyoto.</p>

	<p pid="a.160.5/1">The Minister is candid on renewables and she is absolutely right&mdash;we have been at the bottom of the league tables for the whole period of the Labour Government despite their rhetoric on climate change. She will accept that, internationally, the climate change imperative has held sway over politics for only 10 or 15 years. It is 20 years since Margaret Thatcher first kicked the whole issue off, but only in the past decade has it assumed absolute importance as a driver of public policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.5/2">If we look at what Germany has been able to achieve with its feed-in tariffs&mdash;they are based on a different policy model that the Conservatives are pledging to introduce along similar lines&mdash;we will see that they are the kind of policy drivers that we need. The UK has performed miserably in the past 10 years under this Government, and we cannot afford to continue with the status quo or to adopt a business-as-usual position. The ETS alone will not provide the required solutions, and the Minister cannot be satisfied with the unambitious target of 10 or 15 per cent. We are supposed to be a leader in Europe; after all, we have one of the largest economies in the region. Will Latvia or Estonia or eastern European fringe countries make up the difference? It would be an abrogation of responsibility and, more importantly, a loss of economic opportunity if we allowed the Government to get their way on the issue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-25a.166.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" speakername="Joan Ruddock" colnum="166"  time="016:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071025/halltext/71025h0005.htm#07102555000301">
	<p pid="a.166.1/1">Any further discussion will have to be left to my colleagues, particularly hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment. I apologise for the fact that he could not be here; hon. Members will appreciate that he is in Bali for preparations. The process also involves Ministers from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. They will hear this debate and will want to consider the points made.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/2">I recognise the concerns raised in the report about the competitiveness implications for industry; the hon. Gentleman is one of the hon. Members who raised the issue. The UK is keen to work with other member states and the Commission to develop a more harmonised approach to the scheme. The EAC report recommends that to protect UK competitiveness and prevent carbon leakage, Government should develop trade agreements. We feel that the way forward is to create incentives by opening up trade in new technologies and developing an international carbon market.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/3">The EU ETS needs to provide business with flexibility to make reductions where they are most cost-effective. That might mean that a proportion of emission reductions delivered by the UK cap will not occur within the UK. They might occur within the EU or outside it through the clean development mechanism. A number of hon. Members have mentioned that. I stress that such reductions are made and paid for by the UK economy, even though they occur in other countries. The problem that we face is global, and it is appropriate to contribute to bringing low-carbon technologies to other countries. We are counting such reductions in a transparent and open way.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/4">The Committee highlighted the need for greater transparency in a number of recommendations. The Government agree that it is important to the scheme's success that the market operates transparently and that we learn the lessons of phase 1, especially the need for market scarcity in phase 2 and beyond. Consequently, we have pressed hard for tight caps in phase 2 and are supporting the Commission in delivering them. Hon. Members will know that some other member states are contesting it, but we are supporting the Commission in that matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/5">Our main aim for the review of the scheme is achieving the market scarcity necessary to reduce emissions. Similarly, we see the need for transparency in reporting. The climate change Bill will be key to achieving that, as enhanced transparency will be provided by annual reporting from both a Select Committee on climate change and Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/6">The EAC report is critical of how Government have presented our emissions figures. I acknowledge that if the Government are to count overseas savings towards domestic targets, we must be clear and open about the number of savings purchased. We have endeavoured to do that in Government reporting. For example, our annual report to Parliament in July this year presented emission figures in a way that showed the number of allowances brought in from the EU ETS. A number of hon. Members have raised that issue. I refer to our response to recommendation 24, on page 31 of the Government response, which shows clearly that we produce data on both UK CO2 reductions and total reductions funded by the UK here and abroad. The EAC recently stated that the value of carbon credits is only as real as the trading scheme that issues them is effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/7">Questions were asked about the value of phase 1 and the suggestion that UK industry is merely buying hot air. Those are valid concerns. Indeed, they are the primary reason why we pushed for market scarcity in phase 2. However, it is difficult for the Government to make a judgment about the real value of any allowance. It is not the Government's place to say whether the market price is right. It could also lead to a limited incentive to use tight caps if member states cannot count emissions reductions from the EU ETS towards their national targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/8">The way forward is for the EU ETS to open up the whole carbon market. That can be done by expanding the scheme to new sectors and gases, and through linking the scheme to other trading schemes around the world. That could lead to greater investment in low carbon technology in developing countries, and it could deliver reductions at the least cost. Linking the EU ETS to other trading schemes will encourage countries to work together, which we should all consider to be essential. Only by working together can we fight global climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/9">I shall now address some of the specific points raised during the debate. The hon. Member for South Suffolk spoke about including aviation emissions in the EU ETS, and auctioning them in a way that would not give the airlines the opportunity to make windfall profits. We agree that if aviation enters the scheme, there would have to be a greater use of auctioning. The hon. Gentleman will know that the UK has pressed repeatedly for aviation emissions to be included in the EU ETS. At the moment, if airlines pass through the costs of allowances and make windfall profits, the Government need to assess the evidence on what the costs would be in order to influence the debate on auctioning the limits. We are saying that there would have to be auctioning, but the extent of the auctioning in relation to aviation would clearly need to be determined by further research.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/10">The hon. Gentleman also asked about business-as-usual projections, and whether we should use absolute figures. The Government agree that there are uncertainties in using such projections. In phase 2, projects were fully consulted on and were scrutinised by an independent auditor. Such projections can indicate the level of scarcity in the scheme; in effect, that gives important indications on what the carbon price should be. We accept the uncertainty, but we believe that it can be a useful guide.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/11">The hon. Members for South Suffolk and for Morley and Rothwell (Colin Challen) asked about the need for a consistent figure on limiting the use of clean development mechanism credits. The United Kingdom has taken a keen interest in CDM, and we have worked hard to make the mechanisms more effective and accountable. We asked for a limit on CDM credits for the EU ETS. Each member state proposed limits, some of which were reduced by the Commission. We sought and won a limit of 8 per cent. of the free allocation and 93 per cent. of the electricity sector. We are pushing for limits in the EU ETS in phase 3 on that very topic.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/12">The hon. Member for Morley and Rothwell also asked about other measures, saying that we should be careful not to think that the EU ETS was the only solution to our difficulties. The Government agree. I remind the House that the Stern review suggests that three elements are involved: the first is carbon pricing; the second is technology policy; and the third is measures to overcome barriers to behaviour change in fields such as energy efficiency. We are committed to that. We accept the Stern analysis and we are doing various things in all those areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.1/1">I am not the Minister responsible for that, so I would have to check, but I understand that we have changed schemes rather than cut them. If we end one scheme, we may introduce something better&mdash;something that will go further. I will happily write to the hon. Gentleman on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/2">The hon. Member for Morley and Rothwell spoke of contraction and convergence, as did my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1920" name="Adrian Bailey">the Member for West Bromwich, West (Mr. Bailey)</phrase> in an intervention. There is currently no international consensus on that approach. We believe that it could be a way forward and certainly merits attention, but other options are more favourable.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/3">I am sorry to say that the consensus that so often exists in such debates&mdash;over the years, I have worked with many of the Members here today&mdash;was somewhat broken and soured by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1407" name="Gregory Barker">the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker)</phrase>. He endeavoured to make a number of party political points, as did the hon. Member for Cheltenham. The Government would be delighted if either party were to produce an action plan to achieve a carbon economy of 80 per cent. or 90 per cent.&mdash;or even a zero-carbon economy. However, we have to be credible and realistic about what can be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/4">It is vital that people understand the low level of renewable energy that existed in this country when Labour came to office; there was hardly any, except for the long-standing hydro schemes in Scotland. We have made huge efforts, and we have a target of 15 per cent. for electricity generation by 2015. The hon. Member for Cheltenham said that the Prime Minister had talked of 20 per cent. electricity coming from renewables by 2020. He was correct about our aspirations for renewable generation of electricity by 2020. No one has resiled from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/5">The debate about the EU target is completely different. It is about the supply of energy as a whole; it is not about electricity production alone but about all sectors, including transport and heat. It is a very different situation, bearing in mind that the UK is now at 2 per cent. We would be very happy to receive recommendations on how to proceed at a faster pace and how to achieve more. We remain committed to the 20 per cent. EU-wide target. Many other member states have a much higher renewable energy supply and many of them will find it as easy or as difficult as us to move forward. There needs to be a balance, but a balance will be found. We have made a proper commitment to doing that and we remain committed.</p>

	<p pid="a.169.4/1">I think perhaps that the hon. Gentleman needs to look at the achievement of our Kyoto emissions targets and compare that with Germany. I think that different mechanisms achieve different results. We have made a good effort and are meeting our international obligations on CO2 targets. We started without renewables, or effectively with limited renewables, except for the historic hydro in Scotland, because of the previous Administration's total failure to understand the developments in this new technology. We are reviewing the renewables obligation. It is going to change substantially and I am convinced that it will give a new impetus to the development of new kinds&mdash;new forms&mdash;of renewable technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.4/2">The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood said that we needed a consistent, transparent methodology for giving out allowances with less scope for political interference. He will not be surprised that we agree with that sentiment. There should be greater harmonisation of the allocation and future free allocation should be based on benchmarking. It is particularly important that we have harmonised rules for new entrants' allocations from phase 3. The hon. Gentleman can rest assured that we are with him. With that approach added to much more auctioning, we would be able to make much further progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.4/3">Both the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase> mentioned the need for a sectoral approach in allocating allowances and said that energy producers should not get a disproportionate number and be allowed to pass on the cost to other sectors. Again, we agree with that. Some pressure was put on the electricity producers in terms of the cap and they took a cut in allowances in phase 1. In phase 2, allowances for auctioning will be taken from that sector and in doing so we will be putting special pressure on them. I think that that is what hon. Members would want. In other sectors, there is allocation on a business-as-usual basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.4/4">The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood turned away for a moment from his good all-party credentials and questioned the commitment of the present Administration on climate change. In questioning the commitment of the Prime Minister, he is speaking of a man who, as treasurer, provided all the instruments that have been used to drive down CO2 emissions, increase renewables and make a real difference in getting this country on a path to a low-carbon economy. The hon. Gentleman will remember that the Prime Minister, when he was Chancellor, introduced the climate change levy, the first really important instrument in this regard, which the hon. Gentleman's party has consistently opposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.4/5">Let me also remind the hon. Gentleman that it was the present Prime Minister, when Chancellor, who commissioned the Stern report. I know that the hon. Gentleman knows this because he and I have travelled to conferences together around the world, and the Stern report is considered a seminal work on climate change dialogue.</p>
