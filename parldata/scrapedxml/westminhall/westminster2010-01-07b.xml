<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-07b.142.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" speakername="Tony Wright" colnum="142"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100107/halltext/100107h0001.htm#10010728000206">
	<p pid="b.142.1/1">I am actually quite ambivalent about that. I say that as a great man for openness, freedom of information and so on. However, if I was Prince Charles-there is a thought-and the heir to the throne and I thought that I had a role of advising, encouraging and warning, which is part of what a monarchy does, then I would probably want to exercise that role, certainly not in areas that were party contentious but over a wide terrain. I would write vigorously to Ministers about all the things that I was concerned with and I would probably write less vigorously if I thought that those letters were going to be published. That is the reason for my ambivalence. The easy answer would be to say, &quot;Yes, of course, they should be published&quot;. However, the older I get, the more old-fashioned I get, and I quite like the idea of monarchs writing to Prime Ministers, Prime Ministers writing to monarchs and all that kind of thing, but no doubt that is just a sign of ageing.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/2">Anyway, lobbying is intrinsically a good and necessary thing. So why should we be concerned with it? Why on earth should we investigate it and inquire into it? Of course, it is because lobbying carries with it, as well as intrinsic goods, some intrinsic dangers too. Those dangers are pretty obvious; if some people have privileged access to power, policy and Government, that creates disadvantages for other people. So, as far as possible, we need to know who is lobbying whom about what. If we do not know that, of course people will draw all kinds of conclusions about the policy process. When Governments take decisions, unless we know something about the process by which those decisions have been taken openly, it can simply be asserted that they have been taken because certain interests have had their way with a Government in a manner that is not open and that has not been challenged.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/3">So, on that basis, we set out a number of principles that we thought should inform lobbying. We said in our original report that we needed measures that would do three things:</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/4" class="indent">&quot;to promote ethical behaviour by lobbyists, with the prospect of sanctions if rules are broken...to ensure that the process of lobbying takes place in as public a way as possible, subject to the maximum reasonable degree of transparency...and to make it harder for politicians and public servants to use the information and contacts they have built up in office as an inducement to other potential employers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/5">That third and last principle relates to the issue of the so-called &quot;revolving door&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/6">In pursuing those principles, which I think would receive wide assent, we wanted to take an approach that would be effective in ensuring that the principles were actually safeguarded in some serious way. However, we also wanted to approach this subject in a way that was proportionate. We did not want to set up a bureaucratic structure that would be completely out of kilter with the nature of the problem. Those were the two aims that we brought to our approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/7">We wanted to consider those who lobby and those who are lobbied. To take up a point that I mentioned at the beginning, we decided that we were concerned not just with the industry, and certainly not just with multi-client firms, but with all those who lobby regularly. Most lobbying is done by in-house lobbyists, not firms. I am always interested, by the way, by people who do not want to describe themselves as what they are. Lobbyists usually like to describe themselves not as lobbyists but as something else, usually people concerned with public affairs or Government relations. We know that they are lobbyists. If they think that lobbying is a good thing, they should say that they are lobbyists. They should set up lobbying companies and advertise themselves as lobbyists. They should not be coy about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/8">We wanted to consider the whole activity of lobbying, wherever it came from, and not single out certain bits of the industry. In relation to those who lobby, although this was not our primary concern, we began to consider the industry. There are other issues that I will not touch on about whether it is worth spending large amounts of money on lobbyists to do a variety of jobs. Some people who spoke to us certainly did not think so, but that is not our concern.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/9">We were struck by the fact that there was no single and effective system of regulation for the lobbying industry. There are three major industry associations or bodies that, although they all claim to have principles in common, are run in different ways. We know that industry is important to Government, but it does not have a single regulator to maintain ethical standards, so when issues blow up, the ability to deal with them depends on whether someone belongs to a particular association and whether it has standards that bite and can be enforced.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/10">We took the view that we needed an umbrella regulator for the industry to approach the issue from the side of ethical regulation. The Government agreed with us in their reply, saying that they want a &quot;single and credible&quot; system of regulation-self-regulation, if possible-for the industry. We will discuss whether the industry is making progress towards a single, effective regulator.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/11">What I have said so far relates to those who lobby, but our prime concern was those who are lobbied within the policy process and within Government and what we should be doing about them. We discussed the need for records of meetings between those who lobby and those who are lobbied, and we considered the provisions for declaring outside gifts and hospitality in relation to Ministers and civil servants.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/12">Our central proposal involved a register of lobbying activity. In our report-I will not repeat it now, but it is worth reading for those who are interested-we have set down what principles we think should inform such a register and described what we think its content should be. We seek to show that it can be done both effectively and proportionately, and we give examples of different jurisdictions, showing what registers are like in the United States, Australia, Canada and parts of Europe. By the way, that indicates that the need to move towards a registration system is becoming common in many parts of the world. It is becoming common in Commonwealth and European systems and at the European level, and the United States has detailed provisions. One of the first acts of the new Administration in the United States was to introduce more effective lobbying regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.1/13">However, we did not want simply to copy those systems. We thought it important to devise a scheme appropriate for our political system. For example, when we went to the United States, we talked to lobbyists and those who were lobbied, and most of us returned with a feeling that the scale, volume and detail of what was legislated for there was not appropriate for our system. We went to a lobbying firm and met the lawyer whom it employed, whose job was to circumvent all the provisions to regulate who people can have a cup of coffee with and what contacts they can make. Due to the role of campaign finance in the United States, it is more pressing to regulate any contact between politicians and money people and outside lobbyists. Our system here is rather different. That is the point about combining effectiveness with proportionality.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-07b.147.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" speakername="Kelvin Hopkins" colnum="147"  time="015:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100107/halltext/100107h0002.htm#10010728000217">
	<p pid="b.147.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton. After the debate, like you, I have to repair to the frozen north before the next snowstorm, although I appreciate that Luton is not quite as far north as Bootle.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/2">The last point my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> made was that as and when things go wrong-when a crisis arises-he is rather pessimistic that the Government of the day might do the wrong thing. Perhaps he could then say, &quot;We told you so. Here's our report; just implement it.&quot; He perhaps should not be too clever about it, but he could at least offer the report and say, &quot;Here's one we made earlier. This is what you should do.&quot; I would like to think that we are ahead of the game and that, at a future point, the report that we recommended will be adopted, rather than the Government inching towards that position. We have made progress, however, and that is good.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/3">I wish my right hon. Friend the Minister a happy birthday and hope that she is not delayed too long by our debate. The Chamber is not too crowded, so she might get away fairly soon.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/4">The report is absolutely splendid, and although I put my name to it, the credit goes to the whole Committee and, indeed, to those Officers whom my hon. Friend the Committee Chairman praised so fully and appropriately. I should also say-he would not say this, and he has perhaps heard me give such compliments before-that his chairmanship of our Committee is absolutely first class. In my 13 years in the House, the most enjoyable and worthwhile thing I have done is to be a member of the Public Administration Committee for the past seven years. At least for the next six months, I hope to continue to be a member of it. The Committee has a splendid group of members and produces first-class reports, as it has done over several years.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/5">My fellow Committee members present will have heard my arguments before, so I apologise for raising them yet again. My concerns were always about the power of lobbying at the very centre of the Government. I have drawn a spectrum of lobbying, or perhaps a division between its two types, one of which I call altruistic lobbying-indeed, that is the sort of lobbying that I do. I represent the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament-I have mentioned that organisation before in the House. It does not pay me any money; I support it because I believe in its aims and objectives. It is a matter of personal belief, rather than a question of interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/6">I also sponsor the National Pensioners Convention lobby of Parliament every year. As I am above pensionable age, I should declare an interest, but I also believe in what that organisation is doing. There are a number of other organisations that we support, in a sense, because we passionately believe in their objectives, and that is what I call altruistic lobbying.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/7">Moving along the spectrum, one then has the professional organisations. I have personal associations with the trade union Unison, the Association of Colleges-as co-chair of the all-party group on further education and lifelong learning-and million+, which is an organisation of new universities, the chairman of which is vice-chancellor of my local university. Again, there is no financial interest involved. We do these things because we happen to agree with what such organisations stand for and what they are doing.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/8">We then get to the more serious end of the spectrum, which is where large sums of Government money and contracts are involved. Those are invariably dealt with at the highest level of Government, and that is what my concerns relate to. The links between the defence industry and the Ministry of Defence are well known. The contracts concerned are literally worth billions, not just millions. As far as is reasonable-as long as one is not giving away national secrets that would be advantageous to an enemy-such contracts should be transparent. There have been scandals in the past about the defence industry and its relations with not just the British Government but foreign Governments.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/9">I am also very concerned about the extent to which the previous Prime Minister had visitations at Downing street from big business interests, particularly those of the health industry. Time and again, there were reports in the journals about meetings at Downing street involving large numbers of American health corporations that considered the rich pickings they could get from the national health service. That process is still taking place, and it worries me greatly. We should not be privatising the health service under the disguise of commissioning or whatever. The drive that has come from American health interests, in particular, is very unhealthy and unwelcome. That is all done at the level of Downing street, not even at the level of the Department of Health. That should be exposed and made public. We get leaks in the press, but that is not anything like enough.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/10">Another area that I know a little about is dealt with by the Department for Transport, which is talking about ordering rolling stock from different companies. Many of us were very concerned about the Government's decision to place a big order with Hitachi rather than with companies in Britain that have productive capacity, particularly because the Department for Transport now has its own in-house ROSCO-rolling stock company. That has been an advance, but the ordering process and the links between the companies and the Government ought to be much more transparent. I want them to be made public.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/11">Something that worried me perhaps more than anything was the gambling interests and the American gambling corporations that went into Downing street and pressed the previous Prime Minister to drive forward a large number of giant casinos across Britain. In fact, we saw them off through a combination of Back-Bench lobbying by myself and others. I know that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> also felt that the matter was deeply unhealthy. We did not want the legacy of a Labour Government to be a nation left with increasing levels of gambling addiction and more large casinos. The idea that an economy somehow has to be based on a giant casino, particularly in a poor area, is really reprehensible. However, as a result of parliamentary pressure and lobbying against the gambling corporations, they were seen off to a large extent. That was very healthy.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/12">I understand, again from leaks in the journals, that the American gambling corporations were very disappointed in the previous Prime Minister because he did not manage to get through what they wanted, which was for Britain to become an offshore Las Vegas. My opinion on the matter is not just a result of my puritanical ancestry. It would have been deeply unhealthy for Britain to go down that route and we should not have done so. Again, lobbying was done at a central level, and that was unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/13">It is interesting to note from the Government's response to the report that they have apparently agreed to publish details of ministerial meetings with outside interests. That is very welcome. However, at the last minute, they showed reluctance to publish information about lobbying activity involving the most senior officials. The Government are therefore saying, &quot;Yes, you can know everything, except that which is most important.&quot; I want to know what the senior officials are doing with these big companies. That is what really matters and that is what I want to see exposed.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/14">Many years ago, I was a supporter-the constituency chair-of Brian Sedgemore, who at that time was the Labour Member of Parliament for Luton, West. I was his party chair and campaign organiser when he was the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Tony Benn. He and Tony Benn went to have dinner with the warden of, I think, All Souls-certainly the warden of an Oxford college. Brian Sedgemore put forward the view that government ought to be open and public so that all these things would be known. The warden turned to Tony Benn and said, &quot;Mr. Benn, do you know that your Parliamentary Private Secretary is mad?&quot; Brian Sedgemore was perhaps ahead of his time, but I agreed with him then and do so now.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.0/15">We have some way to go. The report is a tremendous advance and I would like to think that a future Labour Government will implement it in full so that we have the statutory register and reach the healthy state of affairs in which such things are known publicly and the electorate will know what senior officials and Ministers are doing in their offices regarding big contracts with wealthy corporations, meaning that they no longer have that hidden from them. I look forward to hearing what other hon. Members have to say.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-07b.150.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" speakername="John Grogan" colnum="150"  time="015:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100107/halltext/100107h0002.htm#10010728000218">
	<p pid="b.150.0/1">It is a great pleasure to make a brief contribution to the debate. As the Select Committee Chairman said, I have a dual role this afternoon. It is truly the highlight of my political career to be the Minister's acting PPS for a few minutes. I have just begun to realise how much power I have in that role. I have a lot of notes, and could pass the Minister the wrong ones-or pass the wrong ones back and forth-but I shall try to perform both my roles correctly.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/2">In 1869 the American magazine <i>The Nation</i> defined a lobbyist as</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/3" class="indent">&quot;a man whom everybody suspects...and whose employment by those who have bills before a legislature is only resorted to as a disagreeable necessity.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/4">That is one view of lobbying-not the one that I take. Some of my best friends are lobbyists. I agree with the Chairman of the Select Committee that they are a vital part of our democracy and can articulate the case of not just business but charities and all sorts of organisations about legislation. They can make sure that a diversity of voices and opinions is heard in our democracy. However, the central principle that the Chairman referred to about the declaration of clients by multi-client lobbyists is fundamental. It is no accident that, as he pointed out, nations across the developed world have been changing their rules on the matter in recent years. In the United States there is a long tradition of transparency, dating back to the quotation I gave, and before. In the European Union there is a voluntary register in operation. In France, only this month, the French Parliament has adopted such a declaration of clients-the decision of the Senate has probably to come.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/5">Why does it matter? Partly it is because the websites of the multi-client lobbying firms and the pitches that they make claim great influence. They claim that they shape policy and that they have done over decades. If that influence exists, it should be transparent. Some firms have been holding out against the declaration of clients. Bell Pottinger, chaired by Lord Bell, is one in particular. Down the years there has been an occasional burst of publicity suggesting the importance of declaring all one's clients. For example, a few years ago, during the gambling debate that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> referred to, Bell Pottinger had two sets of clients-an American gambling company and the British Amusement Catering Trade Association, a trade association covering gambling machines and so on, in Britain. BACTA decided that that was a conflict of interest, and that it would seek representation other than that of Bell Pottinger. If the client list is not published, one cannot be sure that such conflicts of interest do not exist.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/6">I know from my own dealings and inquiries in the matter that that was not the only case in which Bell Pottinger represented completely different interests. I went to a dinner organised by Bell Pottinger at which one interest was being argued. A few weeks later I saw the same Bell Pottinger personnel-there were not even Chinese walls in operation-representing exactly the opposite interest. I cannot imagine that the clients would have been happy with those non-existent Chinese walls. The matter is clearly one of public interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/7">In recent years some firms have changed, and have begun to declare their clients, and it has not been the end of the world. Life goes on and the firms continue to thrive. Sovereign Strategy and Finsbury were originally very doubtful about publishing lists of their clients. Finsbury, with its influence in the financial world, thought that hedge funds would not be happy about the declaration of clients. Roland Rudd, to his credit, published his clients a couple of years ago and is making massive profits. He is still best buddies with Lord Mandelson and I think he has entertained the Leader of the Opposition to dinner at his house, so there is life beyond declaring clients. That is clearly something that the industry should make universal, as many people have suggested.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/8">I was pleased that the Government acknowledged and encouraged some of the suggestions in the Select Committee report. I, too, have heard rumours about changes in the drafts of the report. I even heard that it was so important that it went to Lord Mandelson himself, and that he made comments. I do not know whether it is true that it achieved such elevated heights, but it is interesting that the industry was a little disappointed that the Government perhaps did not find the words-I hope that the Minister will find them today-to be a little more assertive about the need for the declaration of clients. The chair of the Association of Professional Political Consultants, Robbie McDuff, said</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/9" class="indent">&quot;we are somewhat disappointed that the Government has not sought to encourage those who choose not to follow the self-regulatory route&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/10">I, indeed, asked the Library for comments of Ministers in the past decade supporting self-regulation, if that is the policy on the declaration of clients by multi-client lobbyists. The Library reply was that Ministerial comments on the subject were elusive.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/11">Today's debate is a chance for the Minister to avoid doubt. To be fair to the Opposition Front Bench, the shadow Cabinet Office Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1642" name="Francis Maude">the right hon. Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude)</phrase>, has said:</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/12" class="indent">&quot;Public affairs firms should publish all client lists and their full-time and part-time staff. If this is not undertaken across the whole industry by a process of effective self-regulation, Conservatives are warning that pressure will mount to subject the industry to statutory regulation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/13">I hope that we can get unity on the Front Benches today and that the Minister will issue similar declarations. I shall make some practical suggestions about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/14">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" name="Anthony D Wright">the Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase>, the Chairman of the Select Committee, mentioned the role of lawyers, in the firms that bring them together with public affairs. There is much merit in his suggestion that there is no other way to approach this matter than by a statutory register. However, let us not let the DLA Pipers of this world get off the hook by saying that they cannot sign up to a voluntary register because of Law Society rules. They can clearly do that, should they choose to. I wrote to the Solicitors Regulation Authority, which is the regulatory body in this instance, and asked whether firms such as DLA Piper could, if they wanted to, sign up and declare their clients on a voluntary basis, and quoted the European Commission's voluntary scheme. It wrote back:</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/15" class="indent">&quot;We do not think a lawyer's duty of confidentiality presents an automatic bar to lawyers being included in the initiative.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/16">It continued by saying that</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/17" class="indent">&quot;provided that membership imposes no requirement which conflicts with a solicitor's professional duties (such as, for example, a <i>retrospective</i> obligation to publish clients' names) there is nothing to prevent a solicitors' firm becoming a member of the APPC&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/18">or presumably the public affairs council-</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/19" class="indent">&quot;or a similar organisation. The member firm could meet the disclosure requirements of that Association, and therefore the requirements of transparency, by making the client's consent to the disclosure a pre-condition for acting.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/20">Thus, all that firms such as DLA Piper need do when they take on new clients would be to say, &quot;In future we are going to declare all our clients.&quot; They could not do that retrospectively, but they could do it in future, and happily remain members of the Law Society and sign up to the code. It is making an excuse and hiding behind the Law Society, when it will not do that. I hope that that firm, and firms such as Bell Pottinger, will review their position and sign up.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/21">We are where we are, as they say, and are coming up to a general election. We have very few weeks left. I hope that Ministers, and the Opposition, can give a further boost to the campaign for all multi-client lobbyists to declare their clients. There are certain things that they could do. For example, the public affairs council is being set up. There all sorts of weaknesses and hesitancies about the organisation, as it is formed, as there are with any new organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/22">Sir Philip Mawer, who I understand is responsible for the new body, and an independent figure of some repute, has said on the record that self-regulation works only if everyone is involved. I have confidence in him and believe he wants to do a good job, but it is difficult to weld together a multitude of organisations. In the first instance, it appears that each organisation will be responsible for its own disciplinary code, but I hope that in future there will be one code.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/23">I also hope that the public affairs council will look carefully at those firms that divide themselves. Bell Pottinger is an example, as it is a member of the Chime group of public affairs companies. One member of that group, Good Relations, declares its clients and is a member of the various self-regulatory bodies, but Bell Pottinger is not. If a company is to be a member of a self-regulatory organisation, the whole organisation should sign up to its principles, not just one arm of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/24">Another group that falls into that category is the Huntsworth group, which has a variety of public affairs firms under its wing. Of those, Citigate and Grayling declare their clients, but Quiller does not. A gentleman called George Bridges recently left Quiller to work for the Conservative Front-Bench team, and one of the public relations newspapers has argued that, because he was one of the main reasons for many people signing up to Quiller, the company would suffer from that loss. Clearly, if one part of a group is signed up to declaring its clients, all should be. I challenge the public affairs council, if it is to be credible, to insist on that. It cannot have part of a group declaring its clients and another part not.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/25">I urge the Minister to consider whether it is beyond the pale for her to commit to writing to all major public affairs companies, urging them to declare their clients? Is it beyond the pale for her to write to the FTSE 100 companies and urge them that the next time they contract a public affairs company that they do so with one that publicly declares its clients and is involved in the public affairs council? I offer the same challenge to the Opposition: would <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1443" name="Brooks Newmark">the hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark)</phrase> be prepared to write such letters to the top lobbying companies, and to the FTSE 100 companies to urge them to employ lobbyists who adopt the highest ethical rules?</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/26">If we are serious about self-regulation, which both the Government and the Opposition are committed to, we have to take further action. We in Parliament must look at a report produced by the Committee on Standards in Public Life a couple of years ago, which stated that consultancies that service all-party groups should adopt those standards. There are probably things that Parliament can do to encourage that.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.0/27">I am in a particular position this afternoon-I do not know whether Lord Mandelson is watching, but if he is, the Minister knows that I can just lose any note he sends. This is a decision that she can make on her own, but I hope that she will at least consider the suggestion. I hope that the likes of Lord Bell and Peter Bingle of Bell Pottinger, and Alan Parker of Brunswick, who are in danger of becoming the Arthur Daleys of the public affairs industry if they hold out against the declaration of clients, will also heed the call from the Opposition Front Bench. I am sure that the Treasury Bench will today call on those companies to join the modern world and declare their clients.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-07b.153.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" speakername="Gordon Prentice" colnum="153"  time="015:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100107/halltext/100107h0003.htm#10010728000219">
	<p pid="b.153.0/1">Lord Mandelson, whether or not he is watching the debate, will know what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> said this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/2">I shall be brief and have only two or three points to make, the first of which is about the context in which we are discussing the matter. We need more transparency in our politics. People's trust in politicians is at an all-time low. We have all, collectively, been seared by the MPs' expenses business. I had a debate in this Chamber on this subject in February 2009, which was just about the time that we were reading about Lords for lobbying: peers who had been approached by fake lobbyists and asked to do their bidding. Two of those peers were suspended from the House of Lords, which was unprecedented. That has never happened before, and I hope it will never happen again.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/3">We pick up our newspapers and read about former Ministers. One of yesterday's plotters has a &#163;60,000 to &#163;70,000 contract with Alliance Boots, and she used to be the Secretary of State for Health. Any number of former Ministers are doing two jobs, and we should know more about that. There is a public interest imperative in having the greatest transparency possible. We need to know where power lies and how it is exercised.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/4">In February's debate, which took place nearly a year ago, I reminded colleagues about Derek Draper's famous claim in 1998-he used to be very close to Lord Mandelson and perhaps still is-that there were 17 people in the new Labour Government, that he knew them all and that he could introduce people to them. That was disgraceful, and something should have been done about it. We can only deal with the Derek Drapers of this world by making lobbying open and transparent.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/5">The Committee's report calls for a mandatory register. My friend the Member for Selby mentioned the Committee on Standards in Public Life. I put the question of a mandatory register to Sir Christopher Kelly at the meeting we had back in February, and he agreed that there should be one. There is no other way of addressing the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/6">My friend the Member for Selby mentioned the position of solicitors and the Law Society. Any number of law firms have a lobbying branch. DLA Piper is one such firm, and its lobbying branch is Global Communications. Eben Black from DLA Piper appeared before our Committee-I dare say has written to colleagues-claiming that the solicitor's code, which prohibits the publication of client details, also covers people, such as him, who are not solicitors. The Law Society has also been in touch with the Committee to say that client confidentiality will prohibit the disclosure of client names. The only way around that is to go for a mandatory register in statute: a statutory register. Eben Black and the Law Society are in favour of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/7">My friend the Member for Selby mentioned some kind of compromise, but I do not think that it would be workable to tell solicitors that new clients have to be disclosed while existing clients could not be. That would put older clients, if I may so term them, in a more advantageous and privileged position than newer clients. It is just too complicated. It will never fly, so we need a statutory register.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/8">Colleagues have mentioned examples from overseas. We do not need to reinvent the wheel. The United States, which was mentioned by my friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase>, is a bad example. Politics in the United States is polluted by the need to raise millions and millions in campaign finance. A better comparator for us is Canada. It is unfortunate that we did not visit Ottawa when we were in north America to discuss how lobbying is managed there, but we have the advantage of the annual report of the Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying of Canada.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/9">I have said many times that Canada is a sister democracy. Its system is probably the closest anywhere to what we have in Westminster. The Canadians first legislated on lobbying back in 1989, and they have progressively tightened the rules. The commissioner makes four points on the front page of the annual report:</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Free and open access to government is an important matter of public interest;</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/11" class="indent">Lobbying public office holders is a legitimate activity;</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/12" class="indent">It is desirable that public office holders and the general public be able to know who is attempting to influence government;</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/13" class="indent">The system for the registration of paid lobbyists should not impede free and open access to government.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/14">That is simple; there is not a huge bureaucracy. A new Lobbying Act in 2008 created the post of Commissioner of Lobbying. Everything is in the report, which can be accessed on the web pages. It states that lobbyists have to put in monthly returns to say who they are lobbying. Such transparency is testimony to the health and vibrancy of Canadian democracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/15">My friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1676" name="Patricia Hewitt">the Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt)</phrase> has a part-time job with Boots the Chemist, but in Canada, there is five-year prohibition on designated public office holders taking such positions, although it can be waived by the commissioner in certain circumstances. Five years-here, people move seamlessly from Whitehall and Westminster straight into commerce in a matter of months.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/16">In addition, our system is not policed. The Advisory Committee on Public Appointments will tell ex-Ministers, perhaps Defence Ministers who have been responsible for billion-pound budgets, that they should not lobby for six months or 12 months, but that is never policed, and we do not know what whisperings go on behind the curtain.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/17">In view of that, I was disappointed by the Government response. No disrespect to the Minister, but I thought that it was limp and feeble-words that were used by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. When the Government published their response in October 2009, the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/18" class="indent">&quot;The Government has dropped the ball on political reform-and ignored public concerns-by refusing to force lobbyists to operate in the open.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/19">That is what we are talking about.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/20">This nation spends &#163;79 billion of public money in the commercial sector every year. The lobbing industry is worth &#163;2 billion, but we do not know who is influencing whom, and that is wrong. It runs against the whole current of opinion. I cannot understand for the life of me why the Government took this decision, which runs counter to what I believe that we as a Government have been trying to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.0/21">I do not know where this leaves us. We are at the fag end of this Parliament, and many of us will not be here for the next one, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. We could have a new Government, but I share the view of my friend the Member for Cannock Chase that the issue will not go away. I predict that within four or five years we will have a statutory register of lobbyists and we will bring this practice out of the shadows and into the open.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-07b.157.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" speakername="Nick Hurd" colnum="157"  time="015:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100107/halltext/100107h0003.htm#10010728000222">
	<p pid="b.157.1/1">I cannot prove or disprove that. I am trying to get across the public perception that the decision was over-influenced by that BAA's access to and privileged relationship with the Department for Transport. The reality is one thing. However, I am more concerned about the perception and how it compounds public unease about the way that decisions are taken by those who govern in their name.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.1/2">I congratulate the Committee, because we need to look at this issue more closely. The balance of the report looked at those doing the lobbying, notwithstanding the powerful statements made by the hon. Member for Pendle on the need for greater policing of what happens, for example, to Ministers once they leave office with their freedom to pursue gain elsewhere, and the need to look again at the system of regulation there.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.1/3">I found the report persuasive in its message that the current system of self-regulation is not effective, for the reasons stated, including a lack of consistency and the lack of one trusted body. Although it has not been picked up so far in the debate, the point was well made about it being difficult for the three organisations to combine the role of being effectively a trade association that is dependent on members and a regulator of those members. That dynamic and tension is unsustainable.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.1/4">The third point made by the report, which was persuasively argued, was about there being no evidence of an effective complaints process in this system.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.1/5">The report was clear, and the line of the Committee was clear, about the need for a new body to enforce standards and a mandatory register of contacts. I found the Government's line less clear, when it eventually came-we will return to that. The hon. Member for Pendle described the Government's response as limp and feeble, and I agree. I was certainly disappointed with it. The Government's line seems to be that they prefer to focus on those who are lobbied, rather than on those who are doing the lobbying. In that context, I welcome the move to produce quarterly publications of information about ministerial meetings, which is a welcome development. I share the view of the hon. Member for Luton, North that that should be extended to senior officials as well, because as the hon. Member for Pendle said, the move to greater transparency is inevitable and we must go with it.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.1/6">I was less clear about the Government's view in respect of the need for a register. They have clearly come down on the side of more effective voluntary self-regulation, which is our instinct as well, but the Committee Chairman described their response as &quot;gnomic&quot;-not a word that I would ever use to describe the current Minister; certainly not on her birthday-and I agree. The response is unclear in that regard. The Committee Chairman cited the following quote:</p>
	<p pid="b.157.1/7" class="indent">&quot;The Government agrees that any system of regulation ...voluntary...or statutory...requires a register of lobbyists to ensure that lobbying activity is transparent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.157.1/8">But a few pages earlier, a large section is given over to expanding on the possible risks of mandatory registration, as outlined by the Committee on Standards in Public Life. The message from the Government is not clear enough in this respect. I should like to press the Minister to be clear, because if we are to go down the path of more effective voluntary self-regulation, which is our instinct, we need to send a much stronger signal to the industry than the Government's response delivers, particularly on the need for greater transparency. The hon. Member for Pendle was powerful in that regard, but we endorse that principle.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.1/9">The hon. Member for Selby kindly quoted my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1642" name="Francis Maude">the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude)</phrase>, who said:</p>
	<p pid="b.157.1/10" class="indent">&quot;Public affairs firms should publish all client lists and their full-time and part-time staff... The Solicitors' Code of Conduct should also be amended so solicitors' firms who engage in public affairs work can disclose their lobbying clients&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.1/11">I should like the Government to be clearer on their position. I get no sense from their response about a big stick being waved in the direction of the industry and no sense of urgency. In fact, they have taken a long time to say very little indeed.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.1/12">I close my remarks with three questions to the Minister. First, why the delay in responding? I am not a member of the Committee, so I am not privy to the correspondence or the explanations given, but a change of Ministers is not a sufficiently good response in respect of a delay of nine months in responding to such an important report-seven months more than the parliamentary protocol dictates. I should like the courtesy of some explanation for that unusual delay in responding.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.1/13">Secondly, if the message is, &quot;We want to see more effective self-regulation,&quot; what will the Government do to assess the response of the sector? The Government response is silent on the process from here on and silent on a timetable. This is an opportunity for the Minister to place on the record a much stronger message to the lobbying industry, saying that if it fails to self-regulate effectively, it should be prepared for intense pressure from Parliament to legislate to ensure greater accountability.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.1/14">Thirdly and more specifically, we are concerned about a trend within lobbying for public sector organisations to hire lobbyists to effectively lobby the Government. We published a dossier called &quot;Government Lobbying Government&quot;, which identifies some &#163;10 million of public money being used apparently in this circle of public sector organisations-predominantly quangos-lobbying Departments for funds or legislative action. That strikes us as unhealthy and quite wrong in the current climate of concern about public expenditure. We draw the Government's attention to the action in the United States, where the Byrd amendment of 1996 prohibits the use of federal contracts, grants, loans or moneys to influence, or attempt to influence, the Executive or legislative branch. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 states that moneys derived from Government contracts in excess of $500,000 cannot be used to fund the influencing of legislative action, directly or indirectly.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.1/15">I should like the Minister to place on the record her position on the Government's approach to clamping down on public money being used by public sector companies to lobby the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.1/16">I congratulate the Committee on an excellent report that throws some useful light into some potentially dark corners.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-07b.159.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1388" speakername="Angela Smith" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Cabinet Office"  colnum="159"  time="015:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100107/halltext/100107h0004.htm#10010728000223">
	<p pid="b.159.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship yet again, Mr. Benton, and I welcome you to the Chair.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> and the Committee on securing this debate and on the work that they have done preparing the report, which all hon. Members agree is timely and useful. I assure my hon. Friend that there is nowhere else I would rather be on my birthday, particularly because this is the warmest place in the House of Commons at the moment. I also thank my temporary honorary Parliamentary Private Secretary, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase>, who has done great service today, both in his comments and his efforts on my behalf.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/3">The Select Committee on Public Administration has conducted the first parliamentary inquiry on lobbying for almost 20 years. The word &quot;timely&quot; has been used several times, as the work was needed. The Committee produced two reports on this issue, the most recent coming before the Christmas recess.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/4">Before I go any further, it is appropriate that I apologise unreservedly for the time that it took the Government to respond to the Committee's original report. As I said when I provided the Government's response and when I went to the Committee last July, no discourtesy to the Committee was intended. I had hoped to get the response to the Committee prior to recess. Another week before recess and that would have happened. I am sorry that that delayed it further. I will ensure that the Government's response to the further report will be with the Committee shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/5">I should perhaps confess an involvement in this issue, as before I became a Member of Parliament, I lobbied MPs, including members of the Committee-my hon. Friends the Members for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) and for Newport, West (Paul Flynn). I think that I was what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> would call a good lobbyist. I worked for the League Against Cruel Sports, but I did not call myself a lobbyist at the time. I was a parliamentary officer, and I did various work around Parliament, and political work in general, lobbying for the abolition of hunting and wildlife protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/6">The Committee's inquiry into lobbying took a broad look at the contact between those working in the public sector and those attempting to influence their decisions. The Government's response to the Committee's original report stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Lobbying is essentially the activity of those in a democracy making representations to government on issues of concern. The Government is committed to protecting this right from improper use&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/8">The Government agree with the Committee that there is still more to do in order to provide the public with greater reassurance that when lobbying takes place, it does so within a framework that upholds the highest standards of propriety and prevents improper influence or access. That includes the need to ensure that appropriate rules and measures are in place to govern the acceptance of outside business appointments by Ministers and Crown servants on their leaving office. The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments is an independent committee that deals with such matters, and I will return to its work later in my comments. I am aware that, in November, the Public Administration Committee held a pre-appointment meeting with Lord Lang of Monkton, who is now the chairman of the advisory committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/9">Perhaps I can touch on the issue of transparency. When responding to the Committee's original report, the Government took further steps, which were welcomed by my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase, to ensure that appropriate and proportionate measures were in place for those who are mostly in discussion with lobbyists-Ministers and civil servants. For Ministers, the Government accepted three key recommendations. First, information about hospitality received by Ministers in a ministerial capacity and valued at more than &#163;140 will be published quarterly and online by Departments. Information for the period between <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-01">1 October</phrase> and the end of December last year is being collated and will be published as soon as it is ready. When providing that information, the Government have decided that the threshold for Ministers should be the same as that currently set for the declaration of gifts-both given and received-which is &#163;140. That is considerably lower than the threshold for both MPs and peers, for whom registration would normally be required for hospitality valued at around &#163;650 for Members of the House of Commons, and about &#163;1,000 for Members of the House of Lords.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/10">Secondly, information about Ministers' meetings with outside interest groups will be routinely published by the Department-again, I am pleased that that is welcomed by the Committee. It will be published quarterly and online, and information for the period of the three months to the end of December is being collated and will be published as soon as it is ready. That information will include the name of the Minister holding the meeting, the date of the meeting, the organisations present and the principal subjects discussed.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/11">Thirdly, in response to the Committee, the Government have committed to updating and publishing online the list of ministerial interests by the Cabinet Office every six months. The list is not an account of all the interests held by Ministers or their families, but it contains interests that are-or could reasonably be perceived to be-directly relevant to a Minister's public duties. The first ever list was published in March last year, and the process has already increased transparency and confidence in the application of rules designed to prevent conflicts of interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/12">I turn to the recommendations concerning civil servants. Last February-again for the first time-the Government published a list of hospitality received by members of departmental boards. That was taken a stage further when, in response to a recommendation by the Committee in its original report on lobbying, the Government agreed to extend the coverage of the list to include hospitality received by senior civil servants at director general level and above. Extending the hospitality publication to cover the most senior officials, and also to include their official expenses, is an important part of the Government's commitment to account to the taxpayer for the use of public money.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/13">I appreciate that the Committee wanted the Government to go further in relation to senior civil servants. In its further report, the Committee recommended publishing information about meetings between the most senior officials and outside interest groups, and publishing relevant private interests of the most senior civil servants-director general and above-and the equivalent employees of public bodies. The Committee did not consider that that would place a disproportionate burden on Departments and agencies, but the Government took a different view and considered that, in respect of meetings with outside interest groups, publication of such information would be disproportionate. There are more than 4,000 members of the senior civil service, and around 210 at director general level and above. In respect of relevant private interests, the interests of board members are already publicly available as part of a Department's annual report and accounts. I assure my hon. Friends that the level of disclosure will be kept under review and we will continue to bear in mind the recommendations of the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/14">In response to another recommendation by the Committee, the Government have produced and circulated to Departments guidance that sets out best practice for compliance with the principles-based approach for the receipt of hospitality, as set out in the civil service code and the civil service management code. My hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase said that he was glad that the Government had accepted some of the Committee's proposals to increase transparency in areas directly involving Ministers and civil servants. Accepting the recommendations made by the Committee in respect of Ministers and civil servants clearly demonstrates that the Government are committed to greater transparency.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/15">I would like to mention the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. In November, the Public Administration Committee held a pre-appointment hearing with Lord Lang of Monkton, who was the Prime Minister's preferred candidate for the post of chairman of the advisory committee. Although the Public Administration Committee had some criticisms about process and the issue of business interests, it subsequently reported that it was</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/16" class="indent">&quot;satisfied that Lord Lang has the professional competence and personal independence required for the post of Chair of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments as it is currently constituted.&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/17">My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office and for the Olympics, and Paymaster General, has been in correspondence with my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase in relation to the appointment process for that post. The Committee's recently published further report makes a number of observations about the make-up of the advisory committee's membership.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/18">The Government continue to take the view that the advisory committee's unique remit, which is narrowly focused and confined to individual casework for a relatively small number of people, calls for a membership with first-hand experience and understanding of the business appointment rules and procedures, in order to have credibility in the areas on which they advise. The Government have committed to reviewing the outcomes of the recent refreshment of the advisory committee, and we will work on that with the commissioner for public appointments. The commissioner has welcomed that review, and as part of it we will include consideration of the points that the Committee has made on the appointments process.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/19">In consultation with the advisory committee, the Government are reviewing and revising the detail of the business appointment rules for Crown servants, and the parallel rules for former Ministers, to ensure that they are effective and clear for applicants and Departments. I reassure the Committee that there is no question of the Government having prejudged the outcome of that exercise, and the Committee took that view in its recently published further report. The Government are clear that the business appointment rules should continue to reflect the high-level principles set out in the seven principles of public life, which were drawn up by the Committee on Standards in Public Life under the chairmanship of Lord Nolan.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/20">Today's discussion has centred largely on the regulation of lobbyists, but I would like to touch on the further report that was published before Christmas. Members of the Select Committee and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" name="Nick Hurd">the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)</phrase> sought further clarification from the Government about the process they are establishing for reviewing progress made by the lobbying industry on voluntary self-regulation, and particularly on how the Government intend to assess whether the progress is adequate and the likely time scale. I would like to summarise the position so far. The Committee is aware that three representative bodies are involved: the Association of Professional Political Consultants; the Chartered Institute of Public Relations; and the Public Relations Consultants Association. Under the umbrella of the public affairs council working party, they published an issues paper last May that set out options for the creation of a new system of voluntary self-regulation. The working party subsequently proposed a stronger system of independent-but still voluntary-regulation of the industry, based around a voluntary register and an enforceable code of conduct.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/21">Following that, in November, the three representative bodies consulted their respective memberships on the proposals to form a public affairs council. The working party's letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase, which is published as an appendix to the Committee's further report, makes clear that the three representative bodies not only have consulted widely on proposals for the establishment of a new voluntary self-regulatory regime, which would operate under the oversight of the proposed public affairs council, but have also set up a public affairs council implementation team to take forward those proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.0/22">The public affairs council implementation team is independently chaired by Sir Philip Mawer. I know that the House and the Committee regard Sir Philip as a person of the highest integrity who will do his utmost to ensure that the lobbying industry takes the opportunity to make a success of the proposed voluntary system of self-regulation. Although we talk about voluntary self-regulation, it is important that there is also an independent element in all this work.</p>

	<p pid="b.166.1/1">My fear, which I am afraid the Minister has not reassured me on, is that the big fish I am interested in will just get away. We may get 99 per cent. of lobbyists, such as the ones that I am associated with; some of them might like to be on a voluntary register as it would give them higher status. I am sure that CND would be very pleased to be on a register of lobbyists-&quot;We're lobbyists, we're doing a good job&quot;. However, the big fish, the big contracts, the money and the global corporations will find their way through and not be caught.</p>
