<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-28a.187.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1929" speakername="Adam Afriyie" colnum="187"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060328/halltext/60328h01.htm#60328h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.187.5/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a precise and good point. If people choose to change their behaviour, perhaps by taking a job elsewhere or by organising their lives differently, once they have done so, it is difficult to reopen lines because by the time closure is reconsidered, the demand has vanished.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/2">More recently, transport and the railways were placed at the heart of new Labour policy, when in 1997 the Deputy Prime Minister announced that he would have failed in five years' time if</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/3" class="indent">&quot;there are not . . . far fewer journeys made by car&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/4">If that were not enough, he went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/5" class="indent">&quot;It is a tall order, but I urge you to hold me to it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/6">The reality is far from the fantastical ideal envisaged by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/7">I quote again, this time from passengers, where</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/8" class="indent">&quot;at the station, all the people were talking at once; they were telling the fat director what a bad railway it was&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/9">Of course, I quote from &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot;, a seminal work by the Rev. W. Awdry. Hon. Members and users of the railway services recognise that the Government's railway ambitions were more like a children's story, given the reality of rail today. The Government have a strange logic when it comes to rail services. On the one hand, they demand that we give up our cars; on the other hand, in the Windsor and Thames Valley region in particular, they make it difficult for us to take the train.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/10">I shall move on to matters of concern to Windsor constituents. I have a letter written in August 2005 from Vivien of College crescent. She says:</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/11" class="indent">&quot;I started work in London in February 2005 based on the fact that I could make my journey, door-to-door, in a journey time of approximately 75 minutes . . . I've paid &pound;810 to park at Slough station.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/12">Commuters from Windsor need to get to Slough first in order to get to Paddington and central London. Her letter continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/13" class="indent">&quot;This allows me to catch the fast trains to London Paddington and provides the shortest journey time.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/14">She points out that before December 2004, the journey time was 30 minutes on average, and that now, based on the new timetabling arrangements, it will be approximately 39 minutes. She concludes:</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/15" class="indent">&quot;Additionally, I will certainly no longer feel that the current season ticket and the parking prices are acceptable to receive a slow stopping service into and from London.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/16">The point is clear. A small increase in journey times from areas such as Windsor, which are closer to London, will have a big impact on how commuters choose to travel. People have a choice. They can either drive their car, take the train or make some other arrangements. If one's journey time is 45 minutes door to door using the train and 55 minutes using the car, even a five or 10-minute delay to the train or a change in scheduling will almost certainly result in someone driving to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/17">I have another letter, which is from the Windsor and Slough Passenger Association. Its members are representative of the hundreds of commuters throughout Windsor, and they raise several concerns. Overcrowding often means that commuters, many of whom may have health issues, are forced to stand for their entire journey. Even at my age I find it hard to stand for more than 30 or 45 minutes without some inconvenience. The Minister knows the train services we are talking about.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/18">A lack of ventilation and air conditioning means that passengers travel in conditions that are often worse than those for cattle going to market. In addition, working ticket machines are scarce, and ticket office opening hours are erratic to say the least. As if that were not bad enough, security at stations is often poor, with inadequate staffing, and the elderly and the young often feel threatened either late at night or during less busy times of the day.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/19">The Windsor and Slough Passenger Association made the effort to respond to the Strategic Rail Authority's consultation on rail franchises. In the association's response, it pointed out that the journey time from Windsor to Paddington was approximately 30 minutes before 2004, whereas after the implementation of the new franchise and its new timetabling and schedules, the journey times will increase to 39 minutes. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/20" class="indent">&quot;This demonstrates a 30 per cent. deterioration overall and is evidence of a continual process of deceleration.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/21">Not exactly a ringing endorsement.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/22">Sadly, although services have deteriorated by 30 per cent., passengers have not seen an equivalent decrease in fares. When taken together, all those factors erect sizable barriers to choosing to use the train.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/23">In conclusion, I have four direct questions for the Minister. First, does he acknowledge that a small increase in journey time for commuters closer to London will encourage them to use their cars? Secondly, how does he intend to supply enough parking spaces close to stations? Thirdly, what steps is he taking to improve the security of stations? Fourthly, is he confident that the Government will deliver on their promise to move millions of people from their cars to the railways? I am not so sure.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-28a.189.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" speakername="Theresa May" colnum="189"  time="009:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060328/halltext/60328h01.htm#60328h01_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.189.2/1">I think that the Minister has received invitations from some of my constituents to go and wait on Maidenhead or Twyford station for the 7.27, to understand the impact that cutting that service will have.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/2">In his intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor, the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire made the point that once services were cut, it was very difficult to restore them, which is indeed the case. The sad fact for my constituents is that when Thames Trains was given the franchise for the local services, it increased the number of services and improved the services available to my constituents, but since the decision was taken to merge the franchise between Thames Trains and First Great Western, services have been cut year on year.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/3">I have a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu about the debate, because I have been fighting cuts in services since December 2003, when it was first suggested that the timetable should be changed and there should be cuts as a result of the merged franchise. To that extent, I feel sorry for the Minister, because he has been saddled with the impact of the decision to merge the franchise, which was taken by the Government and by Richard Bowker when he was chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/4">I want to talk about issues that relate specifically to services for my constituency and I shall start with the timetable. We fought long and hard for a restoration of good fast services to Paddington from Maidenhead and Twyford, and my constituents were very pleased when changes were made to two services. The situation is a little complicated because both services leave at 7.27, although they go from two different stations. One train is the 7.27 from Twyford; the other is the 7.27 from Maidenhead. Extra carriages were put on the 7.27 from Twyford to accommodate the large numbers of people wanting to use that service, and a similar thing happened with the service from Maidenhead. That was a real victory for local passengers and commuters, whose voices were heard.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/5">What will happen under the new timetable in December 2006? Those two trains, which are already overcrowded, will be scrapped and replaced by a single train. That means fewer spaces on the train for my constituents, and the service will be going later, which will cause my constituents considerable problems. Many of them will not get into Paddington early.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/6">One problem that we have with the approach taken by First Great Western and the Department for Transport on the timetable is the failure to understand two things. First, as my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor said, for people commuting from stations close to London, the time that the journey takes is crucial. On a good day, it takes someone who lives in Maidenhead about 45 minutes to drive to London in their car. If a train service is available that takes 20 or 25 minutes, they get on the train. If they are now told that their train service will take 35, 40 or 45 minutes, it is a toss-up, but they will probably get in the car, because the train is so overcrowded that it is unpleasant. The Department needs to understand the crucial importance of journey time for local commuters.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/7">Secondly, the Department needs to recognise the importance that the services have for local people in enabling the economy of the Thames valley to thrive by allowing easy access into London. Obviously, many of my constituents boost the London economy by coming into London to work. Setting aside for a moment the impact on people's lives, which is crucial, cuts in services will also have a major impact on local businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/8">My constituents are, rightly, up in arms about the proposals. They are not quite sure whether to blame First Great Western or the Department for Transport. First Great Western tells me clearly that the Department for Transport is responsible. However, the message that I am now getting from the Department for Transport is that perhaps the situation is not quite as easy as that and there are some issues to do with First Great Western. Frankly, for my constituents, in a sense it does not matter who is at fault. There is a problem that needs to be fixed. The ultimate decision lies with the Government, so my constituents will ultimately say that the Government have to fix the problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.0/1">It is great pleasure to take part in this debate this morning and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1929" name="Adam Afriyie">my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie)</phrase> on securing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March</phrase>, I met the Minister with a number of my constituents to discuss primarily the Bristol to Waterloo line and I am grateful for the way in which he conducted that meeting and for his thoughtfulness on what was said.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/3">I suppose that we are about half way through the 10-year transport plan and it is appropriate for us to ask whether that has been successful in the context of rail travel. The answer is a resounding no. That is a tragedy for our constituents, particularly people in places such as the one I represent who rely heavily on transport of one sort or another and would prefer to rely on public transport, particularly trains, but find increasingly that that is difficult.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-28a.194.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" speakername="Andrew Murrison" colnum="194"  time="009:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060328/halltext/60328h01.htm#60328h01_spnew14">
	<p pid="a.194.3/1">My right hon. Friend makes an extremely good point, which illustrates the point I was trying to make in response to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the intervention from the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.3/2">My principle concerns are about my rural services. There have been cuts on First Great Western's Cardiff to Portsmouth line. I received a letter this morning from a constituent in the village of Dilton Marsh who is concerned about the effect of the new timetable on that community. There have been cuts to the mainline Paddington service which affect the town of Westbury and there is a proposal that the direct service from Bristol to London Waterloo, which stops at towns in west Wiltshire, should be removed. I know that the Minister is considering the invitation to tender. I have not yet heard his decision, but I hope that he has relied on the new figures that have been provided for him by the west Wiltshire rail users group. They seem to conflict starkly with those produced by his Department. He will recall that during our meeting we cast some doubt on the methodology used by the Department for Transport when compiling those figures. There were software problems and a number of other issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.3/3">Essentially, the west Wiltshire rail users group believes that the authorities have grossly underestimated passenger usage. I can tell the Minister that, from my personal observation, the figures on which his Department is relying are well wide of the mark. I hope that when making his determination he pays proper attention to the new data that have been gathered.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.3/4">Although <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1929" name="Adam Afriyie">my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" name="Theresa May">my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase> believe that timetable changes particularly affect those who live close to London and commute, we must appreciate that connectivity is an important part of people's decisions to travel by train or use the convenience of their own car. I am not sure that the Minister has yet considered the importance of direct services, albeit stopping services, which the Bristol to London Waterloo service necessarily is because it stops at towns in west Wiltshire. It is important psychologically that people can latch on to a direct service that will take them all the way from their town in west Wiltshire to London Waterloo. That is important to them and if they have to change at Salisbury they will think twice, especially as that connection is sometimes unreliable. They will either not travel or they will take their car, with the obvious impact on road congestion.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.3/5">I am concerned about a suggestion in the <i>Evening Standard</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-16">16 January</phrase> that the Government were reducing services on rural lines to provide scope for investment on overcrowded services in the south-east. I am not sure about the veracity of that report. Generally speaking, I rely on what I read in the <i>Evening Standard, </i>but it would be useful to know what assessment the Minister made of that report and whether there was any truth in it, as it would be a great shame were that to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.3/6">We know very well that the Department controls, in fairly minute detail, what happens on our train services. The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire railed against privatisation. We must appreciate that the level of control that this Government have over the railways is extraordinary. Therefore, I suspect that to some extent his concerns about privatisation and the rustication of control of public transport have been assuaged somewhat by the Government's recent attempts to command and control the rail network. That being the case, the Minister must accept responsibility for what happens.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1929" name="Adam Afriyie">My hon. Friend the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie)</phrase> has done the House a service in initiating this debate on community rail, which is what I shall focus on this morning. I wish to direct the attention of the House and the Minister to the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/2">I do not believe that there will be any significant new road building in counties such as Oxfordshire in the next 10 to 20 years. There will not be any widening of the M40 motorway, although there may be some marginal improvements to the A34, which is the road from Oxford to Newbury. The county's road network will probably be the same in 10 or 20 years as it is now.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/3">However, Oxfordshire is a fast-growing county. Banbury and Bicester, the two main towns in my constituency, are growing at an exponential rate. I suspect that Bicester is one of the fastest growing towns in the country. Planning permission was granted only last week for new housing estates in Banbury, and new estates have been proposed for Bicester. Oxford is now set to grow as well. That simply means more and more cars on the roads, and, given that there will be little extra road capacity, more and more congestion.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/4">On Friday, it took me an hour to drive from Banbury to the county hall in Oxford&mdash;an hour there and an hour back&mdash;and that was not during the rush hour but in the middle of the day. As our roads get more and more congested, travelling time will increase. Yet within that equation, the local railways are under-utilised and undervalued. The two lines, one from Oxford to Banbury and one from Oxford to Bicester, have, in a sense, become branch lines. There used to be a line from Oxford to Stratford-upon-Avon, but the Government in their wisdom moved that franchise to Chiltern Railways. That was excellent news for that company, which has done an excellent job on the whole of its franchise from Marylebone to Birmingham, but it now means, in effect, that the only trains from Oxford to Banbury run between Oxford and Banbury&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

In Oxfordshire, the roads are becoming more and more congested, and there is an opportunity for rail to take people from Banbury and Bicester to Oxford for study. Many people go to Oxford for the college of further education, and many go for shopping, leisure, recreation and work. With the current system, community rail services get completely lost in the franchise that has been given to First Great Western. I make no particular criticism of First Great Western, but it is really a long-distance train operator. Its skill is operating trains from Exeter and Bristol to London. I do not say that it is not interested in community rail, but it sees it as a contractual obligation to the Government. It is not desperately concerned about the long-term transport needs of counties such as Oxford.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/3">The system is not integrated. The county council looks at roads and bus services. It is able statutorily to subsidise loss-making bus services and to consult with people, but it has no involvement with rail services. At a local community level, we do not have an integrated community transport strategy, because rail is left in limbo.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/4">What First Great Western and other train operators do depends largely on the contractual obligations placed on them by the Government. There are huge demands on the Government's rail budget for subsidies, so they are not particularly interested in subsidising loss-making and community lines in counties such as Oxfordshire. Therefore, there is spiralling decline. The Government say, &quot;The Oxford to Bicester railway line needs only a few services each day, so that is all we will provide money for,&quot; First Great Western says, &quot;We are not going to run any services for which there is no subsidy&quot; and the service goes further into decline. Commuters and other passengers from Bicester to Oxford then find the service less and less reliable, and find other ways of travelling from Bicester to Oxford&mdash;often by bus or coach. Although buses and coaches carry large numbers of people, journey times are often much longer than on trains because of road congestion going into Oxford.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/5">The Government think that they have got around the problem by introducing community rail partnerships. I can see that they might be of value in areas with a high number of tourists, where a branch line might be on the verge of closing and the Government, working with community groups and the tourism industry, might manage to preserve it, but that is not the situation in Oxfordshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/6">I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" name="Theresa May">my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase> that community rail partnerships have been for many the beginning of the end. It is not community rail partnerships that we require, but an integrated transport strategy for counties such as Oxfordshire that looks at the next 10 to 20 years and asks where rail fits in. Rail will not fit in if we have, as we do at the moment, an ever-declining service on the rail lines from Oxford to Banbury and Oxford to Bicester.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> and my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor mentioned the Beeching cuts. I suspect that, if what we know now had been known in the mid-1950s, many of the lines cut during the Beeching period would not have been cut. Many of those could have provided good rail services today. My concern is that, if we do not focus on the potential for the use of rail in areas where the roads will become increasingly congested, by the time that we wake up and recognise the value of the railways as a means of getting people around not only long distances but locally from one town to another, they will have become run down to such an extent that they will not be revivable.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/8">I have a couple of requests for the Minister. Can he and his officials have another look at community rail? They should not just say, &quot;Okay, we will shove off that bit that is too difficult on to community rail partnerships.&quot; Instead, they should ask how, in counties such as Oxfordshire&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase> makes the same point about Wiltshire&mdash;we can ensure that rail services help people with journeys of often no more than 20 or 30 miles to the nearest university city, major town or connecting town. How can we do that and how can we integrate the system more with county councils?</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/9">Subsidies are clearly an issue. I asked the same question in the House. There is considerable subsidy in the rail network, but my constituents are no less worthy of rail subsidy to go to work, study or school than long-distance commuters who come from Exeter or Bristol to London. There has to be some transparency about the subsidies given out on the railways.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/10">Can we please find ways in which to work out how to optimise the opportunities that rail transport and the railway network offer us? Otherwise, I can see that each year First Great Western will apologetically come and talk to the Cherwell rail users group and others and say, &quot;We are terribly sorry. This is the requirement that has been placed on us by the Government. We are fulfilling that contract but we have to meet other obligations and we have that difficulty.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/11">My other point is by way of parenthesis but it follows on from what my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead and my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor said. A number of commuters use the local services as connecting services via Oxford to London. There is a broad difficulty. To everyone in areas such as Oxfordshire and the Thames valley, its seems that First Great Western has either taken the decision or been told by the Government that the stretch of rail from Reading to Paddington must be as high speed as possible to enable long-distance trains to get through more quickly. The irony is that many local services are being held back. Not only are the number of trains from Islip, Tackley and Heyford fewer during the day, but the time of running is considerably longer, as is the time that those people have to wait for connections at Oxford. That is simply because of how the stretch of line between Reading and Paddington is used.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/12">That must be considered, otherwise the irony will be that those living nearer to London will find their services becoming more and more disrupted. Apart from anything else, I cannot see that that makes good economic sense for First Great Western. All that will happen is that those nearer to London will take other options, not least getting in their cars and going up the M4 or the M40. That will mean a considerable loss of revenue for First Great Western. There has to be fairer access to the stretch of rail between Reading and Paddington, so that the people who live nearest to London and others are not penalised.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/13">My concern is that we do not seem to have an integrated transport plan and local plan for how to use rail to the best effect as a community asset in areas in the south and south-east of England in particular. Housing numbers in those areas are growing exponentially and as a consequence car and road usage will grow. We are bound to see greater road congestion. Railways provide a wonderful, unique way of relieving that congestion cost-effectively. However, people will use them only if services are adequate and reliable. Services will not be adequate on the present system, with the Government giving minimal subsidy to the rail operators. The rail operators do not see an opportunity but a duty that they have to fulfil. We are missing an opportunity, which is sad. I hope the Minister can address it.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.0/1">I am not here to defend the Government, but long-term underinvestment cannot be addressed overnight.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.0/2">Five issues need to be addressed. Although the debate this morning has concentrated on London and the south, as I represent a northern constituency, I want to make it clear that some of the issues that have been mentioned affect the rail network and commuters as a whole, and are not merely London-centric.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.0/3">The first issue is the rail franchising system and the unprecedented power of the Secretary of State under the Railways Act 2005. The second is overcrowding on commuter services. The third is the age and suitability of much of the rolling stock. The fourth is the cost per mile. The fifth is the issue of capacity and bottlenecks, which have a major effect on future development and expansion not only in London but in the big cities, including Birmingham and Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.0/4">The Railways Act gave the Secretary of State unprecedented powers. He stipulates and controls the franchise and can set the timetable within that. If we consider the issues that have been referred to, it is clear that many of those problems have come about as a result of setting the franchises so tightly. Although the Secretary of State sought to deny responsibility for such issues in the House last week, in my view he cannot escape that fact. Those powers exist and they have clearly been exercised. He can also require a review of rail services&mdash;we saw two published last week&mdash;and close unpopular routes.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.0/5">If we look at the new franchises, and particularly the west country franchise, which was let to First earlier this year, we see that train numbers have been reduced despite unprecedented increases in passenger numbers. On the St. Ives Bay line, for example, passenger numbers are up 25 per cent., but the number of trains has been reduced from 26 to 23 each way in the summer and to 16 in the winter. On the Maritime line, passenger numbers are up 21 per cent, but the number of trains has been reduced from 13 to eight each way. It is the same on the Looe Valley line, where passenger numbers are up 16 per cent., but the number of trains has been reduced from 13 to eight each way. That is the direct result of a franchise that will deliver &pound;1.13 billion to the Treasury over the next 10 years. In the past, many people would have expected the more profitable lines, such as the Bristol to London line, to help to subsidise some of the rural and branch commuter services, but that has not happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.0/6">If we look elsewhere, we will see the same process beginning as each franchise is let. In my area, for example, the operator of the northern franchise wanted to introduce new services and an improved timetable, but the new franchise system has prevented them from doing so. That has had the consequence of continuing overcrowding, but the issue has not been addressed on lines such as that from Huddersfield to Manchester, which has only two carriageways. The review that was published last week contained no plans whatever to increase capacity on such lines.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.0/7">As for overcrowding, the numbers of excess passengers are quoted for London, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1575" name="Chris Grayling">the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)</phrase> asked a telling question last week about commuter services in London, but similar figures are not available for elsewhere in the country. Overcrowding affects commuters who travel into not only London, but Manchester, Birmingham and our other big cities, and the House needs all the figures to be made available when we debate the development of services. The review that was published last week is meaningless for the northern franchise because it gives no information to back up some of the points that it makes.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.0/8">I turn now to the age and suitability of the rolling stock. A few weeks ago, I asked a question about the plans for each franchise and about what would be done to improve the age of the rolling stock. Of course, the average age, which the Government quote, has improved, but if we look at services other than those on inner-city lines or serving London, we see that things are different. The average age of northern franchise rolling stock is 19 years, and there are no plans to renew it. That is totally unacceptable. We have inefficient, old rolling stock that costs a fortune to run, but we are not dealing with the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.0/9">On the cost per mile, we are sometimes quoted figures for some rural lines that show that such lines are inordinately inexpensive and cost too much per mile. However, we do not see the figures. If we are to have an honest discussion about which services should be provided, we need the figures to be produced. It has now been decided to axe certain services in the west country, but such decisions should not be made just by the Department for Transport&mdash;they should involve local people. A key point about the Railways Act is that it removed control from passenger transport authorities and councils, which no longer have a proper say in the letting of franchises.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.0/10">To sum up, I would like to see f<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">our things. As the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> said, we need the network to be looked at as a whole, and there should not be this piecemeal letting of franchises. Secondly, we need more profitable lines to subsidise less profitable lines. Thirdly, we need long-term investment. The original plan talked about having franchises of 15 and 20 years, so that improvements could be made, but that is not happening, and all the franchises that have been let are for shorter periods. Finally, we need passenger transport authorities and local councils to play a greater role in setting priorities as part of an integrated transport plan. In short, we do not need the greater centralisation of the rail network that we are currently seeing. We need the Minister to be open about what is happening and we need to have an honest debate about the problems that we face.</p>

The truth is that, all round the country, lines are under threat of closure or service reductions and stations are in jeopardy.</p>

	<p pid="a.207.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve for the first time under your chairmanship, Miss Begg.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/2">Overcrowded housing is an important issue, both in my London constituency and nationally. I shall talk about the reasons for that and then consider some of the solutions that the Government could consider more firmly. As a Hackney and London MP, I view these matters from the perspective of a city that is rapidly growing. London's population is set to grow by the equivalent of a city the size of Leeds by 2016. Indeed, we are already in the middle of that growth and are seeing the pressures put on all services in London, particularly housing. London is also a young city. In Hackney, 22.1 per cent. of the population is under the age of 16. Children and families need homes to live in&mdash;and they need them now.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/3">Overcrowding may be concentrated in London, but it is not just a London issue. London and the south-east are widely acknowledged as the powerhouse of the British economy, and we need to create housing stock for our workers. The cost of not tackling overcrowding is high.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/4">I shall highlight some of the problems in my constituency. Hackney is the third most overcrowded borough in London, with one person in 10&mdash;8,000 families&mdash;living in overcrowded accommodation. The number of households in this one London borough who live in overcrowded conditions is greater than can be found in whole cities. Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool and Bradford also suffer from overcrowding, but each of those cities has fewer such households than Hackney. In Greater London, 174,200 households, including 261,000 children&mdash;one fifth of London's children&mdash;live in overcrowded conditions. That figure rises to 30 per cent. among those who live in social housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/5">The debate about overcrowding often has to deal with technical definitions and financial models. However, as I know only too well as a constituency Member, there is a human side. It is the people who are suffering from living in overcrowded conditions&mdash;the children who miss out and the families who suffer stress.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/6">According to a survey of English housing conducted by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, 500,000 households nationally&mdash;900,000 children&mdash;live in overcrowded conditions. The problem has grown in London since 1991, and severe overcrowding has risen by almost 50 per cent. Black and minority ethnic families are six times more likely to live in overcrowded conditions than white British families, and overcrowding is particularly prevalent among Bangladeshi and African communities. That is why three east London boroughs top the unenviable overcrowding league.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/7">The Mayor of London's involvement in housing has helped to sharpen the political focus on the issue, which is too big a problem for individual boroughs to deal with alone. Later, I shall touch on some of the funding problems of London boroughs. Nationally, the Minister of Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1826" name="David Miliband">the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Miliband)</phrase>, and his colleagues are debating the question of city regional government. I may not always see eye to eye with the Mayor of London&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-28a.208.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" speakername="Meg Hillier" colnum="208"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060328/halltext/60328h02.htm#60328h02_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.208.1/1">That may be a moment of agreement with the Opposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/2">The creation of strategic London government was an important and helpful step towards seeing the wider picture on housing, including overcrowding. Under this Government, we have seen a welcome growth in the number of affordable homes, but the balance of the various types of home is not right. The pressure for unit numbers&mdash;whichever party is in government will always exert political pressure to increase quantity&mdash;is often at the cost of a greater balance that would allow people to move within their communities rather than having to move out of London. I have much anecdotal evidence showing that those of my constituents who have the wherewithal to move from inner London to outer London or even outside London are doing just that in order to find the housing that they need. Over-focusing on one and two-bedroom properties in private and social housing stock is either driving families out or condemning them to live in cramped and unhealthy conditions, and many of their neighbours are in the same position, which often creates near ghettos of overpopulated areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/3">The problems of imbalanced communities and affordable housing are not unique to cities, but they are acute in London, which is why I shall focus on their impact on the city. We need a greater supply of larger affordable housing, but other mechanisms are also needed in order to adjust the playing field so that, for example, it can become more cost-effective to upgrade older, larger homes than selling them to pay for smaller units.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/4">Another issue that impacts on housing supply in London is under-occupancy. According to the ODPM's survey of English housing, 9 per cent. of London's social rented sector is under-occupied. Freeing up those larger homes will not solve overcrowding, but it could help, and many councils are at the forefront of initiatives to encourage tenants with spare bedrooms to move to smaller properties. For example, Hackney is adjusting its lettings policy to give more priority to overcrowded families. It is also increasing financial support for under-occupying tenants to cover the cost of moving to smaller properties&mdash;a simple thing that is often the brake on people's desire to move. It is also encouraging under-occupying tenants to move by offering them not only what they need, but a second bedroom, so that relatives who visit can use the spare room. That is one reason why people do not want to move from larger properties. I am delighted that Shelter, the housing charity, has highlighted Hackney's approach as good practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/5">Even if all tenants with spare rooms moved to smaller properties, however, it would not solve the problem. I want to move on to some bigger solutions and issues. The main solution is a greater supply of housing, and altering the financial incentives for housing associations that are developing new social housing would help provide the right size and mix of units. I shall highlight supply and size of housing and consider some definitions of overcrowding, as well as mentioning the effects of not acting. I am not a technical expert on housing matters, but I worked in the housing field for more than a decade. I hope that the Minister is listening hard, because the stark fact is that the current definition has been extant since 1935. It is rather out of date. I see him nodding; he may like to comment in his winding-up speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/6">The Housing Act 2004 allows the Government to modernise housing standards&mdash;a provision that I welcome. However, the Housing Act 1985 contains two legal definitions of overcrowding. I shall not go into detail, but I want to highlight the room and space standards. The room standard allows a large kitchen to be counted as a sleeping room. It puts no limit on the number of same-sex cohabitants in such rooms, and it does not include children under the age of 10. Under that definition, children under 10 are wiped out.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/7">Under the space standard, children under the age of one do not count at all. A room is counted if it is a bedroom or living room, as are kitchens and dining rooms. Families can live in severe overcrowded conditions without hitting the Government's radar. Applying those definitions to the reality shows that it is probably a great deal worse than was suggested by the figures that that I cited earlier. I remind the House&mdash;I hope that the Minister will hear what I have to say&mdash;that, in theory, four children under the age of 10 could share a living room as a bedroom without being technically severely overcrowded.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/8">I was delighted in 2003 when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" name="Andrew Love">my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love)</phrase> promoted a private Member's Bill that recommended not counting living rooms or kitchens and giving every occupant of the household equal worth. A change is certainly needed, and I am pleased with the Government's recent announcement that they will consult on the statutory overcrowding standard. It is a step forward, but it is long overdue.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/9">The Government have rightly highlighted the importance of education, on which debate is raging further down the Committee corridor today. Overcrowding has a big educational impact. A Shelter survey carried out at the end of last year showed that 80 per cent. of families felt that living in overcrowded conditions was damaging their children's educational prospects. That is self-evident. Overcrowding prevents children from having a quiet space to read, do their homework and study for exams. In my constituency, we have a number of homework clubs. Indeed, a local vicar in Haggerston in south Hackney, the Rev. Rose Hudson-Wilkin, has opened her home to local schoolchildren to provide them with space and peace to do their homework. I applaud her philanthropy, but the Government need to tackle the problem more systematicall.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/10">There are also international examples of the impact of overcrowding on education. Research entitled &quot;The Urban Prospect&quot;, published in 2001 by New York's citizens housing and planning council, showed a link between overcrowding and lower levels of educational attainment. The study found that overcrowding reduces the probability of boys completing secondary school by almost 11 per cent., and that of girls by about 6 per cent. I do not doubt the Government's commitment to improving educational standards, but we need to do that across the piece. A home with the space to study must come high up the list.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/11">The links between overcrowding and health are well documented. When I entered politics, the then director of public health stressed to me that the provision of better-quality housing for families living in poor, overcrowded homes would have one of the best impacts on local health. We have come on a bit during the past 12 years or so. However, I cite the Shelter survey again: 90 per cent. of families felt that overcrowding was damaging their children's health; asthma was the condition mentioned most often. It will not surprise hon. Members to hear that 86 per cent. of those surveyed felt that depression, anxiety and stress resulted from living in cramped quarters; every week, we see in our surgeries the impact of overcrowding.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/12">Research also shows links between overcrowding and respiratory and infectious diseases. British Medical Association research shows that overcrowding in childhood significantly affects stature, rates of disease and rates of early mortality in adulthood. If we do not tackle overcrowding, we will condemn today's children to a life of health inequality. Tuberculosis is another problem that is particularly prevalent in London, and it is directly linked to overcrowding. I commend work done by the London assembly on the impacts and causes of TB, which is on the increase. In Hackney, TB rates are similar to those in China. In 2001, all but three of the 15 London boroughs with above-average overcrowding had an above-average incidence of TB. We know from research that overcrowding plays a larger role in the incidence of TB than that of migration or ethnicity.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/13">The critical argument is about the shortage of housing supply. The Government have done much good work to tackle the problem, but the concentration on one and two-bedroom properties has meant that the problems have not been entirely addressed. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-08">8 March</phrase>, the Minister for Housing and Planning announced that in London the proportion of new housing built with three bedrooms or more would increase from 27 per cent. in 2004&ndash;06 to 35 per cent. from 2006&ndash;08. That was very welcome. In Hackney, the fruits of that policy are eagerly awaited, especially by the tenants of Haggerston West and Kingsland estate, who await a determination about their estate transfer, which has been discussed, in particular, because of the need to include larger family properties on the estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/14">Supply is one part of overcrowding, but we need other ways of tackling the problem in the short term. I commend the 10-point plan drawn up by the Association of London Government, with the support of the National Housing Federation. The key points include a call for a national target to reduce overcrowding, which I support. People often mock nationally set targets, but all types of professionals on the ground tell me that Government targets have a beneficial impact because they focus local delivery, so a national target would be a good step forward. I also support the ALG's calls for the Government to have an overcrowding unit; perhaps it is time we had an overcrowding tsar. The Minister is smiling at the idea; perhaps he could have the job.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/15">I should also like grant funding to be re-jigged to make the building of family-sized units easier and more affordable. Local housing associations in Hackney tell me that although we need more family-sized units locally, they do not provide the rent return that comes from building more one and two-bedroom properties. That is perverse situation, which we need to change by considering the cost per person of building a home, rather than at the cost per home. It is a typical clash between the Treasury and the delivery arm of the Government. The common-sense argument is there, but we need to make sure that it is translated. I am not sure whether the Minister can make pledges about what the Treasury can do, but perhaps he can comment on any discussions between the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasury on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/16">I turn to the need for one small but important measure in London. A number of housing associations have been selling their larger properties, particularly street properties and older properties. We need a brake on the sale of such properties, incentives to do them up and more support for tenants who want to move out of larger social homes and into other properties. Perhaps we could collate the existing funding mechanisms and provide extra support.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/17">One of the bizarre aspects of current policy is that housing corporation funding rules reduce, pound for pound, the money that housing associations receive from local funding. I am a great believer in decentralisation and in local government having a role strategically, and in some cases in delivery terms, in tackling the detailed needs of an area. It seems an emasculation of local government, however, to say, &quot;Fine, you can fund housing associations to provide more housing&quot;, but then to remove money from the national pot.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/18">In the 2004 spending review, an extra 10,000 new socially rented homes were promised by 2007&ndash;08, and a total of 75,000 homes over three years. That has been very welcome and I do not underplay the step change the Government have made in focusing on housing. However, I am looking to the next comprehensive spending review, as no doubt the Minister is, although perhaps he cannot commit at this point. I should like the Government to commit to the recommendations of the Barker review and ensure that the resources are available to deliver on those pledges.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/19">The Government have done a great deal and recent announcements give me great hope, but I urge the Minister to start acting now to ensure that the benefits accrue for this generation of our children, as well as the next.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this morning, Miss Begg.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> on securing this debate. I know that she has spent more than a decade taking an interest in housing issues, and her speech did her great credit. She reflected both on the problems in her constituency and on the broader issue that we face in tackling overcrowding in housing. Her speech was a model of clarity and exposition, and I congratulate her on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/3">I believe that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" name="Daniel Rogerson">the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson)</phrase> was making his Front-Bench debut, and I thank him for laying out the issues from a rural perspective with particular clarity and for contributing to what I hope will be a broad consensus on the need to tackle this issue. Westminster Hall is not usually an arena for vicious partisanship, and I hope that it will not be so today. In sharing a commitment to tackle the problem, I hope that we can establish a degree of consensus across the Front Benches.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/4">I also want to thank Shelter, the campaigning housing charity, not only for its sustained campaigning effort for many years, but for its poster in Westminster station. Those of us who regularly use the Jubilee line will be familiar with that striking and effective poster. It shows a number of children in the House of Commons, crawling over the Dispatch Box and so on, and vividly and graphically brings home to parliamentarians and others what the reality of overcrowding might mean. The picture paints a thousand words&mdash;words that are conveyed more effectively than the thousand words of mine that the <i>Hansard</i> reporters are recording today.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/5">The scale of the problem was outlined with particular authority by the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch. She reminded us that about 500,000 households in Britain today experience overcrowding. As we know, that means that almost 1 million children are growing up in circumstances that are an affront to social justice. She reminded us of the particular problems that she encounters in her constituency. Across London, 175,000 households experience overcrowding, which means that about 261,000 children are growing up in circumstances that they should not have to face. The Minister represents a seat that covers the London boroughs of Newham and Tower Hamlets&mdash;the two local authorities in London that have the most severe overcrowding problem&mdash;so he will know the scale of the problem from his constituency postbag.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/6">As both speakers have spelled out, the consequences of the problem are particularly severe for children. The consequences in health terms have been graphically spelled out. As the hon. Lady pointed out, respiratory problems, particularly tuberculosis, are on the increase, and overcrowding is a crucial factor. The hon. Member for North Cornwall said that when it comes to mental health and well-being, overcrowding contributes to stress and anxiety, and in the worst cases to depression.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/7">There are compelling reasons for dealing with overcrowding in terms of both public health and educational outcomes. As both speakers pointed out, it is increasingly difficult for children and teenagers living in overcrowded housing to get the space that they need to devote themselves to the study that will allow themselves to make the most of their lives and their potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/8">Nearly a century ago, Virginia Woolf wrote a book entitled &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot;. Part of the burden of that book was the difficulty that women had faced in the past, overwhelmed as they were by crippling domestic duties, in managing to clear both the time and the space for creative endeavour. Her plea then&mdash;an explicitly feminist plea&mdash;is one that should be made on behalf of our children and teenagers today. They need a room of their own&mdash;their own space in which they can not only grow and develop psychologically, but study and make the most of their homework. Such a space would help young people's schooling and ensure that they become all that they can be.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/9">We recognise that this problem has a direct effect on health and educational outcomes for our young people and that we need to address it, and I suspect that there is a consensus throughout the House on that. How should we go about addressing it? As the hon. Lady pointed out, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" name="Andrew Love">her colleague the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love)</phrase> tried to introduce a private Member's Bill to modernise the definition of statutory overcrowding. The last time we had a statutory definition was in 1935, when there was a national Government and Ramsay MacDonald was the Prime Minister; some of us, I suspect, are nostalgic for those days, while others perhaps are not. In 1935, the definition was accepted simply as a working definition; it was seen not as the ideal, but simply as a means to an end&mdash;a staging post on the road to improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/10">I suspect that there is broad consensus at present that the time is long overdue for revisiting the definition of statutory overcrowding. Indeed, that has certainly been hinted at by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. As the hon. Lady also pointed out, both the room standard and the space standard in that definition are outdated. We cannot have a situation in our country in which living rooms are counted as bedrooms in working out whether individuals are suffering from overcrowding, and in which four children sleeping in one room does not count as overcrowding. That offends against common sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/11">Legislation on its own is not enough, however. We can legislate to deal with this problem, but that is not a magic wand. It is helpful in setting a benchmark and in governing our direction of travel, but it will not in itself resolve the problem. What can we do? As both hon. Members have spoken have pointed out, we need to address the issue of supply and to ensure that, as we increase and free up supply, we have the right mix of houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/12">When we examine supply, we discover that there have been melancholy trends in the statistics since the early 1990s. Again, I make my comments in a spirit of bipartisanship, and although some of my remarks may be construed as critical of the Government&mdash;and, indeed, they are&mdash;some of them are also critical of the Conservatives towards the end of our time in government, when our contribution to and investment in social housing started to fall. There has been a fall in housing supply since the very early 1990s. According to the ODPM's own figures, that reduction meant that over the period broadly from 1991 to the beginning of the 21st century we had an excess in the growth of households over the amount of new homes of about 500,000. Therefore, 500,000 households did not get the houses they deserved.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/13">Since the beginning of the current century there has been a welcome increase in housing supply, but it is still the case that household growth outstrips the supply of new housing, and the most recent ODPM figures on household growth emphasise that households are growing at an even faster rate than we envisaged. It is therefore incumbent on all of us to do everything we can to free up supply further.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/14">The point has been made, not least by the hon. Member for North Cornwall, that the constrictions in housing supply have been particularly acute in the social housing sector. Even though there has been a welcome increase in the amount of new development in the private sector, there is still not enough of it and there has not been a matching increase in the supply of social housing.</p>

	<p pid="a.221.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his point, and I entirely understand why he was absent. Bill Clinton is a bigger attraction than any of us. At the beginning of my speech, I said that the Opposition recognise that the scale of future household growth requires significant additional housing. Like the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch, I paid tribute to the hon. Gentleman's private Member's Bill and his crusade to deal with the definition of statutory overcrowding. I am delighted to see him in the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/2">This country has become more prosperous during the past 30 years. One key thing about countries that become more prosperous is that people generally like to live in more spacious homes with access to green space. It is an entirely worthy aspiration. I do not think that just because individuals no longer live in large or extended families, we should automatically say, &quot;You're condemned to live in this type of housing.&quot; Flatted developments and sheltered housing will be appropriate for certain people towards the end of their lives, when they want to live in a smaller space because larger space becomes unmanageable. As the hon. Lady said, enlightened local authorities are providing incentives for people to move out of social housing that may be too big for them. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation made this discovery:</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/3" class="indent">&quot;People's least favourite type of development in their community is the high rise block.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/4">Only 28 per cent. of people say that their preferred form of living is high-density city centre living. There is clear evidence that the popular demand is for more space in greener cities and greener communities. That is the direction of travel in which housing should go.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/5">Finally, because I have taken up far too much time, I have just a few questions for the Minister. First, we should all like to know where we are on progress towards a new statutory definition of overcrowding. Secondly, what new initiatives might we see from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to increase the supply of social housing and to ensure that it is of the right kind? Thirdly, as a general indication, has he considered the effect of regulation on the private rented supply?</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/6">Finally and perhaps most importantly, what will be done in the next few years to encourage development and to free up supply? In particular, does the Minister accept that when it comes to tackling the resistance to development in our country, it is not enough to belabour those who resist it? We must take them with us by understanding their concerns, so that we can address the pressing need, which I think everyone agrees we have, to deal with the problem of overcrowding, the health and education challenges that it poses us, and in particular, the challenge it poses us to ensure that our society is socially just and inclusive.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.0/1">Miss Begg, it is a pleasure to see you in the Chair presiding over t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">his debate. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> on securing this important debate. As a fellow east London MP, she knows that I share the type of casework that she receives. I have close, first-hand knowledge of the serious problems that she raises, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1858" name="Michael Gove">the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)</phrase> acknowledged. I also associate myself with his generous tribute to my hon. Friend, as well as the welcome that he extended to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" name="Daniel Rogerson">the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/2">I welcome the characteristically thoughtful, well crafted and constructive contribution of the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. I hope to continue the debate in that spirit. However, the consensus seemed to break down towards the end, particularly when the hon. Gentleman was tested by some of my hon. Friend's questions about his party's financial commitment to the house-build programme that I shall outline. I believe from the Sunday newspapers that his leader is about to make a pronouncement about the new-build programme, so perhaps that was the reason why the hon. Gentleman was unable to supply as much information as might have been helpful. None the less, I am conscious that both Opposition parties have made a constructive contribution to the debate, and I welcome it.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/3">As my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch said, the statutory overcrowding standards have been with us for a considerable time&mdash;indeed, they have remained unchanged since 1935. Back in 1935, those provisions were considered very much reforming measures. The key motivation was to promote better health. Given the other social advances since 1935, overcrowding is now much less likely to indicate grossly insanitary conditions or a high risk of the spread of life-threatening diseases, notwithstanding the qualification of tuberculosis, as my hon. Friend mentioned. However, I recognise that overcrowding can still raise health concerns, bringing on stress, making the spread of infection easier, and increasing the risk of accidents in the home.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/4">The Government do not defend the current overcrowding standards. They are very out of date. They discount sleeping in rooms other than bedrooms and they tolerate unacceptable degrees of sharing by children who, by any modern standard, are old enough to need their own space. That is why we took powers in the Housing Act 2004 to amend the standards, and undertook to consult on how the powers might be used. Some hon. Members feel that we have taken rather too long to consult, but we needed to consider the statutory standards in the context of our housing policies, and I shall explain how we are doing that.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/5">Information on overcrowding under the 1935 standards is not collected systematically, but we believe that about 20,000 households are statutorily overcrowded. That is roughly 0.1 per cent. of households. The other measure is the bedroom standard, a long-standing statistical measure that is used in the English housing condition survey and represents the main source of data on overcrowding. We know that 2.5 per cent. of households&mdash;just over 500,000 households&mdash;are overcrowded by that measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/6">Both of those percentages are small, but I do not underestimate the impact on overcrowding upon those families, nor do I seek to diminish the wide variations that the figures conceal. For instance, overcrowding is more of a problem in London, where 150,000 households are overcrowded, of which 29,000 are severely overcrowded in the social rented sector. Overcrowding throughout the whole of London is 6.3 per cent. by the bedroom standard. Specifically in the social sector in London, it is calculated at 11.8 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/7">Ethnicity, as mentioned by hon. Members, is also a significant issue. Within London's social rented sector, for instance, the rate of overcrowding is 7.8 per cent. for white households, but 17.8 per cent. for black and minority ethnic households. The highest rate of overcrowding by ethnic group in London's social rented sector is 29 per cent. among Bangladeshi households. They account for just 3 per cent. of all households but 10 per cent. of all overcrowded households in London's social rented sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/8">My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch raised the question of the Association of Local Government's 10-point plan on overcrowding, which has been welcomed by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.0/1">Before my hon. Friend reels off the estimates about overcrowding, may I inform the House that according to the English house condition survey, more than 900,000 children are affected by overcrowding&mdash;about 260,000 of them in Greater London? Does he accept that if the Government are to achieve their ambition of halving child poverty by 2010 and eliminating it by 2020, action has to be taken on overcrowding?</p>

I hope to return to some of the Government's commitments later in my speech. If I do not cover the figures, I will write to my hon. Friend, but I think that they are included in my speech. As he suggests, the Barker report is fundamental to the Government's direction of travel. There is a commitment. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch raised the relationship between the ODPM and the Treasury. That relationship clearly involves dynamism. We are clear that we have to address the question that has been raised, and I will provide some reassurance shortly in respect of numbers and the immediate future.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/3">My hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning recently announced a new programme of work to deal with overcrowding and its impact on children. We are increasing the proportion of new social housing with three or more bedrooms to be built in London from 27 to 34 per cent. in the 2006&ndash;08 affordable housing programme. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch welcomed that in her opening speech. We are building on the preventive measures that have been successful in reducing the number of new homeless families in London by 25 per cent. in the past year. We are encouraging London boroughs to make better use of cash incentive schemes and tailored support to help single people wanting to move out of larger accommodation and to help families to move to other areas where they can find larger homes. Against that background of specific measures, we shall consult in the next few months on the statutory definition of overcrowding.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/4">As my hon. Friend said, there are examples of good practice. Hackney and Tower Hamlets are two of the local authorities that are hardest pressed in respect of overcrowding and they are seeking innovative solutions to assist their communities to have better housing conditions. I recognise that overcrowding is seen as a neglected problem, but it would be wrong to think that authorities have not been considering the issue or not reporting the contribution that overcrowding makes to the totality of housing need in their areas. All local authorities have carried out housing needs surveys, which included assessments of overcrowding. Those surveys, along with other data on housing needs, inform the assessment of the need for new affordable housing set out in authorities' housing strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/5">Part 7 of the Local Government Act 2003 puts the strategies on a statutory footing for the first time, because the Government believe that a robust strategy is essential to the delivery of local authorities' housing functions. Our guidance stresses the importance of addressing all relevant issues in housing strategies. One element of the strategy in respect of which the hon. Member for Surrey Heath requested information was private landlords' role and regulation in that regard. The Government agree that private landlords have a vital role. There are many good landlords, but there is also a lot of poor stock and bad management, as hon. Members know. The package of measures in the Housing Act 2004 addresses that. Responsible landlords and their associations recognise the need to raise standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/6">The provisions may look like over-regulation, but we need to protect tenants as well as encouraging existing and new landlords. We think that our policies strike that balance, but we are always open to representations from any associations that believe that more can be done. I would also welcome anything that the hon. Gentleman for Surrey Heath might wish to contribute to the discussion and the solution or partial solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/7">I return to overcrowding as a health and safety issue. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch may want to bear in mind that the new housing health and safety rating system, which will come into operation on <phrase class="date" code="">6 April</phrase>, will enable local authorities to assess overcrowding as a potential health and safety hazard. The principle of the system is that authorities will consider what action to take to deal with health and safety hazards in dwellings on the basis of statutory powers and duties, supported by regulations and guidance. Authorities will have a number of options to deal with the hazards identified under the new system. Those options will range from mere notification of minor remote hazards up to prohibition or closure where justified.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/8">That does not mean that overcrowding will disappear. It will not always be possible to establish serious health and safety risks from overcrowding, and the system will not deal with gender separation. None the less, it will bring crowding and space into the mainstream of health and safety issues relating to housing. Where overcrowding aggravates other hazards such as fire risk, strong action will be possible. In addition, the provisions in the 2004 Act for the licensing of higher-risk houses in multiple occupation, which will also come into operation on <phrase class="date" code="">6 April</phrase>, will play an important part in ensuring safe conditions and adequate amenities in properties that, by definition, contain more than one household.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/9">The hon. Member for North Cornwall raised the issue of the right to buy. I know of the suggestions that right-to-buy sales are eroding the stock of local authority homes, and the argument that the Government should reduce the maximum right-to-buy discounts available to tenants to reduce sales. The Government support the principle of the right to buy. It has helped many thousands of families to realise their aspiration to own their own home and it has helped to create many stable mixed-tenure communities. However, we were concerned about its impact on the availability of affordable housing in some areas and about exploitation of the rules. We therefore lowered maximum right-to-buy discounts in 41 areas under housing market pressure. We also changed the rules in the Housing Act 2004 to restore the scheme's focus on long-term home ownership and the building of sustainable communities, and to tackle exploitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/10">We are keeping right-to-buy discounts under review and do not rule out further changes, but they must be targeted and proportionate.</p>

	<p pid="a.226.1/1">As a regular attender at ODPM questions in the Chamber, my hon. Friend knows that that matter has arisen a number of times during parliamentary questions and that a number of debates have been raised. The assurance from the ODPM is that a number of initiatives are under review on how best to stimulate the housing market, including the new social homebuy and shared equity schemes, in addition to the new money that the Government are putting in and the building programme. The matter is very much to the forefront of the Government's consideration and I am sure that it will feature strongly in the 2007 comprehensive spending review.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.1/2">On the educational impact, my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch referred specifically to the impact of overcrowding on educational attainment. The ODPM commissioned a review of the evidence and literature on the impact of overcrowding on education and health in 2004. That review, which was carried out by De Montfort university, identified only a few previous studies of the relationship between overcrowding and educational attainment and was thus unable to draw conclusions. However, the review concluded that such a relationship existed for both health and education and drew attention to a study carried out in Paris in 2003 which pointed to a strong relationship with education. It is worth noting that no single definition of overcrowding was used in the studies, but the review tells us clearly that the need to safeguard children's educational attainment should be in the front of our mind as we tackle overcrowding.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.1/3">In conclusion, I do not believe for a second that I have satisfactorily responded to my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch or to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath in that I do not have a magic wand to provide a solution to the problem that we all agree is clearly desperate for many thousands of families. However, I hope that I have reassured my hon. Friend that the Government are determined to bring overcrowding to the front of our mind in taking our housing policies forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.228.1/1">It is the first time I have spoken in a debate with you in the Chair, Mr. Hood, and I am looking forward to it. This week, three independent health watchdogs have highlighted concerns about the treatment of the elderly in our country. This topic is rather current so it is appropriate for us to debate it in the House today.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/2">The objective of any civilised society is to treat the elderly with dignity and respect, but there are examples of the elderly being neglected and patronised in all parts of the country. This represents an ongoing battle that we must pursue and win. The Labour Government have done a great deal to help senior citizens during the last eight or nine years, and this is not an opportunity for me to have a go at the Administration. Rather, it is an opportunity to ask some questions that constituents have put to me because they feel strongly about the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/3">The Government, the national health service, local government and care homes are inextricably linked. They are all interdependent. I shall be interested to hear from the Minister what studies have been done of that link and how greater efficiency and care can be guaranteed. If we provide good care in nursing homes and care homes that gives peace of mind to senior citizens, how much will the NHS save in the long term? Many medical friends of mine confirm that stress can have a great impact on senior citizens and the illnesses that they can have. Providing them with a guarantee of long-term care in a nursing home would go a long way to preventing other illnesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/4">I represent Shrewsbury, and many owners of nursing homes and care homes in Shropshire want the Government to listen to them more. They do a very good job of looking after people in Shrewsbury, but believe that the huge amount of regulations and red tape that have been foisted on them are having a major impact on the cost of running their establishments. They have to pass their costs on to their clients. I understand that the Government have a responsibility to set uniform standards across the country, but if the Minister were to come to any care home or nursing home in Shrewsbury, she would find that the standards were extremely high. I wish that we could give the owners and managers of care homes fewer targets and less red tape and allow them to get on with the job of running their establishments. The resulting costs are passed on to their clients, which is part of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/5">I would like tax breaks for private companies to allow them to develop new care homes and for the training of their staff. Another of their major problems is that they cannot find enough staff to look after patients, so they have to spend a great deal of money on finding people and training them.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/6">Constituents in Shrewsbury have been coming to my surgery in growing numbers to tell me of the financial headaches that they have in relation to this issue. Many of them, such as Mr. Cartwright of Shrewsbury, have had to sell their parents' homes in order to pay for long-term care. Once they have sold their homes, they then have to manage the assets, which are eked out over a certain amount of time to pay for the costs. Many constituents feel that such care should be entirely or partly funded by the NHS. This generation feels that the state&mdash;the NHS&mdash;is responsible and the Government should help.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/7">People genuinely feel that they have paid taxes for all of their lives and that long-term care should be either partly or totally paid for by the state. That is a frame of mind that many people have and it is difficult to change it in the short term because people have high expectations. Later on, I shall talk about my generation of citizens and how we shall have to deal with the problem, but many of my constituents in Shrewsbury resent selling their homes at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/8">Many people have worked hard and saved up in order to pass an inheritance on to their children. They come from an era after the war when many worked extremely hard and made huge sacrifices in order to make investments and buy homes that they could then pass on to their children. I am about to become a father for the first time, but I am not thinking about passing on my wealth to my children; I want to enjoy myself while I am still alive. However, the generation before us certainly felt that it wanted to save up and pass on money to the next generation. That is not possible if people have to sell their homes to pay for care.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/9">Rural areas such as Shropshire are underfunded. I pore over all of the funding statistics for the police, children in schools and social services. In every single funding table, Shropshire is right at the bottom. I know that it is a long way away from London and that it is a rural area, but as the MP for Shrewsbury, it really concerns me when I see Shropshire at the bottom of all the funding league tables. Ultimately, when there is a lack of funding, the emphasis on looking after the elderly falls on local authorities that simply cannot sustain such levels of expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/10">I now come to my generation. We have to get people ready to deal with the situation. As a 34-year-old, I cannot totally rely on the state to look after my mother in 20 years' time if she needs care. I very much hope to be able to look after her in my own home, but not everyone can afford to look after their elderly relatives in their home as part of the family. My generation will experience this problem in 20 years' time, when our parents, who are now in their late 50s or early 60s, will be in their 80s. Taxation is going up significantly and young people are not saving as a result; they are also burdened by the high cost of buying their first home. From talking to young people in Shrewsbury, it seems that very few of them are saving at all. They are making little provision for looking after their elderly relatives. When I say this to people of my age, they look at me with a blank expression; it has not even registered that they should be taking out insurance or saving up to look after their parents in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/11">In the House, we tend to look at things as they are now, because we deal with problems that face us today, but I hope that the Government will consider the problem in relation to the future, because it is important that my generation should start to be more accountable.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/12">The Government's role is to incentivise people of my generation to make provision for their parents, who will live much longer than people do now. Some of them will live to be 90 or even 100, by which time many will have eked out their savings and downsized their homes. My parents, who have retired, are going to sell their family home and move further away from London in order to release capital to pay for their retirement. When they are older, they will have even less to look after themselves than people do now.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/13">The Government should look to partner people of my age in preparing themselves and their families for the future. I hope that the Minister can tell us what steps the Government are taking to provide tax incentives for people to make such provision. Various insurance companies are starting to do work in this field and to introduce proposals to protect people in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/14">The Government have introduced other major initiatives such as baby bonds. People might ask, &quot;Why is a Tory trying to interfere in this aspect of society? Surely you should leave market forces to deal with it,&quot; but I say no. I feel passionately and compassionately about this matter. It is our responsibility to ensure that our parents and other people are looked after, particularly in 20 or 30 years' time, and that there is some form of private insurance in place, or that the state has looked into this matter with a view to providing a solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/15">The most important point that I make today is about my constituents, many of whom have come to see me, such as Mr. Cartwright. Many of them&mdash;I am going back from my generation to the generation of today&mdash;are arguing with the Shropshire and Staffordshire strategic health authority and the ombudsman about who is responsible for paying for their relatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/16">Mr. Cartwright's mother died two years ago, but he is, unfortunately, still going through the protracted and painful process of interacting with the local health authority and the ombudsman because he is convinced that his mother should have received free care in her nursing home. She did not. Everything had to be sold; all of her assets went and she was left, on the day she died, with about &pound;250 in her account. Fortunately for her&mdash;I hate to say this&mdash;she died at the right time, because there was no money left to look after her. I would like the Minister to look into the case of Mr. Cartwright of Telford estate, Monkmoor, Shrewsbury, because he has suffered greatly.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/17">Our fellow citizens&mdash;they are more than constituents&mdash;are going through an extremely traumatic battle of ping-pong between the ombudsman and their health authority, and they are not getting satisfactory answers to their genuine concerns. I know that the Government have to deal with hundreds of thousands of cases, but one reason why I asked for this debate is because one thing that a Member of Parliament can do is focus the spotlight on constituents who have faced trauma.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-28a.230.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="230"  time="012:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060328/halltext/60328h03.htm#60328h03_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.230.0/1">I am pleased to take part in this Adjournment debate with you, Mr. Hood, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase>, whom I congratulate on securing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/2">The hon. Gentleman made several interesting points. He is right to draw attention to the shifting issues over a number of generations. When the national health service was introduced by a Labour Government&mdash;I am afraid that the Conservative party voted against its creation&mdash;the health issues faced by politicians and health professionals were different to those faced today. People died a lot younger in 1945 and the following decades than they do in the 21st century. We welcome that, but it brings challenges regarding people planning for their future and the sort of care that they want and need.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/3">The hon. Gentleman will know from his constituency work, as I do from mine, that the needs of older people vary enormously. The other week, I met a woman in her 80s who was active and fit, and lived independently in her own home, but I have also met people in their 70s who do not have her level of fitness and need a variety of care. There is no one-size-fits-all solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/4">There has also been a change in the expectations of different generations as they get older. I was a little perturbed to hear someone on the radio use the term &quot;elderly&quot; to describe people aged over 50. That was somewhat ridiculous. The issue of what people expect is important. The expectations of my grandmother&mdash;she was born in the first part of the 20th century&mdash;and of my mother, who was born at the end of world war two, in relation to their lifestyles, perceptions and needs in their 50s, 60s and 70s, are very different to what I expect for myself and my children.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/5">A good change is that people are less deferent and do not simply accept what they are offered. They now have some say in how services are provided. That is one reason why the Government have tried since 1997 to look not only at nursing care homes&mdash;that very phrase conjures up a particular picture of older people living in those facilities. They have also considered how services can be provided nearer to home by health services working with local authorities, and enabling people who choose to do so to live as independently as possible in their own homes or in family homes with others.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/6">There have been dynamic changes in the provision of supported or sheltered housing. Technology has moved on to such an extent that older people can run their own lives knowing that there is someone catering for their needs. I pay tribute to what has been done in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase> with Housing Hartlepool. I recently visited Richard court, which has a 24/7 service whereby a resident can call a number and someone will be ready to answer their call and assist them with health-related needs, repairs or concerns about intruders or people causing problems in the area. Clearly, steps are being taken to provide a variety of assistance such as supported housing and care within a home setting, and to use technology to meet people's needs as they grow older. That is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/7">An estimated one in three women in Britain, and one in five men, will eventually need some form of long-term care. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the funding of such care is an issue that will touch many people's lives at some point. We have to deal with people who are in that situation, and with people and their families who are approaching such decisions. We must also consider younger people, who might not think about this issue, and what their needs will be 30, 40 or 50 years down the road.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/8">It would be helpful at this stage to draw out some of the distinctions between nursing care and other support. Nursing care is care by a registered nurse, who provides, plans and supervises a person's health care.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/9">In 2001, we delivered on the commitment set out in the NHS plan to remove the anomaly that residents of care homes did not automatically receive free nursing care as they would in other care settings. That was an important, positive and progressive decision by the Government and it ensured that 42,000 people now get nursing care free of charge from the NHS, when they would previously have had to fund it themselves. That is a clear change. I welcome the hon. Gentleman's recognition of the positive changes since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/10">Charging for care is not new. People have always had to pay or contribute towards the cost of social care. The National Assistance Act 1948 sets out the framework within which local authorities decide what people can afford to contribute. Capital assets and income, including the former home, have always been taken into account in making that assessment. That is nothing new; it was there at the start of the NHS and has influenced policy ever since. However, no one should be forced to sell their home.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/11">Working with local authorities, the Government have recognised the opportunity and local authorities provide an interest-free loan secured against the property. That means that where the arrangements are appropriate, someone can keep their house even if they are in some form of residential care. However, as and when they die the council or the local authority has a claim against the cost of that individual's social care. That is a step forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/12">Local authorities means-test whether people have to make a contribution. They have to give a direction of choice, with a variety of providers. When someone chooses not to opt for the local authority choice, there is also provision for them to consider something that suits their needs elsewhere. If they are eligible, the local authority will pay its part of the cost with the option of the person topping up the payments if they want a choice other than those it provides. Efforts have been made to consider how we deliver that.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/13">I am pleased to say that in 2005 Shropshire county council moved from a two-star to a three-star rating for its services for children and adults. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that it is working to improve its services.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/14">The other support available includes personal care&mdash;help to carry out personal activities such as bathing, dressing and undressing, eating and using the lavatory&mdash;and continuing health care for people who require the highest degree of support, where the NHS pays the entire cost of care, as it would if their care was being provided in an NHS hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/15">The past two decades have witnessed significant changes. In many respects, there used to be no choice. Care was provided in a long-stay hospital ward or not at all. Now, increasingly, people get intensive support that enables them to live independently in their own home. I think we would all agree that many people would like to have that choice, if it is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/16">The shift away from the acute sector has in many respects been positive, not least because it has enabled care to be delivered more appropriately and effectively. It is interesting how different practices are used in different parts of the country. Care has been delivered in a more homely environment, allowing people to maintain their independence.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/17">As I said before, people have always had to pay for or contribute towards the cost of social care. Removing means-testing for care services would have profound and long-lasting implications. Personal care alone would cost an additional &pound;1.5 billion a year, rising to an estimated &pound;3 billion a year by 2020. Board and lodging would cost many more billions a year. There is a balance to be struck between providing nursing care free, as it would be in an NHS setting, and coming to an arrangement to pay for the personal care towards which someone in a different setting has to contribute. We have tried to consider systems that deal with that as smoothly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/18">Provision of free personal care could divert resources from services that benefit all older and disabled people. The announcements made in the past year and in the Budget of free transport for older people, for example, have a cost, as does the winter fuel allowance. We have to come up with a package in which the Government play their role and take their responsibilities, but within that there is a challenge for individuals and their families to look at their own lives and plan for their futures.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/19">I cannot answer all the hon. Gentleman's questions about tax incentives, but I shall be happy to pass them on to the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne)</phrase>, who is the Minister responsible. I hope that he will be able to write back to the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/20">Eligibility for NHS-funded continuing care has in recent years been the subject of much debate. NHS continuing care eligibility criteria were designed to identify those who have a primary need for ongoing health care, as distinct from help with the daily activities of personal care. That has proved to be problematic, not least for individuals and their families&mdash;I think Mr. Cartwright probably falls into this category&mdash;who could not understand why similar types of care were sometimes free and sometimes means- tested.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/21">We are aware of the difficulties around the interpretation and application of the criteria and concerns about whether they have been too restrictive in practice. Individual court judgments of which the hon. Gentleman might be aware have provided some clarification of the responsibilities of the NHS and social services for long-term care, including the Coughlan judgment in 1999 and the recent Grogan judgment. We acknowledge that mistaken decisions about individuals' eligibility have been made in the past and we have asked strategic health authorities to review their eligibility criteria again following the Grogan case and to ensure that their eligibility and decision-making processes are lawful in the light of that judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/22">We have already announced plans to develop a national framework for NHS continuing health care to achieve greater clarity, transparency and consistency in making decisions. I will ensure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is aware of the comments raised in relation to Mr. Cartwright's case. I cannot say that he will be able to intervene, but I will ask him to consider the case. It is clear from what the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham said that Mr. Cartwright is pursuing his case through the channels that the Government have set up.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/23">We plan to consult publicly on the national framework soon. It will sit alongside a broader range of measures to improve the quality of care and provide a fairer system. We take the care of our older people seriously and, as the hon. Gentleman will know, this Government published the national service framework for older people in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/24">One of the central pillars of the framework is the single assessment process, which is meant to ensure that the needs, wishes and perceptions of older people are placed at the heart of the assessment process and that the subsequent planning and delivery of services are informed by that. Linked to the assessment process is the fair access to care services guidance, which was issued to councils in May 2002 and implemented in April 2003. It provides councils with an eligibility framework for adult social care to use when setting and applying their eligibility criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/25">Extra care housing offers independence and choice to individuals to own or rent self-contained flats yet also have access to 24-hour support of the type that is provided in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool, as well as other services such as meals, domestic help, and onsite leisure and recreational facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/26">We have also introduced &pound;185 million each year for the carers grant, which provides local authorities with the means to provide respite breaks and services for carers in England. We have introduced a performance indicator, which ensures that councils recognise that support for carers continues to be a priority for the Government. We need to build on that to improve health and well-being so that more people can remain independent in their homes, where appropriate. At the same time, we have to ensure that where that is not possible people in residential care settings are treated with dignity and respect. Not only the individuals but their families should feel fully supported by the care plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/27">Such developments are leading to a more flexible pattern of provision of care, which can better respond to the needs and wishes of patients and their families. A record number of people are being supported to live independently and are being offered a choice of care and support when they leave hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/28">The steps that we are taking are improving the situation. We must continue to provide wider choices. This is not a debate that starts and finishes with a general election&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.235.1/1">It is a great pleasure to have secured this debate on my twin passions of manufacturing industry and renewable energy. It is a particular pleasure to have secured a debate under you, Mr. Hood, and to have the opportunity to speak to my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy on this important issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/2">This has been an auspicious seven days for microgeneration. The Chancellor's announcement in last week's Budget of an additional &pound;50 million in investment for microgeneration has been widely welcomed, even by Greenpeace, which said:</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The measures on energy efficiency and microgeneration are very positive and will help bring forward low-carbon buildings and a decentralised energy system.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/4">That is high praise indeed from an organisation that has been one of the Government's most vociferous critics, and I am pleased that the Government have taken such positive steps.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/5">At the outset, I should declare that I have a substantial constituency interest in microgeneration. Sharp, in my constituency, is one of the few United Kingdom plants manufacturing photovoltaic solar cells. It had been in Wrexham for about 20 years before it began manufacturing cells there in July 2004. Since its decision to invest in Wrexham and to show confidence in the work force there, it has been rewarded by the work force with a tripling of photovoltaic solar cell production at the factory. The site has therefore expanded and there has been real development in the renewable energy sector in north Wales. Indeed, north Wales is developing a reputation as something of a renewable energy hub. We have the North Hoyle offshore wind farm, and the planning stage has begun for Gwynt-y-Mor wind farm, which will produce energy on a much larger scale. I enthusiastically support that project.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/6">In north-east Wales, we also have a strong tradition in manufacturing industry. That is very important in my constituency, where a quarter of the work force is employed in manufacturing. There are also historic energy links because the north-east Wales coalfield produced energy for many years and was part of the powerhouse that the UK economy was in the past. I want that energy production to continue in the new century, with microgeneration and manufacturing developing together to create new jobs and new potential in the north-east Wales economy. In the renewable energy industry, we have a huge opportunity to develop the UK's manufacturing base and we must seize it.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/7">I am presently engaged in discussions with Wrexham county borough council and the Welsh Assembly to develop the use of renewable energies in Wrexham. We must use the fact that the town now has a reputation for producing manufacturing goods in microgeneration to ensure that the development that is taking place in the town uses renewable energy as far as possible. In that way, the town will become a showcase for the potential of renewables and demonstrate how the difficulties of global warming can be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/8">As I mentioned, production of photovoltaic solar cells in Wrexham has tripled in less than two years, and there is huge and increasing demand for them, but they are largely being exported. As the Minister is aware, the biggest market for them in Europe is in Germany. For some years, the German Government have pursued an active strategy of promoting solar energy, and their successful 100,000 roofs programme is recognised to have caught the German public's imagination, encouraging individual householders to take steps to produce their own energy, rather than see it as something that is always produced far away by a large power station.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/9">What is perhaps less well known is that the solar industry in Germany has been successful in promoting employment. Against the backcloth of the difficult employment situation in Germany over the past five years, photovoltaics have been a manufacturing success story. According to the Bundesverband Solarindustrie, 30,000 people are now employed in Germany in the production, distribution and installation of solar systems, with 20,000 employed in photovoltaic technology and 10,000 employed in solar heat technology. In the past year alone, 5,000 new jobs have been created in the booming photovoltaic sector, and it is predicted that as many people will shortly be employed in solar energy as in heavy coal mining. Over the past five years, turnover in the German solar power sector has increased by an average of 43 per cent. per annum and turnover for 2005 is predicted to be &euro;2.7 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/10">Solar energy and microgeneration are therefore big business, and I am pleased to say that the United Kingdom is benefiting from the development of photovoltaics not only in Germany, but in other European economies, such as Spain and the Netherlands. The factory in Wrexham, for example, is exporting to those countries on a huge and increasing scale as their domestic markets develop. However, those who work in the UK microgeneration industry have been frustrated by the fact that development in our domestic market has been rather slow in comparison, and that is where the Chancellor's announcement last week can be so important. The energy White Paper set out the goals for energy policy, including renewables, but there has been confusion over the successor to the clear skies programme in the past two years. The announcement of the low-carbon buildings programme, coupled with the Chancellor's commitment to provide an additional &pound;50 million in investment, is a real opportunity to get the development of microgeneration back on track.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/11">I make a plea that the central focus of the strategy to take microgeneration forward should be not simply on the UK domestic market, but on the individual domestic consumer. Indeed, I sense that we are on the cusp of a large increase in demand for individuals to make their own contribution to the fight against global warming. In that respect, I must pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1722" name="Colin Challen">the excellent work of my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell (Colin Challen)</phrase>, who has done so much to take forward the concept of individuals taking responsibility for their own carbon footprint. In my constituency, Sharp recognises that more work needs to be done on education and has committed itself to developing an education centre on the Wrexham site. It is encouraging local schools and local industry to visit the plant and become much more aware of the potential of photovoltaics and of the way in which the industry can develop to provide a renewable base in the fight against global warming.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/12">However, the Government must play a central role. In designing the new low-carbon buildings programme, they must commit to a real expansion of stream 1 funding to help make microgeneration accessible to the domestic consumer. The present proposed funding is &pound;3.5 million, falling to &pound;2 million in year two of the project and &pound;1 in year three. However, public demand is much greater and was about &pound;4.5 million last year so, even at the present stage, public demand exceeds the fund's capacity to deliver. Given the Chancellor's announcement this week, it is important that we increase stream 1 funding to at least the level that is required to meet current demand. Indeed, I hope that we can increase it above that level so that future demand can also be met.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/13">I also make a plea for simplifying the process of securing the benefit of grants for consumers. I confess that I speak as someone who downloaded the application forms for the clear skies programme around 18 months ago. Confronted with those long forms, which have sat on the corner of my desk since, I never got past the first page, which asked for the square metreage of my roof. I did not undertake to investigate that&mdash;I thought of sending my son up to check, but thought that somewhat reminiscent of chimney-sweeps in the 19th century. The forms are seriously intimidating to someone who is keen to invest in microgeneration. A straightforward system for individuals would be much more effective, so that they could ensure that they had easy access to microgeneration.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/14">The cause is very noble. We are all committed to addressing the problems of global warming. We have heard the news on climate change in the past three days, which is of some concern. We need to establish that individuals have a responsibility to make a contribution. The Government need to put in place a system that will facilitate that. In addition, we can develop our own manufacturing sector in the industry. There is a real demand across Europe for microgeneration, which a company based in Britain is now meeting, although that demand is less within the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/15">Given the investment that the Government have put in place, we have an opportunity to create domestic demand in the UK. We have can demonstration projects but, even more importantly, individuals need to decide to join the fight against global warming. If they do so and if we create a strong domestic market, that will mean more employment in the UK in both microgeneration and manufacturing. I suggest that we should work firmly towards that worthy goal over the next few months. I hope that the Minister will be able to give me that commitment.</p>

	Deaf-blind People (Technology Access)
</major-heading>
<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-28a.241.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-28b.241.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-28a.241.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1617" speakername="Phil Willis" colnum="241"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060328/halltext/60328h05.htm#60328h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.241.1/1">It is difficult for those of us who enjoy the gifts of sight and hearing to imagine life without either, and impossible to imagine how we would cope. Today's short debate is about confronting the issues surrounding deaf-blindness and what society, the Government and Parliament can do to support deaf-blind people.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/2">I pay tribute to Sense, the charity that supports deaf-blind people, and its 2005 report &quot;Make Technology Work&quot;, which brought this key issue to the attention of the public and Parliament. I also recognise the contribution of many private sector companies in supporting deaf-blind people with technology. British Telecom has a long-standing tradition of providing assistance and assistive products to people with sensory impairments. I should also mention Ofcom; following the introduction of the Communications Act 2003, it did a great deal of work to encourage accessible electronic communications equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/3">Thankfully, relatively few people are deaf and blind; 23,000 people&mdash;fewer than 25 per constituency&mdash;are registered for both disabilities in the UK. That figure is small compared with the 378,000 registered as blind or partially sighted and the 8.9 million registered as deaf or hard of hearing.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/4">Of course, very few people are completely deaf and blind; most have some residual sight or hearing. Some people are born deaf-blind as a result of maternal rubella, although thanks to vaccination that is very rare. Some genetic conditions such as Usher syndrome lead to deaf-blindness from late adolescence and people can become deaf-blind at any time through meningitis or accident. However, increasingly, age-related conditions result in sight and hearing loss, and those who already have a sight or hearing problem are particularly susceptible to dual loss later in life. It is therefore important that in responding, the Minister recognises the importance of supporting measures that can assist a wide spectrum of people with hearing and sight difficulties, and not simply the 23,000 registered as deaf-blind.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/5">Remarkable breakthroughs in medical science have helped prevent deaf-blindness, and they will continue. Last week, the Chancellor announced that the Medical Research Council and the NHS research initiative will combine. That will make huge inroads into some of that work. However, today's generations of sufferers look to technology for support.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/6">All of us&mdash;certainly those in this Chamber&mdash;use technology every day. For deaf-blind people, access to technology can be a matter of life and death. Research by Sense has showed that most deaf-blind people use assistive equipment, although sadly, about half of those surveyed have difficulties using the very technology that is there to help them. Many such problems are caused by manufacturers' lack of understanding of the needs of people with sensory impairments, and some of the difficulties could have been avoided if such needs had been considered carefully at the design stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/7">Deaf-blindness is a low-incidence disability, meaning that there is low demand for some types of assistive equipment. That causes two problems: there is limited incentive for manufacturers to make such equipment, and it can be expensive to produce. Some of the equipment that deaf-blind people rely on, such as Braille clocks, vibrating light probes and sound monitors, is no longer available. That means that users who have got used to that technology often cannot get their equipment repaired or replace it if it stops working.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/8">Low demand means that the market alone will never deliver accessible technology to this vulnerable group; intervention is needed. However, the legal situation is complicated. For instance, manufactured goods are excluded from the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 because they are regulated in Europe and not in the UK. It is ironic that someone with a sensory impairment can sue a retailer under the 2005 Act for refusing to serve them in a shop, but has no redress if none of the equipment on sale in the shop is accessible to them. That cannot be right.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/9">Even when equipment is accessible to deaf-blind people, manufacturers are not obliged to produce instructions in accessible formats. Even the simplest equipment can cause huge difficulties for deaf-blind people. Hearing aids are vital for most such people; however, having a visual impairment makes hearing aids more difficult to use. Changing the battery in a hearing aid can be problematic for a person with low vision, because the battery and its chamber are so small; if the battery rolls away, it can be almost impossible to find. The hearing aid itself can be dropped, and for a person with hearing loss and poor vision, dropping a hearing aid on a patterned carpet can ruin a whole day. They would not be able to see the aid, nor hear where it fell. How on earth would they find it?</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/10">Television is a vital source of information and entertainment for most deaf-blind people and subtitling and audio descriptions are making an increasing proportion of programmes accessible. However, remote controls with rows and rows of small buttons with tiny writing can be difficult to operate. I confess that I&mdash;let alone somebody with sight and hearing problems&mdash;find them difficult to use. The on-screen menus used to operate some set-top boxes, video recorders and DVD players are inaccessible to many deaf-blind people. The colour scheme and fonts used can make them difficult to read, and there is no sound output.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/11">Technology is of greatest use to deaf-blind people if it helps them to be independent when they are out and about. Take the case of Jim Hines, who is totally blind and has severe hearing loss. Last year, he had been away from London for a few days and was returning on the evening of <phrase class="date" code="">Thursday 7 July</phrase>; he knew nothing about the bombings. On arrival in London, he discovered that there were no tubes, buses or taxis at the station. Jim said:</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/12" class="indent">&quot;I didn't know what to do. Because I don't have a mobile phone, I couldn't call for a taxi or for a friend to pick me up. I ended up standing on the pavement outside the station all night, wondering what was going on. It was one of the most confusing and frightening situations I've ever been in.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/13">Jim finally got the tube home on Friday morning. Only after arriving home did he learn what had happened. His friends and family had been trying to contact him. They had rung the casualty bureau, but he was not listed; one can imagine what they thought. Had Jim had a Braille mobile phone with SMS, he could have saved himself and his family huge anxiety, but such phones cost &pound;3,000 and such technology is out of the reach of most deaf-blind people.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/14">What can the Government do? First, let me acknowledge that the Government are doing some innovative work. I particularly compliment them for the initiative to provide tactile internet access for deaf-blind people and the &pound;500,000 research programme that was led by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency. Ability to use the internet can bring significant benefits for people with sensory impairments, and the translation of palm signing into internet communication through an interactive mouse may well revolutionise communication for deaf-blind people.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/15">It would be interesting to hear from the Minister what other areas of research are planned by his Department. I acknowledge that it would be difficult for the Government to intervene in the commercial technology marketplace, but they have the chance to intervene through public procurement. That would have the twin effect of setting high standards for quality and accessibility and bringing costs down. For example, 700,000 people have now received digital hearing aids through the NHS, at a cost to the public purse of &pound;65 to &pound;75 per aid. Before the aids were available through the health service, people were paying up to &pound;2,000 per aid privately. However, the excellent procurement arrangements organised by the Government need to be supported by reducing the unacceptable waiting times experienced in many areas of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/16">Perhaps the Minister will make a commitment today to include audiology, from GP referrals to the fitting of digital hearing devices, in the 18-week target for PCTs. If it is not included, we may well see that crucial service slip down the priority list as other funding pressures emerge. Perhaps he will go a step further, by reassuring the audiology service that recurring funding for service and replacement will be built into baseline budgets this year. Some &pound;38 million was expected to go into routine audiology, but as yet there has been no commitment by the Department of Health.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/17">The success of the Government's public procurement of digital hearing aids will hopefully give them confidence to seize other important opportunities on behalf of deaf-blind people. The mass distribution of set-top boxes to older and disabled people for the purposes of digital switchover is such an opportunity; it is a key one. That must not be a project just for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport but one in which the Department of Health plays a crucial role at the design stage. Digital broadcasting will open up huge opportunities for deaf-blind people, but if accessible technology is not built into the set-top boxes they will be lost. Will the Minister say what steps his Department is taking to influence the design of set-top boxes for the digital switchover?</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/18">Another opportunity for the Government to help stimulate demand for accessible technology is the new public sector duty to promote disability equality. Public sector bodies that are procuring equipment should undertake a disability equality impact assessment. Will the Minister tell us how the Government are monitoring that new public sector duty and what steps he intends to take to ensure that deaf-blind people receive appropriate assessment for, and advice about, technological aids by appropriately trained staff? That should be happening under his Department's guidance, but clearly it is not. The Sense survey found that 30 different types of professionals carried out assessments, ranging from therapists to social services staff. A simple step would be for the Minister to issue guidance on what qualifications assessors should have.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/19">Sadly, the Government do not have direct responsibility for the regulation of manufactured goods and the issue of accessible technology; it is the responsibility of our friends in the European Parliament. However, I hope that the Government will make clear their representations in that key area. After all, a misunderstanding of the controls on a cooker can have disastrous effects for any of us, but for a deaf-blind person the problem is acute. Relatively simple universal tactile instructions on appliances such as cookers, ovens, washing machines and mobile phones would solve a great many of the problems, as would a legal requirement to make instruction booklets available in a format that could be used by deaf-blind people.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/20">Despite the concerns of many deaf-blind people about the suitability of existing technology, many responded to the Sense survey in a positive way; whether we are talking about the use of Mobile Magnifier for mobile phones, the cordless telephone or the easier to read flat-screen TV, it is clear that where manufacturers design products with the deaf-blind in mind there is a great deal of satisfaction. Those products can be used by a wide range of other people. There was even praise for some manufacturers. Zanussi offers a simple Braille replacement for the front of its washing machines. It is a simple piece of technology that enables the machines to be used by a wide range of people.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/21">Technology is improving all the time, but the fast pace of change also means that some deaf-blind people fear being left behind. The trend is for smaller pieces of equipment with more functions, and for more and smaller controls. Deaf-blind people are worried that the assistive equipment they own will quickly become out of date and that they will be unable to afford the high price of new equipment. Technology is vital for deaf-blind people, as it is for many of us. Our role as parliamentarians is to ensure that we work with the Government to ensure that their voice is heard.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-28a.244.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" speakername="Liam Byrne" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="244"  time="013:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060328/halltext/60328h05.htm#60328h05_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.244.0/1">It is pleasure to serve under your chairmanship again, Mr. Hood; I did so previously on the European Scrutiny Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1617" name="Phil Willis">the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I know that he has taken a keen interest in the subject of inclusive education for children. His commitment to ensuring that children with disabilities&mdash;particularly those with severe learning disabilities&mdash;have the chance to enjoy mainstream education is well known and much appreciate by Labour Members. I join him in paying tribute to Sense, which during my short time in Government has provided tremendous support and advice to me. I have much appreciated that.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/3">Before I address the specific issue of this debate, I shall make a few opening remarks about the changing nature of this country's population. Tremendous advances have been made in the health service over the past six or seven years, which is not an accident; such advances have occurred because we have doubled the amount of money that has gone into it. As a result of the extra 100,000 staff who have been hired and the falling waiting lists, life expectancy has increased and infant mortality rates have decreased. This year, England has the lowest infant mortality rate in its history. Those medical advances and the advances in care and the national health service mean that more children will survive for longer, including many with severe learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/4">Although the hon. Gentleman is right to say that advances in medical science mean that conditions such as deaf-blindness may in future be on the decrease, the number of children with complex disabilities surviving into adulthood may increase. The health and the care systems need to change to take account of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/5">There are great opportunities to use technology to ensure that those individuals are able to live life to the full in future. I think that it was Albert Einstein who, at the beginning of the cold war, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/6" class="indent">&quot;It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/7">Over the next few years we have the chance to reverse that aphorism, because technology will enable many people to fulfil the full potential of their humanity. For that to happen, it is vital that public services are reformed so that public servants who are responsible for delivering them have the freedom and flexibility to combine together in new ways to improve them.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/8">The hon. Gentleman will know that our new White Paper confirms the vision set out in the social care Green Paper &quot;Independence Well-being and Choice: Our Vision for the Future of Social Care for Adults in England&quot; and sets out practical steps to turn that vision into reality. We talked about the need to bring far more personalised services together by improving assessment, for example by introducing individual budgets that bring five or six different income streams from across Government together in one care account for the individual to spend as they see fit. Supporting healthier, independent lives through a proper risk-management framework will be important, as will a much stronger emphasis on preventive services in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/9">Key to all of this is ensuring that the national health service, social care and other local government services, in particular housing, are orchestrated together in a completely new way. That better integration involves thinking holistically about the needs of the individual, rather than simply questioning their eligibility and finding ways to deny them service This agenda is about empowerment. That personalisation is about listening to individuals, recognising their ability to determine what they need and then delivering the sorts of services that are necessary to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/10">I want to highlight the things that we hope to sweep away, one of which was highlighted by the Commission for Social Care Inspection report &quot;Real Voices, Real Choices&quot; that was published this week. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/11" class="indent">&quot;The NHS Audiology department tends to provide information about physical and health related matters, rather than social and emotional aspects of deafness. It should be able to recognise and help with all aspects.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/12">That is exactly the sort of problem that we want to address by bringing the health service and the social care system far closer together.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/13">This is not a trivial ambition; it is about something important. In the past seven years we have delivered the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth ever known in this country. More people are in work than ever before and we have created a couple of million new businesses. This society is far richer in opportunity, but the challenge is now for us to ensure that everybody in the country has the chance to flourish to the full, irrespective of their background or ethnicity, where they live or what circumstances they have encountered in life.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/14">We know that disabled people are less likely to be in full-time education or in work. They are more likely to feel a lack of confidence and a lack of support. The reasons behind that are not straightforward, nor are they always related to somebody's health impairment or health condition. Attitudes in society play a significant part. How we structure our services for disabled young people is crucial. That is why the extension of the disability discrimination legislation, the establishment of the Disability Rights Commission and changing the ways in which Jobcentre Plus and Connexions work are very important. Those are ambitions that were encapsulated in our 20-year strategy set out in the &quot;Improving the life chances of disabled people&quot; report. Its aim is very simple but also very powerful: to ensure that disabled people will be given the maximum opportunity to fulfil their potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/15">I shall talk about some of the necessary practical steps, and respond to some of the important points raised by the hon. Gentleman. First, we know that working together at both central Government level and local level is essential. That is why we set up the Office for Disability Issues, to act as a bridge between Departments at the centre by creating the mechanisms to ensure that they work together more effectively. That is not just to do with health and social care issues; it is also to do with matters handled by other Departments, such as trade and industry. The work of the Department of Trade and Industry has an important bearing on this agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/16">Examples of how that joint working manifests itself are already coming through. We are supporting services at the local level&mdash;for example, by working with a wide range of groups to develop revised eye care pathways. In addition to the certificate of vision impairment, we have developed two new documents for use in hospitals and on the high street to facilitate easier access to support services prior to certification. Why is that important? One reason is that it will help social services identify people who need support in a timelier manner, before they lose independence and confidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/17">Another key way to deliver change is through changing the work force. That is why I am glad to be able to say that the Department of Health is working with the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association&mdash;in collaboration with other employers&mdash;on a project to redesign hybrid rehabilitation functions in work with visually impaired people. Also, Skills for Care and the Children's Workforce Development Council are managing pilots to look at work force reform. It is important to ensue that there are new kinds of worker with different sorts of skills because, as the hon. Gentleman highlighted, the problem of assessment is sometimes difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/18">We are backing these ambitions with significant sums of new investment. If we combine the amount of money that is going into the health service over the next two years with the extra resources going into local authorities, the total sum is somewhere north of &pound;20 billion. That represents a significant step up in available resources, and I am proud to be able to say that it includes &pound;80 million for the preventative technologies grant, which comes on stream in a few days; local authorities will have the flexibility to invest in a range of services. We have looked into procurement arrangements as part of the planning for the spending of that grant, and I will ask Department officials to examine how issues around deaf-blindness have been considered in the development of guidance for the spending of the money, because that could provide an important opportunity over the next one to two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/19">There is strong international evidence that we can improve the quality of care through technology. The hon. Gentleman asked about that. The new and emerging applications of the technology programme cover all areas of health and social care; there is a budget of about &pound;1.2 million to develop new and innovative uses of technology. In addition, the annual budget for the health care technology development programme is &pound;2 million. The remit of that programme covers novel information technology that looks into how there might be significant improvements in the performance of health care technologies. Recently funded projects include many of direct relevance to disabled people, such as speech-driven environmental control systems, stair-climbing and walking aids, which are very practical applications. For a number of years, the policy research programme has provided a horizon-scanning role in relation to developments in information and communication technologies. All of these things are important, but unless they are translated into front-line practice, they will be of little benefit to the 20 to 25 people in each of our constituencies who might be deaf-blind.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/20">We have said that we expect the directors of adult social services in every part of the country to work in partnership with a range of agencies, including children's services, and health, housing and transport organisations, in order to examine what are the strategic needs of every community. We will provide guidance on how that exercise should be best performed. We expect directors of adult social services to work hand in glove with directors of public health to make sure that there is a shared understanding of the needs of different groups in every community. I said to the House a week or two ago that, given the number of people with sensory impairments in this country, we would expect such strategic needs assessments to take good account of those needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/21">One of the reasons why that is important is that we will expect local authorities to ensure that adequate arrangements are in place for people with sensory impairments or other disabilities to be able to access services in the first place. Often, those barriers to access are among the most difficult hurdles for people with disabilities to leap. To ensure that there is this emphasis on service access, the Department of Health is working closely with the Disability Rights Commission. We have jointly produced leaflets&mdash;such as &quot;You can make a difference: improving hospital services for disabled people&quot;&mdash;for front-line staff in both primary and secondary care. They are important because they explain, and give practical examples of, the ways in which front-line staff can meet the access requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. We are also ensuring that all health and social care staff are aware of the needs of disabled people. The Department of Health and the DRC are producing a comprehensive education and learning programme, which will be available later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/22">My final point is that, as we set about undertaking this process of public service reform over the coming years, it is important that change is not just drawn up and designed in Whitehall&mdash;or even in the House. Instead, we should listen to the voices of people who need the services as we think about how they should be configured. The CSCI is doing that by involving people who use such services in its inspection process. Its report &quot;Real Voices, Real Choices&quot;, which I referred to earlier, considers the qualities people expect from care services and how that feeds into the inspection processes. It spoke to people who use services, and, importantly, it also spoke to their carers&mdash;there are 6 million carers in this country&mdash;and those who represent them. What it found was something that we all probably know in our heart of hearts, because it is simple: people want choice and flexibility in respect of services, as well as creative problem-solving, and they also want information that is available at the right time. In other words, they want to be treated with respect by a system that is fair, and which has the capacity to treat them as grown-ups and to let them, where appropriate, take risks.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/23">We emphasised all those messages in the Green Paper on adult social care and in the White Paper. They reflect what people tell us time and again, and we must now translate that into action, in order to make a genuine difference to people's lives.</p>
