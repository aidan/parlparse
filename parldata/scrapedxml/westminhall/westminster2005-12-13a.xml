<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-13a.363.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" speakername="Austin Mitchell" colnum="363"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051213/halltext/51213h01.htm#51213h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.363.3/1">I am grateful to have the opportunity to talk about the future of the probation service. I am not only a strong supporter but a big admirer of it for the difficult work that it does. It has a key role in what the Government describe as the fight against crime, and in building a better society, by working to redeem offenders, to support them so that they do not slip back into the habit offending, and working to sustain former prisoners and offenders as they adjust to society. It is only that adjustment that will stop them reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.3/2">The probation service is overstretched, and in my view the staff are underpaid. There are probably 200,000 offenders, a total that is increasing, but the service is ever more successful and effective in dealing with that number. Indeed, over the last few years it has coped with the many new duties that have been thrust upon them&mdash;custody plus for instance, introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2003&mdash;all of which has produced what the Home Office estimates will be a 70,000 increase in its case load.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.3/3">Last year, the probation service supervised 12,600 high-risk offenders. Only 79 of them&mdash;0.6 per cent.&mdash;had reoffended by the end of that supervision. Its breach targets have been achieved in 92 per cent. of cases, and eight out of 10 supervisory periods have been sustained for six months or more. In other words, it is doing a very good job. It was helped by the reorganisation of 2001, which created a national service. That good reform is working well, and I ask the Minister to tell us why it is now being scrapped. What evaluation has been done of that successful reform? The probation service has adjusted to it, and is working successfully, yet it now has to face another change.</p>

	<p pid="a.363.5/1">I wish I knew. I am no expert in that form of psychology, but my hon. Friend makes a telling point. Nor am I am expert on the reasons for this process of restless change. As soon as something settles in, it is changed without evaluation. That is why I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to tell us what evaluation has been done. Just how bad is the service? He must tell us when winding up. We need to know before we can comment on the new framework. Will it improve matters or not?</p>
	<p pid="a.363.5/2">It is a process of restless change. Unfortunately, it is not untypical of the Government. We have the blue skies thinker, Lord Birt, in the stratosphere; and we have the grey walls thinker, Lord Carter, who is incarcerated behind the grey walls of the House of Lords. They come up with bright new schemes for changing everything.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.5/3">We face another bout of change, but it is necessary? It will effectively abolish the national probation service. Indeed, there are indications that the national probation directorate is already being run down. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will deal with that. It will be changed under the proposals set out in the consultation paper &quot;Restructuring Probation to Reduce Re-offending&quot;; I have at least touched it, if not read it in detail. It is another product of the restless process of change. That, too, is typical of the process. Again, none of the views on which the paper is based has been thought through or researched. They are assertions, not demonstrable proof of an ability to remedy failings in the existing system. &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot; is a maxim I believe in politics. I think that the Labour party is a more conservative party and that should be our maxim. Why, then, is there this restless change?</p>
	<p pid="a.363.5/4">The paper argues that contestability is better than local co-operation based on the existing structure; co-operation with the police, the magistrates and the community. On the argument that contestability is vital, a unified service will be replaced by fragmentation into business units, and local co-operation will be replaced by contestability. Contestability must mean value for money and the introduction of the profit motive into this judicial service.</p>

	<p pid="a.364.1/1">I am grateful for my hon. Friend's intervention, as I too received a letter from Richard Heller, which sets out his views and the experience of his wife, who was in the probation service and who sadly died a few weeks ago. It was a powerful and moving letter, which sums up this case. The ethos must be co-operation and service to the offender, not the profit motive and value for money. Value to society is the ethos, not for value for money; the two are not the same. Yet on the basis of that untested, unproven assertion, the 42 local area boards will be abolished. Quite apart from the fact that they will shortly abolish themselves as areas, because of the reorganisation of the police service, which will be completed, one hopes, in two years&mdash;another restless change process&mdash;new areas will be required for those that presently work for probation.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.1/2">The area boards will be abolished and replaced by regional business managers, who will invite bids to provide the service from new bodies and contributors; outside organisations. They could be anything; prison companies, charities or cattle prod manufacturers, which also produce tagging devices. The very slogan, &quot;Correction companies&quot; brings to mind sadomasochism of all kinds. One does not know what the organisations will be. Yet, untried organisations will be brought in to replace what is now an effective, well functioning service. They will all be able to bid for contracts to run the service for profit, in local units.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.1/3">What is wrong with that can be fairly readily summed up; it is an attempt to create an artificial market in probation services, which should not be a market at all. This is a judicial function, a service for the courts and offenders, not a means of profit. What is wrong with the proposal? Probation is part of the judicial system. It is an agency of justice, not an agency of commerce. To make it an agency of commerce must undermine trust and undermine its integrity. Judge Judge&mdash;&quot;Here come da judge, judge&quot;&mdash;has pointed out the unsuitability of bringing commerce into this function. It will not only undermine trust but will produce obvious conflicts of interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.1/4">One pictures the scene. A probation officer appears in court to make his recommendations. He recommends that the offender be committed to lag's hall, which is run by his group, group 69, to provide correctional services, and he offers the court a DVD presentation of its charms and attractions. It will be exciting stuff; visual displays of the sort of place to which the offender will be sent.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.1/5">Perhaps the probation officer could recommend tagging; his company McTag-it, which is based in Scotland and can produce red tags that are approved by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, can be worn with any clothing, and will keep the offender under effective supervision.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.1/6">Perhaps, on the other hand, the probation officer could recommend community service and say that, just by coincidence, his company, Charitable Drains R Us, provides useful work digging drains for churches, public toilets and other places in which offenders can usefully be employed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-13a.373.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" speakername="Neil Gerrard" colnum="373"  time="010:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051213/halltext/51213h01.htm#51213h01_spnew20">
	<p pid="a.373.1/1">That is a common pattern. Public sector services are being privatised and when things go wrong, it is almost always in the end the public sector that ends up picking up the tab and dealing with the problem. I shall say a word or two about the latest consultation paper&mdash;the paper that was issued recently, entitled &quot;Restructuring Probation to Reduce Reoffending.&quot; The use of that title makes the assertion and assumption that restructuring probation is necessary to reduce reoffending. A number of issues arise from that consultation paper. I am sure that other hon. Members will have seen the response to the consultation made by the Probation Boards Association, the national body that represents the local probation boards, which are currently the employers of probation staff. Incidentally, that raises another issue: if we go down the road of contestability, who will be the employers of the current probation staff?</p>
	<p pid="a.373.1/2">The probation boards welcomed quite a bit of what the Government said earlier: they welcomed the idea of putting the prevention of reoffending at the centre of what they do and the idea of packages of support and intervention for every offender. No one has issues with such aims and objectives. However, they point out that although the consultation paper has been issued, the Cabinet Office code of practice is not being followed. That is acknowledged in the introduction to the consultation paper&mdash;the argument made for not following the code is that the 12-week consultation period is not needed because</p>
	<p pid="a.373.1/3" class="indent">&quot;we have conducted previous consultation exercises on the National Offender Management Service and are now hoping to introduce the legislation needed to give effect to these proposals as soon as possible.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.373.1/4">However, as the Probation Boards Association points out, a significant change is being proposed, and the document returns to some issues that we thought had gone away.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.1/5">It was only in July last year that the then Minister for Prisons and Probation concluded that we should keep the existing probation boards, at least for the foreseeable future. We all thought at the time that that meant that the probation boards would stay for some time but, a year and a bit later, we are back again discussing the suggestion that the 42 probation boards will be abolished. As we have all been saying in this debate, the overriding test that should be applied is: how will these changes have a positive impact on the degree of reoffending and why, and what is the evidence that they will do so?</p>
	<p pid="a.373.1/6">If we dismantle the probation boards as suggested, that will remove the local links that exist&mdash;it will disengage local communities, the local judiciary and police forces from those links. In the present structure there is coterminosity of services and, particularly since the restructuring of some police services is under discussion, one would have thought that this matter might be better left alone until some of those decisions have been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.1/7">It seems to me that the proposals threaten an end to publicly provided probation services in the form in which we have known them. I think that if the Government introduce legislation to abolish the probation boards and to restructure the probation services, they will find that many more hon. Members will be interested and concerned about that issue than are present this morning. That is what happened the last time that this issue was raised at a national level.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.1/8">I hope that before we go too far down this road we will stop and think again and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington said, listen to what the professionals&mdash;the people who work in the service, who deliver the service on the ground and who run the service through the probation boards&mdash;are actually saying, because none of those people support the proposals. I urge Ministers to think again about the route that they are taking.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-13a.374.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" speakername="John Grogan" colnum="374"  time="010:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051213/halltext/51213h01.htm#51213h01_spnew21">
	<p pid="a.374.0/1">I am delighted to be able to make a brief contribution. I am moved to do so by two things: by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">the tour de force of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase>, and by the fact that I have always had a high regard for the Minister, about whose educational background I know more, thanks to my hon. Friend, than I did at the start of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.0/2">The Home Office has form on this issue: the Government have suggested in recent times that forensic science and young offenders' institutions should be opened up to market contestability. But it stepped back slightly on those fields of endeavour, and I hope they will do so in respect of the probation service.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.0/3">I repeat the question that I asked my hon. Friend the Minister last week at Home Office questions, which she may remember: do the Government think that any part of the management and apprehension of offenders has such a strong public service element that it should not be open to contestability and marketisation? I paraphrase my hon. Friend's reply, which was that as long as there was a public service element in the provision, she was indifferent about who was the provider.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.0/4">There must come a point at which the public service element of something is so strong that all parties recoil from its being provided by a private company. I hope the Home Office would rule out plans for market contestability in the case of a magistrates clerk, a judge or a police officer, and the probation service is not very far from those core elements of our judicial system that have such a strong public service element. That there is not a well developed market and a rush of private providers coming forward to manage offenders suggests that there are some things in which the public service element is so strong that that is where the line should be drawn.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.0/5">Across Government, the only model being provided is of the public sector being a commissioner and being indifferent to who is the provider, but time and again Ministers have to step back because of opposition, as they have had to do as a result of the situation in primary care trusts in the health service. I hope that my hon. Friend will do the same in respect of the probation service.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.0/6">I want to add a little more force to some of the points made by other hon. Members. It could be said that the broad issue has been subject to consultation before, and the Government's defence is that a 12-week consultation period is therefore unnecessary, but these proposals are so radically different from anything that has been consulted on before that it would have shown a measure of good faith to have had a full, 12-week consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.0/7">In north Yorkshire, it is feared that there will no longer be a locally commissioned service and that what we have will be decided by regional or national bureaucrats. People are worried that there will be no local community or judicial input in the remaining local boards and trusts and that input will come mainly from business.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.0/8">I shall be fascinated to hear what the two Opposition parties say about the politics of the proposal. If they announced that they would oppose the marketisation and privatisation of the probation service, they would kill the proposal and provide a great public service.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.0/9">From my humble position on the Back Benches, which is likely to be permanent, I say to my hon. Friend that there are two ways to be a junior Minister: you can either keep your head down, carry out the brief and take instructions from whichever bright young thing happens to be in No. 10 Downing street, or you can exercise some political judgment. That is what I hope the Home Office has done in respect of the forensic science service, although I am not quite sure; I trust that it is pausing for reflection.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.0/10">I have enough regard for the Minister to believe that she will not get into a political situation in which the Labour Government carry large numbers of measures only with support from the majority Opposition party, but that is her only hope of getting measures on this matter through the House. I hope that such is the descriptive potential of the proposal, and such is the feeling that a line must be drawn somewhere between the public and the private sector, that the Opposition parties will say today that they oppose it. I also hope that my hon. Friend will stage a stylish and managed retreat.</p>

	<p pid="a.378.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a valuable point. The lack of thorough evaluation is a major factor.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.0/2">My third point concerns new Labour's naivety in business. It has a breathless enthusiasm for business terminology. We have heard the Home Secretary's comment about the &quot;vibrant mixed economy&quot;, as if that were appropriate for a probation service. There is a statement in &quot;Restructuring Probation to Reduce Re-offending&quot; about winning business from the Secretary of State. One can almost sense his enthusiasm for playing big business.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.0/3">I have a business background, and markets operate well where clear consumer pressure operates. Consumer markets operate on several different levels. They operate not only on price, but on people's experience of the product, on their perceptions of quality, on brand loyalty and, these days, on the ethics of the product. Without those consumer pressures, markets are reduced to being about contracts for price. Cost becomes the only significant factor.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.0/4">Similarly, pseudo-markets in the NHS or the railways have not really operated as the Government expected them to because an individual passenger or patient cannot choose a particular rail company at a particular moment. They must take the train to London that turns up on the platform, just as they must be treated in the accident and emergency department to which they are sent. They do not have consumer choice in that sense. Likewise, offenders and victims will not be able to choose another probation service provider when they come to use the service or attempt to influence it.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.0/5">This is a pseudo-market; it is not a market in the true sense. The market will not operate in the way in which the Government expect it to. I am not ideologically committed to state provision, however, as the business approach is not always right. Each case needs careful evaluation and thought.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.0/6">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> pointed out, even in business some core competencies are not outsourced. One must ask what the Government's core competencies are. The probation service would seem to me to be pretty close to being a core competency. Moreover, a new business approach would not be launched without a robust business plan and without plenty of evaluation having been undertaken. I have known plenty of large companies that would spend 10 years evaluating a new product or approach before launching it on the market. The Government could learn something from such an approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.0/7">Finally, on centralisation, which I would call &quot;de-localisation&quot;, my constituency is facing less-local hospital children's services and planning powers and a less-local ambulance trust, fire control centre, police force and primary care trust. We even face a less-local strategic health authority, and the probation service is now to be added to that list. In the end, the provision of probation services in my constituency will depend on the whim of the Secretary of State. Either it is a huge coincidence that all the evidence about all those different services happens to point in the same direction or some other underlying reason is behind the Government's rush to de-localise services. That reason may be more about saving money.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.0/8">Hon. Members and the National Association of Probation Officers have listed many practical problems. A conflict of interest arises when private companies advise courts on sentences and parole decisions, because those companies must weigh up their commercial interest and a duty to their shareholders against the public interest. There is the problem of sensitive personal data on offenders and victims being handed to multiple data processors. There is an impact on youth offending teams, on police and on local social services, which may need to deal with multiple providers of probation services in their area. We must also consider the impact of the different cultures of the police and probation service within the National Offender Management Service, which has not yet had time to bed in.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.0/9">There is an overall recurring theme of restructuring, rather than examination of the underlying problems and attempts to improve the quality of work. There is short-termism in restructuring before proper evaluation. There is naivety about business provision and business terminology, and there is delocalisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.0/10">In Scotland, in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, Labour has had to find a different approach. After much careful thought, a different route has been taken. I suggest to the Minister that, instead of risking more crime and, possibly, more lost lives, she and her Government should, for once, think again, take time, take advice and take the right decision.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-13a.379.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" speakername="Andrew Turner" colnum="379"  time="010:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051213/halltext/51213h01.htm#51213h01_spnew25">
	<p pid="a.379.0/1">It is a great pleasure to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> on securing this debate. He said what a good job the probation service had done, and he provided evidence to support that. That has been a consistent <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">theme this morning; my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> agreed with him, and so do I. The hon. Member for Great Grimsby remarked on the process of relentless change based on assertions without evidence, which seems to be the underlying motor of the changes that are proposed to the probation service. I was amused by his flights of fancy on the meaning of correctional services. I should report, for the record, that the hon. Gentleman is wearing red socks, if not a red tag.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/2">I shall not take too much time because there is a history of Ministers not fully addressing the issues in answer to hon. Members who speak. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1521" name="Claire Curtis-Thomas">The hon. Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas)</phrase> remarked on <phrase class="date" code="">6 April</phrase> that, during an earlier debate secured by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, concerns were not adequately addressed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1495" name="Cheryl Gillan">the Minister. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)</phrase> remarked that a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-24">24 March 2005</phrase> did not fully answer all the questions raised in a debate on <phrase class="date" code="">16 March</phrase>. Those are two examples; one in which a Minister had not been able to answer during the debate, and another in which a Minister was not able to answer in writing after the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/3">It is worth noting that, in the previous debate that took place on this matter, the Minister spoke for seven columns in <i>Hansard</i>, and only in the fifth column did he begin to address the points made by the hon. Member for Crosby. I cannot say whether this applies to the Under-Secretary, but some Ministers seem to take up too much time with bland and uncontroversial reiteration and never get on to the meat of the matter. That is why I do not propose to spend too much time on my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/4">There are a number of issues to address, the most consistent of which, in previous debates, has been the disfranchisement of those who work for the probation service and the failure to adequately consult before implementing changes proposed by the Government. I shall not repeat those details, which were adequately set out on <phrase class="date" code="">6 April</phrase>. However, despite ministerial promises of flexibility, the results of consultation always seem to end up much as they start.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/5">I conclude that, regardless of responses from Ministers&mdash;among <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1810" name="David Blunkett">them the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett)</phrase>, who said that integration was best achieved at regional and local level&mdash;not all Ministers have enough clout to dissuade the national offender management system or civil servants from following a course that has been predetermined, presumably, somew<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">here further up the line. The hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> suggested that bright young things in No. 10 may be responsible for that. There will be brighter young things in No. 10 in the very near future, but I am sure that they will take much more account of the requirements and wishes of those who work in or are served by the public service.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/6">Something about the consultation that surprised me was a letter of <phrase class="date" code="">7 November</phrase> from the director of probation at the national probation service to NPS chief officers and chairs and national probation directorate regional managers, which told them:</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/7" class="indent">&quot;I am writing to you formally to remind you of your responsibilities in your roles as statutory office holders&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/8">The letter continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/9" class="indent">&quot;You should not engage in lobbying activity, you must not promulgate misinformation (e.g. contestability is privatisation) and you should avoid any action that might suggest that you are encouraging staff to lobby against government policy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/10">Thos instructions are being given to those who know most about the operation of the probation service. The Minister has some explaining to do about why it is unacceptable for those who know most to criticise the Government's policy on restructuring the probation service, when the Home Secretary invited those who know most to criticise the Opposition's policy on sentencing.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/11">Promises have been sought in the past, and many either have not been given or have been given in such a form that they are not reliable. One of the most significant is the one about commissioning at local, not regional, level. Baroness Scotland recently put out a press release announcing that the measures outlined today would transfer the duty to provide probation services to the Home Secretary. He would then assign to national and regional offender managers, acting on his behalf, the task of contracting with a range of providers&mdash;public, private or voluntary and community&mdash;for the supply of probation services. There seems to be complete confusion between the expectations that Ministers&mdash;not least a former Home Secretary&mdash;have repeated time and again, that the service will be a local one, and statements now coming from the Home Office that it will be regional and national. Unless we get clarity over the way in which the service will be provided, no one will trust it.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/12">A second area on which more information is needed is the timetable for the remaining contestability. Of course we need some of the changes, because prisons do not plug in with probation services, because people are released from prison half way through courses and because there is churning of prisoners, who are moved from one prison to another regardless. I was on the Education Committee and I saw exactly the same kind of things as those for which the National Audit Office has provided evidence. However, although I incline to favour contestability in privatisation, the Minister must concede that the explanations of why it is the right solution in the present case are unconvincing.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/13">Finally, I should like the Minister to say more about evaluation. It is evident that inadequate evaluation has been carried out. Indeed, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase> cited the restructuring that took place in 2001. He said that it was designed to prevent fragmentation and to promote localism, yet there has been no evaluation of that restructuring to say &quot;Yes, it works&quot; or &quot;No, it doesn't work&quot;. Instead, as the hon. Member for Great Grimsby said, someone behind the grey walls of another place seems to be committed to a national structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/14">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">my hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> said, we will support the Government when they are doing what is right. If and when we get the opportunity&mdash;I should still like to know when that will be&mdash;we would have no concern about voting for a well-worked out Bill that proposed a sensible solution. As I said, market testing can be effective, and contestability can drive standards up as well as, or instead of, driving costs down. However, there is no evidence for the cost savings that are said to be the consequence of the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/15">The Government do not seem to have settled on their arguments. Even when they are doing what is right, we cannot support them if they are doing it in such a ham-fisted way. That is not to say that the situation is irretrievable. It is retrievable if the Minister listens to what is being said by hon. Members on both sides. I hope that she will listen and, more important, I hope that she will answer.</p>

	<p pid="a.389.0/1">I know that the Minister is listening carefully to my hon. Friend and that he will do his best to help. Unfortunately, I am chairing a meeting at the same time as my hon. Friend's debate, so I am a bit stretched. He mentioned Little Havens, and I wonder whether he is aware that I was at a charity event on Saturday and that the lady who spoke to try to raise more funds said that if it was not for charitable giving continuing, by spring there would be no money left to continue the service. The situation is serious. Would my hon. Friend agree that the Minister should do everything that he can to underpin the funding so that there is some certainty in future arrangements?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-13a.389.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1493" speakername="Simon Burns" colnum="389"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051213/halltext/51213h02.htm#51213h02_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.389.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend because he has hit the nail on the head with the hammer. There is a terrible strain on hospices year in and year out, particularly on children's hospices because of the disparity in state funding. The army of people who help to raise money for Little Havens cannot be praised enough for their fantastic work. However, the state has to help that army because 2 per cent. of funding from state sources for the hospice is, I think the Minister would agree, wrong and unfair.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.1/2">As my hon. Friend knows, we fought a general election six months ago and the Conservative party was clear about what it believed should happen to the funding of children and adult hospices. We do not believe, and neither does the hospice movement, that the state should step in and pay more than a maximum of 49.9 per cent. of the funding. If the state were to pay more than that, it would start dictating terms because it would have the whip hand as the funding source. One of the strengths of the hospice movement is that it is charitable, relies on the voluntary sector and organises its own provision of care within strict guidelines for quality and standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.1/3">The hospice movement does not want to be taken over by the state, and we do not want it to be taken over. However, we believe that that cannot be used as an excuse not to give a fair and reasonable amount of money to allow it to thrive. Every pound that the hospice movement raises to pay for the care of its client group is a pound less that the state has to pay. If only for that reason, the Government should be shamed into making more money available.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.1/4">My hon. Friends and I fought the last election on the policy, as we did in 2001, that if we were returned to office we would increase funding for adult and children's hospices so that they got 40 per cent. of their funding for their day-to-day running costs from the state. That is a fair balance and would make a significant difference to the strains and pressures facing the hospice movement. That would give a breathing space and extra money so that hospices would be able to run their services and provide care with less of a burden and worry about where the money was coming from. If that argument is valid, as I think it is, it is even more valid for children's hospices.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.1/5">For a children's hospice to receive less than 5 per cent. of its funding from the state in this day and age is a travesty and a national disgrace. We are talking about young children and teenagers who, through no fault of their own, find themselves with life-limiting or serious illnesses and disabilities that place a tremendous strain on their families and carers. In some cases, without a hospice to step in and help, there would be no one else. Those families would be left on their own to fend for themselves with all the problems and pressures that causes. For the state to be content to provide less than 5 per cent., less than 5p in every pound spent on those vital and valuable services, is a national disgrace.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.1/6">I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to the matter, because it has come up time and time again in the House, and it will not go away by ignoring it or by flowery flannel, where Government spokesmen try to give the impression that the situation is infinitely better than it is. It is not good, and if the Minister does not believe that, and more importantly, if the Treasury does not believe that, let them go out into the country and visit children's hospices. Let them talk to that army of decent people who spend so much time working to raise money for hospices and find out from them exactly what is going on, the problems and difficulties that they are facing, and the possibilities of cuts in the services, of which we need more, not less.</p>

	<p pid="a.391.3/1">Thank you, Mr. Cook, for correcting me on the manner in which I should have addressed the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.3/2">I want to open up the debate in good faith, in trying to support much of what the hon. Member for West Chelmsford said. He mentioned the 38 children's hospices. One of them is in the north-east, and I am sure, Mr. Cook, that you are familiar with it, because it is on your patch, on the Stockton side, rather than the Tees valley on my side. I am sure that if you had not been chairing the debate you would have said something similar to what I am about to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.3/3">I support much of what the hon. Gentleman said about concerns for hospices. I want the Minister to listen carefully to what I have to say; I am sure that he will. I speak as a friend and supporter of the Government in all that they have done in tackling problems of health and in all the support that they have given to the health service. I speak as a strong friend, not as a foe, as the hon. Gentleman has done. I shall focus on one issue, but first I want to praise the work of Butterwick house children's hospice in my area, because it provides and has provided a tremendous service for children in my area and in the north-east as a whole. I want to pick up on the issue of funding, which was addressed by the hon. Gentleman, because it is a concern for people in the north-east, including many of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.3/4">As I said, Butterwick house children's hospice provides a tremendous service, from which about 80 families in the north-east, many of whom are my constituents, benefit. It provides many useful services, such as complementary therapies, advice and pre- and post-death bereavement support and counselling. The hon. Gentleman referred to such services. The hospice provides a breathing space when things go wrong and support for families over 24 hours. It has had a tremendous impact on the quality of life of families and children in my area.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.3/5">Butterwick house hospice and other hospices save the national health service a great deal of money. The resources and the bed space that a hospice provides facilitate tremendous support and ensure that people receive an excellent service, which should have been available in hospital. The mere fact that people are in a hospice saves the health service some money.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.3/6">Butterwick house hospice enjoys tremendous support from my constituents and others throughout the Tees valley, but it feels that it is threatened by lack of funds. I have received a document from its chief executive, Mr. Graham Leggatt-Chidgey&mdash;no doubt he is familiar to you, Mr. Cook&mdash;about the funding concerns. He informs me that the hospice is in real difficulty because of funding problems. He tells me that the &pound;145,000 annual grant that the hospice receives from the big lottery fund expires on <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2006</phrase>, and he is naturally very worried. The hospice is working exceptionally hard to secure funding from a range of sources, but the harsh reality is that it can only operate a service that can be financed. The hospice is worried and has asked me to raise the issue today, which is why I am here.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.3/7">The &pound;145,000 from the big lottery fund contributes 21 per cent. of the hospice's annual funding. Unless that funding is replaced, there is a real threat that Butterwick house's front-line services will have to be cut, which will have severe consequences for many families in my constituency and in the north-east as a whole. It will also have adverse effects on the NHS in the region, which will be forced to replace some of the specialist services provided by the hospice.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.3/8">As the hon. Member for West Chelmsford said, many hospices have to deal with a large number of primary care trusts. Butterwick house has to negotiate with 15 PCTs for its funding, which presents huge complications and difficulties. I know that the Minister will tell me that the PCT reconfiguration will simplify some of these matters, but children's hospices face serious difficulty with rising PCT deficits and staff already in transitional mode, which has resulted in their not being willing to make any financial commitment for their successors. That is genuinely a serious worry, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.3/9">I speak with great concern. I have never before raised the issue of hospices on the Floor of the House, but I raise it now because I am concerned. I know that the Minister really cares about these issues, so I am sure that he is taking serious account of what is being said. Local health authorities and social services have significant financial difficulties and restraints, and although they are willing to help children's hospices in most cases, they often find that their resources are scarce.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.3/10">As the hon. Member for West Chelmsford said, children's hospices receive only 5 per cent. of funding from the Government. The consequence of that for Butterwick house was that in order to balance its books, it had to raise about &pound;600,000 last year. All of us have been involved in various forms of fundraising, so we know that that is a lot of money for an organisation to raise, despite the fact that people in this country give generously. Given that adult hospices typically receive 35 per cent. of funding from the NHS, children with life-limiting and life-threatening illnesses seem to be getting a raw deal. I agreed with much of what the hon. Gentleman said, but I found the way in which he was saying it&mdash;against this Government&mdash;difficult to stomach. We must move away from the 5 per cent. figure: we must increase it. That cannot go on. It does not look very good. As someone who champions the Government and recognises the great contribution that they have made to tackling health problems, I speak as a strong friend to them. I urge the Minister to take note of this point: we must balance the level of funding to adult and children's hospices. I am not seeking more: parity would be enough. We are talking about a lot of money, but it can be seen as a challenge or target. We have to ensure that the funding that adult hospices receive will lead to further Government funding from here onwards. That is a goal that we should work towards.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.3/11">We must ensure that hospices get support. People who work in them give their best because they believe in them and in the caring service. Butterwick house has made a tremendous contribution to our area. It will be a huge loss if the services there are cut, and there will be great concern in Teesside. I assure the Minister that as we approach the end of the financial year, Members from the Tees valley area will speak on this issue. No doubt you might speak on the issue, Mr. Cook, if there is a further need for debate. I want to make the Minister aware of this issue long before we get down that road, because it is of genuine concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.3/12">The people at Butterwick hospice are not alarmist. I have never know them to express worry about dangers like this before. In all the years that I have been a Member&mdash;I have lived in Teesside for 21 years and know the area well&mdash;this is the first time that they have written to me in this spirit. Therefore, I ask the Minister to listen. We need some action to be taken. The hon. Member for West Chelmsford and I might have started on a wrong note, but his points were genuine. As someone who champions Butterwick hospice care, I passionately believe in the support that it gives our area in the north-east. I do not want the Minister suddenly to make an announcement; I know that he has to go away and think and put figures together, but I appeal to him. If he really wants to help, he should please consider the situation. If he is in a position to meet the people from Butterwick hospice, I am happy to bring them to the House with a delegation of right hon. and hon. Members from my area. I hope that you, Mr. Cook, can assist with this matter in future. We do not want the hospice to be threatened with service cuts toward the end of the financial year. I do not want the Minister to say, &quot;Nobody made me aware of this,&quot; at that point. I seek his support on this and on the wider principle of increasing funding from 5 per cent. The Opposition suggested a figure of 49 per cent.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-13a.395.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1458" speakername="Stephen Williams" colnum="395"  time="011:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051213/halltext/51213h02.htm#51213h02_spnew17">
	<p pid="a.395.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1493" name="Simon Burns">the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns)</phrase> on having secured a debate on such an important and emotive topic, and recognise the passion and commitment with which he addressed his subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/2">It has been said a few times that, nationally, there are 38 children's hospices. The nearest one to my constituency is Little Bridge House in north Devon. On a good day on the M5 and other roads, that is about two hours away, but frequently it takes rather longer to get there. There is certainly demand in greater Bristol for a new children's hospice. In the heart of my constituency, we have the Bristol Royal hospital for children. Bristol, West also has CLIC, the well-known charity for children with cancer and leukaemia, which was founded in Bristol. The Association of Children's Hospices is also based in Bristol. There are plans to build and equip a new children's hospice at Charlton Farm in Wraxall&mdash;just over the Avon gorge, which divides my constituency from Woodspring. However, it will cost &pound;15 million to build and equip the new hospice and to endow the initial running costs. Some &pound;5 million per annum will also need to be raised to run it jointly with the hospice that I mentioned in north Devon.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/3">I was pleased recently to attend a fundraising ball; it will contribute in a small way towards the costs of running the hospice, but as has been mentioned, such charitable fundraising is competing with ever-growing demands from other parts of health care system and from other charities that are trying to raise funds. The children's hospital in Bristol is having a Wallace and Gromit appeal to raise funds, while the hospice is having its Babe's Big appeal. We therefore have well-known children's characters competing to raise funds for essentially the same sort of care for children. I am also aware of the campaign being run by <i>The Sun</i>, although I was not aware, until the hon. Member for West Chelmsford mentioned it, of the campaign run by Somerfield. I am pleased to hear about it, however, because Somerfield is also a Bristol-based commercial company.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/4">As has been mentioned, children's hospices receive about 5 per cent. of their funding on average from the state, but 15 of the 38 existing hospices get no state funding whatever. That compares with core funding of 28 to 30 per cent. for adult hospices. Surely, it is reasonable that hospices that give children essential palliative care, which might otherwise be provided by the NHS, should get a fair price for those services from the NHS or other health care commissioners. It is not immediately clear, however, how they can access some of those funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/5">In 2002, in response to a parliamentary question tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase>, the then Minister, now the Minister for Housing and Planning, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" name="Yvette Cooper">the hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase>, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/6" class="indent">&quot;It is for the national health service locally to make arrangements for financial support for both adults' and children's hospices, given the extent of local diversity both of the services provided and of alternative sources of local support.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-11">11 March 2002</phrase>; Vol. 381, c. 818W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/7">The restructuring of primary care trusts has been alluded to, and I wonder whether existing PCTs or even new ones have adequate funds to provide that support, particularly given the situation that I mentioned in the south-west, where children will typically come from a wide range of communities. A better way of directing funds towards hospices might therefore be to fund them on a regional level.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/8">In the recent general election, the Labour party manifesto contained a commitment to increasing end-of-life palliative care, and I look forward to the Minister expanding on what that means, particularly for hospices. I share the concern expressed by other hon. Members that it would be unrealistic to expect the state to fund hospice care entirely, and we are certainly not arguing for that: it would undermine hospices' charity ethos, their volunteer base and their independence from the state. Surely, however, it is realistic to expect the state to pick up more than 0 per cent. of funding in 15 cases and more than 5 per cent. in 23 cases, and to at least match the average funding that is given to adult hospices. That would give children's hospices some degree of core funding and security so that they can provide an important and appreciated service in our communities. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-13a.397.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" speakername="Tim Loughton" colnum="397"  time="011:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051213/halltext/51213h02.htm#51213h02_spnew18">
	<p pid="a.397.0/1">I too congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1493" name="Simon Burns">my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns)</phrase>. It is a shame that more hon. Members have not been able to participate in the debate, but that does not reflect on the seriousness of its subject, which affects all hon. Members; in many cases, it will have done so directly and personally, because relatives and friends will have used the facilities that children's hospices provide. They do an essential job.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/2">I declare an interest as a patron of the St. Barnabas hospice in Worthing, which is the parent organisation of a recently set up children's hospice, the Chestnut Tree house, which is a fantastic facility on the outskirts of Worthing. Staff at that hospice have already looked after many of my constituents. St. Barnabas has been running for 32 years, and in that time has provided direct care to 20,000 people. That is no mean achievement.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/3">It is estimated that, generally, hospices must provide about 80 per cent. of all palliative care in the United Kingdom. Part of the problem is that the provision of hospices is subject to something of a postcode lottery. There is patchiness in the provision of children's hospices. As with many charitable causes, they are quite often less easy to find in less affluent areas. That results in a double whammy whereby many facilities are not available in areas where they are desperately needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/4">Hon. Members have already mentioned the legacy of Dame Cicely Saunders who died this year, having set up the first hospice in 1967 and the first children's hospice in Oxford in 1982. The Chestnut Tree house hospice was opened for overnight care in April 2004, and has already cared for 135 children and young adults with life-limiting conditions. It has also provided services for almost 500 family members. I wish to pay tribute to Monica Ridley, who recently stood down as chairman of the trustees of the Chestnut Tree house hospice, and to Hugh Lowson, who, as chief executive of St. Barnabas, has made a great impact on that excellent resource over the past few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/5">All hon. Members agree that we owe a great debt of gratitude to the volunteers who make the hospice movement possible. They are unsung heroes who do much to take the pressures and strains off the national health service, which would otherwise have to pick up the tab. All hon. Members have, in affectionate terms, mentioned hospices in, or close to, their constituencies. We heard about Little Haven in Essex, Butterwick in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" name="Ashok Kumar">the constituency of the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar)</phrase>, St. Luke's hospice in Southend, and Little Bridge house in Devon, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1458" name="Stephen Williams">the hon. Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams)</phrase> mentioned. The latter hospice is two hours away from the hon. Gentleman's constituency, which reinforces my point about the patchiness of provision. There are other high-profile children's hospices that do a fantastic job, such as the Shooting Stars hospice in south-west London and the CHASE hospice in Surrey, which has been at the forefront of a campaign to secure a fairer deal on funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/6">My hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford made some good points, especially on how important it is that hospices are able to keep their independence. There is a strength and wealth of talent and good will in the hospice movement. The last thing that hospices would want is for them to be nationalised in some way. As the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland put it, we must achieve something approaching parity of funding with adult hospices. He made some good points about the range of care that Butterwick hospice is able to offer. It is not just a matter of the last few days of someone's life; especially for children, it is a matter of their going there for short stays to take the pressure off parents and to take advantage of specialised facilities and complementary therapies. The hon. Gentleman freely admitted that that hospice is facing a funding crisis. I defy any hon. Member who has been in touch with a local hospice to come away with a different story.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/7">Nationally, about 20,000 children are suffering from life-limiting diseases. An average of around 4,300 of those children and their families are assisted by hospices, but there are only a few hundred acute beds available in children's hospices. Those figures apply to the 38 fully operational children's hospices and another five that are planned or in the process of being built.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/8">It is interesting to reflect on the nature of the diseases that children's hospices treat. Some 96 per cent. of cases that are treated in adult hospices tend to be of some form of cancer. Mercifully, only one in 600 children under the age of 15 develops a cancer, and children respond differently to treatment than adults do. Some diseases that children's hospices deal with are: Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which affects 100 boys born each year; Batten disease, or neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis&mdash;that will really frustrate <i>Hansard&mdash;</i>which affects one in 30,000 births and leads to a progressive and incurable deterioration of the brain and nervous system; Rett syndrome, which affects more than one in 10,000 females and causes profound and multiple disabilities; and cystic fibrosis, with which hon. Members will be more familiar.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/9">Children with those diseases now live well into their teens, so many fall into the gap that exists between adult and child provision. Therefore children with the aforementioned diseases form an increasing body. As a result of advances in medical technology, more children can live much longer with diseases from which they would have been expected to have only a short lifespan. Surely children's hospices' work load will increase as the pool of children with whom they will deal increases. Unfortunately, those diseases will still be around until we find a cure, but they are much more manageable, and children can, fortunately, often live on into adult life.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/10">First and foremost, children's hospices deal with health problems. In a country that has a national health service that is charged to deal with such problems, surely hospices should be an integrated beneficiary of national health funding. Even at the most advanced stages of a disease, caring for the dying is a fundamental part of health care and should not be treated as some novelty good cause that may be lucky enough to pick up public funds through a lottery board's philanthropy.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/11">I fear that the care of children with life-limiting conditions often does not fit into the Government's obsession with a health service that is driven by target tables, waiting-list numbers, hospital admission numbers and bed blocking. How does one measure the outcomes of looking after children who have life-limiting conditions? Obviously, one does not measure those outcomes on the basis of how long they stay in hospital, by minimising the cost of their drug treatment, or by curing their diseases and cutting down on their readmissions. One does not measure those outcomes based on comparative morbidity rates or on the number of complaints made about treatment. They can be measured only by the length of time for which quality of life can be extended, the impact of physical pain relief on the child and his or her emotional well-being, and, of course, the impact on the family and how they cope at a tremendously emotional and traumatic time before and after their child has passed away. That is what children's hospices are all about.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/12">One cannot easily evaluate, quantify, tick boxes for or comply with target tables for children's hospices. They are measured by the comfort and relief that they bring. As someone put it: &quot;Hospices are not places where people go to die; a hospice is somewhere where you can come to life.&quot; That is the modern vision of palliative care.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/13">On the subject of funding, many hon. Members have already mentioned that children's hospices receive, on average, little more than 5 per cent. of their funds from public sources. The former Minister for Public Health, Melanie Johnson, raised the problem. She stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/14" class="indent">&quot;Funding the services provided by hospices is a matter for negotiation between the hospice concerned and the NHS primary care trusts to which the hospice provides a service. There are no limits to the amount of funding which may be provided; this is for local decision.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons, </i><phrase class="date" code="2004-09-16">16 September 2004</phrase>; Vol. 424, c. 1759W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/15">The problem is that there are no limits to the minimum amount that primary care trusts can provide. In many cases, because it is not a statutory requirement and because of the great funding pressures on PCTs, they provide zero funding for children's hospices. Unless there is a statutory duty on PCTs to provide funding, I am afraid that, because of priorities and because PCTs are strapped for cash, children's hospices will not get a look-in, whatever we might say here. The Minister and his Government take direct action to encourage PCTs to provide funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/16">The new opportunities fund&mdash;now the big lottery fund&mdash;provided &pound;48 million over three years for 130 palliative care projects. The funding runs out at the end of March 2006. At present, there are no plans to renew that funding. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about his intentions, now that March 2006 is just four months away. Children's hospices have received little, if any, of the extra money from the cancer plan funding that the Government established some years ago. The Government promised to double the level of investment in palliative care, but, often, that extra investment has got lost in PCTs and has not found its way to end use in hospices&mdash;most certainly not children's hospices.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/17">In addition, in the past few years there have been many extra funding pressures on charitable institutions such as children's hospices from national insurance increases, extra pay pressure from Agenda for Change, price inflation of 7 to 9 per cent. for pharmaceutical products that are heavily used in hospices, extra requirements under the Care Standards Act 2000, and the estimated &pound;400 million of VAT that is not reclaimable. I hope that the Minister will be able to give assurances of a more sympathetic financial treatment of children's hospices from the Treasury in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/18">I remember speaking on this subject in the House three years ago. It is not a new subject or a new problem, but it is getting worse. I was told that new funds such as Futurebuilders would help to deal with the problem. Futurebuilders is a fund designed for voluntary bodies. I tabled a parliamentary question recently to ask how much money Futurebuilders had paid out, and how much of that had gone to children's hospices. Out of a promised fund of &pound;120 million, so far about &pound;4.5 million has been paid to voluntary bodies, of which not one penny piece has gone to any hospice, let alone any children's hospice.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/19">Perhaps we should not be surprised about that, because to qualify for funding from Futurebuilders the applicant must be able to show that 50 per cent. of core funding is sustainable. However, children's hospices rely on very transient funding. We cannot say that a given number of people will die in the coming year and leave legacies to a hospice in their wills. Charitable fundraising is, as we know, unpredictable. It is virtually impossible for those hospices to get funding from Futurebuilders.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/20">We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the carers of the children who use children's hospices. There are about 6 million carers in this country, more than 2 million of whom are aged over 60, and 20 per cent. of whom are over 70. They do an enormous amount, for which they get little gratitude, and without them the state would have to pick up the tab and things would be much more difficult. We should be making their job easier, not harder.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/21">I want to end my remarks by relating the problem to the Chestnut Tree house. My local children's hospice is one of those 15 that receive zero funds from the public purse. It has been losing staff because of wage pressures. Charitable fundraising has raised some &pound;600,000 in the past year, but it takes almost double that to run the hospice. Therefore, the parent hospice, St. Barnabas, must subsidise its work. That is unsustainable. Donations have been difficult recently because of all the competing charitable pressures, not least the tsunami. We all know the enormous amount of fundraising that was done for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/22">The Chestnut Tree house has four acute beds at present, plus one for emergencies, but it was planned that it would have eight, plus two for emergencies. It has received no money from Children in Need, despite repeated applications to that charity. We are told that West Sussex has had quite enough, so it is tough. It used its grant from the New Opportunities Fund to develop a very sophisticated and welcome bereavement counselling support service for parents of children who have gone into a hospice.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/23">All in all, hospice funding is highly unsatisfactory and it is time that things changed. It is particularly unsatisfactory that many hospices must shrink their services at a time of growing demand. Effectively, many hospices are subsidising the NHS by providing services that it would otherwise have to provide. That contravenes Charity Commission rules. Is that really the way in which to fund health care? Would it be acceptable for the Government to seek to fulfil their target to recruit so many thousands of doctors or to reduce waiting times for hip operations to less than 18 months through random grants from one of the lottery funds? Of course it would not, so why should palliative care for children be treated as a bonus good cause that just happened to come up trumps this year under the Government's current definition of what worthy cause needs to benefit from the British public's gambling largesse? What happens when that funding stream runs out next year? Faced with those pressures, how can hospices plan long-term expansion strategies?</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/24">Health policy is not rocket science. It must treat palliative care and hospices as a mainstream health activity, and it must feature in the health strategy of all the NHS providers as a matter of course. We need fair funding through the NHS, not funding at the whim of the lottery, which sends out the message that the Government do not regard hospices as a priority. Surely we should be doing everything that we can to help to nurture, to encourage and to expand the tremendous legacy of Dame Cicely Saunders.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.0/25">The Government really should be doing more to support the fantastic work done by children's hospices, and I hope that we will hear some wise and solid words from the Minister and the assurance that the Government will at last take children's hospices seriously as a mainstream provider of palliative care in the NHS.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-13a.403.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" speakername="Liam Byrne" colnum="403"  time="012:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051213/halltext/51213h02.htm#51213h02_spnew20">
	<p pid="a.403.1/1">I said at the beginning that I started my travels of the past few months at the Donna Louise trust. That is the principal hospice that I have visited on site, but I have met multi-disciplinary teams working with hospices throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">3 November</phrase>, in a debate that the hon. Gentleman was not able to attend, I said what steps have been taken since 1997, but I shall repeat them for his benefit. The first was our immediate commendation of the report by the Association for Children with Life-Threatening or Terminal Conditions. That was closely followed by the second step; NHS executive guidance was issued in 1998 that drew on lessons learned from a series of projects that provide a range of care to families.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.1/3">The third step also occurred in 1998, when a team headed by the Treasury invited applications to establish Diana children's community nursing teams throughout the country. They were to build on the work undertaken in the first pilot programme and blaze a trail for the development of home care for children with life-threatening illnesses. Additional funding of about &pound;1.5 million to support that project in England was provided by the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.1/4">The fourth step was the partnership that became possible in 1998 when the Association of Children's Hospices was registered as a charity to promote the interest of the children's hospice movement. Since then, the Department of Health has worked closely with the association to develop a better understanding of the issues on both sides. In particular, the Department has commissioned the association to provide quality assurance packages to enhance the quality of care provided by children's hospices.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.1/5">Step five, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, took place in 2000, when, after discussions with the New Opportunities Fund, about &pound;45 million was made available to 135 projects, including 71 awards to home-based palliative care teams. Step six took place in 2003, when the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence commissioned the national collaborating centre for cancer to develop service guidance on child and adolescent cancer services, including palliative care and bereavement support. NICE service guidance supports the implementation of the national cancer plan and also forms an additional structure to provide support for children's palliative care needs. The seventh step involved work with ACH, where the Department funded the production of care pathway guidance launched last year to complement the national service framework on disabled children and young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.1/6">That is the past, so I will now talk about the future. As hon. Members from all parties have argued for some time, the steps taken are not enough and we must and can go further. Several trends emerge from the work on hospices undertaken by ACH. Often hospices are set up after a family's tragic struggle, and they create an enormous amount of energy to see through an important dream backed through the strength of local communities. As a former native of Harlow I well know the generosity and support that is available in Essex. To help ensure that that energy is channelled in the right way, the Department of Health can do a great deal to support innovative services.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.1/7">Part of the answer has to be how we support hospices in their plan. To support those ambitions the Department provided funding for ACH to develop a toolkit on how children's hospices work, which aims to provide references to the sources of information that are required to plan and establish services so that any new services that are being set up can make informed decisions about what services the families would find most helpful. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" name="Tim Loughton">the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)</phrase> pointed out, children with life-threatening illnesses often have different conditions and needs. The services that hospices need to provide are often varied. However, the toolkit provides a much better understanding of what is involved in starting and running a hospice and an overview of some of the challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.1/8">Although there is support for the hospice movement, the Government have to bear their share of the responsibility. We must take three steps. First&mdash;this is probably the crucial point&mdash;we must strengthen the support provided by the local NHS for hospices. We have tripled the amount of money that will go into the health service by 2007&ndash;08 to &pound;92 billion. At the heart of this morning's debate is how we make that money work for local people who provide hospices for children. The way in which the local national health services will work together is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.1/9">As my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough has said on a number of occasions, many hospices provide services over wide areas. I know that the hospice near his community confronts that challenge. We need to ensure that local health service commissioners work together effectively to provide financing. I have launched dedicated guidance for that purpose that will build on and make real the intentions expressed in the NSF for children and young people, which is mandatory for the NHS. I have laid copies of the guide in the Library, and it will support health care organisations, local authorities and other partners. Of course, a range of partners are involved who are working together in children's trusts to understand and develop children's palliative care services and make the mandatory NSF a reality. The guide is important because it sets out the service model, describes the elements that need to be involved and gives practical examples of the services that need to be provided and how they should look.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.1/10">Secondly, we must make specialist commissioning sharper. My noble Friend, Lord Warner, made a ministerial statement on <phrase class="date" code="">Wednesday 19 October</phrase> announcing a review of NHS specialist services. The taskforce set up to lead the review will be headed by Scotland's chief medical officer and will consider how such services are commissioned and how they can be changed in future. It will address to a good extent <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1458" name="Stephen Williams">the issues raised by the hon. Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams)</phrase>, when he said that a stronger way of doing things is needed than the method that we now operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.1/11">Finally, I want to consider the question of resources. I made an announcement to the House in the Adjournment debate on <phrase class="date" code="">3 November</phrase>, which was secured by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1843" name="Robert Flello">my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello)</phrase>. He spoke passionately about the need to extend the manifesto pledge that we made about strengthening end-of-life care for adults. He asked why we could not extend that commitment to include children. I can tell him, with the agreement of my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Central, that we shall extend that pledge for children and young people with life-threatening conditions. I shall make further announcements to the House as soon as possible, but I expect that the Department will be able to say far more about how the policy will be implemented in detail, in the forthcoming White Paper on social care and health.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-13a.411.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1882" speakername="David Lammy" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport"  colnum="411"  time="012:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051213/halltext/51213h03.htm#51213h03_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.411.0/1">I am very grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1647" name="Diana Johnson">my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Ms Johnson)</phrase> for introducing the debate, and giving me the opportunity to respond on what I know all hon. Members here will know is an historic occasion for me, as the descendant of freed slaves. The 200th anniversary of Parliament's passing of the Slave Trade Act offers us an incredibly important opportunity to mark a crucial turning point in this country's history.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/2">I want to set out how important I believe 2007 and the bicentenary of the abolition to be. In so doing, I pay tribute to the work of those who have done so much to keep alive the spirit of the abolitionists and who are now planning on making the bicentenary such a success, particularly in my hon. Friend's constituency. I also want to indicate where the Government believe they can best contribute in the lead-up to 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/3">From 1562, when the first English slaving expedition was led by Sir John Hawkins, to the eventual freedom of enslaved men, women and children in the British Empire on <phrase class="date" code="1838-08-01">1 August 1838</phrase>, this country was intimately concerned in slavery and the slave trade. Until the 19th century, slavery was considered by many to be an acceptable part of the economic system and the fabric of this country. It was seen as enabling many countries in Europe and beyond to profit from the exchange of goods produced by a vast pool of free labour.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/4">At the time, the legitimacy of slavery was justified by people from across society: politicians, businessmen, scientists and even some within the churches. Indeed at some time or another much of the country was intimately connected with slavery and its products. Every spoonful of sugar or coffee and every bale of cotton was closely connected with the slave trade. This country was not alone in benefiting financially from the slave trade. Yet, as the strongest power of the age, it bears a great weight of responsibility. As the Bicentenary of Parliament's passing of the Slave Trade Act approaches, it is right that we begin to feel that weight more keenly. There are very strongly held views on the historical facts of slavery, the moral and legal accountability of those who were involved and the lasting effects. Many people have argued that the repercussions of the slave trade still resonate down the centuries.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/5">The bicentenary in 2007 marks a crucial turning point in this country's move towards the nation it is today. It was a critical, if long overdue, step into the modern world, which we should still be proud this country took before any other. We took it before France, the United States and Brazil. I am very keen that we use the bicentenary in 2007 to the best possible effect. So, 2007 offers a timely opportunity for the people of Britain to recognise the reality of the transatlantic slave trade, to mark the abolition itself and the role of ordinary people, alongside other Britons, Africans and Caribbean people to help bring slavery to an end.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/6">My hon. Friend has eloquently reminded us of one of the great heroes of the abolition movement&mdash;William Wilberforce. His conviction, his strength and above all his belief and sense of purpose, still shine out to us over the intervening years. Many people will already know a little of his life, and those of his contemporaries such as Thomas Clarkson. As my hon. Friend said, 2007 offers a great opportunity for his life and achievements, and those of his contemporaries to be made much more widely known.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/7">I am also keen that in 2007 we do our utmost to celebrate the lives and contributions of those abolitionists who are not so well known. I think of Olaudah Equiano, thought to have been born in 1745 in west Africa, and kidnapped and sold into slavery in the west Indies. Having bought his freedom he became a leading spokesman for the campaign for the abolition of the slave trade and slavery. His autobiography is still in print today.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/8">In addition to Equiano, there is Quobna Cugoano, the acclaimed writer who was born in 1757, who denounced the evils of slavery and pleaded for human dignity, not the relocation of ex-slaves to Sierra Leone. There is also Ignatio Sancho, who was born on a slave ship in the mid-Atlantic in 1729 and who became a leading activist in the pro-abolition campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/9">All three were Africans and important figures in this country's history. One of the measures of a successful year in 2007 will be that the lives and achievements of those still largely unknown Britons are brought to the fore. I am pleased that plans for a major ground-breaking exhibition in 2007 on the life and times of Equiano are already well advanced.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/10">The year 2007 also offers the important opportunity to celebrate not only the lives and achievements of politicians, church leaders, Africans and former slaves, but of the countless ordinary British citizens who demanded change. Their petitions, marches, lobbying and prayers were crucial in putting pressure on Parliament to abolish the slave trade. They were ordinary people who spoke out against what they knew was wrong, despite the unpopularity of their views at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/11">Therefore, in addition to ensuring that the reality of the transatlantic slave trade is highlighted in 2007 and that we celebrate the achievements of the abolitionists, I want to ensure that we make the links between the concerns for justice that were present 200 years ago and our current concerns to tackle modern-day slavery and injustices, such as dealing with people trafficking and smuggling, making progress on providing debt relief for the poorest countries in the world and on development and justice in Africa, and dealing with the trade in sex slaves that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase> mentioned. It is right that we understand and do all we can to combat those injustices.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/12">I believe that the bicentenary in 2007 offers a chance for the country to make a collective commitment to ensure that in another 200 years, no one should feel the need to express the same level of regret for our actions today. That is a bold ambition, but 2007 is the right year in which to make it.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/13">We know that poverty and social exclusion are at the root of most forms of contemporary slavery. Since 1997, the UK has doubled its aid budget and the primary focus of our programme has been the elimination of poverty. Where possible we do that by supporting country-owned development plans. At the G8 summit in July, it was agreed that an extra $50 billion a year would be provided to poor countries by 2010, some $25 billion of which will go to Africa, which will more than double our aid to Africa compared with 2004's figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/14">A key aim is to ensure that the needs of the poor, and particularly the most vulnerable groups, are taken into account in all the Government's approaches. It is therefore right that I should highlight just a few of the approaches that are already being adopted by the Department for International Development to tackle modern-day forms of slavery.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/15">In west Africa, we provide more than &pound;1 million to the International Labour Organisation's programme to tackle descent-based slavery and other forced labour issues. In Sudan, we support the participation of displaced children, including those who have been forced to work as soldiers and slaves, in the rebuilding of Sudan. The Government's contribution is nearly &pound;500,000. In Nepal, the modern slave trade project provides more than &pound;250,000 to reduce the number of young boys and girls coerced into prostitution.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/16">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for drawing attention to the considerable work already undertaken in Hull at the Wilberforce House museum and the Wilberforce Institute for the study of slavery and emancipation. The close working between the museum, the university of Hull, the city council and others is a strong example of how we are most successful when we work together.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/17">Through its close connections with William Wilberforce and as one of the country's major ports, Hull clearly has a key role to play in 2007. I am especially pleased that it has been working closely with the other great port cities of Liverpool and Bristol, which had a direct connection to the slave trade. The focus in Hull on highlighting the historical detail of the slave trade, the role of abolitionists and the links to modern-day forms of slavery and injustice is the focus that will make 2007 a success. Hull will rightly play a major role in the events of 2007, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for inviting me to visit the city. I look forward to seeing the work she outlined in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/18">I recognise the pivotal role of Hull&mdash;I underline pivotal&mdash;and I shall highlight a few of the other initiatives that are already in hand or planned for 2007. The National Maritime museum in Liverpool will open a new gallery, known as the National museum and centre for the understanding of transatlantic slavery. In the design of the displays and through focused outreach, the museum will target new visitors, particularly from under-represented and ethnic minority groups in and around Merseyside. Funding for the museum comes largely from the Heritage Lottery Fund. I am pleased that my Department is directly contributing &pound;250,000 a year to meet the new museum's running costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/19">Education and youth involvement is a key element in 2007. As part of strategic commissioning through the national-regional partnerships programme, my Department and the Department for Education and Skills have funded the understanding slavery initiative, involving Hull, Bristol, Liverpool and the National Maritime museum in Greenwich. I am pleased that since 2003 that initiative, which anchors teaching of the history of the period within the school curriculum, has received nearly &pound;600,000 from the Government. It is most important that children in key stages 2 and 3 learn that history.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/20">In funding events in 2007, the Heritage Lottery Fund is encouraging community-based organisations and others to apply for funding inspired by the bicentenary. It is keen to fund projects that add to the collective understanding of the transatlantic slave trade and its impact on our national heritage.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/21">It was noted earlier that there was a problem in the application made in Liverpool; I was also lobbied vigorously on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" name="Kerry McCarthy">the issue by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase>. I understand that the Heritage Lottery Fund will meet the Bristol Empire and Commonwealth museum again soon. The fund is keen to emphasise that it is committed to funding projects throughout the UK to mark the 2007 bicententary. It has already awarded grants totalling &pound;15 million and published guidance for applicants considering projects. I hope that the problems, particularly those in Bristol, will be overcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/22">We cannot hope now to right the wrongs perpetuated in the past, but we should not ignore them. We must learn from them, and take the opportunity of the bicentenary to engage more widely in positive debate about the evils of present-day unfree labour, trafficking and forced prostitution. We must also celebrate and commemorate the many lay people and parliamentarians, men, women and free slaves who successfully campaigned in Britain for the abolition of the slave trade.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-13a.418.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" speakername="Karen Buck" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport"  colnum="418"  time="013:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051213/halltext/51213h04.htm#51213h04_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.418.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" name="Andrew Turner">the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> on securing this debate and on his energy in making representations to me a couple of weeks ago. He and his council colleagues have made many valuable points about transport on the Isle of Wight. We can all agree about the special character of the Isle of Wight and some of the particular challenges faced by rural and rural island communities in transport and in accessing services.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/2">I hope that I will be able to respond to a number of his points. If I cannot cover them all, I shall be happy to speak to him later. He talked about bus transport today, as he did when we met earlier. The Government are heavily committed to supporting bus use. We are providing more than &pound;360 million a year through the bus service operators grant and through rural subsidy grant, which is now &pound;53 million a year and helps to support around 2,200 rural bus services. We also invest in particular projects, such as bus challenge schemes and kick start.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/3">Isle of Wight services are benefiting from more than &pound;250,000 in rural bus services grant in this financial year and have been awarded more than &pound;1.6 million since 1998 to develop their rural bus services. That supports 15 services in the authority's area. The Isle of Wight was successful with a 2002 rural bus challenge bid, the &quot;East Wight villager&quot; for which it was awarded more than &pound;400,000. The &quot;East Wight villager&quot; is essentially a demand responsive service, linking the small villages with the principal towns. The award paid for the purchase of the vehicles and provided support to maintain the service for three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/4">The hon. Gentleman referred to concessionary travel. As he knows, the Government are committed to helping older and disabled people to access public transport. We introduced the first statutory minimum entitlement in 2001, which guaranteed half-fare travel on local buses. We will provide an extra &pound;350 million in the next financial year to allow older and disabled people to travel free on local off-peak bus services. As he is aware, we have made it very clear that this is a baseline of service on which local authorities are encouraged to build. That may be in partnership with other local authorities, which is not so easy when one is separated by a body of water, or by developing additional services on top of the concessionary fare that is essentially Government funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/5">It is pleasing to hear that the council is looking at innovative ways of approaching flat fares or other concessionary fare approaches to help meet the particular local needs of the community. The Government are investing the money to provide a service but we recognise that central Government cannot and should not attempt to develop a very responsive service to every local area's particular needs. We want local government to take a lead in doing that.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/6">One of the appropriate ways for local authorities to rise to that challenge is in the field of community transport, which is particularly relevant to rural communities. Provision and funding of transport to hospital and medical facilities, for example, can be provided by a number of different organisations, such as the hospital trust, local, voluntary and community groups, and bus and taxi companies. Community services operated by the voluntary sector have a valuable role in supplementing public transport provision. Local authorities have the flexibility to support these services from their local budgets should they choose to do so. A local authority can use its allocation of rural bus subsidy grant to help fund such services, and many community transport operators are also eligible to claim bus service operators grant from the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/7">The hon. Gentleman has made several representations on making travel concessions on ferry crossings a statutory entitlement; that was the clear theme of his speech today and at our meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">30 November</phrase>. As he vigorously explained, it will be necessary for islanders to travel to the mainland to access hospital health services or services such as education. However, I assure him that travel concession authorities can already provide enhancements to the statutory minimum requirement, and it would be within the local authority's power to give concessions on ferries, subject to financial priorities. The current basis of concessionary travel is the Government framework for a minimum entitlement, which leaves local discretion to add extras, such as bus travel before 9.30 am, community transport schemes and concessionary travel on services outside the local authority boundary.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/8">The context is the financial settlement for local authorities, which was announced early last week. It was the first two-year settlement for local authorities' Government grant. Overall, &pound;62 billion will be provided in 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;65 billion in 2007&ndash;08. For the Isle of Wight, that means an extra &pound;6 million, or 5.5 per cent., in funding in 2006&ndash;07. Taking formula grant and dedicated schools grant together, that will increase to &pound;7 million, a 6.1 per cent. increase.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-13a.420.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" speakername="Karen Buck" colnum="420"  time="013:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051213/halltext/51213h04.htm#51213h04_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.420.1/1">I am afraid that I do not have the figure with me, but the grant is not a ring-fenced, as the hon. Gentleman is probably aware. The distribution is done under a formula and in consultation with local government. The money is then put into the general environmental and protective cultural services block of the revenue support grant for local authorities to draw on.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.1/2">On roads, the hon. Gentleman made a strong case for supporting the roads private finance initiative. It may be helpful if I explain the bidding process for PFI. We aim to invite expressions of interest for further highway maintenance PFI pathfinder projects from local transport authorities early next year, although the exact details have yet to be finalised. Under the process for accepting bids, the Department will invite expressions of interest from local authorities and ask the strongest bidders to produce an outline business case. If the Department approves an authority's outline business case, it will be put forward to be approved by the project review group. The group is an interdepartmental body chaired by Her Majesty's Treasury and has to approve all PFI schemes that require central Government support.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.1/3">On air services, the White Paper on the future of air transport supported the growth of regional airports and recognised in particular the role that air services can play in providing rapid access from the regions to other parts of the country. The network of domestic air services in the UK has expanded significantly in recent years, and several airlines specialise in serving thinner routes to small regional airports. We are looking to those carriers, working with airport operators, to introduce proposals for new commercial services and to open up parts of the country that do not possess air links. I am aware that there is a history of air links to the Isle of Wight, although no sustained air services have operated for a great many years. The potential for new services to the island would of course be restricted by the limited capabilities of the two licensed aerodromes, which could support only smaller types of commercial aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.1/4">The hon. Gentleman mentioned Island Line. As he knows, it is a stand-alone train operating company franchise operated by Stagecoach, and it is due to end in February 2007. The first stage of the procurement process for the letting of the new South Western passenger rail franchise has started. The new franchise will encompass the existing Island Line franchise. There has been no significant investment in the line for a considerable time, but it is being designated as a community rail line as part of the Department's community rail development strategy, which is examining the cost-effectiveness of infrastructure enhancements to enable a more regular service pattern to operate while reducing ongoing costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.1/5">Progress has been made in establishing a community rail partnership for the island that involves the railway, the council, Wightlink and other user groups. Its main purpose will be to raise the profile of the line and to promote its local use and use by mainline visitors.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.1/6">The hon. Gentleman made important and valuable points about information, advertising and rail punctuality. I promise him that I will ensure that the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1609" name="Derek Twigg">my hon. Friend the Member for Halton (Derek Twigg)</phrase>, who is responsible for rail services, is given a note of what he said, and I will ask whether he can add anything to my comments today.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.1/7">We recognise that there are many challenges ahead, and that rural communities, particularly on islands, face very specific challenges. We believe, however, that there is a healthy future for rural transport of the island, given the Government's investment in local government settlements, in local transport plans and in the bus service, and given the partnership achieved by the Isle of Wight authority. I assure the hon. Gentleman that officials in my Department want to continue to work with the local authority to ensure that we make the best possible use of the opportunities available to us.</p>

	<p pid="a.422.1/1">I am absolutely delighted to have secured the debate because the issue that I am about to discuss is causing great consternation in four villages in my constituency. Under an initiative that it has called &quot;Transforming learning communities&quot;, Cheshire county council has introduced a document on which it will base its attempt to tackle what it describes as falling rolls and surplus school places. Several people in the villages of my constituency believe that, rather than transforming learning communities, the title of the document is a sort of euphemism and that the council will close at least two, or possibly three, schools in my constituency. That is why they are very concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/2">The council decided on the basis of population projections and birth rates that it will have a surplus of some 5,000 school places by 2010. It decided on a piecemeal approach to dealing with the problem and has divided the county into eight different areas, three of which it will visit this year, a few of which it will visit next year, and a few the year after.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/3">The first tranche of the review deals with the area that it has called Frodsham and Helsby, which contains Manley village school, Kingsley St. Johns and Norley Church of England school, as well as a primary school. The review also covers Frodsham technology college, which it recommends for closure because it has only 700 pupils, at least 400 of whom are from outside the county council area. Most of them, in fact, come from the Runcorn part of my constituency, which also causes me some concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/4">I do not believe that the county council has thought through the implications of closing Frodsham technology college for the other parts of Cheshire, particularly for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1569" name="Andrew Miller">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller)</phrase>. Young people from the village of Elton in that constituency will be very much affected by the closure, and may be forced to go to a school other than Helsby high school for their secondary education.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/5">The first tranche of the review suggests that Alvanley primary school merges&mdash;the council uses the word &quot;amalgamate&quot;&mdash;with Manley primary school, and that Kingsley St. Johns and Norley Church of England school should amalgamate. That could result in the closure of all four schools and the opening of two new schools on sites yet to be determined, or it could result in two of the schools closing and the two other schools amalgamating on one of the sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/6">Whatever happens, village schools in my constituency will close. When we pressed the county council on the matter, its first argument was that it had to tackle falling school rolls and surplus places. The four primary schools, however, are full. They have a buoyant intake, they do not face the prospect of falling school rolls and they provide an excellent education for the pupils in their care. The role that they play in their communities is equally important. They are vital to the infrastructure of their communities, and closure of any one of them would be irrevocable.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/7">The first thing that I asked the county council was that this was the first tranche of the review and it did not know what would happen in the other schools in the county, so why the piecemeal approach? It said that it would review the area again in 2008, so not only do we face a traumatic review in 2005, but three years down the track, when the county council has found out the implications of its reorganisation, it will revisit the schools that stay open. I have told the county council that it should adopt a two-stage approach. It should review every primary school in the county and, when it has an idea of the changes it would like, go to the second stage of the process and carry out the statutory consultations required by law. That would give us a clear picture of the effect on the whole county, and we would not have to tell schools that they would be reviewed again. Everyone would see that the process was fair and transparent.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/8">There is a fear that the county council will do the first tranche of work and find out that the temperature out there is so hot that it needs to rethink its views, so that village schools in my constituency will close but a different attitude will be taken to reviewing the rest of the county. That would be unfair and unnecessary. I hope that the county council will consider that view, but I am not optimistic that it will do so when it makes its decisions tomorrow and on <phrase class="date" code="">19 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/9">When pressed on the matter of falling rolls and surplus school places the county council has used 2002 statistics. The statistics for 2003 show that the birth rate in the county council area of Cheshire is growing. The county council advised me in a letter that it accepts that the birth rate is increasing, but does not know whether it is a trend. Without waiting to establish whether there is a trend of an increasing birth rate the county council went through an exercise of removing surplus school places across the county. It readily acknowledges that Alvanley primary school, Manley village school and Kingsley St. John's and Norley Church of England primary schools are, all four of them, full. They turn parents away each year because they are popular village schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/10">The county council then deploys a different argument. When I first encountered it, I thought that it had carried out an assessment of the education in those four primary schools and come up with specific criticisms about what was happening. It said that the schools are small, with cross-age group classes, that they teach across the key stages, and that the head teachers all have a significant teaching commitment. Of course, that is true for those four schools, but it is not seen as a problem by Ofsted, which has inspected the schools and found them excellent.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/11">On digging below the surface, one finds that the criticism does not arise from observation of the four primary schools in my constituency. It is taken, lock stock and barrel, from a Government document called the toolkit for falling rolls, which mentions the three relevant characteristics as being found by Ofsted in schools with falling rolls; but that is not a criticism that can readily be levelled at the four schools in my constituency. In less strident language, the county council draws attention to its concerns that the four schools may not be able to deliver the national curriculum, and that they may have weak leadership and governance. Those three observations, of course, do not derive from direct observation of the schools, but are taken from the Government toolkit on falling rolls.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/12">The county council has always said that transforming learning communities is not about saving money. However, the document that it has produced, and of which I have a copy, makes it clear&mdash;and draws specific attention to the fact&mdash;that educating pupils in village schools is more expensive than educating pupils in urban areas. We all know that, but we also know that it should not be a barrier to pupils' attendance at their village school to get the excellent education that it provides. Those arguments have all been put to Cheshire county council, which has not taken cognisance of the strength of feeling in the villages.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/13">That leads me to a very important issue. If the schools do not have falling rolls and are not facing surplus school places in future, if they are full and buoyant and Ofsted has given them a good report, and if parents clearly want to send their children to those village schools, why does the county council propose to merge them? The county council has come up with a figure; it says that most primary schools should aspire to have 110 pupils, and the fact that those four schools have fallen below that figure is one reason put forward for their amalgamation.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/14">I would refer the county council to another important document produced by the Department for Education and Skills, entitled &quot;Schools organisation changes&quot; which is drawn up for decision makers. Paragraph 52 of that document is specific. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/15" class="indent">&quot;There is 'a presumption against the closure of rural schools.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/16">It goes on to say it does not mean that rural schools should never close, but it sets out strict criteria about what needs to be in place should a local authority propose closing a village school and the arguments that it should provide to the school organisation committee. It draws specific attention to transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/17">The parents of the children in my four rural schools can currently walk their children to school. If Alvanley or Manley schools were to close, it would mean a two-mile journey for the pupils. There is no public transport, so the parents will have no choice but to take them by car. The same applies to Kingsley St. John or Norley Church of England primary schools; if they were to close, transport would be a problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/18">I asked the county council whether, when making its initial proposals, it had taken account of the impact that closing any of those schools would have on the wider village communities. Quite straightforwardly, it said that it had not but that it would do so when it undertook formal, statutory consultation. Again, the county council is being remiss in not recognising the role that primary schools play in the life of the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/19">The document also talks about federation. All four schools have said that they would like to consider that option. I have to tell my right hon. Friend the Minister that the parents in Manley, Alvanley, Norley and Kingsley do not want federation. They all want their village schools to stay open. The governing bodies of the four schools have gone for federation because they think that it is the only way to save their schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/20">My view is that if there is a true consultation&mdash;one about transforming learning communities, improving education and sustaining rural communities&mdash;the status quo must be an option. I accept that the status quo is not an option for the entire county and that things will have to change. However, no case has been made for the amalgamation or federation of those four schools, or for the closure of two of them, or even all four. The parents are right. They should have the option of federation.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/21">The volume of opinion in the four villages&mdash;what people are saying in support of the four schools and in response to the county council's initial consultation&mdash;should give the council pause for thought. It should take stock and reconsider the issue. I would be reassured if, at its meeting tomorrow, the county council decided to consult properly; the decision would need to be confirmed by the executive committee on <phrase class="date" code="">19 December</phrase>. If it put all the options on the table&mdash;the status quo, amalgamation and confederation&mdash;it would go some way to addressing the villagers' fears.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/22">The county council has not given an educational reason why any of the four schools should be faced with the threat of closure. I hope that when my right hon. Friend replies to the debate, she will be able reassure me about Government policy, because when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> was shadow spokesman for education he wrote to one of my constituents and tried to blame the Labour Government for what is going on in Tory-controlled Cheshire county council.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/23">I have never wanted to make a political issue of all this. It is not one. It is about what we should do in the 21st century for primary school kids in my constituency. They should still be able to go to schools that serve their villages, and some of those schools have been doing just that for more than 120 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.425.2/1">My hon. Friend gets some awkward letters from me.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.2/2">Alvanley, one of the schools that he mentioned, is in the village where I live, and my wife is a member of the governing body, so I am accountable through that route as well. The project affects the whole of Cheshire. The county council has split the county into a number of sub-units and intends between now and the end of 2006 to complete its review. I have said from the outset, in respect of the parts of the review that impact on my constituency, including those that overlap with the constituency of my hon. Friend, that it is absurd that they should be dealt with in isolation. My hon. Friend suggested a two-stage approach. I do not think that any irrevocable decisions should be taken until the whole county has been reviewed. That would be illogical; we would create fixed borders between the sub-areas of the county, and if a decision were taken in, for example, Weaver Vale that affected Chester or Ellesmere Port and Neston, illogical decisions might be made in relation to schools that were close to the border because they had been dealt with in different blocks. There ought to be fuzzy borders, and a different approach will have to be adopted if that is to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.2/3">I concur with my hon. Friend in questioning the methodology. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will undertake to check whether the approach being adopted by Cheshire in respect of predicted population figures is sound&mdash;there are statisticians who would argue otherwise. In my constituency, the review has produced a bit of a curate's egg. There are some welcome parts and some that will cause serious problems, not because of the rural make-up that my hon. Friend described but because no explanation has been offered as to what will happen to schools such as Gorsthill and Mansefield, which have served the community well for a long time, Mansefield with an multiple learning disability unit. Gorsthill has a dangerous fast road.</p>

	<p pid="a.426.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. That raises a legitimate question against the proposals. There are major implications for the secondary sector. One of the proposals involves two centres for 11-to-14 year-olds and a 14-to-19 academy. That must be reinforced with very substantial sums from central Government. I have not been consulted about my views, either directly by the Government or indirectly through the county council. I hope that Members of Parliament will be engaged directly with the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/2">My final observation concerns a small school, Dunham Hill. It is a tiny little village school with a unique feature: over the years it has developed a specialist unit to provide education for the children of Travellers. It is unique. The current proposal is that the school should be closed and moved, lock stock and barrel, into Horns Mill in my hon. Friend's constituency. That might be perfectly logical in terms of numbers, because Dunham Hill does not meet the 100 criterion. However, one has to ask whether it makes sense in terms of broader social policy considerations, because it will jeopardise the effort that has been made over the last 10 to 15 years by successive county council administrations to integrate Travellers' children into mainstream education, which is now showing success in getting some youngsters into the secondary sector, will be jeopardised. I do not believe it is possible to pick up such a unit and physically move it, and I have concerns about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/3">I fully understand my hon. Friend's comments about rural schools, and, like him, I do not want to make this a political issue, but we find it a tad amusing to see signs popping up all around the county that say &quot;Save our schools&quot;&mdash;we must remind people that this is all about saving our schools from a Tory county council.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.1/4">The issue is complex; there must be change in some parts of the county, but I hope that the Minister will use her good offices to intervene to ensure that the changes that take place make sense in all the policy areas that my hon. Friend described, which have an impact on children in the communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.427.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1914" name="Mike Hall">my hon. Friend the Member for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall)</phrase> on securing the debate, from which it is evident that there is great interest among local people in Cheshire's transforming learning communities initiative, and particularly on the impact that it may have on primary and secondary school provision in my hon. Friend's constituency and in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1569" name="Andrew Miller">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller)</phrase>. My hon. Friends and other stakeholders in the local community should and will have an important role in considering the issues. It is good to see local MPs not only ably defending their constituencies but being willing to see the coherence of the plans throughout the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.0/2">Changes to school provision in a district are essentially matters for local decision, as the local authority has the statutory responsibility for planning school places and for proposing to close schools and open new ones. The local authority has a statutory duty to ensure that there are sufficient places and that high quality education is provided in a cost-effective way.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.0/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Weaver Vale rightly put great emphasis on the quality of the primary education that will be provided in his constituency, which must be at the heart of any proposals or changes made. The Department's five-year strategy for children and learners, which followed from our primary document &quot;Excellence and Enjoyment&mdash;A Strategy for Primary Schools&quot; sets out the success story of primary education, with many schools delivering high-quality education. Impressive strides in literacy and numeracy have been made in recent years, and teaching has improved in every curriculum in primary schools since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.0/4">My hon. Friend is right to say that overall primary standards in Frodsham and Helsby are good and broadly in line with the average for all Cheshire schools. In Cheshire as a whole, key stage 1 and 2 results are above the national average. No primary schools in Frodsham and Helsby have been identified as requiring special measures, having serious weaknesses or as under-achieving. The staff and governors at Alvanley, Manley, Kingsley St. John's and Norley primary schools are doing an excellent job in ensuring that the work continues for my hon. Friend's constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.0/5">Cheshire county council is reviewing primary and secondary school places in Frodsham and Helsby because of the surplus places that exist in both sectors. The county council has informed me it is undertaking public consultations on the proposals for schools in Frodsham and Helsby. It is important that the process allows for the consideration of alternative proposals put forward by local stakeholders with an interest in education. Clearly, both my hon. Friends are concerned about and involved in that. Hon. Members must be involved. We recently changed the guidance on schools organisation to ensure that local Members are fully engaged in decisions. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston that he will be consulted about any academy proposals in his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.0/6">Later this month, the Cheshire schools panel will consider the outcome of the consultations and will make recommendations to the executive of the council on which proposals to recommend for publication. The executive will then decide whether to authorise publication of statutory proposals setting out any planned changes. There will then be a formal process, which must be carried out, which I will outline in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.0/7">My hon. Friend the Member for Weaver Vale concentrated particularly on the possible amalgamations involving his four primary schools. He outlined the need to ensure that the proposal to close the secondary school in his constituency is dovetailed with proposals for other changes and that considerations of the knock-on effect of any closure on where young people and families will receive their secondary education is important. In the Government's view, any changes to school organisation should focus on boosting standards and opportunities for young people while matching school place supply as closely as possible to pupil and parental needs and wishes.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.0/8">The Education Act 1996 places a duty on each local education authority to ensure that sufficient school places exist to meet the needs of the local population in order to promote high standards of attainment for all pupils. If an authority decides to reorganise provision, decisions will not be taken by Ministers but will be decided locally, as Cheshire county council is starting to do. As I indicated, the proposals are at public consultation and have not yet moved into the statutory phase. All interested parties must be consulted before proposals are published by the authority, provided with sufficient information and allowed adequate time in which to respond. If there is a decision to proceed with closure proposals for individual schools, formal notices must be published in a local newspaper, posted at the main entrances of the schools named in the proposals and placed locally in another conspicuous place. There is then a six-week period in which people can submit representations in support of or against the proposals, except in the case of a school in special measures, when case the period is one month, although that clearly is not the case in my hon. Friend's constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.0/9">If the authority publishes the proposals and there are no objections, it may proceed and implement them. In all other cases, such as those for which objections are received and those concerning voluntary-aided schools, the proposals are referred to the school organisation committee, which is made up of five or six groups, each representing major stakeholders in the provision of education, including the diocesan bodies. Each group has one vote and must consider all evidence in line with the guidance issued by the Secretary of State before reaching a decision. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the case is referred to the independent schools adjudicator for final decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.0/10">Guidance for those publishing and deciding proposals for changes to local school organisation makes it clear that the Government are committed to greater personalisation and choice, with learners and parents at centre-stage, but that must be set in the context of raising standards.</p>
