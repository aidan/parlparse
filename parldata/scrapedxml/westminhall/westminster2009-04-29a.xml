<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-29a.292.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1845" speakername="Lynda Waltho" colnum="292"  time="014:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090429/halltext/90429h0006.htm#09042944000492">
	<p pid="a.292.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1969" name="Russell Brown">the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown)</phrase> on securing this debate. I should like to talk about a man for whom I have a great deal of admiration. He has already been mentioned. His name is Frank Foley, but some refer to him as the &quot;British Schindler&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/2">Frank was remarkable. We in Stourbridge like to think of him as a son of Stourbridge&mdash;he retired there&mdash;but he was born in Somerset. He has been a source of great pride and inspiration. When I was a teacher, I used to talk about Frank Foley and his deeds. It is an inspiration when we hear about ordinary people doing extraordinary things, particularly to young people. I used to walk children down the street where he lived&mdash;we do not even have a plaque there, but there is one in the local park&mdash;and they saw that he lived in an ordinary house in an ordinary street in an ordinary town called Stourbridge. That is a powerful image for young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/3">Frank was born in Somerset in 1884. He was recruited as a spy, and following stints in France and Cologne, he was posted to Berlin, where he worked as a passport control officer. Of course, that was a cover for his main duties as head of the British Secret Intelligence Service station. During the '20s and '30s, he successfully recruited agents and acquired key details of German military research and development, but it is primarily through his work as a passport control officer that he earned the nickname of the &quot;British Schindler&quot;. He saved tens of thousands of lives by providing papers to allow Jewish people to escape from Nazi Germany. He would bend the rules when he was stamping passports and visas to allow Jews to escape legally to Britain and Palestine. However, he went further, even going into internment camps to get Jews out, sheltering people in his own home and helping them to get forged passports.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/4">Frank also used his hiding place to brief foreign journalists. That was particularly important, because it meant that more information came out about the increasing persecution of Jews in the Third Reich. He worked very long hours&mdash;from 7 o'clock in the morning to 10 o'clock at night without a break on most days&mdash;and personally handled as many applications as he could to keep the operation tight. He gave comfort and advice to those who were waiting for their applications to be processed. Even after the passport office closed in '39, he continued to help Jews to escape. In the first week of the war, the US embassy was using youth certificates that he had signed to send hundreds of Jewish children to Scandinavia, or to Palestine via Italy.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/5">Frank's actions were carried out at great personal danger. He had no diplomatic immunity and he could have been arrested at any time. He received no financial rewards for his actions. He risked his life every day simply because he believed it was the right and moral thing to do. After the war, he was involved in hunting ex-SS members and ran a network of double agents called the double cross system. At the 1961 trial of Nazi colonel Adolf Eichmann, who is sometimes referred to as the architect of the holocaust, Foley was described as the &quot;Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; for the way in which he risked his own life to save others&mdash;he was very difficult to pin down.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/6">In '49, Frank retired to Stourbridge, where he remained until his death. His bravery has been recognised in various ways but, unfortunately, not until after his death. Furthermore, many of the thousands of Jews who were helped to safety by forged visas that he supplied do not know his name&mdash;when they arrived in Palestine with visas that they knew they ought not to have, it is hardly surprising that they kept their heads down. It is only in recent years that the true extent of his bravery and the huge number of people that he rescued has begun to come to light.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/7">In October 1999, Frank was given the status of righteous among the nations. Closer to home, we in Stourbridge have recognised him with a remembrance plaque in Mary Stevens park. A statue of him has been erected in Highbridge, where he was born&mdash;it was paid for by volunteer fundraisers&mdash;and there is a plaque that pays tribute to him at the British embassy in Berlin.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/8">I have started an annual Frank Foley lecture in my constituency with my colleague, the Minister for the West Midlands, which brings people together to remember Mr. Foley and to hear talks from experts. This year, we welcomed Michael Smith, who has written a book about him and who has carried out much of the original research into his life. We also heard from Ziggy Shipper, who is a holocaust survivor. He spoke movingly about his experience. The lecture is an important way to commemorate locally those who died in the holocaust and to let more people know about the stories of incredible people such as Frank Foley. The most gratifying thing was that many young people were there, some of whom had benefited from Government funding for the Holocaust Educational Trust's excellent programme of visits to Auschwitz. I, too, have been privileged to make that trip.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/9">This time last year, I tabled an early-day motion that called for the current statutes governing the honours system to be changed, to allow a posthumous knighthood to be awarded to Frank Foley and other rescuers of the holocaust. It received 111 signatures, which shows the strength of feeling on the issue and the cross-party support for such a move. The Cabinet Office has a list of criteria for individuals to be considered for honours, particularly civilian honours. I think that Frank Foley fulfils many of them. He carried the respect of his peers, improved the lot of those less able to help themselves and displayed moral courage and vision in making and delivering tough choices time and again.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/10">I appreciate that membership of the Order of Chivalry ceases on death, but it was impossible to recognise Frank Foley's acts while he was alive because he was bound by the Official Secrets Act, which prevented him from telling anyone about his work in Berlin and the tens of thousands of people he saved. To put it simply, very few people knew about his extraordinary bravery until it was too late to thank him. I ask the Minister to make a special exemption in this case and to recognise an incredible man who asked for no reward during his lifetime, but who none the less deserves the highest award that we can bestow on him.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/11">One of the things that I find so amazing about Frank Foley's story is that after his time in Germany, where he accomplished extraordinary things and saved so many lives, he retired to live an ordinary life in an ordinary house in Stourbridge. It goes to show that extraordinary deeds can be accomplished by ordinary people, which is truly inspirational. It is a vital learning experience, particularly for youngsters. I urge the Minister to change the honours system, so that heroes such as Frank Foley can be given the recognition of an honour. It is the least that they deserve.</p>
