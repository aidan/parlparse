<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-20a.1.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" speakername="Matthew Taylor" colnum="1"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070220/halltext/70220h0001.htm#07022049000460">
	<p pid="a.1.3/1">We will try to warm things up during the course of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/2">I am pleased to have the opportunity to secure this debate. The issue has raised considerable concern among Cornwall's MPs as a team; that can be judged by the turnout from Cornwall today. The out-of-hours service was run by a GP-led service, KernowDoc, for nine years. It was set up as a local, non-profit-making operation and it was successful. Since April 2006, however, it has been transformed into Kernow Urgent Care Services, a branch of the US-owned company, Serco, following a contracting process that the Government require to take place. The three-year contract is worth &pound;16.5 million and the company won the bid on a promise to deliver a service as good as, if not better than, before, but for a much lower cost&mdash;a saving of several million pounds, we are told.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/3">During the contracting process, all the MPs in Cornwall expressed doubt that as good a service could be delivered for that much less. I guess that our theme was, &quot;If it ain't broke, why fix it?&quot; However, Serco and the primary care trust insisted that it could be done, and now we have the result. Serco has failed month after month since taking over the service. Formal complaints, which Serco referred to in its briefings, have risen from four per month to as many as 27 in a month, but those formal complaints are the tip of the iceberg. I do not recall receiving a complaint about KernowDoc for years, but now it is a major part of my casework. GPs say that they have lost confidence in it. The ambulance service complains that people are resorting to the already overstretched 999 blue-light service because they do not trust the service provided by Serco.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/4">From the evidence of my own constituents, those of my colleagues, and indeed the PCT's media statements, it is clear that KUCS as it has been operating is unfit for purpose, and as a result patients are potentially at risk. Last month, the PCT announced that it would carry out a review early in April and that it was seeking a response from Serco to its requests to put the service right. I have never in 20 years felt the need to resort to a parliamentary debate to tackle problems in such a local service. I have challenged the Government on their policy, but I have never felt that the inadequacy of the responses received merited taking the matter to the level of a parliamentary debate. I have been enraged, frankly, by Serco's poor service, which has been made worse by its unwillingness to respond to the complaints that I have made on behalf of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/5">The constituents' concerns that I have raised have been met with as poor a response as the service itself provides. I have had to fight to get any reply at all. KUCS then hid behind the barrier of patient confidentiality, even when I wrote to raise concern that the phone system was not working, meaning that people could not get through. I am not sure how patient confidentiality could be the justification for not replying to me. Even when I sent a copy of the regulations showing that patient confidentiality did not apply to MPs' queries of this sort, I could not get a response.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/6">I have to say that it was not much use taking the matter up with the Minister either. The Minister wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-05">5 February</phrase>, referring me back to the PCT. I would not have written to the Minister if I were happy with the response from the PCT. Only this debate has had any real effect. Indeed, it has already had a wondrous effect. Last week Serco and the PCT insisted on meeting me. Now the matter has hit Parliament, Serco genuinely appears to realise that it has a problem and that it has to act. I received a promise of proper responses to MPs' concerns, a promise of big changes to improve the service and a promise that it accepts that it has to get it right, even if its original costings were wrong. Bluntly, we aim to hold it to those promises, but I cannot say that I have great confidence that it will deliver.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/7">I believe that there is an element of ministerial responsibility involved, and I am calling on the Government to ensure that KUCS delivers on its promises should it retain the contract. They must also review the contracting process to redraw lines of accountability and ensure that private contractors charged with public service delivery, which the Government want to come into the NHS, cannot renege on their promises or underbid and then fail to provide an effective service. There must be an effective process of judging whether bids are deliverable for the price cited, and of holding those involved more quickly to account than has happened in this case. I shall return to those requests to the Minister after giving a rather more detailed outline of the abysmal record of the service so far.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/8">First, I shall consider patient care, which is the primary issue. Frequently, Serco has not complied with, or only partially complied with the national quality requirements for out-of-hours service, or its own contractual obligations. Clearly, the most essential element of effective out-of-hours services is answering the call in the first place, but that has not been happening. For example, a Miss K from Redruth, who spoke very coherently in an interview on BBC Radio Cornwall earlier today, became sick a few days after returning home from an operation. She tried to call KUCS repeatedly, but could not get through. Eventually, an ambulance took her to Treliske with full-blown, life-threatening septicaemia. According to the doctors who treated her, 30 minutes later could have been too late.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/9">Another patient who wrote to me called KUCS three times. None of the calls were answered in five minutes, so eventually they were transferred via NHS Direct. When the patient did get through, they waited over five hours for a doctor to see them. Those problems were meant to have been sorted after the awful track record of the service during the summer. In September, the PCT intervened, and in October, Serco promised that it would sort out the problem. However, over Christmas, almost one in five calls, according to Serco's own figures, were abandoned. The accepted standard is no more than 5 per cent., and that rate of abandoned calls amounts to 2,500 calls in a month. KUCS has given high call volumes as its excuse, but the increase in demand over Christmas, when doctors' surgeries are closed, is entirely predictable, and it is exactly the same excuse that Serco gave for poor performance during the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/10">The second essential element is correct triage when someone does get through. On the basis of the phone call, the right response should be given, whether that is reassurance that a problem can wait for a regular GP appointment, being seen by a doctor at an out-of-hours clinic or at home, or reference to the 999 service. According to the PCT, last summer, up to 40 per cent. of calls were not triaged by an appropriate professional. Some might be concerned about that, because people have found it difficult to understand by whom they are being triaged. The increasing use of emergency care practitioners is often confusing, and people are often under the impression that they are being triaged by a doctor. Serco has accepted that it has not made that clear, and that it needs to put it right. It has admitted that there is a problem, as the PCT has spelt out. I hope that it will be put right, and it is worth bearing in mind that firm oversight by qualified doctors should be part of the process. At least on those occasions, however, there was some response&mdash;the telephone was picked up.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/11">The third essential element, once a patient is triaged, is that of response times when patients are assessed as needing urgent treatment At points last year, roughly half the total number of emergency callers were not seen at a clinic within an hour of contacting KUCS. The national quality requirements say that it should be 95 per cent. At points, more than 40 per cent. of emergency callers requiring home treatment were not receiving it within an hour of contacting KUCS. Again, national quality requirements say that the figure should be 95 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/12">Indeed, the briefing that Serco has provided shows just how bad the situation was. For example, the standard for calls abandoned is no more than 5 per cent., but in December the figure was more than 18 per cent. The rate for urgent clinical assessments within 20 minutes should be 95 per cent., but Serco fell short, while for non-urgent clinical assessments within 60 minutes it fell short by almost 20 per cent. For emergency clinic visits completed within 60 minutes, Serco fell short by almost 30 per cent., and on urgent visits completed within 120 minutes it fell short of the Government's target by 16.5 per cent. Those appalling records are repeated in many other months. For example, for emergencies completed within 60 minutes on clinic visits, the rate was only 54 per cent. in September, 79 per cent. in October, 80 per cent. in November and 70 per cent. in December, as against the national target of 95 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/13">A mother wrote to me, hugely angry about the treatment of her four-year-old son, who had shown signs of having a temperature. NHS Direct told his mother to ring the out-of-hours service if it hit 39&deg; C. She did so and an appointment was made. However, the agency doctor she saw told her that it was not unusual for a child's temperature to go as high as 41&deg; C, and advised her to give him Calpol. According to the mother, the doctor did not notice while saying so that the child had slipped into febrile convulsions, slumped in a chair and was staring into mid-air. Apparently, even after she pointed that out, the doctor just sat there, as she lifted the boy up to prevent him from swallowing his tongue. The convulsions worsened and the mother screamed for an ambulance, while the doctor did nothing. Eventually an ambulance was called and the patient was treated, but not before a highly traumatic and potentially serious scene had unfolded.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/14">Another constituent, Ms E, was rendered incoherent and immobile by a severe asthma attack. She was triaged and told to go to Falmouth for treatment, where she would immediately be put on a nebuliser. In fact, she was not given that treatment; she was given an unfamiliar treatment by a doctor who, she says, had little command of English. Ms E went home confused and still unwell, and so called back, only to discover that the treatment that she had been given would not take effect for six hours. Another appointment was made, this time with a different doctor, also handicapped by poor English. She was finally put on a nebuliser, but only because of the intervention of the receptionist, who happened to be a trained nurse, as the doctor did not know how to use it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/15">Mr. and Mrs. T were gobsmacked when their daughter was seen by another overseas agency doctor who not only found it difficult to understand her&mdash;this has been an issue with the overseas doctors employed&mdash;but relied on an electronic word converter to communicate with the patient. He was also unable to communicate with other doctors. When the patient was eventually referred to Wheal Agar ward, it was discovered that the doctor had not provided her with the letter that she needed to present to nursing staff for any treatment to proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/16">I know that one or two regularly used agency doctors are good. However, I am talking about some of the temporary agency doctors who are called at short notice and for short periods, who do not know the best routes when out on multiple visits and as a result waste time and resources. Finally, patients have been let down at the final stages of care. More than 10 per cent. of patients do not have their details passed on to the GP by the start of the next working day, as is the standard. Patients have also been advised on numerous occasions that prescriptions have been faxed to their local pharmacy, only to find that the information has not been forwarded as promised.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/17">The high complaint volumes are unsurprising, but they are only the tip of the iceberg. To add insult to injury, when constituents come to me or other MPs with complaints, we do not receive a response; or, if we receive any response at all, we are told that the issue is a matter of patient confidentiality. The patient might be replied to directly, but we have no way of judging whether that reply is adequate. As I have said, I have raised issues that bear no relation to patient confidentiality, such as why it was not possible to receive an answer on the phone, but I was still told that patient confidentiality applied. Serco has assured me that that will no longer happen, as there are new routes of contact and new staff, but it should never have happened in the first place. That raises the question whether it is effective to use private contractors if they do not believe in proper lines of accountability through the elected representatives of the patients whom they are treating so badly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/18">When Serco saw me last week, it finally admitted all those errors. Serco sees them as part of a learning curve, but the question for the Minister is whether it is remotely defensible that the Government's drive to use the private sector in the NHS should subject patients to, and put them at risk from, such an appalling learning curve. Serco also acknowledges morale problems among its staff and local GPs, and that it needs to sort that out. It certainly does, judging by the level of concern that has been expressed to me. Since this debate was called, my office has been inundated with calls from GPs and patients keen to add their problems to the list. GPs are particularly concerned that Serco has only recently dispensed with doctor standby altogether, so that if the service comes under pressure, there are no doctors ready to supplement the service. Doctors say that phones go unanswered. Clinics stay closed&mdash;sometimes those that are meant to be open&mdash;resulting in long journeys for some patients. That is another problem that Serco has acknowledged, but which we are yet to see put right.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/19">Staff have also complained of being deprived of proper breaks and coming under a lot of pressure. That is true. Many of the staff who transferred to KUCS were from KernowDoc and were loyal to it. Surely one of the first priorities for any company taking it over should be to build the morale of staff, not to leave them jaded and disfranchised. The heavy reliance on agency doctors is partly the result of GPs refusing to work for KUCS. I understand that the situation is improving, but I should like to know how and what is being done.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/20">KernowDoc thrived on good will and flexibility, as an organisation that the doctors had set up themselves. By definition, that was not likely to happen in the same way with Serco, but those considerations appear to have been ignored in the contracting process. GPs used to stay late. They wanted to provide a high level of service, because the service itself was theirs. They communicated for the sake of patients, sharing information and giving advice. They had trust in each other's professionalism and support. That flexibility, communication and support has gone. Many of the GPs who have contacted me describe Serco as bullish in its managerial style, which has discouraged co-operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/21">By definition, the agency GPs do a job and clock out, which is what I understand the management have encouraged. That is fine in an office environment, but not appropriate in health care. Many GPs have described the framework as difficult or even dangerous. Indeed, one GP complained prominently in the press that her prioritisation of patient need had been overturned by non-medically qualified administrative staff working for Serco, who simply wanted GPs to get on to the next patient in order to meet the patient call-out times, rather than deal with what the GPs regarded as a dangerous position for the patient.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/22">The ordinary staff working for Serco&mdash;the people answering the calls, the nursing staff and others&mdash;have similarly complained. Unison, the patient watchdog and the paramedics' union, have all complained about Serco's treatment of staff. They have complained about the number of staff who were made redundant immediately after transfer, which was 35 out of 122, that staff were forced to lodge employment tribunal claims to get the correct redundancy payments, that Serco failed to award an expected pay rise in April 2006 and that when it was granted in September, it was lower than the NHS rise and not backdated. Staff describe themselves as demoralised by petty cutbacks, such as no free tea and coffee, no Christmas party and other such elements. Again, Serco has admitted to me that it has a lot of work to do with its staff. Too right it has, judging from the responses that I have received.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/23">Corners have been cut in an area where geography and scattered rural populations mean that out-of-hours health care is necessarily more expensive. My MP colleagues and I were sceptical when KUCS won the contract; it seemed unlikely that the service could be offered so cheaply. We were right to be worried. The fact that changes have been made&mdash;the recruitment of a lead nurse, an operational manager and a medical director&mdash;highlights how badly thought through the bid was in the first place. The Minister has to reflect on how it was possible for a contract to be accepted on those terms, given that the basic situation in respect of the lead nurse, operational manager and medical director was not right in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/24">What now? The primary need is for patients to have a robust, reliable and quality out-of-hours service, whoever supplies it. They had that before, but do not have it now. The PCTs were told that they had to go through the process of tendering because KernowDoc was too expensive. They switched to a cut-price service, but&mdash;as they were warned&mdash;it has proved to be cut-rate. The PCT says that it is reviewing the contract. However, I am not going to call for an immediate change because the disruption of yet another contracting process, in which under Government rules there is no guarantee that yet another private company will not trial a service that it clearly does not know how to offer, will not necessarily result in the best outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/25">My first demand is that Serco should be made to put in place the quality of service that it is contractually obliged to, and that that should happen fast. It is clear that Serco is now embarrassed and that it knows that it needs to put the situation right, but it needs to be held to that. When its representatives spoke to me, they talked about needing three to six months to put the situation right; frankly, patients calling the service do not want to wait three or six months. That would involve Serco having run the service inadequately for a year of its three-year contract. It must be held to that now. The Minister needs to reflect on the accountability of such private services. Patient and GP complaints and a parliamentary debate should not be required to persuade Serco to offer an adequate service. The Government have a role as guarantor of adequate health care in the NHS, and they must have a role in holding KUCS to its commitments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/26">The debacle is also an indication that the Government need to review the contracting process throughout the NHS for such private services, in respect of how they are originally offered, of the risks of cut-price bids that do not deliver the quality needed and, when things go wrong, of the speed of reaction in putting them right.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/27">The Minister has a role to play for Cornwall in sorting the problem out now and for the nation in making sure that the use of private services does not make such problems occur in other places at other times; it is the one service offered by the country that is most important to every individual. When a person's health or life are threatened, or when their child's health is threatened, they need to rely on the NHS to give an adequate, professional and rapid response. I hope that the Minister will reflect that, when I raised the lack of response to the situation, it was not the right course of action to write me a letter referring me back to the local level.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-20a.7.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1514" speakername="Colin Breed" colnum="7"  time="009:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070220/halltext/70220h0001.htm#07022049000461">
	<p pid="a.7.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> on securing this important debate. It is welcomed not only by his colleagues but by doctors and all the residents of Cornwall who have been exasperated at what has been happening in the past few months to a most important service. It should be remembered that we are talking about emergency services. When people access them, it is necessarily at a time of stress and strain and in an emergency, and they expect a response that recognises that emergency. However, we have a failure of a system that should work and was working extremely well.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/2">We have all had complaints from patients, community groups, the ambulance service, doctors, doctors' receptionists and even the staff of Serco themselves. Very few groups in Cornwall have not complained to us at some stage in the past year or so. Confidence in an important system has now been lost. People are beginning to wonder whether, if they call out of hours, they will get any service at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/3">It is fair for us to recognise that when a system is changed, a period of changeover and preparation for that change will be needed, particularly for an emergency service. Nevertheless, there will always be some sort of learning curve. We accepted that, but the period needed to be short and clear so that the service could maintain its momentum and quality. Far from that being the case, we have seen a decline during the changeover period, and things have got worse and worse during the Serco contract. Last Christmas, that culminated in an absolute debacle: Serco said that it could not answer the phones because of a staff shortage due to illness. People ringing up for emergency services were not likely to accept that excuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/4">It seems that Serco has followed its usual practices&mdash;it has a track record in other areas. It bids for Government business, promising much and to do it for much less. When everything goes wrong, it toughs it out and tries to make excuses. It then tries to make such improvements as are minimally necessary to maintain its profitability at the minimum quality of service that might just get it through its contracts. Frankly, that is totally unacceptable, particularly for an emergency service.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/5">It is time to expose those practices. Surely the Government, who have worked with Serco for a long time, have recognised the trait that I have mentioned. As my hon. Friend the Member for Truro andSt. Austell said, Serco needs to live up to its promises and be exposed to real financial penalties if it fails to do so. If improvement is not forthcoming, it needs to be clear that it will lose the contract. Only through such a profitability motive might it begin to understand that it has to live up to its promises.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/6">The Government profess to want value for money, when in this context all they are interested in is cutting costs. We had a good, reliable and robust service that had the confidence of doctors and patients. It was professional, caused no one to complain to us and was run on a no-profit basis. For us, that was value for money and seemed to deliver all that we wanted at a cost that did not produce a profit. We now have a service that still demands millions of pounds, but the money goes to a profit-motivated commercial organisation providing an appalling service. I fail to understand how that gives us value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/7">In their wisdom, the Government decided that they wanted a change, and they arranged the process of change. They helped to pick the winner of the contract. The disastrous result is their fault and it is up to them to fix it, and quickly. Unless they do, lives will be lost.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-20a.8.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" speakername="Julia Goldsworthy" colnum="8"  time="009:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070220/halltext/70220h0002.htm#07022049000462">
	<p pid="a.8.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> on securing this debate. Every single MP with a constituency in Cornwall has been inundated with correspondence on the issue since what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1514" name="Colin Breed">the Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed)</phrase> described as the &quot;debacle&quot; at Christmas when so many people found it impossible to get through on the telephone and to access the services that they needed in an emergency.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/2">I should like to expand on the background to the award of the contract. Let us not forget that it was awarded in the midst of the reconfiguration of primary care trusts in Cornwall. The concern is that a lot of attention was being focused on what the new PCT would look like and how it would manage the fact that some existing trusts were in deficit and others were in balance. In the context of that massive disruption and uncertainty about the future, the main motive was to find the cheapest possible service. That, not cost-effectiveness, was dictating what it was looking for.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/3">We all accept that KernowDoc did not provide a cheap service. One general practitioner described it as a Rolls Royce out-of-hours service. The company recognised that Cornwall is geographically isolated, that it cannot pull in resources from other areas because it is a peninsula, and that, in the main, it is sparsely populated. It recognised that those aspects had to be reflected in where services were provided. We now have a contract that focuses services in a small number of areas, which makes it difficult for many people to access out-of-hours services. Even if they were able to get in a car and travel to such services, they would still have to make a significant journey.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/4">That draws us back to the point that all of us in Cornwall have been making for a long time about whether the county gets the funding that it needs to provide services. Unfortunately, it does not, and that was once again reflected in the decision on the Serco contract, which has resulted in a poorer service for everybody in Cornwall.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/5">In the summer, we were told that the appalling response rates were due to teething problems under the new contract, and that they would be resolved in a few months. The problems were not isolated to out-of-hours care. They had massive knock-on effects on other emergency services. Ambulances queued for up to five hours outside accident and emergency at Royal Cornwall hospital in Treliske, which meant not only that that hospital was at full stretch but that the ambulances were not on the road trying to cover the massive geographical area. It also meant that the Cornwall air ambulance, which is charitably funded and which extends emergency cover across Cornwall, had to do things such as nursing home transfers because there was not a single ambulance available to do that. We cannot consider the problems in isolation&mdash;they have important knock-on effects on other services.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/6">When the issue came up again at Christmas, the concern was that the difficulties were not due to teething problems but to a complete inability to deal with Cornwall's entirely predictable seasonal fluctuations. For instance, we know that Cornwall's population doubles in the summer, which has important implications for demands on the service. Moreover, the fact that the county's main arterial roads are often entirely blocked for large parts of the day affects people's ability to access the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/7">It is very difficult to get information from Serco. The repeat of the problems at Christmas prompted my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" name="Daniel Rogerson">the Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson)</phrase> and me to undertake a survey of GPs and ask for details of their experiences, and I understand that some of the material that has been used today was accessible only after a freedom of information request from the PCT.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/8">The survey has resulted in a mass of correspondence from constituents and GPs keen to relate their experiences. I shall start off with some people's personal experiences, beginning with those of my sister, who developed an allergic reaction on Christmas day and started having breathing difficulties. We do not know the cause, but she has experienced similar allergic reactions in the past and, on this occasion, was struggling to breathe. Fortunately for her, we live near the most densely populated part of Cornwall, and someone in the household was able to drive a car. Although we had to wait on the telephone before we got hold of someone, we were eventually told that, if we could get her to a doctor, she could be seen. Because we had a car, we were able to get to a doctor and a pharmacy to access the services that we needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/9">Unfortunately, that is not the case for many people. My hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall is not here, but he has said on many occasions that people in Bude, on the northern-most tip of Cornwall, have been told that the only way that they could access services was by getting to Pool. For people with a car, that is an hour's drive on a good day. I would not even attempt to make that journey on public transport, because I am not sure that I would ever get there.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/10">Another constituent&mdash;a terminally ill patient&mdash;rang the out-of-hours service over Christmas for pain relief. He was dying, and he wanted to die at home. Despite his wish, he was told that he would have to dial 999 because that was the only way he would get an injection&mdash;an injection that could be provided at home. The out-of-hours service did not have the capacity to help that person die with the dignity that he wanted.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/11">Another constituent, Mrs. H, wrote on behalf of her mother-in-law who is 85 and who was unwell on new year's eve. When she phoned at 11 o'clock in the morning, she was put on hold. Her daughter-in-law got through to the operator at 2 o'clock that afternoon. She explained the difficulty and was told that it would be about three hours before a GP arrived&mdash;that is, six hours after the first call at 11 o'clock. At 5 o'clock, they received a call from a doctor asking what the problem was. The daughter-in-law said, &quot;I thought that you would be calling,&quot; but he said, &quot;No, I am just triaging the call.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/12">At that point, the daughter-in-law got in a bit of a strop. She was told that the call would be put through as urgent, which meant another wait of three hours, or that they could contact the paramedics. That is what was happening: people were experiencing that kind of wait, then massive additional pressure was put on the paramedic service.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/13">When the daughter-in-law rang again to find out why the call had not been dealt with at the time, she was again kept on hold. There were only five cars on call in Cornwall that day. It is clear that the out-of-hours service was totally unable to deal with demand that it should have been able to predict.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/14">The surveys have gone out in the constituencies of Falmouth and Camborne, and North Cornwall, and they are still coming back. The forms went out in the past two weeks, but already we have had a response rate of more than 50 per cent. Ninety per cent. of GPs believe that the quality of the out-of-hours service has become worse since Serco took over in April last year, and 80 per cent. said that they have received more complaints since that date.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/15">One of the most worrying statistics is that 95 per cent. of GPs worked for the out-of-hours service when it was run by KernowDoc, but only 15 per cent. of those surveyed continue to do so. We are trying to meet the demand for services from elsewhere, and there are all kinds of horror stories. I heard one anecdote of a doctor from somewhere else in Europe&mdash;Germany, I believe&mdash;who paid for a holiday in the south-west for himself and his family by providing cover for one day. What impact does that have on continuity of care? Other examples involve doctors prescribing antibiotics that are not usually prescribed in the UK, resulting in a massive run on the particular brand to the point that the pharmacies ran out completely and were then at a loss as to what they were supposed to be providing.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/16">I appreciate that self-interest will be reflected in GPs' comments, but they show that GPs and their patients are worryingly lacking in confidence. One doctor said that patients now receive a less personal service, and that morale among staff working for the urgent care services has plummeted.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/17">As my hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell said, in the past a huge amount was done on the basis of good will. Then, the huge fluctuations in demand were dealt with out of good will, but now it appears that they are not dealt with at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/18">Doctors also cite the increased use of the nurse triage system as a cause for concern. I understand that that is national best practice, so perhaps the Minister will comment on whether similar reports are coming back from other urgent care providers about the adequacy of nurse triaging. As has been said, fewer cars and clinics are available at any one time. People are having to travel further, and in Cornwall the logistics of that make things very difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/19">It is clear and undeniable that there are problems with the out-of-hours service. They cannot be considered in isolation, as they have knock-on effects on the ambulance service, emergency care practitioners and accident and emergency provision. As I said before, the issue brings us back to the fundamental question, which has not been adequately answered, of whether the county gets the resources that it needs to deliver essential services. We can undertake a strategic review in the county but, ultimately, the service was taken on because it came at a lower price. We are getting a lower level of service as a result, and that is very much a concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/20">I want assurances from the Minister&mdash;reiterating those asked for by my hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell&mdash;that the tendering process will be improved, so that there will be real understanding about whether the bottom line of the tendering process will mean that services will be delivered to meet the need in the area. Will Ministers reconsider the funding levels?</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/21">We do not want the removal of Serco: what we want is a level of service that meets people's needs. Ultimately, and unfortunately, we have reached a point where we need ministerial assurances to ensure that that is delivered. Serco has no democratic accountability, and neither does the PCT. We want assurances from a source with genuine accountability, and that means that the matter rests on the Minister's desk.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-20a.11.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="11"  time="010:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070220/halltext/70220h0002.htm#07022049000463">
	<p pid="a.11.0/1">I join others in congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I concur with his remarks and those of my hon. Friends the Members for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) and for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy).</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/2">Since the service commenced in April last year, it has notably failed in comparison with its predecessor. It must be acknowledged that KernowDoc and those involved with it&mdash;the service that preceded the Kernow urgent care out-of-hours services&mdash;were more expensive, and perhaps more expensive than necessary. Efficiencies needed to be secured, and many of the GPs involved accepted that during the re-tendering process. The debate reflects the sour grapes of GPs who were engaged in organising the out-of-hours service at that stage and who feel badly about the service that is now in place. The complaints are coming from patients, not from GPs, and that is an important point.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/3">Many of us have been reflecting on the failure of the telephone system and of the service to respond to patient need during the Christmas period. In particular, there was a failure to respond to the needs of patients who were in difficulty, pain and distress over a period when GPs' surgeries were not running, and who did not want to take themselves off to clog up the local accident and emergency service in Treliske or the casualty service at West Cornwall hospital. It was interesting that just before the Christmas period, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-21">21 December</phrase>, because we had gone through the many concerns about the adequacy of the service, the primary care trust put out a press release anticipating the problem. Having discussed past failures of the Serco-run service, the trust stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/4" class="indent">&quot;The service has learned from&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/5">past</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/6" class="indent">&quot;experience and changed the contingency plans to make sure they respond quickly to changing or unexpected circumstances in future&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/7">The ink on that press release was hardly dry when the telephone service failed. Patients in desperate need were unable to get through, GPs supporting those patients were unable to get through and, when patients turned up unnecessarily at the casualty service in West Cornwall hospital in Penzance in my constituency and formed queues, the casualty service telephoned the out-of-hours service and it could not get through either. In the end, they all had to phone the ambulance service. That was the nature of the seriousness of the failure, immediately after a public reassurance that contingency plans were in place to cope with the Christmas pressures.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/8">I am concerned not only about the way in which the service is managed and its failure to meet its targets, as my hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell ably pointed out&mdash;Kernow Urgent Care Services are hitting or near to hitting few of the targets set out in the original contract&mdash;but about inside information that suggests that the PCT is not undertaking independent verification, and that the targets are monitored, and heavily massaged, by Serco. We have doubts that the service is performing even at the poor level reported in the targets, and we could get copies of those targets only by making freedom of information requests. The whole thing does not read well at all, as I am sure the Minister appreciates.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/9">We must consider the matter in the context of the ambulance service in Cornwall. We do not expect the quickest ambulance service because Cornwall is a long peninsula and difficult to cover for category A calls. Although we want a better service than we currently have, the out-of-hours GP service comes on top of a service that we already know to be overstretched. The South Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust has difficulty in providing both category A and B responses in a rural and remote area such as ours. The further west one goes, the poorer the response. Although the ambulance service is often slower than the target time for category A calls, at least people support the service and understand the pressures that it is under. If ambulances are being called out unnecessarily because the out-of-hours GP service is failing, and they travel all the way from the far west of my constituency up to Truro&mdash;a 40 mile journey&mdash;and queue up outside the accident and emergency service at Treliske, that will take up a lot of ambulance time. The problem is not only the failure of the out-of-hours GP services, but the knock-on effect on the health service, the urgent care service and the accident and emergency services.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-20a.13.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="13"  time="010:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070220/halltext/70220h0002.htm#07022049000465">
	<p pid="a.13.1/1">I agree entirely. The additional costs are lost in the service and add pressure on the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust, which is already under budget pressure because it failed last year to turn around the deficit from the previous year. The additional pressures do not help the trust to achieve a recurring balance, which is what it is attempting to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/2">We warned that there would be unnecessary journeys to accident and emergency and, possibly, unnecessary admissions. We argued, too, that we expected the use of less experienced doctors who did not know the patients or the area so well, which would mean more unnecessary emergency out-of-hours hospital admissions and put pressure on the trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/3">In January 2006, I received a letter from Brian Steggles, chairman of the faculty of pre-hospital care at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. On the subject of pre-hospital care and urgent GP care, he wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/4" class="indent">&quot;We have therefore developed considerable expertise in the setting of standards and training in this most important area of medicine and with this background have grave concerns about the quality of out-of-hours emergency care that may be provided by a commercial organisation both in Cornwall and indeed elsewhere throughout the United Kingdom. With recent involvement with one of the providers of offshore medicine and the use of eastern European doctors I would equally share concern if Serco should seek to use this type of cheap labour.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/5">The warning was made before fulfilment of the contract was entered into.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/6">We all have anecdotes. I have one from a GP, who referred to a patient and the treatment of that patient just before the Christmas period. He summarised the situation by saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/7" class="indent">&quot;It seems that the patient and family were lied to, that the patient was given an inappropriate prescription, that the patient suffered unnecessarily, and that an additional visit was required. All in all not a very professional service, particularly in view of the high standard of the initial triage.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/8">I have a letter from another constituent, whose name I will not give, who lives in the west of my constituency. He wrote to complain about the length of time that Kernow Urgent Care Services had taken to respond to a call. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/9" class="indent">&quot;I phoned at 20.30 on 2nd August 2006, explained my wife's condition (she has liver cancer) to the operator and that she was in extreme pain. The operator said my wife would be the first visit when the doctor came on at 22.00. However, the doctor did not arrive at our house until 23.40.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/10">Later, my constituent wrote to complain about the service, saying that he had other experiences of having to wait for more than three hours for Kernow Urgent Care Services to visit the patient. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-30">30 September</phrase>, he wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/11" class="indent">&quot;On the evening of 26th August I called Serco at 18.25 to advise my wife had passed away. The doctor did not arrive until more than 3 hours later.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/12">The situation is unacceptable. Prior to the commencement of the contract, we were given reassurances through press statements by primary care trusts. For example, the chief executive of the West Cornwall primary care trust, who largely led the negotiations, is quoted in a press release of <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-16">16 December 2005</phrase> as saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/13" class="indent">&quot;Serco Health has a very good track record in providing out of hours service in Cardiff and North Oxfordshire.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/14">At that stage, however, it did not have much experience, as the contracts had only just commenced. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.]</i> As my hon. Friends point out, those services were not carried out in such a rural area.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/15">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-27">27 February</phrase>, just before the contract was to be implemented, the out-of-hours project manager sent out a question and answer paper. Among many reassurances that we were given at that stage, we were told:</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/16" class="indent">&quot;The company will have three clinicians on stand-by, whom they will call upon when needs be. The stand-by doctors may be called in periods of extreme pressure, but also be called upon to see a single patient only.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/17">We have already heard about the effectiveness of their response to problems of extreme pressure.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/18">The problems have been amply expressed by my hon. Friends. GPs have told me of their problems with the service, with more patients being admitted to hospitals, fewer patients visited and some doctors having less experience. However, we also have a major opportunity. Under practice-based commissioning, many GPs say that if it were not for the contract they could negotiate a wrap-around service. The Government have the opportunity to intervene and to help local communities. It has always been my view that public service for private profit will not work, especially not with emergency care. Public service is not best run if it is compromised by having to produce shareholder dividends.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/19">I finish with a question. Given that Serco is failing to meet its targets, what provision is there for the PCT either to renegotiate the contract or to withdraw from it to find better ways, through public service and with public servants, to provide the more than adequate out-of-hours service from GPs that I know our local communities are crying out for?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-20a.16.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" speakername="Tim Loughton" colnum="16"  time="010:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070220/halltext/70220h0003.htm#07022049000467">
	<p pid="a.16.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> on this debate, which has certainly warmed up, although I fear that Westminster Hall has not mirrored that. We will struggle through the last half an hour of the debate in this chilly Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/2">The hon. Gentleman and his colleagues raised a catalogue of failures by this part of the health service in Cornwall. As he said, the service is unfit for purpose and he and his colleagues confirmed that it is putting the health and the lives of their constituents at risk. That is simply unacceptable. The hon. Gentleman also said that during his time in Parliament, which may soon be coming to an end, it is unprecedented that he has had to bring a local health matter to the attention of the Chamber. That underlines the seriousness of what is going wrong in Cornwall with this service. I hope that such problems are an isolated incident. I do not want to take against new configurations per se, but the Department of Health has a key role and interest in learning from the lessons that are now painfully being learned in Cornwall.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/3">We are again talking about health issues in this Chamber and about the failures within the health service. Such debates are becoming a regular gig for the Minister, myself and other Front-Bench spokespeople on health. This is another debate involving deficits, bungled reorganisations and, above all, complete discontent among patients, who are at the heart of the NHS, what it stands for and what it is there to do. Today, there are reports in the papers that civil servants in the Department of the Secretary of State for Health have lost all confidence in her and the Government's ability to run the health service. It is of little surprise that we are again here to debate shortcomings in the NHS after 10 years of this Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/4">Clearly, hon. Members have raised several common themes relating to this problem. Professionals and patients have lost confidence in the service. The previous service, KernowDoc, was a Rolls-Royce service that worked rather well. It might not have been as cost-effective as other services, but it worked well and as the saying goes, &quot;If it ain't bust, why fix it?&quot; A further problem is that poor information is provided by the new operators of this service and even Members of Parliament have to resort to freedom of information requests to find out exactly what is going on. That is surely unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/5">GP survey findings show that the service has become worse. It is not just a few whingeing patients raising concerns, it is the entire population of Cornwall&mdash;patients and health professionals&mdash;who are united with their local councillors and MPs in condemning the way the service is run. Despite the reassurances that hon. Members have had from Serco, things are still going wrong and this is resulting in enormous, acceptable and unsustainable pressures on the 999 emergency services. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1514" name="Colin Breed">the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed)</phrase> said, these are false economies if they shift costs to other parts of the NHS, where they may be higher.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/6">What has been achieved by the people who have raised concerns in Cornwall? There have been many complaints and the patient forum for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly primary care trust has asked people to come forward with their experiences. The chair of that organisation, Mrs. Hewett-Silk, has said that she wants to hear from GPs. She is quoted as saying that since Serco took over, very few doctors in Cornwall have worked with the service and she wants to know why. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" name="Julia Goldsworthy">The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy)</phrase> said that 95 per cent. of GPs used to work for the out-of-hours service and that that is now down to 15 per cent.. That shows that many GPs have voted with their feet. There was particularly heavy criticism of the service over last Christmas between 23 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-27">27 December</phrase>, when the service took about 3,500 calls, which is 10 per cent. more than the out-of-hours service took during the same period in the previous year. Serco had nine months to prepare for that situation and knew that GPs surgeries would be closed over the Christmas period. When Serco took over the contract last April it restructured the administrative, finance and personnel teams. That resulted in many redundancies and perhaps we are now seeing the implications of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/7">Problems with the service include slow response times and, in some cases, responses were non-existent. The ambulance service has complained about excessive use of the 999 service and ambulances. As hon. Members have mentioned, that also puts pressure on the air ambulance service and results in queues at the Royal Treliske hospital. Great pressure has been put on the accident and emergency department, as going to hospital has simply been the only way people can receive a service. There have been instances of serious misdiagnosis, and treatment by doctors who have an inadequate grasp of the English language and British medical procedure. Many doctors are drafted in from eastern Europe on a temporary basis. People have had to wait hours to be called back or given an appointment and, if they have use of a car, have had to drive considerable distances, particularly over the Christmas and new year period. There has been little sympathy and concern from Serco when patients call and are unable to get through at all. Those are all experiences that hon. Members have relayed from their constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/8">There are concerns among patients, doctors, professional counsellors and MPs. Indeed, my colleague, Sarah Newton, who is a prospective parliamentary candidate for Truro and Falmouth, reports similar findings about the service from her own survey of patient care. She has been working with Sue Hindle, the chairman of the association of friends of Cornwall hospitals, who will be monitoring the situation with Ann James, the new chief executive of the PCT.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/9">There are serious questions to be answered. In particular, the Minister might wish to comment on why Serco was considered better than others to take over the contract. The South Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust made a bid to take on the contract. It has considerable local experience and already runs out-of-hours services in Dorset and Somerset. Given the Government's drive to centralise the health service and bring parts of it together in bigger and, we are told, better&mdash;although that is highly questionable&mdash;services, why did they not take the decision to co-locate such services with the ambulance service call centre and NHS Direct? It would have made a lot of sense to bring local knowledge together in one organisation. Instead, the service has been fragmented and that flies in the face of what the Government are trying to do elsewhere in the health service.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/10">We welcome the fact that, very belatedly, Serco has woken up to the fact that it has messed up and must do something about the problems and take them seriously. A Serco spokesman has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/11" class="indent">&quot;We are looking to make progress in introducing best practice into the out-of-hours service, which includes a nurse triage system. We are committed to delivering an excellent service to the people of Cornwall. We are open and transparent about our performance and where improvements are needed we hold our hands up and take action.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/12">That represents a rather significant disconnect from reality, given the testaments that we have heard from hon. Members, based on the experiences of their constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/13">I therefore have a series of questions for the Minister, many of which echo questions that we have already heard in the contributions from local Members of Parliament. How was Serco selected, particularly against other, local bidders who had a good deal of experience and local knowledge? How are the systems being monitored by the Department of Health? It will not wash for Ministers in that Department simply to say that data are not collected centrally. The developments in the health service in Cornwall are strategically important with regard to other similar developments that may be happening elsewhere in the health service. Surely the Department of Health is monitoring the situation closely to assess whether the experience is a good one, whether the application and bidding process needs to be changed and whether better monitoring needs to take place. What monitoring is done by the Department or by the Minister's colleagues?</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/14">Who oversees the complaints procedure? Given the demise of community health councils and the various things that have followed them, exactly where do patients go to complain? We have heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> that much of the monitoring of the service seems to be done by Serco itself, so where is the independent monitoring of whether what is being delivered is cost-effective, is of sufficiently high quality, complies with the contract that Serco was given and is doing what patients and professionals need it to do? Who is responsible ultimately for monitoring the quality and the independence of that monitoring?</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/15">What effect has the situation had on A and E admissions? Have the Government done an assessment of whether there has simply been a shifting of the problem and of the financial liability, which may end up being a bigger financial liability? What have the extra costs been on NHS Direct? What have the extra costs been on the hospital at Tresliske?</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/16">Serco gave an extraordinary excuse for the problems experienced last Christmas. It had to do with staff sickness. I wonder where those staff went for their treatment if they had to call for an out-of-hours doctor, given that they would not have been able to get through on their own telephone service if they had the experience of other patients with whom it was supposedly dealing.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/17">What locum cover arrangements are such firms expected to provide? We have heard that many agency staff have been employed, despite questionable qualifications and an inability to do the job. If, as I think was mentioned, the PCT is reviewing the contract extraordinarily&mdash;not as part of a routine review&mdash;which is to be welcomed, what break clauses are expected to be placed in such a contract? What penalties may fall to the company or, more worryingly, to the PCT for early termination of the contract?</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/18">Clearly, what may have happened is that the national health service in Cornwall is paying more for less; for a service of lower quality. Is that happening elsewhere? We need assurances from the Minister that the Department of Health is on to this. A BBC investigation for &quot;File on 4&quot; in 2005 found that the NHS was not meeting targets to see patients who needed emergency GP care outside normal office hours. Data from 21 PCTs obtained showed that one in four was not meeting the target of 90 per cent. of patients being seen within an hour. In some cases, the target was met in only 13 per cent. of cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/19">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-28">28 November 2006</phrase>, the Secretary of State said:</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/20" class="indent">&quot;The result of the new contract is that GPs are providing better services for patients according to the quality and outcomes framework, and doing much more work on prevention and long-term care.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-11-28.956"><i>Official Report, </i>28 November 2006; Vol. 453, c. 956-7</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/21">How does that gel with what has been happening in Cornwall? I gather that the new &quot;snitching&quot; website that the Secretary of State has set up, for reporting on the quality of GP services, does not include the out-of-hours service, which is perhaps unfortunate.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/22">Patients should be able to expect from the new service high-quality clinical treatment, good responsiveness, good access times, good communications and good accountability. I fear that in the case of the service in Cornwall, none of those has been achieved. The Minister needs to look seriously into why that has happened.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-20a.20.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" speakername="Andy Burnham" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health"  colnum="20"  time="010:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070220/halltext/70220h0004.htm#07022049000468">
	<p pid="a.20.0/1">This has indeed been a good debate, even if it has taken place in somewhat chilly surroundings, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" name="Tim Loughton">the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)</phrase> said. That made me pine for the sun-baked days of my childhood that were spent in many of the constituencies represented here today.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> on securing this debate on the provision of out-of-hours health care in Cornwall by Serco. I note that he is joined by three of his four colleagues from Cornwall: the hon. Members for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed), for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) and for St. Ives (Andrew George). That shows the strength of feeling on the issues that the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell has put before the House today. I say quite straightforwardly, without any sense of party politics, that he and his colleagues have raised, quite properly, concerns that they should raise as MPs about the quality of health care in their locality.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/3">I am sure that the comments that the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell has made today will have been heard not only in this place but in his county, by those to whom the remarks relate. I shall go on to address some of the specific points that he raised, but I want to say first that he has properly raised issues, and I think that we would all be united in saying that we want improvements to result from the process that he has begun.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/4">I want to clear up one thing at the beginning. I think that the hon. Gentleman's description of my response to his referral of this matter to the Department was a little unfair. He wrote to Dr. Colin Barrett of Kernow Urgent Care Services on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-11">11 January</phrase> to outline some of his concerns, including the concern about accountability and the response to the concerns that he has raised, quite properly, as an MP. I wrote back to the hon. Gentleman less than a month later. I shall quote from my letter:</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Dear Matthew...I am concerned you are not getting a response from the out-of-hours provider in your area to the questions you have raised.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/6">I was quite explicit about the fact that I was concerned about that point. I did not simply bat it away to the primary care trust, asking him to take it there. I asked the trust to investigate the matter, and I copied into the correspondence Sir Ian Carruthers, chief executive of the South West strategic health authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/7">I just want to assure the hon. Gentleman that there was not a dismissive response to his letter. We took the proper action, which was to refer it to the bodies in the region that have the responsibility for ensuring that the quality standards are achieved. That brings us to one issue that has cropped up a few times in the debate, which is that of accountability. I agree with the points that hon. Members have made. The question was asked: who is accountable? The PCT is accountable. In contracting with any provider, the PCT does not offshore its responsibility&mdash;its accountability&mdash;for the service. The process that is under way is the right and proper one.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/8">Let me address some of the context on out-of-hours services before addressing the specific concerns raised about Cornwall. It is important to put in context the changes that we have brought about today. Under the old primary care contracts, GPs traditionally had a 24-hour responsibility for their patients. Although responsible for care, most GPs did not provide their own out-of-hours services, as was the case in the constituency of the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell, I believe. Instead, they delegated responsibility to independent GP co-operatives or commercial providers. Indeed, at the beginning of 2004, only 5 per cent. of GPs provided out-of-hours services themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/9">By early 2000, it had become clear that the old model for out-of-hours arrangements was not sustainable. There were rising numbers of complaints about the quality of service and there was evidence that the quality of care was inconsistent across the country. That prompted the health service commissioner to raise with the Department concerns about the provision of out-of-hours services. There was also concern about the impact that the responsibility of providing such services had on the recruitment and retention of GPs. We all know about low morale among GPs and how it is linked to the requirement to provide out-of-hours services.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/10">Those two factors prompted the Department to commission the Carson review. The October 2000 report, &quot;Raising Standards for Patients: New Partnerships in Out-of-Hours Care&quot; made 22 recommendations, all of which were fully accepted by the Department. The review identified a future model of out-of-hours care in which PCTs would develop an integrated network of urgent care provision. Under the new primary care contract from April 2004, GP practices have been able to transfer responsibility for providing out-of-hours services to their primary care trust by opting out and handing to the PCT a sum reflecting the cost of providing the service&mdash;on average, about &pound;6,000 per GP. That transfer of responsibility is improving GPs' lives and having a positive effect on their recruitment and retention. That is certainly true in my constituency, where we have traditionally had a low number of GPs per 100,000 population.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/11">PCTs now have a legal responsibility to ensure that patients are well cared for when GPs' surgeries are closed. They are also responsible for performance managing providers' delivery of out-of-hours services. We have put quality requirements in place that set out the standard of service that we expect to be provided across the country. I shall return to that important point when I address the concerns raised by the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/12">The quality requirements set out the minimum standards that a high-quality, safe out-of-hours service should achieve. They include performance targets for answering the telephone calls of patients who access the service as a first point of contact and for face-to-face consultations. The requirements stipulate that patients will be guaranteed a GP consultation, including a home visit if there is clinical need for one, and that they will be treated by the clinician who is best equipped to meet their needs and in the most appropriate location. They also stipulate that service providers should be regularly audited to ensure that patients receive high-quality care.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/13">Before I relate all that to the concerns that have been raised, it is important to note that the changes have improved out-of-hours services across the country. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">The hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> mentioned the National Audit Office report, which confirmed that patient experiences of out-of-hours services are generally positive. Some eight out of 10 patients are satisfied with the service, and six out of 10 rate it as excellent or good. Crucially, the NAO found no evidence of risk to patient safety as a result of the change to the GMS contract, but&mdash;there is a but&mdash;we accept that some PCTs need to improve their performance and those of their service providers to comply with the quality requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/14">Since the NAO published its report, we have introduced a series of steps to help PCTs and their contracting teams to improve their commissioning of out-of-hours services. I was asked whether I accept that responsibility and I do. We take it extremely seriously that such things can be improved.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-20a.25.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1627" speakername="Jon Trickett" colnum="25"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070220/halltext/70220h0004.htm#07022049000478">
	<p pid="a.25.1/1">I am grateful to you, Lady Winterton, and the House authorities for allowing me to introduce this important debate. I am pleased to speak in the first hour-and-a-half debate that I have secured in 11 years in the House. I am glad that it will take place under your firm but fair chairmanship and that colleagues from Yorkshire are present.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/2">I was wondering how the previous speaker's last sentence was going to finish, because he had just reached the crucial question. The crucial question in this debate is how the housing market works. There has been much debate about how public service provision ought best to be made. There has been a particular focus on the marketisation or even the privatisation of public services. There is no doubt that there is a place for the market in the distribution of goods and services, because it is an efficient means of distributing services. However, from time to time the market produces inequity, and, in something such as housing, inequity can lead to a breakdown in social cohesion. I want to reflect on how the housing market has worked over the past few years and to suggest that housing is not a good example of a public service that can rely exclusively on the market as a means of distributing public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/3">I begin by reflecting on a sentence in a speech made by the Prime Minister last year. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/4" class="indent">&quot;The USP of New Labour is aspiration and compassion reconciled.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/5">The USP refers to the unique selling proposition. It is fair to say that the Prime Minister and this Administration have located much of their effort around aspiration. As I shall illustrate, the housing market has enabled many families and others to achieve their aspirations. My right hon. Friend combines aspiration with compassion, which suggests that he is disturbed or worried about the possibility that aspiration alone, or marketisation alone, can lead to social exclusion. That probably explains the latter part of his comment, whereby aspiration is reconciled with &quot;compassion&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/6">During this Labour Government's time in power, families, households and individuals who have owned their houses have done remarkably well. Owning one's own house has been a route for many not only to security and happiness, but to prosperity and a generally benign life. Let us consider what has happened to house prices since 1996, when the Tories had engineered a most catastrophic collapse in the housing market&mdash;we all remember the negative equity and the other problems that the country then faced. House prices across the nation as a whole have increased by 187 per cent. on average. That has contributed to a sense of well-being and to a realisation of many families' aspirations.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/7">Yorkshire and the Humber has outperformed the nation in the housing market, because the value of houses in the area has doubled. My constituency forms part of the Wakefield area, which has four MPs. Wakefield's house prices have increased from an average of &pound;58,000 in 2000&mdash;imagine that&mdash;to today's heady heights of just under &pound;140,000. In this decade alone, a number of factors, doubtless including the wise stewardship of the economy and a surfeit of demand over supply because of changes in the household structure, have resulted in an increase of about 250 per cent. in the value of the average house in Wakefield. That is a remarkable achievement, and it doubtless explains the benign attitude of many people to new Labour. We should celebrate it, because we all want a home-owning democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/8">The housing market is, to some extent, dysfunctional in places. In those areas, there is both a breakdown in social cohesion and the exclusion of large numbers of people. When I was discussing the possibility of securing this debate, someone told me that we can compare the housing market to a ladder that people can ascend. That is a valuable metaphor, but let us consider it further. The housing ladder, both in my constituency and more generally, has some rungs missing, and some people now find it too hard to mount the bottom rung. The Abbey recently estimated that 17 million of our fellow citizens feel excluded from home ownership.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/9">I received some remarkable figures from my local authority in Wakefield on the amount of money that the average constituent in Hemsworth earns as a percentage of the average cost of a mortgage needed by first-time buyers&mdash;people attempting to get on to the bottom rung of the housing market&mdash;to buy a starter home. The figures for Yorkshire and the Humber are broadly the same as those for the nation. In the first quarter of 2000, the average monthly mortgage payment as a proportion of the average monthly take-home pay was less than 70 per cent. Obviously, many households would have more than one earner, but let us consider the figures as an indication of how difficult it now is to get on to the first rung of the ladder.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-20a.26.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-20b.26.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-20a.26.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1627" speakername="Jon Trickett" colnum="26"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070220/halltext/70220h0004.htm#07022049000480">
	<p pid="a.26.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making an important point. He has been a long-time acquaintance and colleague of mine. Sitting alongside him is another Leeds Member of Parliament, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1671" name="Fabian Hamilton">the Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Hamilton)</phrase>. They have both spent their lives committed to the development of steady progress in the housing market in Leeds.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/2">I shall come on to the extreme difficulties faced by the 30 per cent. of the population that does not have access to the bottom rung of the ladder&mdash;if a ladder is an appropriate analogy. I was about to compare the 60 per cent. or so of average income that the first-time buyer spent on mortgage payments in 2000 to the current situation. Extraordinarily, the average first-time buyer will now need 111 per cent. of their monthly income to pay the cost of an average mortgage for a starter home in Yorkshire and Humberside. I need not say that the mathematics simply do not work.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/3">Someone wanting to get on the first rung of ownership on the housing ladder will find it impossible to do so, given the average cost and the average wage of people in Yorkshire and the Humber. There has been an increase in the relevant figure of income to mortgage from 2.8 when we came to power to more than four now, and we know that it is not prudent to borrow more than three and a half times one's salary and that many people are in danger of getting into extended debt. Clearly, it is important that the Government keep a steady hand on the economy so that interest rates do not rise any more. The current situation requires payments of 111 per cent. of average earnings, and the frightening prospect is that first time buyers will find it almost impossible to get on to the housing market at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/4">There is a rung missing at the bottom of the ladder for those who want to become home owners. More rungs are missing in my constituency, which is now part of a fancy new notion called the Leeds city region. I come from Leeds and most of my family still live there. I was the leader of Leeds city council and I have nothing bad to say about what is a great European city. However, Wakefield and my constituency are gradually becoming the repository for much of the new house building that is being generated by the Leeds economy because of the additional demand for labour and households' changing size and character. We are happy about that. People in my constituency showed generosity to outsiders who came into the area during the last century and before as the mining industry grew and subsequently collapsed.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/5">However, the new housing tends to be executive homes, which are priced substantially higher than the terraced houses in the mining villages that I represent. It is almost impossible for a householder in my constituency to sell a house the value of which has increased over the past few years, thanks to the Labour Government, and to borrow enough money to move up to the next step on the ladder and the new housing in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/6">I represent 22&mdash;it will shortly be 23&mdash;former mining villages. Much of the new executive housing is bog standard in character. It is a visual intrusion into the framework of the villages and does not reflect their architectural character. There is a big step between one and the other. If we are not careful, that will reinforce the feeling that people&mdash;former miners&mdash;have of exclusion from and inaccessibility to the new economy that Labour is building in the area. It is important to get the architecture and design right, as well as the various rungs on the ladder so that those houses are not inaccessible.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/7">I am worried about a proposed large housing developing in South Elmshall in my constituency because the infrastructure&mdash;housing, sewerage, schools and so on&mdash;is hardly adequate. We welcome new housing, but the infrastructure, architecture and design must be right, with accessibility to the local market for local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/8">Another housing market dysfunction is specific to mining communities, of which there are many in Yorkshire, as you know, Lady Winterton. At the end of the miners' strike, the Government decided to dispose of all the housing stock. Not everyone here will know that the National Coal Board provided housing for its work force and owned well over 100,000 houses. A precipitous and eventually calamitous decision was made to dispose of all that housing stock with almost immediate effect. After a year on strike, many miners found it impossible to raise the money for a deposit to buy the house that they had rented from the National Coal Board for donkeys' years. Some people managed to buy, but many did not because of the disastrous effect of the strike on household economies, so landlords moved into National Coal Board communities. Many were probably responsible, but some were extremely irresponsible. It was possible to buy a street for a few thousand pounds and houses were sold for very small sums, but the money was not available to the people who lived in those houses and, through no fault of their own, they had a change of landlord. There was pepper-potting in whole communities and some people who had bought their own house were surrounded by private landlords and, occasionally, social landlords.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/9">The landlords bought the houses for next to nothing and were often able to obtain money from the Government's housing benefit support. They cared little for the communities and knew little about them. I once had a letter from a large landlord in my patch who lived in Hong Kong. He had never been to Yorkshire and had no idea of what was happening in the area. Landlords did not pay much attention to the quality and standards of tenants, nor of the properties that they owned because they had been acquired for next to nothing.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/10">What happened was the most disastrous experience that can be imagined. Over the years I took three Ministers to five estates in my constituency that were being dismantled brick by brick. Local residents simply took flight and houses were left empty. Vandals gradually moved in and began to demolish them by hand from the roof down. That demolition surrounded the houses of people who had bought they own property. They were then unable to sell their homes because the market had collapsed, and a landscape developed that looked like Kosovo in Yorkshire. Ministers were visibly shaken by what they saw, and I am pleased that the Government made money available through the housing market renewal fund to try to help. One estate collapsed almost completely, leaving only the house where Geoff Boycott had been born, and even that was eventually torn down. It is arguable that that saved money for the public purse because the cost of demolition was not high due to the local youth taking care of the demolition. That was a city estate in Fitzwilliam.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/11">In some parts of my constituency, there was wholesale demolition, but in other parts community activists&mdash;mainly brave women&mdash;refused to admit that their communities were to be destroyed in that way. In Moorthorpe, for example, the women got together and insisted that their Member of Parliament and councillors join them. Together, we worked with Housing Ministers to try to prevent further decay in Moorthorpe. I am proud to say that I think we have succeeded.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/12">Girnhill lane in Featherstone had belonged to the National Coal Board. Other areas had been terraced housing, but Girnhill lane consisted of post-war, system-built housing and could not be remedied. People there today&mdash;in Yorkshire, England, in this century and this year&mdash;are living in intolerable conditions because they bought their own houses but cannot sell them because there are no buyers. The situation is intolerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/13">The Government have made money available&mdash;I am grateful to them for that&mdash;and they are about to announce more. They have played their part, and the council is doing its part, but a single landlord, who owns probably one third of the properties, has found it difficult to accept the market price for the land value. I am hopeful that a decision will be made shortly to allow us to make progress in Girnhill lane. It is unimaginable that people, and particularly children, should left in such conditions in the fifth or sixth largest economy in the world.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-20a.34.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1770" speakername="Paul Truswell" colnum="34"  time="011:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070220/halltext/70220h0006.htm#07022049000490">
	<p pid="a.34.2/1">I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman raised that question. We are used to the Tories locally and nationally trying to construct a specious amulet, because it conceals the point that the lack of investment led to the decay of the remaining stock, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth graphically described. I shall not debate the rights and wrongs of right to buy, but it left a residue of property that was in the worst state of repair, and which this Government rightly tried to address. I am afraid that the magic amulet does not dispel any criticisms that I and others will continue to have of the previous Conservative Government's appalling housing record.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/2">One comment that Councillor Lewis made sums up what I have just said. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/3" class="indent">&quot;We were never allowed to transform anything under the Conservative Government, but now we can.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/4">He is right. Thousands of homes have been transferred with remedial work such as no-fines system-built housing, new windows, kitchens and bathrooms, re-roofing and new heating and insulation&mdash;a range of measures that are crucial to improving the quality of people's accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/5">The important point that I make to my constituents is that such investment transforms not only the individual properties and the living conditions of tenants, but the surrounding community, whether it comprises rented or owner-occupied housing. My two hon. Friends have pointed out extremely well the problem that we do not have sufficient rented property in Leeds or beyond. That is why fellow Leeds MPs and I support the Leeds Tenants Federation's &quot;Right to Rent&quot; campaign. I am grateful to the federation for providing me with some information to put to the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/6">The campaign's aims are to obtain acceptance of three principal views:</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/7" class="indent">&quot;An affordable homes policy needs a healthy social rented sector to provide a full range of housing options. The growth of the Leeds economy depends on increasing the provision of social rented housing. Social rented housing is a tenure of choice for many people&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/8">I referred to my own family earlier&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/9" class="indent">&quot;and not just a tenure of last resort,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/10">as it is so often seen and portrayed. The federation is pressing Leeds city council on two points: first, to</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/11" class="indent">&quot;develop a land bank that can be transferred to housing associations at nil or low cost for the development of social homes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/12">I must give credit to my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth. Under his leadership, and that of his predecessors, the council entered into a productive arrangement with social housing organisations, the Leeds Homes Partnership, through which it made land available at less than market value to build housing for rent. He may correct me, but I think that it provided about 4,000 accommodation units.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-20a.35.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1770" speakername="Paul Truswell" colnum="35"  time="011:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070220/halltext/70220h0006.htm#07022049000492">
	<p pid="a.35.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his amplification of the point and for correcting the number of properties that the initiative generated.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/2">The second element of the federation's campaign is to have the city council</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/3" class="indent">&quot;set a target of developing 1,500 social rented homes a year through Section 106 planning agreements and supporting housing association new build programmes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/4">As my hon. Friend remarked, Shelter recommends a minimum of about 20,000 properties for rent per year, which equates to just under 1,200 for Yorkshire and Humberside.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/5">I shall provide a background to housing need in Leeds. I am grateful to the federation for providing me with the information. In 1981, there were more than 100,000 social rented homes in Leeds; by 2006 the number had fallen to just over 74,000. More than 36,000 council homes have been lost through right to buy or demolition and only 9,800 housing association homes have been built. The net loss has been almost 27,000 affordable rented homes. In recent years, housing association new build has slowed to a point at which fewer than 200 new homes are developed each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/6">Sales and clearance is predicted to reduce further the total number of council homes in Leeds to about 50,000 by 2016. The federation calculates the scale of the problem to be such that at current levels of building, it will take 83 years to return to the level of social housing available in 1995. Even with a new build programme of 1,200 new social homes a year, which is six times the current rate, by 2010 we would still be back only to the numbers of affordable rented homes available in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/7">The number of empty council homes has reduced from 2,500 in 1995 to its lowest point of 1,190 today, for which we pay tribute to Leeds city council. The number of social rented homes available to let has also nose-dived from 9,700 in 1995 to 7,600 today. The dwindling supply of social rented homes is increasing competition and frustration about rationing decisions&mdash;it is rationing, and both my hon. Friends have referred to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/8">Some 31,000 people are looking for social rented housing through the Leeds homes register, and again, to amplify a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East made, on average, between 50 and 142 bids are made for each home that becomes available under choice-based lettings. In fact, there was a great deal of publicity just a few weeks ago when462 people bid for the same three-bedroomed property in Kirkstall. That gives some indication of just how desperate people are.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/9">To amplify a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth, private rents are comparable to the level of mortgages in this fast growing sector. A three-bedroomed private rented house will cost about &pound;120 a week, compared with &pound;50 to &pound;70 for a comparable home in the social rented sector. Home ownership is out of reach for most households on low incomes. It is estimated that a single income of &pound;44,700 would be needed to afford the average house price in Leeds, which at the moment costs about &pound;156,000 and is rising steeply.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/10">I am familiar with back-to-back properties, as I am sure <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" name="Greg Mulholland">the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> is, because I used to represent an area that largely comprised terraced accommodation and many back-to-backs. To buy the cheapest of those properties in Leeds, a couple have to be on a dual income of over &pound;22,000, whereas the average dual income for the bottom 10 per cent. of wage earners in Leeds is only &pound;19,000 a year. The projections for the Leeds economy show that the main growth will be in the low-paid, private sector&mdash;exactly the sort of people requiring growth in the provision of accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/11">I shall just quote another example that Richard Lewis cited in my conversation with him. He tells me that people on average incomes can only afford to buy in something like four out of 102 postcode areas in Leeds. That is a dreadful state of affairs. Organisations such as the Leeds Tenants Federation and Shelter understand, as do the Government, the aspiration for home ownership and that there is a sustained need for an increase in the supply of housing for sale on the open market, which my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth touched upon. However, it is clear that, although the supply in market housing has remained relatively constant during the past 30 years, there has been a dramatic decline in the number of social and rented homes being built for the very reasons that we have rehearsed today.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/12">In contrast with the progress that has been made in tackling the most acute cases of homelessness&mdash;although I accept that those continue to be a source of concern&mdash;very little progress has been made in easing overcrowding, and I shall give a few examples of that in my constituency. They are not headline-grabbing. In many respects, they are quite mundane and unexceptional, except for the many hundreds, if not thousands, of families living in such circumstances. These examples demonstrate the common, daily grind that many people face in coping with temporary and usually overcrowded accommodation. They are all anonymised because I did not feel it appropriate to use names.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/13">A young family is living on the upper floor of a two-storey block, with no access to a garden, and experiencing the obvious difficulties struggling up and down stairs with prams and young children. They live above an elderly couple who, despite their patience, find the natural movements of young children&mdash;as we might call them&mdash;extremely distressing and disturbing.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/14">There is a family with a baby, and a teenage son and daughter, living in a two-bedroomed flat, with no privacy for the daughter and no space for her brother to study for his GCSEs. Lack of privacy is particularly hard on teenage girls who are forced to share bedrooms with their brothers. Overcrowding makes it difficult to find a quiet space to read, to do homework or to study for exams, and sleep is often disrupted by other members as they arrive home and move around in the limited confines of the sort of property that we are talking about.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/15">We all have numerous families in our constituencies living with relatives, especially parents, where overcrowding and tensions cause great stress, and in some cases, severe stress-related illness. Such people are essentially homeless, but not recognised as such. The only way in which they can really amplify their priority is by working the system and getting their relatives to write a letter saying, &quot;Right, you're out. We don't want you any more.&quot; That causes increasing tension within families.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/16">Research undertaken by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, when it still existed, showed the link between overcrowding and ill health, particularly respiratory and other infectious diseases. The stress of sharing bedrooms and inadequate cooking, washing and toilet facilities is well documented as a cause of tension between family members, leaving many parents suffering from anxiety and depression. A fairly recent survey by Shelter showed that 90 per cent. of overcrowded families felt that overcrowding was damaging their children's health and 80 per cent. felt that that living in overcrowded conditions was damaging their children's educational prospects.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/17">There is the case of the family forced to leave insecure and unaffordable private rented accommodation, who were temporarily rehoused by the council on the far side of the city from where they previously lived&mdash;away from supportive family networks and requiring a two-hour round trip to maintain the continuity of their children's education. It is anyone's guess when a property will become available in the area in which they are seeking to re-establish themselves. There are young people unable to find accommodation in the area where their families have lived for generations because of soaring house prices, high private rents and a dearth of social rented housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/18">In conclusion, I would like to suggest a few bullet points outlining the issues that need to be addressed to tackle the sort of need that my hon. Friends are trying to impress upon the Minister. Planning policy statement 3 is welcome in my area because we have seen numerous developments based on profiteering and not on meeting the housing needs of families, older people or those with special housing needs. We hope that councils like Leeds will grasp that measure with both hands and use it to prevent high-density and totally over-intensive and unnecessary profiteering developments. As was said earlier, we need to respond to the moderate challenge of Shelter&mdash;it is not over the top&mdash;that was backed by the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government. Shelter stated that 20,000 more social homes need to be built a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/19">We need a better balance between the focus on low-cost home ownership schemes and investment in social rented homes. We do not want one to be shutting out the other, which happens in practice to some extent. We need to examine and learn the lessons of changes to the right-to-buy discount, which have had some good effects on the housing market. We need to consider the concerns expressed about negative subsidy. I know that we could have, and have had, whole debates on that issue. We must be more inventive and innovative in the promotion of self-build schemes and in looking at council properties, and perhaps, as we have seen in my constituency, the turning of unwanted bedsits into family accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/20">We need to ensure that the planning gain through section 106 agreements secures more social housing and that the planning gain supplement does not interfere with that aim. In my area&mdash;I am sure that this is also true of others&mdash;developers become very good at explaining why it is not financially feasible to include the required proportion of affordable housing. One of their favourite reasons is that the land is contaminated so that the cost of redevelopment is excessive. We need to build on the regulation of houses in multiple occupation introduced through the very welcome Housing Act 2004. I urge the Minister and her colleagues to extend its operation to smaller HMOs and impose better standards on private rented accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/21">Finally, one very clear message emerges from the whole debate, particularly those parts relating to the need for more social rented housing. No housing strategy for this nation, or any part of it, is complete without recognition of the importance of the social rented sector or the action to boost it to the levels necessary to meet the needs that my colleagues and I have described in our constituencies, our region and throughout the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1627" name="Jon Trickett">the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett)</phrase> on securing the debate. It covers a very important and topical subject for all of us who represent Yorkshire, and indeed for us all nationally. I have visited his constituency, but only to watch rugby league, yet we would all agree that he painted a powerful picture of some of the specific and general issues that his constituents face.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/2">There is no question but that social cohesion is important and that it is most certainly related to housing, as we would all agree. It comes from income, occupation, ethnic background, life chances, aspirations and having balanced and sustainable communities in every part of Yorkshire and nationally. We would all hope that housing policy was geared towards achieving that. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the average house price in Yorkshire and the Humber is &pound;139,965, which is clearly out of the reach of many people. To echo many of the comments that have been made, particularly those of my constituency neighbour, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1770" name="Paul Truswell">the hon. Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell)</phrase>, social housing is essential if we are to have socially cohesive communities. I agree that social housing must no longer be seen as second best to owner occupancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/3">We face a social housing crisis in Yorkshire and nationally. My constituency neighbour on the other side, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1671" name="Fabian Hamilton">the hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Hamilton)</phrase>, discussed some of the cases in his constituency. Few MPs in Yorkshire or nationally, including rural as well as urban MPs, will not have been contacted by large numbers of constituents about similar housing cases. I have been contacted by people living on friends' floors, mothers with two or more children living in a single room, and families with teenage children who have been forced to share rooms with teenage siblings of the opposite sex and, often, also their parents. I have also had some extraordinary cases that echo the hon. Gentleman's experience, including one involving a family living in a caravan on a friend's drive and another involving a family living in a tent in a back garden&mdash;hard to imagine in one of the fastest-growing cities and regions in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/4">As well as the problem of people registered with local authorities&mdash;those cases that we are generally talking about&mdash;there is the problem of the hidden homeless. I look forward to hearing the Minister's opinion on that. Crisis estimates that as many as 400,000 people might be unregistered and living in hostels, squats and bed and breakfasts, and sofa surfing. We are talking about social cohesion, and they are among the most socially excluded in society. Altogether, the increasing number of those listed in temporary accommodation in local authorities, those in unsuitable in accommodation and the hidden homeless are creating a dramatic social divide and a section of society, comprising people without a decent home to call their own, in which they can raise their children and pursue their careers.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/5">The simple reality, as borne out by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation's research, is that we are not building enough homes for either owner occupiers or social housing. That will inevitably lead to a degree of breakdown in social cohesion. The hon. Member for Hemsworth mentioned that that leads to division, as the various groups in our society might perceive unfairness in the allocation system. I am sure that that has been reflected in the experience of my Leeds colleagues.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-20a.40.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" speakername="Greg Mulholland" colnum="40"  time="011:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070220/halltext/70220h0007.htm#07022049000495">
	<p pid="a.40.1/1">I could not agree more. The issue is vital for many of us in the region and nationally, and I note that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1526" name="Jon Cruddas">the hon. Member for Dagenham (Jon Cruddas)</phrase> made similar comments recently. We must take the issue seriously. However, if we do not have adequate housing, we cannot address those problems or the need for more social cohesion on economic and aspirational lines. It should also be pointed out that, as the hon. Member for Leeds, North-East mentioned, without those social houses being replaced, the right-to-buy policy has been a disaster for the social housing network in this country. It led to a generation of children living for periods in entirely unsuitable accommodation. We have heard many examples of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/2">The figures are quite damning. I was disappointed with the party political points that the hon. Gentleman made. It is extraordinary political logic to point the finger at councils whose hands are so clearly tied by a Government who will not give them the opportunity to build more social housing. The problem is a failure of Government policy. Since 1997, 449,807 social homes have been sold in England alone under the right-to-buy legislation, but in the same period only 151,255 social homes have been built in England, while 500,000 extra households are now on council waiting lists. That is the legacy of a failure of Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/3">I am delighted, however, that the hon. Gentleman supports Liberal Democrat policy, which would finally allow councils to use the right-to-buy receipts for those currently without a place to call home. That would lead to &pound;1.5 billion nationally, which would be a healthy sum to start the process, as I am sure he agrees. I also echo the comments about the Tory Government who created a social housing crisis, but they have been replaced by a Labour Government who have failed to address it in any meaningful way.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/4">All of us, in all political parties, need to have a much bolder vision of housing. That applies to allowing people to get on to the property ladder, but also means considering how we treat social housing. The issue is not just about supply. We often get bogged down with supply, particularly when it comes to homes to buy and own. We also need to look at the kind of supply. We need more mixed-income communities, not only more housing per se.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/5">For example, Liberal Democrat-run South Shropshire district council has taken an interesting approach, specifying that 25 per cent. of the homes in any private development must be affordable homes and that 25 per cent. of the homes must be social homes to rent. Crucially, however, those homes must be of the same sort as the private homes being built, so if the homes for sale are four-bedroomed family homes, the social and affordable homes must also be four-bedroomed family homes. What tends to happen otherwise is that, even when private developers are obliged to provide social and affordable housing, they often stick it in the corner of developments, as a token gesture. Such homes are often much smaller properties, so that there is still division of the sort that we are surely trying to avoid.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/6">We need a bolder approach, as we should all accept, but the issue goes back to the biggest problem, which is the crisis in social housing. I echo the comments that the hon. Member for Pudsey made. The drive for people to own their homes and get on that first rung of the property ladder is a laudable aim with which we would all agree, but social housing is not a rung below that. We must not allow the laudable drive to enable people to get on the property ladder to come at the expense of those who, realistically, cannot afford to do so, and in some cases will never be able to afford to do so. It is time we stopped seeing social housing as second best.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/7">I conclude by quoting Michael Hall, the chair of the Leeds Tenants Federation. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the high-profile right-to-rent campaign in Leeds, which we all support. Mr. Hall said:</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/8" class="indent">&quot;The stigma surrounding social housing had been created by successive governments that have treated the sector as little more than a welfare safety-net. These policies have led us to the housing crisis we now face...where the scarcity of affordable rented homes is causing misery for thousands who need a decent place to live.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/9">He added:</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/10" class="indent">&quot;We want social housing to be available to everyone no matter what their needs. Social housing should be a main-stream choice, up there alongside home ownership or private renting as an option for everyone in this booming city.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/11">That is the right approach for Leeds, the rest of Yorkshire and the whole country, if we are to have a more socially cohesive Britain.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.1/1">I take the hon. Gentleman's point, which is well made. However, although all hon. Members acknowledged the importance of home ownership, all so far have tended to concentrate on the negative side of the balance sheet when discussing the right to buy. I have no idea what this Minister will say, but I want to put on record the positive side to the right to buy.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/2">I was rude enough to intervene on the hon. Member for Pudsey and ask him about housing completions in the social sector. It might have seemed as if I was making a shallow partisan point&mdash;perhaps I was&mdash;but I wanted to illuminate the fact that as the Conservative Government introduced right to buy and encouraged wider home ownership, they were also engaged in presiding over a house building programme that puts this Government to shame. Every year that the Conservatives were in power, the number of housing completions in both the private, market sector and the social sector was higher than during the 10 years or so that Labour has been in power.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/3">That brings me to my fundamental criticism of the Government's position. I want to mention Bill Clinton. Those who remember working with that US President often used to remark that he liked nothing more at the end of an evening than putting his feet up, pouring himself a can of Pepsi and saying, &quot;Well, if I were President, I'd do this and that and that&quot;, until an aide eventually cut through the flow and said, &quot;But Mr. President&mdash;you are the President.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/4">When I listen to the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Minister for Housing and Planning saying, &quot;We need a massive extension in home building and a significant increase in the number of people taking advantage of low-cost home-ownership schemes&quot;, I ask myself about who has been in power for the past 10 years and what has happened in that period. As the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West pointed out, has there been any relaxation in the rules that allow receipts to be spent on new building? Has there been a significant increase in new construction or any real dynamism in the low-cost home-ownership programme? Reluctantly, we are forced to conclude that there has not.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/5">One of the statistics to which I always return in debates on home ownership is the take-up of social home buy. The Government's own low-cost home ownership scheme has cost hundreds of thousands of pounds but has so far had a take-up only in the low 20s. I shall not delay the Chamber with the variety of detailed reasons why I believe social home buy has failed, but the Government, in their anxiety to press on us how vital it is to embrace low-cost home ownership, should first consider their own poor record and explain why they have failed before, as they so often do, either revisiting the 1980s and talking about the problems of right to buy then, or blaming Conservative local authorities for somehow standing in the way of people's aspirations. We all know that some individuals in local government may not always take the most enlightened view of the national interest, but they come from all parties. One of the things that I find difficult to take is how Ministers continually demonise Conservative, Liberal Democrat, and sometimes Labour, local authorities, when the fundamental responsibility, given the centralised nature of so much planning power and the role of the Treasury, rests with the Government and their failure.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1627" name="Jon Trickett">the Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I have the privilege of knowing his constituency well. I am not the only Member of Parliament in this Chamber who previously worked for Wakefield council, and I visited the constituency on many occasions and know from personal experience the kind of conditions and homes that he discussed. The issues that he raised are important because they have an impact on social cohesion, and the Government understand and share his concerns. I shall set out what we are doing, both in a national and regional context.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.2/2">It is always tempting to spar with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1858" name="Michael Gove">the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)</phrase>, but many important points have been raised by my hon. Friends about issues in Yorkshire and Humberside, and I shall concentrate on responding to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.2/3">Let me first set out what we have achieved in housing. We have sustained an unprecedented period of economic growth, coupled with mortgage rates at their lowest since the 1950s. On average, &pound;4,000 a year has been cut off mortgages. Home ownership has continued to flourish, with 1.8 million new home owners since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.2/4">We have also reversed the legacy of decades of underinvestment. We are tackling the &pound;19 billion backlog of repairs to social housing that we inherited in 1997. In Yorkshire and the Humber region, the number of non-decent homes has fallen by some 150,000 since 1997. That not only improves living conditions but helps build social cohesion and contributes to sustainable communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.2/5">We are also tackling areas of decline and abandonment through the housing market renewal programme. My hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth specifically mentioned Girnhill lane in Featherstone. As he said, it was a National Coal Board estate. It has 174 properties in mixed ownership and suffers from extensive abandonment. Negotiations with the sole private landlord, a major landholder, have been somewhat protracted, although the local authority is now more optimistic that a settlement can be reached soon without the need to use a compulsory purchase order.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.2/6">A funding agreement with English Partnerships, which is progressing well, will enable the local authority to buy up further properties and land from the private landlord. It is seen as a major step forward for the project, which has stalled in recent years due to lack of funding and/or unwillingness to co-operate on the part of the landlord. The area is the subject of a master planning exercise that will be crucial to getting the local community on board in respect of future developments. The acquisition of owner-occupied properties is continuing, and there are plans for some demolition work that will be funded by the West Yorkshire housing market renewal project and other complementary funding from the regional housing board.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.0/1">I am grateful for those comments about Gurnhill lane. They show the Government's depth of understanding about this particularly acute problem. Will my hon. Friend the Minister give me an assurance that the Department will continue to support local people in ensuring that progress is much faster than it has been in the past, and that it will keep a finger on the pulse?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-20a.45.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" speakername="Meg Munn" colnum="45"  time="012:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070220/halltext/70220h0007.htm#07022049000503">
	<p pid="a.45.1/1">I can certainly give my hon. Friend that assurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/2">On the wider issues of housing market renewal, homelessness has fallen to a 23-year low. We have also ended the use of long-term bed and breakfast for families, which was so detrimental to their quality of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/3">The main housing challenge is to build more homes. Our ambition is to increase the rate of building additional homes to more than 200,000 per year during the next decade. New homes in Yorkshire and the Humber will be part of that. The figures reflect growth in the number of households, which is at its highest for more than 10 years because of changing household size.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/4">My hon. Friend raised the issue of migration. Continued international migration, including increased numbers of economic migrants from the European Union accession states since 2004, is a contributory factor. More than 90,000 new migrants have registered for national insurance numbers since 2001 in Yorkshire and the Humber, with 21,500 in 2005-06 alone. Local economies have benefited from the influx of migrant workers, who are meeting demand for staff and skills not previously satisfied by local people. They are filling unpopular low-paid, temporary or shift-work jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/5">There is currently uncertainty about the future housing needs of migrants, as it is difficult to forecast how many will come and how many will stay. There is anecdotal evidence that many are young and travelling without dependants. They are living in private rented accommodation, which is often overcrowded. Such conditions can underpin the speculative buy-to-let market, causing unsustainable price rises in some areas, and prop up poor-quality and poorly-managed properties. Public sector agencies must do more to understand better the impact of migrant workers on communities. Effective planning, engagement and communication are essential, especially if migrants settle for longer periods with their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/6">The region needs to build more homes, and a better mix of homes, to meet the demands of increased migration as well as changing household size, which is an important driver of the number of homes that are required. As has been pointed out, increasing problems of affordability undermine social cohesion. Local people find it increasingly difficult to enter the housing market near their work, and subsequently are locked out of the nation's growing prosperity. Consequently, more affordable housing is a priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/7">The Government are creating a range of options aimed at tackling the situation. We are already helping thousands of people to get on the housing ladder. For example, 120,000 households are being helped to buy a share of a home and get a first step on that ladder. But home ownership, even on a shared basis, is not the right option for everyone. For some, it is simply unaffordable. For others, renting is a better option because it provides flexibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/8">Falling investment under previous Governments created a shortage of social housing in many parts of the country. We have had significant success in reducing homelessness, but there are still too many households living in overcrowded or temporary accommodation. We will increase the supply of new social homes. We are on track for a 50 per cent. increase in new social rented homes in the three years between 2005 and 2008&mdash;30,000 homes by 2008. Nearly 3,000 affordable homes are planned for the Yorkshire and the Humber region between 2006 and 2008, including more than 400 in rural areas. We recognise that that will not meet all newly arising need, and we have pledged to make increasing the supply a priority in the 2007 comprehensive spending review.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/9">Local authorities and their partners can do more to deliver more affordable housing, including exploiting capacity through the planning system to meet needs, and making effective use of assets and private sector leverage. Today is important not only because this debate is taking place but because it is the day on which the Government will receive John Hills' report on the future role of social housing in England. The report provides an objective and comprehensive platform from which we can develop options for future policy within the wider housing reform agenda and debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-20a.49.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" speakername="Christopher Chope" colnum="49"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070220/halltext/70220h0008.htm#07022049000506">
	<p pid="a.49.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December</phrase>, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that he was doubling the rate of air passenger duty, with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-01">1 February 2007</phrase>, for all flights to and from the United Kingdom irrespective of when those flights had been booked. There has been a lot of fuss about that, with full page advertisements in the press referring to somebody called &quot;Greedy Gordon&quot;. What is all the fuss about? Extra taxes are not a new phenomenon for the Chancellor, and the tax increase is one of many that mean that we are now one of the most highly taxed nations in the world. However, this tax increase is different, because it has not been approved by Parliament. Furthermore, the tax is retrospective from the date of its announcement and it purports to be green when it is not. In this short debate, I hope to address those issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/2">The fact is that the tax has been brought in without being approved by Parliament and is therefore a constitutional outrage. It is without precedent. When the Select Committee on Treasury questioned the Minister, he was unable to refer to any precedent because there is none. After the Committee issued its scathing report last month criticising the Government for not having obtained parliamentary approval, the Minister claimed justification through a precedent in respect of tax on North sea oil. Needless to say, it turns out not to be a true precedent.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/3">If left unchallenged, the APD increase will become a precedent for future taxation without representation. Many years ago, in the American colonies, that was the cry: &quot;No taxation without representation&quot;. We have representation in this country, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer has chosen to bypass Parliament in respect of this tax. In the absence of a written constitution, the Standing Orders and procedures of the House are our constitution and protection against despotism. That the Chancellor of the Exchequer, tipped to be Prime Minister within a few months, can be so cavalier and contemptuous of Parliament is extremely worrying. Indeed, now is the time for him to show some contrition, as the Leader of the House did yesterday when he, too, tried to bypass and upset the procedures of the House in relation to the reform of the House of Lords.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/4">The unconstitutionality of the increase in APD is compounded by its retrospective nature. By <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-06">6 December 2006</phrase>, 4 million holidays had been sold by UK tour operators with departure dates from <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-01">1 February 2007</phrase> onwards. Of those, 1.3 million were winter holidays and 2.7 million were summer holidays. The Chancellor is charging doubled air passenger duty for each of those 4 million holidays. The Government have increased the cost after the contract has been made between the tour operator and the tour operator's customer. Almost all that extra cost will have to be paid for by the tour operators&mdash;ironically, because of legislation passed by the House against surcharges being passed on to passengers. The total cost for tour operators is likely to be some &pound;44 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/5">Tour operators are not the only people to be hit. Millions of individuals with flight-only bookings made before <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December</phrase> for travel from <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-01">1 February</phrase> are finding themselves subject to the extra tax, which is being collected at airports. Hard-working families going on half-term vacations with their children this week are finding themselves in the front line, as victims of retrospective legislation from a high-handed, tax-hungry Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/6">So the tax increase is unconstitutional and retrospective. It is also disingenuously being presented as a green tax. All the spin before and at the time of the pre-Budget statement was designed to create the perception that it is a green tax. Even the Minister, whom I welcome to the debate&mdash;he is becoming quite a veteran of parliamentary Committees on the subject of green taxes and air passenger duty&mdash;said on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">9 February 2006</phrase>, when being questioned by the Select Committee on Environmental Audit, that he did not regard it as a green tax. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/7" class="indent">&quot;The air passenger duty in many ways is not an entirely satisfactory tax. It was introduced...in the early 1990s. It has never been an environmental tax. It has certain sorts of perverse aspects built into the design. In other words, a more fuel-efficient plane filled with the same number of passengers pays the same rate of air passenger duty as an airline using a much less fuel-efficient plane, and actually a half-empty plane is rather less than a full plane, even though it is more efficient in terms of passengers per air miles travelled. First of all, it is not an environmental tax. Second, it does, however, contribute to the recognition that we have been very clear about, that the aviation industry has to pay the costs, the externalities if you like, that it imposes on society and on the environment. It is a significant contribution to that, but it is not an instrument that is well designed to achieving environmental ends.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/8">That was what the Minister said in February last year, and I have to say that I agree with every word of that statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/9">I agree with the Minister that aviation needs to cover its environmental costs, but it already does. That is the big fallacy that has not been exposed in the Government campaign to increase air passenger duty. Each year, UK aviation produces 36 million tonnes of CO2. Carbon is being traded at less than &pound;10 a tonne&mdash;some people say at &pound;7.50 a tonne. The cost of the carbon emitted from UK aircraft is therefore about two fifths of the yield of APD before the latest increase. If one takes the latest increase into account, the yield is only two tenths&mdash;one fifth&mdash;of the total. In other words, the total air passenger duty is five times as high as it needs to be to ensure that aviation covers its environmental costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/10">The fact that only &pound;1 in every &pound;5 of the new rates of APD would be needed to offset total UK air travel carbon emissions for carbon markets raises the issue of what will happen in 2011, when aviation will become part of the European Union's emissions trading scheme. Most objective commentators view the scheme as a means of providing positive encouragement via an effective market mechanism for companies to invest in more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly technologies to reduce fuel consumption. Is that still the Government's view? If so, will the Minister confirm that APD will be abolished in 2011, when it can be subsumed into the EU emissions trading scheme?</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/11">The evidence that the increase in APD is not a green tax is fortified by the fact that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has given no commitment that the proceeds of APD will be used for environmental purposes. He would not be able to make such an announcement, of course, without undermining his own purpose, which is to increase his revenues through the tax. That is why the tax was originally introduced by my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> back in the mid-1990s. That was avowedly to increase Government revenues, not to help the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/12">In case the Chancellor is thinking about using the extra money&mdash;about &pound;1 billion a year&mdash;for environmental investment, I suggest that he look closely at the shortfall in current taxpayer funding in aerospace sector research and development that was identified in the national aerospace technology strategy. Targets have been set to achieve a 50 per cent. reduction in carbon emissions, an 80 per cent. reduction in nitrogen emissions and a 50 per cent. reduction in external noise by 2020. However, that sustainable aviation strategy needs investment. The &pound;1 billion a year being raised from APD would make a useful contribution to that investment; it could be directed towards making environmental improvements.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/13">Meanwhile, Sir Richard Branson has undertaken to invest all the profits from his transport companies, estimated at about $3 billion over the next 10 years, in research to develop alternative fuels. He has also launched a major prize to encourage research into the removal of harmful emissions from the atmosphere. Virgin Atlantic is taking active steps to reduce the environmental impact of its activities. APD will not achieve anything for the environment compared to those private-sector, entrepreneurial, market-driven initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/14">Let us be frank: the increase in air passenger duty is oppressive and retrospective; it is a stealth tax on hard-working families, and the suggestion that it can be justified as being a green tax is utter baloney. I hope that, when Parliament is eventually given the chance to express an opinion on the increase, it will give it the thumbs down.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/15">The way in which the Government have dealt with APD contrasts most unfavourably with the way in which it was dealt with on previous occasions. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe introduced the concept of APD in his autumn statement of November 1993; he found himself in need of extra money, but he did not implement the tax until <phrase class="date" code="1994-11-01">1 November 1994</phrase>. My noble Friend Lord Cope of Berkeley, who was then Paymaster General, accepted that</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/16" class="indent">&quot;It would be unreasonable to expect tour operators to take the theoretical possibility of new taxes into account&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1994-01-31.643"><i>Official Report</i>, 31 January 1994; Vol. 236, c. 643</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/17">when they made their no surcharge guarantees.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/18">In March 2000, the Chancellor changed the APD rate to apply to journeys on or after <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase>, thereby giving tour operators and others more than 12 months notice. The Treasury explained that the delay would allow airlines and tour operators plenty of time to adjust their marketing and pricing strategies to the new structure. What is different this time? The short answer is that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has decided that he must compensate for the failure of so many of his other policies&mdash;not least, the failure to reduce benefit fraud&mdash;by raising an extra &pound;1 billion in stealth tax, but not allowing a reasonable time for its implementation. The term &quot;stealth tax&quot; was first conceived to describe the way in which the present Chancellor behaves, but even then it did not have its present connotation as a tax that has not even been approved by Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/19">The present increase in APD is out of context with the way in which it has been increased in the past. It is unnecessary, because aviation more than meets its associated environmental costs, and it will cut across the emissions trading scheme for carbon, which all sensible people think is a good way forward. Indeed, the Chancellor said in his pre-Budget statement that he thought it a good way forward, that it would eventually have to be done on a global basis but that, in the meantime, it would be sensible to set up a European Union scheme. That is being done, but it will not work unless the Government give air passengers a sense of fair play. We cannot expect air passengers to engage in voluntary carbon offsetting schemes and we cannot expect airlines to engage in such schemes unless they are treated fairly. The APD increase is not only unconstitutional; it is also very unfair.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" name="Christopher Chope">the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)</phrase> on securing this debate. He has a long-established interest in transport. He served as a junior Minister in the early 1990s, and for several years a decade later he was a shadow Transport Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/2">He asks what is all the fuss is about. I hope to explain. On the three principle counts on which he indicts the decision of <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December</phrase>&mdash;first, that it is retrospective; secondly, that it has no environmental benefit; and, thirdly, that it is a constitutional outrage without precedent&mdash;he is wrong. I hope to underline precisely the question that he asked&mdash;what is all the fuss about?</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/3">Before starting to put him right, I have to correct one other fact. It was officials, not Ministers, who were asked by the Treasury Committee about precedence. I appeared before the Committee last month, when I answered questions on air passenger duty. I was able to explain precedence and the parliamentary procedure that we are following in the case of APD, and I shall explain that a little later.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/4">It is certainly the case that the aviation industry is important to the United Kingdom. It directly employs more than 200,000 people, and it carries about a third of all UK exports by value. However, it is clearly right that aviation should pay the external environmental costs that it imposes on society. That was the conclusion reached in the Eddington report, published just before Christmas, and in the Stern review, which was published in October last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/5">The hon. Member for Christchurch questions the basis of the environmental cost of aviation. Those calculations, which have been published, were made on an established basis that is widely accepted. In 2003, we calculated and published the external environmental cost of aviation, which we set at &pound;1.4 billion. We made it clear that without a change of policy and practice, it was set to rise to &pound;4.8 billion by 2030. However, I must make it clear to the hon. Gentleman that those calculations are based on the social cost of carbon, not the traded price of carbon that he cites.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/6">Globally, aviation contributes to the danger of climate change through carbon and other emissions. It is responsible for about 1.6 per cent. of total greenhouse gas emissions. However, the figure is rising; although other sectors are reducing emissions, the demand for air travel continues to increase. In the UK, aviation is responsible for about 5.5 per cent. of our CO2emissions, but that could rise to as much as 15 per cent. by 2030.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/7">It is an international threat, so we are pressing for international action to tackle it. The UK has been the strongest advocate for the inclusion of aviation in the EU emissions trading scheme, and I am glad that the hon. Gentleman recognises the fact, because it will be the most cost-effective and efficient way to support the aviation sector to play its part in dealing with climate change. We had pressed for its inclusion in 2008, but the legislative proposal from the European Commission, which was published in December last year, welcome and important though it is, means that is unlikely to happen before 2011. We have therefore made it consistently clear that focusing on the EU scheme does not preclude the consideration of other economic instruments.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/8">Air passenger duty is clearly not the best policy. The hon. Gentleman cited at length the evidence that I gave to the Environmental Audit Committee a year ago, and I stand by that; it is entirely consistent with believing, as I said then, that it is not well designed to achieve environmental ends. However, it is available and it has some environmental gains. It certainly has a role to play, especially given the delay in applying other economic instruments.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/9">Before dealing with the three specific points made by the hon. Gentleman, I must be clear about the change announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December</phrase>. First, it will help the sector meet its environmental cost. Secondly, it will deliver resources for the coming spending round for the Government's priorities, including for public transport and the environment. Thirdly, it will deliver savings of about 0.3 million tonnes of carbon per year by the year 2010-11 and will have a wider effect on climate change year on year because of the impact on high-altitude emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/10">In total, we calculate that the environmental gain will be the equivalent of saving about 0.75 million tonnes of carbon every year from 2010. Therefore, despite this tax being a blunt policy instrument, there is an environmental gain. That was the first point contested by the hon. Gentleman. Secondly, he argued that it was a retrospective tax. I will explain how APD works. Despite its name, APD is a tax on the airlines and it is the operators of aircraft who pay it. That has been the case since <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> introduced the tax in the Finance Act 1994. The duty point is at departure and duty is payable on the basis of when a passenger flies. That makes it simple for airlines and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to administer. When a passenger booked their flight does not make any difference to APD liability, and that has been the case since 1994.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/11">With all previous APD changes, the new duty rates applied to flights booked before the announcement was made and that has been the case since 1994. APD is payable by the airlines and therefore the decision on covering the cost of the duty by charging passengers is for them&mdash;as it has been since 1994. If flights were booked before the date of an announcement, airlines must decide whether, and if so how, to pass on the cost to passengers. Since December and the pre-Budget report announcement, some airlines have done so and some have not. Some airlines are emailing passengers, some are posting news on their websites, some are debiting cards automatically and some are allowing payment at the airport. The large majority of air passengers are not paying more anyway because most airline tickets are not booked that far in advance. Industry data suggests that just 30 per cent. of passengers book their tickets two or more months in advance of their flight date. In any case, this tax is not unprecedented or unpredicted.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-20a.54.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1918" speakername="John Healey" colnum="54"  time="012:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070220/halltext/70220h0009.htm#07022049000509">
	<p pid="a.54.1/1">The hon. Gentleman's point about precedent related to the lack of parliamentary precedent for dealing with the tax in such a way. I will come on to explain exactly why it is not unprecedented; indeed, recent precedents exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/2">First, I will develop the point about the relationship between the airline and the passenger and who is the dutiable party. &quot;Taxes can change constantly&quot;. Those are not my words, but are a direct quote from the standard airlines' terms and conditions of ticket sale. I could cite any number of airlines' conditions of carriage, but I will refer to those of Ryanair:</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Taxes, fees and charges imposed on air travel are constantly changing and can be imposed after the date that your reservation has been made. If any such tax, fee or charge is introduced or increased after your reservation has been made you will be obliged to pay it (or any increase) prior to departure.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/4">That shows that the issue is not unpredicted and changes are incorporated into the terms of the contract between the passenger and the airline rather than being contrary to them. Again, that is in opposition to the hon. Gentleman's argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/5">The APD sits alongside the other non-governmental taxes, fees and charges that airlines levy on their customers&mdash;for example, fuel surcharges, airport taxes, other countries' taxes, insurance and security surcharges, and, in some cases, charges on additional hold luggage.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/6">Using the strongest words, the hon. Gentleman talked about a constitutional outrage. That is entirely inappropriate and wrong. Let me explain why. This tax is nothing like a constitutional outrage because the way in which we announced and implemented the rise was entirely in line with the conventions of the House. There is an established and accepted parliamentary process for dealing with such an increase and current legislative provision comes from the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968. It is common practice for rate changes to major taxes to have immediate or near-immediate effect. Pre-Budget report and Budget decisions need to respond flexibly to changing economic, environmental and social factors&mdash;for example, oil markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/7">The hon. Member for Christchurch was first elected to the House in 1983 and has served, albeit briefly, as a shadow Treasury Minister so he will know the procedure well. Resolutions to give effect to such tax changes are laid at the Budget, form part of the Budget debates and are voted on at the conclusion of those debates. Those resolutions are then legislated for as part of the Finance Bill that follows. There is nothing irregular or untoward about a tax change coming into effect before the Budget resolutions have been approved, and I will give a couple of precedents in relation to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/8">The pre-Budget report 2006 increased fuel duty in line with inflation from midnight on PBR day. Delaying that increase until, for instance, Budget day would have cost about &pound;200 million in this financial year alone. The 2005 pre-Budget report increased the rate of supplementary charges for north sea oil companies. That took effect for accounting years beginning on or after <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase>. In line with precedent and parliamentary procedure, the resolution for that was not voted on by Parliament until the 2006 Budget. That is the procedure that will be followed in the case of the air passenger duty change.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/9">In the meantime, I welcome this debate as it forms part of the proper parliamentary scrutiny of our tax decisions. Alongside this debate, the Chancellor, myself and Treasury officials have given evidence separately to the Treasury Select Committee. I have given evidence to the Select Committee on Environmental Audit and have answered more than 20 oral and written parliamentary questions on this subject. Questions have also been dealt with by the Leader of the House in business questions and in the House of Lords.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.1/1">Since that would entail a three or four-mile journey, I am happy to agree to that suggestion; it would be a pleasure to listen to the vice-chancellor.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/2">My hon. Friend was right to recall the decimation of the training of health professionals in the mid-1990s and to say that the effects of changes in such training are often felt years down the line. It was this Government who felt the effects of those changes and of the chronic staff shortages. She was right to say that the situation led to the spending of health resources on temporary, agency and bank staff and to the recruitment of large numbers of staff from overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/3">The NHS has a vested interest in getting this right and in working with the Department for Education and Skills to get the partnership properly balanced, so that it benefits all partners&mdash;the NHS, the universities and the students who wish to study in them. We owe a responsibility to all partners in this equation.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/4">Nurses and allied health professionals are at the heart of the NHS, providing care 24 hours a day,365 days a year. They care for the sick, support the vulnerable and work to prevent ill health in hospitals and in the community, and make a real difference to people's lives, day in, day out. They are supported by a vast array of scientists and technicians, who provide valuable laboratory and screening services, which are crucial to the diagnosis and treatment of patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/5">Before I address the specific problems that have occurred recently, it is important that I put today's discussion into context. From 2003-04 to 2006-07, the multi-professional education and training&mdash;MPET&mdash;allocation has increased by 20 per cent. That is a real commitment to investing in the education of the future NHS work force. Strategic health authorities receive the allocation as part of an overall funding envelope. Within that envelope, SHAs are expected to balance their budgets and to meet their commitments. That has helped the Government to fulfil the commitments set out in the NHS plan that was published at the beginning of this decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/6">I do not want to bandy too many statistics around, but I should say that more than 80,000 more nurses work in the NHS today than did so a decade ago. During that decade, the number of students entering nurse training has increased by 9,900, or 75 per cent. and there has been an increase of 3,700, or 94 per cent., in the number of allied health professionals. The medical school intake in England in 2006-07 was 6,451, which represents an increase of 2,702, or 72 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/7">I cite those figures because it is important to set out the context&mdash;the huge investment in the training of health professionals that has been made since this Government came to power. That investment has now fed through to a much expanded, better trained and better motivated work force in our NHS.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-20a.63.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" speakername="Andy Burnham" colnum="63"  time="013:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070220/halltext/70220h0010.htm#07022049000520">
	<p pid="a.63.3/1">I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that I do not avoid the question when I say that these issues are sometimes more of an art than a science; it is difficult to get the two sides of the equation right.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/2">In answer to the question put by my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North, I should say that it is true that in this financial year not all of the funds allocated for education and training have been spent on those things. In 2006-07, we allocated &pound;3.694 billion to education and training centrally and another &pound;460 million to bursaries; there was a real-terms increase, but I accept that not all of that money has fed through directly to training. I shall explain a little more about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/3">We invest in the development of the health care work force through the MPET levy, which goes out to SHAs. In 2006-07, that was part of a bundle of central budgets. We took that route to allow SHAs greater flexibility to use resources to tackle local priorities, including financial deficits. I understand what my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North says about hoping for the best, but I hope that she agrees that some decisions are best taken in the region that they affect. The emphasis is on giving more decision-making responsibility to the region and to the local level. Having said that, we can take things from this year so that we improve how we plan for our work force requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/4">In many ways, this was an exceptional year, because there was a reorganisation of both primary care trusts and SHAs. That will have impacted on the relationships within the different regions of the country and on discussions between higher education institutions and the health bodies. There have also been financial pressures on the NHS. I believe that my hon. Friend accepted that balancing the books was one of its crucial priorities and that everything flowed from having financial stability in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/5">My hon. Friend is correct that the situation has led to reductions in the number of commissioned training places and in the support for NHS organisations providing training places for students and trainees. In meeting their responsibilities to balance their budgets, SHAs have made savings from their overall MPET allocation. The savings are emerging at about 10 per cent. of overall MPET allocation and it is inevitable that they will have had some impact on higher education institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/6">I should make a point of context. In the coming years, as we take on board the points made about planning and adjusting for the future work force and examining the age profile of the existing work force, it is important to accept that the levels of investment in training and education may have to stabilise or to be adjusted, because in the early part of this decade we were correcting a previous decade of decimation in the funding of training of health professionals. There may be a period of adjustment as we return towards the right level.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/7">Although we will not ring-fence MPET funding, we want to put in place a more robust service-level agreement between the Department and the SHAs. That answers one of the questions that this debate has raised. We want that service-level agreement to pick out long-term work force planning requirements so that we ensure that the SHAs are responsible for spending their money with a view to their long-term planning needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/8">The committee that my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North mentioned has met, and it was agreed that the Department of Health would work with the Council of Deans to monitor the figures going into training. In addition, Universities UK and the Office of the Strategic Health Authorities have agreed to work together better to improve partnership arrangements between higher education institutions and SHAs.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/9">I would like to go into more detail on some of the things that we are doing. My hon. Friend is right to request this debate and to call for more action in this area to tighten up and improve on what has happened. I shall write to her to cover any points that I have not addressed.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Pope. I wanted to say a few words during the previous debate, but the Minister was saved by the bell.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/2">I welcome the Economic Secretary and am glad that he will reply to my debate. That is probably apposite, because I want to raise a number of concerns that go back some time&mdash;indeed to before the Government came into office.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/3">Politicians in this country are being neither open nor transparent about the state of public finances. Too much Government borrowing is funding current consumption, and we are mortgaging our future and expecting subsequent working generations, some of whom have not yet been born, to foot the bill for the cost of today's health care, education and pensions. That approach is neither prudent nor sustainable. That cavalier outlook to public expenditure has a fairly long political tradition in this country. After the second world war, Britain frittered away its Marshall aid on welfare consumption, in contrast, of course, with the Germans under Konrad Adenauer and Ludwig Erhard who invested the US-backed aid in rebuilding a world-beating German industry. My own party also failed to address that fundamental problem. During several periods in recent decades, particularly in the early 1970s and early 1990s, the national debt rose as a result of an unwillingness to take difficult and unpopular political decisions to curb public sector consumption.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/4">The Chancellor of the Exchequer's diversionary tactic over the past decade has been to use the mechanism of the private finance initiative&mdash;now the public-private partnership&mdash;to remove from the public balance sheet a proportion of the capital costs associated with the Government's much-vaunted investment in the public sector. The Treasury's response to criticism of the PFI has always been robust. The Chancellor argues that it was set up by the previous Conservative Administration, which is true, but he also says that his Government are simply adopting the same rules, but under tighter accounting standards. We were wrong then, and he is wrong now.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/5">The concept of unitary payments&mdash;the amalgamation of the capital and service costs of PFI projects&mdash;has been adopted as a supposedly simple method of allowing easy comparison between contractors during the PFI bidding process. However, that means that a huge amount of current capital expenditure, which the Government would have had to borrow against, is turned into future payments to contractors. In short, I contend that the PFI acts as a form of disguised borrowing, with repayment postponed for up to 30 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/6">There is no fundamental economic difference between PFI projects and the raising of cash from issues of Government debt. The principal and the interest must be repaid in both cases. The shrewd device of the unitary payment, however, gives rise to a misleading picture of future Government financial commitments. The obligation to repay principal sums under PFI projects should be accounted for as a Government debt obligation, and unitary payments which contain a capital-equivalent component should be treated in accounting terms in the same way as ordinary Government debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/7">I fear that it is a little difficult to describe the working of PFI projects without being beset with arcane or complex terminology, but I contend that the lack of transparency and use of off-balance-sheet funding is not acceptable in the private sector. Any company, never mind its auditors, adopting such tactics would be subject to critical scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/8">The supporters of PFI claim that one of its greatest benefits is the ability to transfer the risk of a project or service failure to the private sector. That assertion is often used to justify the superficially generous deals that operators of PFI contracts appear to have won in the course of negotiation. However, the significant profit potential that those contracts endow on operators, which is evidenced by the inflated share price of many companies that have won lucrative PFI contracts for school, transport system and hospital building here in London, comes at a real cost to future generations of taxpayers, who will foot the bill for today's consumption. All too often, far too little risk is transferred. I suspect that some of that is down to poor negotiation, with most operators&mdash;for example, the bus companies in London&mdash;running rings round their public sector counterparts when drawing up repayment terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/9">The Treasury admitted to the absence of risk transfer as long ago as July 2003 when it said in the document &quot;PFI: meeting the investment challenge&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/10" class="indent">&quot;It is impossible to predict with accuracy the percentage of PFI projects which may fail, but it is important to understand that in these extreme circumstances of failure...the Government will be prepared to terminate such contracts in accordance with its legal rights, even if at a loss to financial participants in the scheme. Where this happens, it will also act within its legal right to ensure that public services will be maintained.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/11">On the one hand, the Government commit themselves as the ultimate guarantor, and in truth many PFI projects cannot be allowed to fail if only for purely political reasons, as evidenced by the vast and unsustainable deficits accrued by many national health service trusts. On the other hand, there is often no sum representing the cost of being the ultimate guarantor on the Government's balance sheet.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/12">While, admittedly, some &pound;20 billion of the capital value of PFI projects has been included on the current Government balance sheet, estimated payments on the PFI contracts for the 25 years to 2030 total some &pound;138 billion, leaving &pound;118 billion of public sector debt currently unaccounted for. That, of course, takes no account of those PFI contracts that are set to last beyond 2030, which is, admittedly, a relatively small minority. Most independent calculations suggest that at the very least an additional &pound;25 billion should be added to the balance sheet by including a risk-rated percentage of total liabilities arising from PFI. Even that aggregate of &pound;45 billion&mdash;the existing &pound;20 billion and the additional &pound;25 billion&mdash;wildly understates the truth of the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/13">The fact is that the great majority of PFI projects are undertaken by local authorities as, I suspect, my constituents and those of all other London MPs will soon discover to their horror when the financial implications of many of the contracts agreed to by the Mayor of London become apparent. Worse still, there has never been any pretence about the balance of risk assessment being made for any of those projects and, again, given the vital social and political importance of the schemes, the Government as the ultimate guarantor will have to cough up.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/14">We have already seen the early skirmishes in what I suspect will be a particularly high-profile battle between the Treasury and the Mayor of London in relation to the budget for the 2012 Olympics which has, as some of us always predicted, spiralled totally out of control. Clearly, a guarantee from the Treasury would have immediately placed that entire project on the Government balance sheet and would amount to public borrowing. I understand, for that reason alone, why the Chancellor and the Financial Secretary would not have had much truck with that option.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/15">There is also a further category of debt, which is classified as contingent liabilities by the Office for National Statistics and the general rule is quite plain; financial reporting should follow the substance of the commercial effect of a transaction, not the form in which it is dressed up. As a result, some &pound;1.25 billion of bonds issued by London and Continental Railways&mdash;the body responsible for the channel tunnel rail link&mdash;were reclassified as Government debt in August 2005 because the debt was ultimately guaranteed by the Government and the bondholders were not deemed to be at risk from default. It had been hoped that the Statistics and Registration Service Bill, which received its Second Reading in the House in January, would provide the opportunity to end the uncertainty surrounding the Government's accounting. I suspect that that may prove to be wishful thinking, but the Bill has been in Committee and we shall no doubt examine it on the Floor of the House before too long.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/16">As some of our brightest investment banking brains create ever more complex financial instruments, the line between substance and form becomes ever more blurred. I accept that transparency in these matters may not always be easy to achieve, but the case of Network Rail gives rise to the strong suspicion that the Government have sometimes deliberately manipulated the calculation of Government debt. Following the collapse of Railtrack five years ago, Network Rail was set up in such a way as to be legally independent of the Government. The management restructuring and the fiction that Network Rail, as a company limited by guarantee, was under the control of its members has helped to mask the fact that the company ran up &pound;18.2 billion of debt by July 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/17">Just over two years ago, the Office for National Statistics received advice from the Department for Transport that the Government's support for Network Rail's borrowing was a &quot;contingent liability of government&quot; and was classified as such in the national accounts. Nevertheless, the Government have guaranteed the debt, and the fact that the company, which is limited by guarantee and has almost &pound;20 billion of debt, is still regarded as having an AAA credit rating gives rise to the presumption that the market, at least, recognises that those debts are effectively owed by the Government. If we were to put substance before form, therefore, they should be on the public balance sheet.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/18">One reason why criticism of PFI has been so muted is that, over the past decade, private sector operators, contractors, consultants, lawyers and accountants have made hay as advisers in a process that has proved extremely lucrative for them. It is incontrovertible that the explosion in PFI projects will vary from bad to appallingly bad value for the taxpayer, although as a means of avoiding up-front Government debt, they have also allowed an almost unprecedented level of school and hospital building.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/19">However, we need to stand back and face some harsh political facts. In the same way that privatisation under Conservative Governments in the 1980s and 1990s proved irreversible&mdash;even the present Government's pledge to reverse rail privatisation in the final year of the Conservative Administration had to be quietly dropped&mdash;so too will PFI, even though the positions will be reversed. In many ways, from the Labour party's point of view, that is the great genius of the vast expansion of such projects that has taken place since it came to office. The cost that the taxpayer will have to meet in the future for PFI projects that are agreed now&mdash;the agreements have been reached, and the projects have been or are being carried out, but they will have to paid for in the decades ahead&mdash;will amount to an ongoing additional burden on public expenditure over the next 25 years or so. However, the political fallout of trying to unravel PFI projects in essential services means that the room for manoeuvre for any future Conservative Government in public expenditure and taxation will be considerably limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/20">This country's economic fundamentals do not look so smart going forward, and we are simply kidding ourselves about the true costs of accounting in the future. Ironically, the Chancellor of the Exchequer recognised that expressly in his early justification for his golden rule that the Government will borrow over the economic cycle only to invest and not to fund current spending. He stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/21" class="indent">&quot;the Government does not pass on the costs of services consumed today to the taxpayers of the future&mdash;each generation is expected to meet the current costs of the public services from which they benefit.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/22">I have spoken in the House before about the principle of generational conflict, and nowhere is it more pronounced than in the area of pensions reform. Unfunded public pension liabilities mean that tomorrow's taxpayers will be obliged to fund today's ever-larger deficits. Alternatively, those who have made their pension contributions in good faith will see their entitlement collapse. Pensions payments are another example of deferred expenditure or, to put it another way, Government borrowing.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/23">Another element of the unsung extent of Government borrowing is in the field of public pensions. The Government have claimed that their unfunded public pensions liability amounted to &pound;460 billion as of <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>. However, that figure was calculated on the basis of a discount rate of 3.5 per cent., which the Government Actuary's Department has now revised downwards to 2.8 per cent. In answer to parliamentary questions on the matter, the Treasury accepts that the total liability for unfunded public pensions amounts to &pound;650 billion and that the unfunded element of local government pension schemes amounts to an additional &pound;70 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/24">Once more, there is no easy way out. In essence, today's pensioners and those retiring in the near future will be able to rely on considerably more generous benefits than those just entering the workplace, who will pay for those liabilities. Given that there are twice as many voters over 55 as there are under 35, and that they are twice as likely to vote, it is unrealistic, to put it mildly, to expect anyone in the political arena&mdash;on either side of the political divide&mdash;to stand up and state some fairly bald facts on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/25">Nevertheless, despite orchestrated campaigns by today's pensioner groups, the fact is that today's pensioners have never had it so good. The reason why many pensioners in their 70s and 80s believe that they have so little is that they have failed to pay anything like enough into the system to warrant what they now expect to receive. I am sad to say that such unrealistic expectations have been created, and are periodically raised, by politicians across the spectrum. That somewhat unpalatable message plays no part in the policy prospectus of any major political party, perhaps for rather obvious reasons. However, it is clear that such a state of affairs cannot continue indefinitely. The unspoken message of the political class to anyone under 30 is that their generation will need not only to foot the bill for the unfunded cost of pensions for those who are older, but significantly to lower their own financial expectations when the time comes for them to retire and benefit in some way from public pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/26">We run the risk of quite serious social unrest in the decades ahead, as the evidence of that appalling generational pyramid sales scam becomes evident. There is no doubt that future Government spending will have to be much higher, not least because there will be ever fewer people in the work force to subsidise an ever larger number of dependants, while the costs of the national health service, for example, will continue to rise exponentially as the population ages.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/27">I fear that off-balance-sheet financing is delaying some of the tough decisions that need to be made about the future of public spending. It also delays our debate about the way in which we will need to manage public services in the future to deliver equity and social cohesion, as well as to provide for the vulnerable and voiceless in our society. One of the more depressing prospects in the years ahead is that my generation will be seen as having had it easy, and I fear that this era will be seen as the best of times. We are consuming what we believe we are entitled to without regard to the costs, and future generations will have to meet the liabilities for that short-sighted and selfish approach.</p>
