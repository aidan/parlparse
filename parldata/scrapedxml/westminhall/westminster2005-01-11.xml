	<p pid=".1.4/1">It really is an honour to be granted the first debate in Westminster Hall in the new year. I wish to reciprocate on behalf of all hon. Members in the Chamber in sending our best wishes to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and to all the staff of the House for the healthiest and happiest of new years. It is clear from the number of colleagues who have joined me this morning that a popular subject has been granted for the first debate of the year. Given the wide geographical representation in the Chamber, we know how important community railways are to the nation. I shall limit my remarks to allow as many hon. Members as possible to raise the specific issues affecting the many local routes that they represent.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/2">Last week, I was reminded that the new year of 2005 is the 40th anniversary of the infamous work of Dr. Beeching and, in a personal context, it is 25 years since I started my railway civil engineering career, before entering the House of Commons in 1997. I hope to steer the debate with due reference to both anniversaries and to what have been the seven happiest and fruitful years of my life as one of the joint chairman of the all-party railways group of which you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, are an active member.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/3">What Dr. Beeching did 40 years ago was fundamentally a major error. Such action was pessimism over optimism and a pessimistic assessment of how much the rail network deserved to survive. Today's debate will link back to what has happened during the past 40 years and will demonstrate how far the potential for community railways can be taken.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/4">Community railways are really about local people and partnerships. In my constituency of Scarborough and Whitby, the Esk valley route from Whitby to Middlesbrough through the North Yorkshire moors national park, the North Yorkshire moors railway and the route along the Yorkshire coast from Scarborough through Bridlington to Hull are good examples of the type of railways that we shall be considering this morning; it is a list of railways that Dr. Beeching did not manage to cut. Given such an historic context, we must define what is meant by a community railway.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/5">In the 1950s, significant parts of the network were being closed as the spread of the private car and the lorry took away much of the local railway's traditional business. In 1963, the Beeching report concluded that about a third of the network should be closed along with many local stations on main lines. The programme was vigorously pursued for five years against strong community opposition. In 1968, it was evident that such an approach could not continue and the policy started to change. The then Transport Minister, Barbara Castle, introduced a subsidy payment for services that did not quite pay their way. It reflected the gap between income and costs and recognised the social and political value of particular local lines. Later, it was consolidated into the passenger service obligation grant under the Railways Act 1974, which lasted until it was replaced by franchise support mechanisms and payments on privatisation between 1996 and 1997. The recent work by the Government and the Strategic Rail Authority responds to the situation today and seeks to repair the historic trend of decline and ultimate closure of our important local community routes.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/6">The community rail development strategy, which was published last November, follows naturally from those historic strands. It is based on the wishes of the communities served by key lines around the country to remain connected to the national rail network and on the concept of a different category of local railway, separately specified, with standards appropriate to its use. It builds on the wishes of local communities to be actively involved in the development of their railway. Essentially, it is about putting those lines on a sustainable basis by bringing costs and income closer together. It recognises that continued subsidy will be required and needs to be commensurate with the value of the railway to the community in terms of economic development, accessibility, social inclusion and the environment, as well as fitting in with spatial development plans and fulfilling a role as backbone of local public transport.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/7">The strategy provides the first opportunity for many years&mdash;perhaps 40 years&mdash; to consider the development of community railways in their own right. Previous policies focused on principal routes or market segments, with little regard paid to the effect on local and rural railways. Fares and standards are often a by-product of decisions made to meet the needs of main lines, but the new strategy provides an opportunity to consider separately the unique characteristics of the much-loved and much-valued community railways.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/8">Many hon. Members have discovered first hand from debates and visits by the all-party railways group as well as recent sittings of the Transport Select Committee, how important the community railways are to local people. When I have finished speaking, I hope to hear wider contributions from the Floor to support the arguments for many valued local railways from all over the country.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/9">As I look forward into the new year, the outlook for rural railways is positive. Publication of the Strategic Rail Authority's community rail development strategy on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-22">22 November</phrase> last year, with the Secretary of State's strong support, was a turning point for rural and local railways in the United Kingdom and perhaps helped to define the new concept of community railways. The new policy suggests development of more lightly used lines in a sensible, cost-effective way, Every Member of the House must applaud that. It will also help to reduce operating costs and to drive up use and revenue. That is important for this sustainable objective.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/10">The proposals include seven demonstration projects, and I am pleased that the Esk valley route in my constituency is one of the seven routes. Those projects will provide practical experience of the best ways of achieving the goals set out by the strategy. I hope that every Member of the House will play a full part in becoming involved in the projects in their own localities to ensure that that is delivered.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/11">Fifty-seven routes have been identified as suitable for future community rail designated routes and perhaps operating standards can be simplified, as is common in other parts of Europe. It is fair to note that much of the policy that has been developed during the past decade or so has its roots, in terms of best practice, in Germany and Scandinavia. I am pleased that many hon. Members have been able to see that work in practice.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/12">The key component of the strategy is the community rail partnerships. They have been extremely successful in winning new business for the rural railways. I believe that the SRA's statistics confirm that. The partnerships bring together local communities, local authorities and the railway industries, with the shared goal of improving service and driving up the use of rural lines. Many of them have been effective in bringing in external funding for projects, including station improvements and extra train services. They go beyond the simple transport agenda and link into wider strategies for accessibility, rural regeneration, social inclusion and sustainable tourism. A growing number are structured as social enterprises and generate some of their resources from practical initiatives such as on-train catering services and events, running feeder bus services, organising community car clubs and consultancy services&mdash;all good examples of the type of work done in the Esk valley.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/13">Despite that positive background, media coverage of the recent launch was mixed, to say the least. Where local journalists had been briefed and were aware of the work of their local community rail partnerships, the coverage was positive and well informed. However, that was not the case with some national newspapers. That led to scare stories about closures and a Beeching mark 2, which undermined the strategy's positive message.</p>

	<p pid=".3.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the negative coverage was not helped by the remarks of some in the upper reaches of government about transporting round the country large volumes of fresh air? Does he also agree that, if the SRA brief were widened from its laudable aim of improving the revenue from and usage of existing passenger rail lines to include the restoration of passenger services such as the national forest line in north-west Leicestershire and south Derbyshire, that would also be worthy of attention and investment?</p>

	<p pid=".5.4/1">I think that that particular train was well out of timetable, but I agree with my hon. Friend's point. As my speech comes to its conclusion, I want to put some key questions to the Minister. I am sure that we are all interested to hear the Government's response.</p>
	<p pid=".5.4/2">I was talking about the direct role that Members of Parliament can play in their local community rail partnerships and how, if such partnerships have not been formed, hon. Members can help form them in their area. I have played a small but, I hope, significant, role in supporting the work of the Esk Valley rail partnership in the past eight years or so. Given my expertise of the rail industry, I hope that that has been a positive contribution to the debate.</p>
	<p pid=".5.4/3">It is worth noting some heroes in that area. On behalf of the Esk valley railway development company, I pay full tribute to the original development officer, Neil Buxton, who handed over to his successor, Tony Smare, in 2003 after many years working with the local community to sustain and build the community rail partnership&mdash;a partnership that saw groups such as the women's institute and local parishes work closely alongside the county council, the North York Moors national park and the North York Moors railway to sustain and in some senses take ownership of those vital community assets.</p>
	<p pid=".5.4/4">My first-hand experience of working with the Esk valley railway development company allows me to focus on three key work streams that are important in my locality&mdash;marketing, rail operations and infrastructure. Those are significant and important because the franchise has just been transferred in my part of the world and there needs to be continuity of working to ensure that the good work that has been invested over many years is not lost.</p>
	<p pid=".5.4/5">I pay tribute to Network Rail, in particular, for working in partnership with local groups and the local newspaper, the <i>Whitby Gazette</i>, to recognise the importance of renewing the final mile or so of track into Whitby to improve journey times, rideability and the overall performance of an important piece of railway that had seen little attention since those black days of Beeching.</p>

	<p pid=".6.3/1">My hon. Friend tries to prevent me from closing my more parochial remarks, but I am coming on to some key questions that I am sure that all hon. Members want the Government to answer.</p>
	<p pid=".6.3/2">I hope that the Minister will restate the Government's full support for the strategy and the intention to transfer it, with all its formal powers, to the Department for Transport once the SRA is wound down. I hope that she will express support for community rail partnerships across the United Kingdom and for the work of the Association of Community Rail Partnerships, which is the national federation of community rail partnerships. I hope that she will include a commitment to maintain Government funding for ACoRP once the SRA and the Countryside Agency funds cease.</p>
	<p pid=".6.3/3">The commitment to the development of a rural rail network, which we all want to see, will bring great benefits and give community rail partnerships throughout the country greater confidence, and enable them to understand better how local circumstances can bring about much-needed change and the flexibility that we have heard about in some of the interventions, and how they can improve and extend services.</p>
	<p pid=".6.3/4">I hope that I shall be able to tease a reassurance out of the Minister that the proposals set out in the Railways Bill do not herald a systematic closure programme. Any future proposed closure programme should take account of the important social exclusion issues that we have mentioned briefly this morning.</p>
	<p pid=".6.3/5">We need to hear about the Government's commitment to get the best from rail and complementary transport in rural areas. There is much scope to develop many of the integrated bus and rail links, as well as to promote walking and cycling to stations. In rural areas, particularly national park areas&mdash;such as the one in my own constituency&mdash;the spread of public transport is very thin, and it makes obvious sense to ensure strong integration between bus and rail to maximise the potential of the network.</p>
	<p pid=".6.3/6">This year will present a number of challenges to the community rail partnerships and to the Association of Community Rail Partnerships. The Countryside Agency and the Strategic Rail Authority have been major funders of vital work and of community rail partnerships. Both organisations will be wound down this year, and their funding support will cease. It is essential that ACORP should continue to develop its positive work with the rail industry and the Government. The funding gap must be bridged and properly filled. What has been achieved so far has come from a real sense of partnership, and I pay tribute to what has happened in Scotland and Wales, where generous support has been provided to community railways.</p>
	<p pid=".6.3/7">In conclusion, not only the future development of transport links but the vitality and economic regeneration of communities such as Scarborough and Whitby depends on good transport links and good access to the rest of the country. The strategy, when it is fully developed and given its head with the voice of local people at the forefront, will create the prospect in my area and many others of reopening many of the missing railway links that were axed by Beeching 40 years ago. One such important link is the eight-mile route from Pickering to Rillington Junction, which offers the revitalisation of transport from Whitby, in my constituency, to the city of York.</p>
	<p pid=".6.3/8">It is extremely important that we have reassurance from the Government. I commend the work of the SRA in introducing this strategy, and I pay full tribute to Mr. Chris Austin, the executive director of community rail development, who said in a covering letter to the SRA that was also sent to all hon. Members:</p>
	<p pid=".6.3/9" class="indent">&quot;Success will be seen as a railway which is sustainable and which contributes to a vibrant local and rural economy, as well as helping to meet Government targets on accessibility, the environment and social inclusion.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".6.3/10">I hope that the Government believe that, and that the Minister will confirm it during the debate.</p>

	<p pid=".8.1/1">I note your request that we make short speeches, Mr. Deputy Speaker, given that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1178" name="Lawrie Quinn">the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Lawrie Quinn)</phrase>, who opened the debate, has spoken for almost one third of the time available to us.</p>
	<p pid=".8.1/2">I want to speak about two lines in my constituency, the Maidenhead-Marlow and Twyford-Henley lines. They are both designated in the Government's plans as future community railways&mdash;a proposal that has caused much concern to my constituents and those of my hon. Friends the Members for Henley (Mr. Johnson) and for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman), both of whom are actively taking up this cause on behalf of their constituents.</p>
	<p pid=".8.1/3">I begin by saying that I have no problem with the concept of the community railway. I am sure that there are lines in the country for which the concept is right and entirely suitable. It will be appropriate to designate such lines as community railways; <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1178" name="Lawrie Quinn">the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Lawrie Quinn)</phrase> has spoken lyrically about his own Esk valley line. However, I do not believe that such a designation would be appropriate for heavily used lines that form major parts of the commuter railway network.</p>
	<p pid=".8.1/4">The hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby referred to lightly used lines. In its consultation document, the Strategic Rail Authority discussed lines that were local and rural in character. The two lines that affect my constituency&mdash;Maidenhead-Marlow and Twyford-Henley&mdash;are not lightly used. In peak hours, they are a main part of the commuter network and carry residents from Wargrave, Cookham and Furze Platt into Maidenhead and Twyford, on to the main line and then, predominantly, into London Paddington, although some people commute west. The lines are heavily used in peak hours and it would not be appropriate to designate them as community railways.</p>
	<p pid=".8.1/5">The hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby paid tribute to the role of the Strategic Rail Authority in bringing forward the proposals. That authority, which was set up only four years or so ago by the Deputy Prime Minister, is now being abolished by this Government. The abolition of the SRA means that the responsibility for such decisions will fall to the Department for Transport.</p>
	<p pid=".8.1/6">The question for my constituents is whether they can trust this Government to look after the future of their heavily used branch lines. From their experience of this Government's transport policy, their answer must be a resounding no. Anyone who tries to fit on the 7.27 from Twyford to Paddington on a weekday morning&mdash;courtesy of this Government's change of our local railway franchise from Thames Trains to First Great Western&mdash;knows that. Sadly, our local commuter lines are being pushed to one side in favour of long-distance trains. What does that say about the future of branch lines such as Maidenhead-Marlow and Twyford-Henley?</p>

	<p pid=".13.0/1">I wish to make just a few comments. The line I want to talk about has already been referred to by the hon. Members for Derby, North (Mr. Laxton) and for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber).</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/2">The way in which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1158" name="Colin Pickthall">the hon. Member for West Lancashire (Mr. Pickthall)</phrase> started his speech was quite telling. He began by saying that he was very excited when he first heard of the community railway idea, but then became very depressed by the reaction to it. I wonder whether that is not something like the experience in respect of what we hear from the Government. An idea starts off, and, yes, we may all agree with it and agree that there is some logic behind it. But we are haunted by the Chancellor's words: we cannot believe a word that they say. He said that of his neighbour, and the truth is that the British public are now saying it of the Government. That is why there has been a great deal of scepticism, to put it mildly, about what community railways are all about and what they will actually deliver.</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/3">I have received a letter from the friends of the Derwent valley line&mdash;as, obviously, have other hon. Members. I want to discuss that line because it serves an important part of my constituency. It goes from Derby up to Matlock. It includes the stations of Matlock Bath, Cromford, Whatstandwell, Ambergate, Belper, Duffield and Derby. A good half of that line&mdash;the section from Ambergate&mdash;is on the same line that is used by inter-city railways. Virgin and Midland Mainline use it for their main services. The line is designated to become a community line&mdash;it is not in the first seven, but it is one of the other 57 lines that we have heard about. Who will have the priority on it, if it is designated as such? That worries me.</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/4">The concerns expressed to me by the friends of the Derwent valley line have a lot of legitimacy. There is much concern about what will be the consequences of the Government's overall proposals for the line, and also about what will come out of the Railways Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/5">We have heard lots of comments this morning about the Strategic Rail Authority and its published document on the community rail development strategy. The Government set up the SRA, and they are now abolishing it in the Railways Bill. When the Deputy Prime Minister set up the SRA he informed us that it would be the answer to all the problems facing the railway industry, and the present Secretary of State for Transport has told us that the Bill is the answer to all the problems currently facing the railways. Therefore, it is not surprising that the British people are sceptical about what the community railways policy will actually deliver.</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/6">The hon. Member for Amber Valley and the friends of the Derwent valley line have mentioned the abolition of the Countryside Agency, and the fact that future funding for the community rail partnerships in general and the Derwent Valley Rural Transport Partnership in particular is not guaranteed after 2005. I want the Minister to assure us that that funding is secure, and that finding that money will not suddenly fall on any of the relevant councils&mdash;Derbyshire county council, Derbyshire Dales district council, Amber Valley borough council or Derby city council. It would be a travesty if the funding were not in place and we were expecting any of those councils to find that money.</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/7">We all know about the problems with regard to local authority resources. There has been an increase of 15 per cent. in passenger traffic on the Derwent valley line in the past six months. The areas that the line serves attract many tourists in the summer months, as well as at other times of the year; lots of people go up to Matlock and Matlock Bath. The Minister's constituency abuts mine and she knows the area well. We also have a huge number of visitors to the Peak district. Therefore, there is a lot of pressure on the roads and urban transport.</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/8">Today seems to be a transport day in the House of Commons. There is not only this debate but a debate on road safety this afternoon in the main Chamber; the Railways Bill is also being debated in Committee. There is a lot of attention on transport today, but there is also much concern. I have not had enough time, but I want to ensure that the Minister has time to respond to some of the interesting points raised by many hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/9">There is much scepticism about the underlying motives behind community railways. As my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1106" name="Theresa May">the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase> said, there is a case to be made for them in certain areas where the railway interferes with no other lines. I am concerned about the Derwent valley line&mdash;particularly about whether a community railway or one of the larger companies, such as Midland Mainline or Virgin will get priority when they operate on the same tracks. My constituents are also concerned about that.</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/10">Whenever there is any threat or change to the railway service&mdash;there was a possibility earlier this year that some services would be removed&mdash;that issue fills my postbag. I thought that the Government wanted to encourage people to use the railway. That is what they say, but they must give assurance that they are not putting services at risk.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-11.21.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/703" speakername="Charlotte Atkins" colnum="21"  time="unknown" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050111/halltext/50111h01.htm#50111h01_spnew37">
	<p pid=".21.5/1">I agree that there have been issues about the inter-city lines, for instance, taking precedence over local lines and I know that many Members have raised that matter, including in my area. We are looking at that.</p>
	<p pid=".21.5/2">As the right hon. Lady has jumped up at this point, I will take on board the issues that she raised about the Twyford to Henley-on-Thames and Maidenhead-Marlow branch lines. She talked of the strategy being imposed on her local community. I assure her that local consultation will take place prior to the designation of any lines. We believe that there is scope for some operational improvements in Marlow in particular, where the current signalling is restrictive. By designating it a community railway, there is a real opportunity to make that a priority for attention. However, I want to make it clear to her and to other hon. Members who raised the issue that it will be down to local consultation and if the local community does not want such a designation, it does not have to happen.</p>
	<p pid=".21.5/3">Returning to the points that I was making, the second key issue is to drive down costs. The key drivers of cost on the railway are the maintenance and renewal of the infrastructure, the lease charges for trains and staff costs. There is scope for reducing those outgoings on community lines through track maintenance strategies more closely aligned to the needs of the routes, through better use of rolling stock and competitive pressure in the rolling stock market, and through training staff with a variety of skills.</p>
	<p pid=".21.5/4">Assessing the exact costs of community rail routes is difficult because almost all routes are part of a larger network. More work is required on that issue and it will be carried out through seven pilot projects that the SRA has identified, including as my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby mentioned, the Esk valley line from Middlesbrough to Whitby, which runs through his constituency. That work will necessarily involve the support of Network Rail and the Office of Rail Regulation.</p>
	<p pid=".21.5/5">Thirdly, the strategy relies on greater community involvement. That includes the industry working with local authorities and local users, and the establishment of community rail partnerships. Those are not-for-profit organisations that include local authorities, rail users, the train operator and often Network Rail. Some may also include local businesses, national park authorities or other local stakeholders. They are established by mutual agreement and run by a committee of the stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid=".21.5/6">Hon. Members have raised a number of issues. One of the issues raised by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1090" name="Judy Mallaber">the Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber)</phrase> related to the Countryside Agency. The Countryside Agency has funded ACoRP as a rural transport partnership project since 2000&ndash;01. A number of Members raised issues about the future of rural transport partnerships and that programme. The programme was never intended as an initiative that would last for all time. Existing commitments will be met until the end of March 2006. At that point, the Countryside Agency will hand over its decision making to regional development agencies. Each RDA will determine the priorities for its region and will certainly give priority to such rural initiatives.</p>

	<p pid=".28.1/1">I agree with that sentiment entirely. Some restoration work on the canals that I have seen throughout the country&mdash;for example, in my hon. Friend's area of Wiltshire and in Northamptonshire&mdash;is splendid and has undoubtedly raised public awareness of the subject. In itself, that can act as a magnet to encourage people to dig a bit further. Properly structured museums that are tailored around that important educational niche can provide potential income for those museums and do a service to our young people. As I suggested, some imaginative tourism enterprises could be developed around the museums and the surrounding waterways.</p>
	<p pid=".28.1/2">My right hon. Friend the Minister may not be in a position to say yes&mdash;which is the word we are looking for&mdash;to all the demands being placed on her today, but in introducing the debate and before, with your permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, allowing my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester to speak, I must say that I hope my right hon. Friend the Minister agrees to work with colleagues in the Chamber, and, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead said, with the many other colleagues from throughout the country who are interested in this aspect of heritage, to find a practical way forward in the interests of our national heritage.</p>
	<p pid=".28.1/3">The nation's industrial heritage&mdash;built as it is on sea-going vessels, coal and the railways&mdash;has another important strand, which is that of the canals. We should never forget the importance of the canal network in the development of this nation. It would be a tragedy if those collections were broken up or allowed to deteriorate, and I urge my right hon. Friend to do her best to help to deliver what we seek.</p>

	<p pid=".29.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I shall try to keep my contribution to no more than about 60 seconds, because I want to give the Minister time to reply. I concur with everything that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1114" name="Andrew Miller">the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller)</phrase> said. We have been working on the issue for some time and I am pleased that the debate is taking place.</p>
	<p pid=".29.1/2">I also wish to thank some people, not least Roger Hanbury of the National Waterways museum, for everything that we have tried to do together on the issue. I am sure that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" name="David Drew">the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> will join me in thanking the docks historian and secretary of Friends of the National Waterways Museum, Hugh Conway-Jones, for the work that he has done with us, as well as volunteers such as Audrey Fielding and many other constituents. The key thing for us in Gloucester, in Daventry and in Ellesmere Port is to ensure that the National Waterways museum can continue and can compete.</p>
	<p pid=".29.1/3">We welcome the Government's decision to introduce free entry to museums. At the same time, we are concerned about the difference in subsidy between our National Waterways museum and that of the national railway, maritime and mining museums. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will consider seriously this request for an additional &pound;1.1 million. In Gloucester, that money is important not only for our heritage. More than &pound;1 billion is flowing into Gloucester docks for regeneration and we want to be able to remind the next generation&mdash;because of tourism and education and because of their history&mdash;why Gloucester docks are so important. A waterways museum is a key part of achieving that.</p>

	<p pid=".33.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to raise such an important issue this afternoon. As opinion poll evidence shows, which I shall quote in a moment, our electors believe that immigration and asylum is one of the most important matters that affects society. The unprecedented level of immigration into this country is accompanied by a range of consequences, such as the polarisation of residents from 1 per cent. ethnic minorities in the New Forest district to more than 50 per cent. in Newham.</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/2">Our failure to integrate ethnic minorities has led to the creation of an ethnic vote, which has been long exploited by Labour in our inner cities and brilliantly so against Labour during the Leicester, South by-election. It was put into overdrive by the Minister for Energy and E-Commerce, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1138" name="Mike O'Brien">the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr O'Brien)</phrase>, in his recent attempt to whip up Muslim sectarian feeling against my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/974" name="Michael Howard">the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase>, the Leader of the Opposition. The effect of the failure to integrate ethnic minorities is the creation of areas in our cities in which the English language is alien and the British culture subordinate. In the words of the Government's community cohesion panel, which reported in July 2004:</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/3" class="indent">&quot;There are . . . concerns about the speed at which newcomers can be accommodated . . . The identity of the host community will be challenged . . . The 'pace of change' (for a variety of reasons) is simply too great in some areas at present.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/4">My first question concerns whether the Government encourage integration or multiculturalism.</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/5">Another objection people have to the high level of immigration is the apparently unfair treatment of the majority community. That was exemplified most recently by the different treatment by the Birmingham Repertory theatre and the BBC of the plays &quot;Behtzi&quot; and &quot;Jerry Springer&mdash;the Opera&quot;, which were perceived as deeply offensive to the Sikh and Christian religions respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/6">While we are about it, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-26">26 December</phrase>, <i>The Sunday Times </i>reported:</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/7" class="indent">&quot;The Inland Revenue is considering recognising polygamy for some religious groups for tax purposes. Officials have agreed to examine 'family friendly' representations from Muslims who take up to four wives under sharia, the laws derived from the Koran.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/8">Perhaps the Minister is in a position to tell us that that was a Boxing day joke. It is not surprising that, when people consider that it might be racist to oppose such culturally unfamiliar concepts, they say that they are not ashamed of being called racist. People vote for extremist parties, and parties that while not extremist, are robustly unafraid of addressing race and immigration. Those are some of the consequences.</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/9">The final consequence is the huge pressure of overcrowding on public services and housing, in particular, in London and the south-east of England. Let no one say that such issues are not widely recognised. A YouGov poll showed that 74 per cent. of people believed that too many immigrants are coming into Britain. As <i>The Economist </i>put it a month ago today:</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/10" class="indent">&quot;Londoners, young people and the middle classes can normally be counted on to hold more liberal views, but not, it seems, when it comes to immigration. Their sentiments are virtually identical . . . A Eurobarometer poll earlier this year&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/11">last year, that is&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/12" class="indent">&quot;found that 41 per cent. saw immigration as one of the two biggest problems faced by the nation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/13">Of course, the Prime Minister&mdash;ever ready to launch an eye-catching initiative&mdash;was not far behind. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-19">19 December</phrase>, <i>The Guardian </i>reported:</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/14" class="indent">&quot;Blair looks at points plan to outflank Tories on migrants . . . Blair and his election co-ordinator, Alan Milburn, are said to be determined to show that asylum and immigration are under control . . . Sources said . . . 'We can't just sit there and say &quot;It's all fine.&quot;&mdash;we look like an incumbent government that is just complacent. There is absolutely no desire to get tough just for the sake of it'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/15">My second question to the Minister concerns whether he is planning to get tough. If so, is that because he thinks that it is necessary to get tough or will he do so just to impress a concerned electorate? If he gets tough, what will he do to cut the numbers of migrants to these islands?</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/16">Pressure on housing is overwhelming. Just before Christmas, I heard of a proposal to build between 14,000 and 27,000 new houses in my constituency, which would increase its population by 25 per cent. They would be part of the 1.2 million houses designated by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for the south-east and eastern regions. Those proposals are causing untold anguish and conflict, as well as the necessity for massive public and private infrastructure investment. They have, of course, been rejected both by the South East England and the East of England regional assemblies.</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/17">The proposals coincided with the admission by the Government for the first time that immigration will increase the number of households in England by 1.2 million over 20 years to 2021. That figure comes from a written answer in the House of Lords. That is double the previous estimate of fewer than 600,000, which was based on 1996 projections of migrant numbers. One in every three new households a year&mdash;that is 60,000&mdash;will be formed due to international migration; 55 per cent. will be in the three Euro regions of London, the south-east and the east. That is one of the most crowded areas in Europe. The rate of new household formation in London will be doubled from 26,000 a year to 46,000 a year.</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/18">Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch UK, stated:</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/19" class="indent">&quot;It is completely irresponsible for the Government to promote immigration without taking account of the resultant intense pressure on housing and public services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/20">Therefore, my third question to the Minister is whether the effect on demand for housing was taken into account when formulating the Government's immigration policy. Do the Government accept that the consequence of increasing immigration is increasing pressure on housing in the south and east of England?</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/21">Of course, we are not only talking about housing; other services are put under considerable pressure. There are some schools in London in which more than half of the pupils in the first year do not speak English. The Government do not collect those statistics, but some local authorities do. The Government do not know how many pupils at the age of five are able to be taught through the medium of English in our schools.</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/22">There is pressure on hospitals and all the other public services. My constituents cannot get a dentist. Today, I received an e-mail from a friend in north Nottinghamshire who told me the same. He cannot get a dentist in that part of the world. That consequence cannot be detached from the large additional numbers of people depending on our public services.</p>

	<p pid=".38.2/1">I would like to take the opportunity presented by this debate today to raise one aspect of the immigration rules: visa charges for international students attending education in the UK. For the past month or so, I have been trying unsuccessfully to secure an Adjournment debate on the subject, so I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1291" name="Andrew Turner">the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> for securing a debate on a topic whose broad remit allows me to concentrate on this specific issue.</p>
	<p pid=".38.2/2">Having heard the hon. Gentleman's opening comments, however, I was tempted to divert my comments in another direction. Although he has raised some valid questions, it seems to me that under the guise of telling us that he wants a serious debate on the matter, he is giving circulation to a number of anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant myths about the effect of immigration on public services and so on, which are entirely unacceptable. I shall be interested to see how the more liberal face of conservatism on the Opposition Front Bench distinguishes itself from the comments of the island backwoodsman who introduced the debate.</p>
	<p pid=".38.2/3">I shall not digress and will speak to the issue that I want to address and that has been a matter of concern to many organisations involved in higher education in this country, including Universities UK and the British Council. It has been raised directly with me by Edinburgh university students' association and constituents of mine who work in the area. It is particularly relevant to cities, such as Edinburgh, that have a large student population, many of whom come from overseas.</p>
	<p pid=".38.2/4">The principle of charging for leave-to-remain visas was introduced in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 and, as the Minister knows, there has been recent Home Office consultation on the matter, the outcome of which has not yet been announced. The big problem, as those who have been involved know, is that we charge those already in the UK who require leave-to-remain visas or extensions of such visas, to allow them to complete their studies. The charge is currently &pound;155 or &pound;250, depending on how the application is made, and, under the consultation, it could rise to almost &pound;500.</p>
	<p pid=".38.2/5">The proposal is of great concern to the organisations to which I just referred. It certainly risks deterring overseas students from coming here to study. It is widely recognised that it is in the interests of the UK, and not just of the students concerned, that we should encourage international students to come here. In cities such as Edinburgh, overseas students and the economic activity that they bring with them is a major element of the local economy. The Prime Minister himself recognised that when he launched his initiative on international students in 1999 with the objective of attracting more international students to the UK and the long-term aim of generating long-lasting trade and diplomatic links for the UK. He rightly spoke at that time of the important contribution of international students and of the need for greater efforts to be made to attract more of them here.</p>
	<p pid=".38.2/6">Many international students do not have to pay the higher charge for visas or visa extensions, but the evidence is that many do. Hon. Members may have received a helpful briefing from Universities UK, which is a highly respected organisation. It states that many entrance clearance officers do not seem to follow the UK Visas guidelines that they should give students leave to remain for the duration of their course plus at least several months when they first make application for a visa. As a result, although students get the benefit of the lower charge when they first apply from outside the UK, they have to renew their visa at the higher charge&mdash;Members will understand that that is a potential deterrent to many students&mdash;and international students who have gone into higher education from school or from further education, or who decide to remain as research students having completed an undergraduate degree here, may also be hit with the higher charge.</p>
	<p pid=".38.2/7">Let me make it clear that I do not object to the principle of requiring those who apply for visas of any type to make a contribution towards the cost of administering the system, just as a UK citizen pays towards the cost of being issued with a passport. However, many organisations that are involved with international students believe that the Home Office would drive away thousands of potential international students from the UK were it to implement the proposals. To our short-term and long-term detriment, they would likely go to our competitors in Europe and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid=".38.2/8">My hon. Friend the Minister knows that this issue concerns many Members, particularly those such as myself with a significant further and higher education presence in their constituency. More than 70 MPs, including me, have supported the early-day motion of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/779" name="Anne Campbell">the Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell)</phrase>. It calls on the Government to grant an exemption from visa charges to international students studying in the UK. Even if the Minister and his colleagues are not prepared to go that far, I hope that they will listen to the concerns that have been raised by Members in this debate and by a wide range of organisations involved in higher education in the UK to try to ensure that we continue to make the UK attractive to the genuine international students, who contribute to our economy, to their education and to the economy of the countries from which they originate.</p>
	<p pid=".38.2/9">I value having had a few minutes to put those points. As I indicated to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, prior to the start of the debate, I hope to take part in the debate in the main Chamber later this afternoon. If by any chance the business in that Chamber were to proceed a bit more rapidly than it is at the moment, I hope that you and other hon. Members will understand why I might leave a little early and before the end of this debate.</p>

	<p pid=".45.0/1">I also thank and congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1291" name="Andrew Turner">the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> on raising the topic. This is an extremely sensitive issue, which, if it is not debated here, is certainly going to be debated on the doorsteps in the months and weeks to come. It requires careful, sensitive handling and difficult questions must be answered. I appreciate the efforts of colleagues to do so in this Chamber.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/2">I do not want to follow the general argument, because I want to deal with a specific area of asylum policy. However, a couple of remarks about the statistics and how policy is put together may have some bearing on the worries that my hon. Friends rightly raised.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/3">I am sure that it will come as no great surprise to the Minister that I want to consider the situation surrounding the Yarl's Wood detention centre in my constituency, particularly the contents of the report by the Prison Service ombudsman on the incident and fire as long ago as St. Valentine's day 2002, but on which the ombudsman was only able to report on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-16">16 November 2004</phrase>. I am pleased to see the Minister; he bears no criticism for the matters that I will discuss, because he was not in place at that time. Since he has been the Minister responsible for Yarl's Wood, he has treated my requests for information and pleas on behalf of various detainees with nothing but courtesy, speed and dispatch, which I appreciate very much indeed. However, his Department has some considerable explaining to do, which I will make clear.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-16">16 November</phrase>, in an answer on a 450-page report on a highly significant incident in which &pound;100 million of damage was caused and scores of lives were endangered, the then Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/739" name="David Blunkett">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett)</phrase>, issued a written statement, which I consider wrong. The statement made no admission of Home Office error and no apology for the circumstances, but the report indicates that the role of the Home Office was of immense significance in creating the problems that eventually led to the disaster.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/5">To put this matter into context, I shall quote from the conclusion of the report. The Prison Service ombudsman said:</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/6" class="indent">&quot;The targets underpinning the project were unachievable, the project was conducted under unreasonable time constraints, the design of the building was poor in terms both of construction materials and layout, speed of delivery was given undue prominence in the contract letting process, the contractors never looked likely to complete the construction within the agreed timescale, policies were ill-thought through and were inadequately consulted upon, and the incident that led to the disturbance was mishandled.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/7">That is a damning indictment.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/8">I make six charges that I should like the Home Office to answer in due course. The Government are incompetent at handling a significant policy and they panic under pressure; they waste resources on an epic scale; they are incompetent in managing their agencies; their use of information for short-term political gain is less than trustworthy; they unfairly pressurise their civil servants; and they are careless with the lives and liberties of those whom they detain without trial or commission of crime. I shall illustrate those charges briefly.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/9">On incompetence and panic, the circumstances behind the building of Yarl's Wood were rising numbers of asylum seekers post-1997, but relatively static removal rates of about 7,000 per year. The report details the setting of an unachievable new removal target and pressure to get a detention centre built speedily, but there was no understanding of the consequences. It was a botched job leading to what the ombudsman describes as a building that was unfit for purpose and the subsequent disaster.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/10">The ombudsman says:</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/11" class="indent">&quot;There was of course no excuse for the actions of those detainees involved in the disturbance and the suffering and damage they caused. I have concluded, however, that what occurred at Yarl's Wood was the result of a series of decisions taken over the previous three years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/12">There is a policy point: we cannot be sure that this Government get their policy right under pressure. Therefore, what assurance can the Minister give us that the policy failures in the assessment of the issues surrounding asylum and removals have been addressed, so that that sort of problem cannot arise again?</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/13">Secondly, I charge that the Government waste resources on an epic scale. Yarl's Wood was significantly overpriced. The ombudsman details a memo from the Prison Service, which said:</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/14" class="indent">&quot;My own view of the IND exercise is that if and when the NAO [National Audit Office] takes an interest they will have a 'field day' in value for money terms.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/15">The report describes how the pressure of speed made it an overpriced contract. Premiums were added on and there was not adequate supervision. I have informed the NAO of that particular paragraph and I am interested in what it says.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/16">The speed also ensured that there was a failure to transfer the insurable risk from the public to the private sector, which has led to an ongoing dispute about the insurance. It might mean that the taxpayer bears a cost for the whole fiasco instead of the people who should have insured it. Again, that is an outstanding waste of resources.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/17">How have procedures changed in the Home Office to ensure that such a reckless and expensive response to a problem cannot happen again? Why were they not considered sufficiently significant to be detailed in the Home Secretary's statement on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-16">16 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/18">Thirdly, I allege that the Home Office is incompetent in managing its agencies. I will give two examples. It was stated to my constituents at the outset that Yarl's Wood would be a relatively low-level security area and that no one who was a serious security risk or was dangerous in any way would go there. However, the report details how those who had been responsible for a riot and incident at Campsfield house shortly before Yarl's Wood opened were deliberately transferred to Yarl's Wood in breach of those undertakings.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/19">It is also clear from the report that the Home Office did not know how many people were at Yarl's Wood on the night that we are discussing. Among his many expressions of astonishment, the ombudsman said that he was astounded that the Government did not know how many people they were in care of in detained circumstances in Yarl's Wood on the night of the fire. How can a Department be so incompetent in the management of its agencies? What action has been taken in the Home Office to investigate why so many errors were made in relation to the supervision of contractors and how can we be sure that that such a situation will not happen again?</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/20">I allege that the Department is less than trustworthy in the use of its information, for short-term political gain. I am aware of the seriousness of that charge. The ombudsman's report describes the process&mdash;if it can be called that&mdash;to produce a removal target of 30,000 a year at a time when removals then stood at about 7,000 a year. The target was treated with great scepticism in the Home Office and by the various agencies involved in the removal of detainees. It inadvertently got into the public arena and a Home Office official, who is quoted in the report, apologised to a Minister by way of a memo on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-07">7 June 2000</phrase> for having allowed such a high figure to get into public currency, because once it did, it gained some credibility.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/21">Despite that lack of certainty within the Department, on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-23">23 March 2001</phrase>, just a few weeks before the onset of a general election campaign, the then Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1258" name="Jack Straw">the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw)</phrase>, re-announced the 30,000 target in a Home Office news release. Indeed, it became a manifesto commitment. It was described by, among all newspapers, <i>The Guardian</i>. On <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-24">24 March 2001</phrase>, it said:</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/22" class="indent">&quot;The home secretary, Jack Straw, yesterday insisted he would continue to maintain the pressure by making the return home of 30,000 failed asylum seekers . . . the focus of official efforts over the next 12 months.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/23">Immediately&mdash;and I mean immediately&mdash;after the general election campaign was over, the new Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/739" name="David Blunkett">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett)</phrase>, was advised by his officials that the target was unachievable. How can that sort of target, the subject of a general election campaign, become unachievable in a few short weeks? How did it become unachievable then, when beforehand, inside the Department, it had been known to be very suspect? I suggest that the carelessness with which the then Home Secretary used those figures was tantamount to a fraud on the electorate. I want to know from the Minister how such a figure, which was characterised with such concern inside the Department, became an official target when it had such a sceptical basis.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/24">My fifth point may give some indication of why that was the case: civil servants are placed under unreasonable pressure. A senior civil servant, the director of detention in 2001, is quoted in the ombudsman's report as saying that</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/25" class="indent">&quot;he considered the 30,000 target 'laughable' and 'plucked out of the sky'. This view was based initially on the views of experienced Immigration Service staff and very rapidly his own observations and judgement. He went so far as to describe the target as some kind of fantasy which you had to publicly acknowledge or you were branded 'not one of us' and a 'troublemaker'. Disturbingly&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/26">the ombudsman concludes&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/27" class="indent">&quot;he said reasoned debate was 'forbidden'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/28">What investigation has taken place into allegations made by such a senior source? In his conclusions, the ombudsman drew attention to the climate in the Department. What evidence do any of us have that that climate is not still present? That leads to the suspicion about statistics and about everything else that we hear about. That is the concern behind the fact that that sort of pressure is placed on officials.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/29">My final point is that the Government are careless of the lives and liberties of those whom they detain without trial and who have not committed any crime. That is the story of the whole thing. For political purposes, a removals target was plucked out of the sky, put in a manifesto and driven by the Prime Minister&mdash;whose personal involvement is also noted in the report&mdash;when everybody else in the Government knew that it would not work. That only became clear immediately after the election when the then Home Secretary admitted a mistake. It was a mistake for which many hundreds of people could have paid for with their lives. That was the process described by the ombudsman.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/30">In conclusion, the story is appalling: detainees were let down; those responsible for them were let down; my constituents were let down; the emergency services that had to deal with the fire were let down and, to add insult to injury, were sued for the part that they had played. Local and national taxpayers were also let down, and the Government's response was a written ministerial statement.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/31">I am certain that the Minister can do a lot better. I ask him to take this opportunity to apologise and indicate what the Home Office is doing to ensure that its part in the process that became the Yarl's Wood disaster is not repeated.</p>

	<p pid=".49.1/1">I am exceptionally grateful to the Minister for that contribution. He makes a valid point, which the hon. Member for Isle of Wight also made. On the wider market, we must wait and see. The Minister referred to access&mdash;he was right to use the term&mdash;but it is early days. The extent to which we can exploit access to that market, the extent to which people will want to come from the new accession countries to perform those jobs and the impact that that will ultimately have on matters such as the sector-based scheme all remain to be seen.</p>
	<p pid=".49.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1038" name="Mark Lazarowicz">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Lazarowicz)</phrase> referred to visa charges for students and I am grateful to him for raising that issue, about which I, too, have received representations. He is right to say that there is a widely held fear that the charges will start to deter overseas students from coming here, which would be exceptionally unfortunate and another example of the law of unintended consequences.</p>
	<p pid=".49.1/3">The contribution made by overseas students to our higher and further education sector is immense in respect of the individual institutions and the long-term benefits that accrue to this country&mdash;those, however, are perhaps less quantifiable&mdash;because we establish good links with a generation of people who will return to their own countries and perhaps go on to lead the opinion-formers of tomorrow. Many of those countries are ones with which it is essential that we establish good relations if our future national security is to be assured.</p>
	<p pid=".49.1/4">The hon. Member for Orpington referred to the scepticism about Government statistics and the Minister made an interesting observation about the National Audit Office audit of the statistics. The answer that he received from the hon. Gentleman made me suspect that not much would satisfy him about Government statistics; he was determined in his scepticism. However, as one who lives at both ends of the country, I caution him because I can take an outsider's view of the problems facing people who live in London.</p>
	<p pid=".49.1/5">I see that there are problems with the overheating of London and the south-east, but to raise such issues in the context of a debate on immigration and asylum and to conflate the issues in that process is not particularly helpful. Indeed, it is no more helpful than the Tory proposals for quotas for asylum seekers. I was disappointed by the hon. Gentleman's response when the Minister challenged him on that issue.</p>
	<p pid=".49.1/6">I am keen to keep to my 10-minute limit and there is only one more issue that I want to draw to the Minister's attention. It was raised by early-day motion 458 on immigration rules and English language fluency for ministers of religion and concerns the difficulties that Hindu temples are having in recruiting poojaris as a result of having to meet English language fluency level 4. The Minister may be aware that poojaris are not required to be preachers in Hindu temples, but there are difficulties with recruitment as a result of that language requirement and I hope that the Minister will give his earliest attention to the matter.</p>

	<p pid=".50.0/1">I, too, would like to congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1291" name="Andrew Turner">the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> on securing this debate and on the way in which he has presented the subject to us this afternoon. I also congratulate all those colleagues who have contributed to the debate.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/785" name="Alistair Carmichael">The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase> said rightly that these vast subjects, particularly when placed together, cannot be discussed fully in a short debate such as the one that we are having today. However, the subject is important, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/770" name="Alistair Burt">the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase> was right to say that when we debate asylum and immigration, we should speak with sensitivity and care. Debates in the House in recent years have shown that characteristic, which is important but is not always reflected in the press and other parts of the media.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/3">I pause only to say that I sometimes consider that standard debates are not the easiest way in which to develop policy and an exchange of ideas. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1173" name="Gwyn Prosser">The hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Prosser)</phrase>, who is here today and an expert on such issues, and I served on the Home Affairs Committee, which I often considered was an extremely good venue for an exchange of ideas and policy, and a good place in which to talk rationally. Other experts on such difficult issues are also present today. What a huge subject.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/4">Reference has been made to the Government's record over the past eight years. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire was right to refer to it. The record was unhappy in many respects and much of it took place before the Minister was in his place. I thank him, as I have done on other occasions, for the way in which he approaches such topics. Undoubtedly, during the past few years, asylum and immigration have become high on the list of worries of members of the public. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/973" name="John Horam">the Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam)</phrase> referred to a survey that was carried out in his constituency. Such matters cause concern.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/5">It is not easy for a Government to handle an efficient and humane asylum and immigration policy&mdash;not easy at all&mdash;but many would say that their record has been disappointing, to give it its lowest description. Asylum applications shot up and almost trebled between 1996 and 2001 and reached more than 100,000. The Government's inability to adopt a proper and effective removals target of failed asylum seekers was well highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/6">In 2001, I tabled a parliamentary question to which the Government replied:</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/7" class="indent">&quot;The current . . . target relating to the removal of failed asylum seekers from the United Kingdom is to remove 30,000 in 2001/02; 33,000 in 2003/04; and 37,000 in 2004/05.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2001-12-17.78"><i>Official Report, House of Commons, </i>17 December 2001; Vol. 377, c.78W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/8">The Government should not have put forward such figures if they could not deliver them. The truth is that they had to abandon that target. It is not surprising that the former Home Secretary said not many months ago that he did not have a clue how many illegal immigrants were in this country. I think that the best estimates suggest that there are upwards of 250,000 failed asylum seekers here at the moment. That is a pity.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/9">I wish to refer to two or three narrow, but important, points. My hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight naturally and properly referred to the impact of migration on housing in this country. Last December in the other place, my noble Friend Lord Lamont asked Her Majesty's Government about the latest projections for additional households each year in England, over what period forecasts had been made and how that compared with the previous projections of households in England in 2021 that was published in 2000. The Minister of State, Lord Rooker replied:</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/10" class="indent">&quot;The 2002-based interim household projections are the Government's latest projections and have updated the 1996-based household projections.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/11" class="indent">The 2002-based Interim Household Projections show that 189,000 additional households are projected to form annually between 2001 and 2021 in England. This projection assumes recent population trends continue and trends in household formation remain as estimated for the 1996-based household projections. They do not take account of future housing supply.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/12" class="indent">The 1996-based Household Projections showed that 150,000 dwellings were projected to form annually in the same time period&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/13">went on to ask:</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/14" class="indent">&quot;How many additional households in England each year can be attributed to the projected levels of net international migration in current and previous projections&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/15">to which Lord Rooker replied:</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/16" class="indent">&quot;It is estimated that, in the 2002-based interim household projections for England, about 59,000 additional households per year are attributable to net international migration out of a total of 189,000 additional households per year between 2001 and 2021.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-12-08.38"><i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i>8 December 2004; Vol. 667, c. WA38&ndash;9</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/17">The number had previously been estimated to be about 38,000 additional households a year. Simply in terms of housing, the problem is important; I say no more than that.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/18">We now have Government figures that show that nearly one in three of the additional 189,000 households formed each year will be due to international migration. It is the first time that that has been officially admitted. I simply put those figures before the Chamber for the Minister to comment on, if he will.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/19">My hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight talked about immigration scams. There are a couple on which I would like an update, although the Minister has been very helpful on the matter in recent times. Reference was made to bogus colleges. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1038" name="Mark Lazarowicz">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Lazarowicz)</phrase> was entirely right to talk of the many benefits of having international students in this country. However, we know&mdash;and the Minister accepts&mdash;that there have been and still are a number of bogus colleges. In a written answer, the Minister has said that</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/20" class="indent">&quot;Immigration and Nationality Directorate officials have visited over 1,150 establishments of concern so far this year&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/21">that is, educational colleges&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/22" class="indent">&quot;of which about a quarter have been found to be bogus.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-11-15.1092"><i>Official Report, House of Commons,</i> 15 November 2004; Vol. 426, c. 1092W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/23">That is almost 300 bogus colleges. I would appreciate it if he could give an update on how many of those bogus educational establishments have been closed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-11.53.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/758" speakername="Des Browne" speakeroffice="The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration"  colnum="53"  time="unknown" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050111/halltext/50111h03.htm#50111h03_spmin1">
	<p pid=".53.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1291" name="Andrew Turner">the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> on securing the debate. He is right to say that it addresses an important and under-discussed issue, and the policy on it can only benefit from the debate. Unfortunately, I appear yet again to have been left with a comparatively small amount of time to respond, so it is unlikely that I will be able to deal with all the points that have been raised in this debate, but I will seek to deal with those that I do not address by other means.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/2">The tone of the debate has broadly been helpful, although I will have something more to say about that. I am grateful to all hon. Members who have spoken for the contributions that they made; I hope that they will excuse me for that general acknowledgement. I am also grateful that my hon. Friends the Members for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) and for Dover (Mr. Prosser) are present; they have expertise in this area and it was unfortunate that the limited time available to us did not allow them to do anything more than intervene in the debate. However, they were telling interventions that helped the debate to progress.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/3">I have a slight disappointment about something, which I hope that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight will accept in the right spirit. He promised that he would address the positive aspects of migration, and particularly the significant contribution that migrant labour makes to the national health service at all levels, but, except for a fleeting reference, he failed to do so. That may be a consequence of lack of time. As I have debated with him before, enjoyed those debates and felt that his contributions were balanced, I will give him the benefit of the doubt on this occasion.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/4">Nobody is more acutely aware than I am of the views of the public on this issue of public policy. They are reflected in my postbag, and in contributions from both sides of the political spectrum. Not everyone shares the views espoused by the hon. Gentleman. There are significant numbers of people in the United Kingdom who have different and far more liberal views about how we should run our border controls and how we should approach issues such as who should be entitled to migrate to our country and live and work among us.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/5">I know that MORI polls show that 70 per cent. of people in this country think that migration is too high. I am also conscious that polls&mdash;and sometimes they are the same polls that produce that 70 per cent. figure&mdash;show that for many of the people who hold that view, it can be explained by the fact that they have exaggerated beliefs about what the actual figures are. The MORI poll that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight referred to recently showed that, on average, people thought there were four times more migrants in the UK than there are on any view of the figures&mdash;whether they be the figures that other people extrapolate from the public figures or those that are published after being audited.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/6">There is a duty on all of us to use statistical information in this area with a degree of responsibility, and, being a Minister, I accept that that stricture applies more heavily to me and to the Home Office than to anybody else. That is what my dispute with MigrationWatch UK is about in relation to the figures. To the extent that it uses figures that are published and are in the public domain&mdash;and, broadly, it does use such figures&mdash;I have no argument. Most of the time, it uses figures that have been independently audited, at the request of the Home Office, by the National Audit Office, and that have to a large extent been given a clean bill of health. I have a copy of the report in front of me and it contains some qualifications, as I mentioned to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/973" name="John Horam">the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam)</phrase>. However, it suggests that the figures can largely be relied on, and it shows in particular that there is no transference from one set of figures to another&mdash;from the migration figures to the asylum figures, or vice versa&mdash;which was an important part of the debate that was taking place many months ago.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/7">To that extent, I have no objection. It is the flawed analysis of the figures that I dispute. I understand that some of that is in an area where there is debate, because no Government in this country have ever been able to say how many illegal migrants there are here. No Government in the world can say how many illegal migrants there are in their country. It seems a sterile argument to concentrate&mdash;as many people and commentators want to do&mdash;on the inability of one Home Secretary, or successive Home Secretaries, to be able to answer that question with accuracy. Nobody has ever been able to do it and I suspect that nobody ever will.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/8">It is incumbent on the Government&mdash;I accept this responsibility&mdash;to look at the methodologies used by other countries, as we are currently doing, to see how the figures can be properly estimated in a way that does not inflame public opinion one way or the other, but informs it and allows us to have a debate. When that work is complete, we will publish those figures and that information, but, as yet, it is work in progress.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/9">I turn to some other important points. It is important to accept that people in the UK live in a globalised world. We do not live in isolation. We may have lived in a different world 20, 30 or 40 years ago, when international travel was much more difficult than it is now and when our economy was in a different state. However, migration is essential if we are to maintain our role as a major economic player. I do not think that there is any party in this Parliament that does not think that that is right. It is the scale that we are debating, rather than the principle.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/10">It is beyond debate that we have one of the strongest economies in the world. We consistently have nearly 600,000 vacancies in the labour market, unemployment is at sustained, historically low levels and employment at sustained, historically high levels. Without migration, the rate of economic growth that we presently enjoy would be much lower. We could not look forward to the expected level of economic growth that all of us, as politicians and the elected leadership of this country, wish to see so that we can make the level of investment that we want in the infrastructure of our country and our public services. We could not sustain that growth. We must face up to that reality.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/11">I understand that those labour market facts have significant consequences in relation to pressures on public services and, in particular, on housing in certain parts of the country. However, we must face the reality that those issues exist whoever does the work. If the work needs to be done in those parts of the United Kingdom, and if we are of the view that that level of growth should be sustained and continued, workers will need to come to do the work.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/12">As I travel around this city, I notice&mdash;with my accent&mdash; that there is a significant amount of migrant labour from my part of the United Kingdom carrying out work and living among the people of the city. If those people settle in this part of the United Kingdom and want their families with them, they will generate a degree of pressure on public resources, whether they be housing resources or health resources. I understand that that is an uncomfortable reality for people who consider themselves to be the indigenous population&mdash;whatever that might mean. What is the indigenous population of the south-east of England? When I am out, I hear people speaking English as a native language with many accents.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/13">Whatever the native population is, that is a challenging fact for them, but if we are to see the growth that we all want, we must deal with those issues. It will be unfortunate if this debate, which it is the Government's responsibility to respond to, becomes an issue about immigration, because, as the hon. Member for Isle of Wight pointed out, if we do not get the context of the debate right and if we do not take it forward properly, it will be ruthlessly exploited by extremists&mdash;particularly from the right wing of politics&mdash;to mask their racist approach to life in this country. That will do significant damage. We have a joint responsibility to take the issues forward.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/14">We are not, in international terms, a high net migration country. Whatever the figures may be&mdash;the Government Actuary's Department has a mixed record of predicting the number of people and the growth of the population of this country&mdash;we are not a high net migration country. In fact, in relation to all our competitors, we are substantially smaller&mdash;.</p>
