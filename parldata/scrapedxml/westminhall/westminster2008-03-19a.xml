<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-19a.228.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" speakername="Mark Field" colnum="228"  time="009:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080319/halltext/80319h0001.htm#08031958000464">
	<p pid="a.228.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> on obtaining this debate, and on how he presented his case. It was gleefully unpartisan, and he made some important points. He will recognise that, historically, this country has always had citizen-based police organisations; we have had special constables, of course, for some years. In many ways it is regrettable that in recent decades&mdash;the situation certainly predates 1997&mdash;that practice seems to have diminished. That is why many of the new initiatives are very positive. Our policing model, in contrast with that of European nations, has always been firmly drilled into local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/2">Much as I think that neighbourhood policing is important, a visible police presence alone should not be the be-all and end-all of the policing challenge. I find that to be the case particularly in central London, where intelligence-led policing has great import, not least in fields such as counter-terrorism. The Metropolitan police and a range of other agencies, including the City of London police in the eastern part of my constituency, do painstaking work, but that approach has a less high profile. I appreciate that the villages in the hon. Gentleman's constituency regard policing as being about bobbies on the beat and a visible presence, but it is important that we give as much credit as possible to a lot of the other work that goes on behind the scenes. In my constituency&mdash;in Westminster at least&mdash;the local authorities are at the forefront of a partnership with the Home Office and the Metropolitan Police Service over PCSOs and a range of other initiatives, some of which I shall discuss in my brief contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/3">Many of the new initiatives were key to restoring public confidence in the aftermath of 9/11. At the outset, the concern in London was that too much of the PCSO initiative was driven by a campaign to keep numbers high. PCSOs are added routinely to overall police numbers; no doubt Ken Livingstone and his mayoral campaign will make much of that. However, I have always supported the idea of PCSOs, even in the immediate aftermath of 2001, when such support was not terribly fashionable in the Conservative party. To be fair, they have worked well, although if there is one slight criticism it is that there is a risk that they have helped to crowd out special constables. From my work with the City of London police, it seems that the cadre of special constables feel that they are now third-class citizens compared with PCSOs. Becoming a PCSO is now an alternative career route in policing.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/4">In Westminster, we have an initiative called CivicWatch, the key to which is that the police safer neighbourhood sergeant is partnered with a local government officer, which ensures effective liaison between the police and the local authority. I hope that the same applies throughout the country. We have found that one of the few positive by-products of the early retirement rule in the police is that some very talented ex-superintendents can come on board and work at City hall in Westminster. We currently have a retired superintendent, Dean Ingledew, who headed up the west end police service, and before him we had Bob Currie. That arrangement has worked extremely well in developing those partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/5">The only potential flaw in the safer neighbourhoods initiative is that most community aspirations are not within the gift of the police but are down to local authorities, which means that the strength of the partnership, which hopefully extends beyond the political divide, is key. For as long as there is increased pressure on local government financing arrangements&mdash;I am sure that there will be for the foreseeable future&mdash;it will be all too easy for such innovative programmes to fall by the wayside. It is therefore crucial to keep that relationship as strong as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/6">Crime and antisocial behaviour are as big a problem in my constituency as they obviously are in Stafford, but community confidence and perceptions have improved, which stems from the ability to report incidents easily, to see a reaction within a reasonable time and to receive feedback from the responsible authority. That helps to build confidence through the reassurance cycle, through which we can reduce the fear of crime and improve many of the positive perceptions.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/7">In central London, our innovative partnership initiative is between the council, the Metropolitan Police Service, the London fire brigade, which comes under the auspices of the Mayor of London, and CityWest Homes, our own arm's length management housing organisation&mdash;we have some large housing estates in Westminster. It was established five years ago as a pilot project in three areas, but has been such a success that it has been rolled out across Westminster, which is now divided into 26 distinct CivicWatch areas, closely aligned to ward and police boundaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/8">Obviously the terrorist threat after September 2001 and July 2005 has resulted in more police on the streets of Westminster. I think that all hon. Members who walk around the streets of my constituency will be impressed by the number of PCSOs, although I suspect that that is in contrast with other parts of the capital. In part that is done to raise confidence. Although central London has a relatively small residential population, some 900,000 people come to work in the 7 sq m of my constituency every day. Behind CivicWatch are some specific ideas: to combat crime, antisocial behaviour and persistent environmental problems; to reduce the fear of crime and antisocial behaviour; to signpost young people to alternatives to poor behaviour, and broadly to improve community confidence in service delivery.</p>

	<p pid="a.232.2/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The inter-agency work and collaboration with other organisations through the neighbourhood action groups, to which I referred earlier, lies at the heart of that activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/2">On the impact on crime throughout Oxford, if we compare the summer of 2007 with the summer of 2006, domestic burglary is down 34 per cent., personal robbery is down 11 per cent. and criminal damage is down 4.5 per cent. Our police&mdash;all of them&mdash;and all the community support officers and neighbourhood action groups deserve praise and thanks for that achievement. There is still, of course, far too much crime and too many nasty incidents&mdash;one crime is one too many&mdash;but let us celebrate the progress that is being made. Let us build on what so clearly works to achieve still more for the future. Let us do all that we can, so that people can enjoy the community safety that is a hallmark of any civilised society.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-19a.238.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" speakername="Tom Brake" colnum="238"  time="010:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080319/halltext/80319h0003.htm#08031958000480">
	<p pid="a.238.0/1">I too start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> on securing this debate. He deployed a rare quality in a politician&mdash;frankness&mdash;in admitting that he secured this debate without knowing that it was opportune. It is indeed opportune and we are all grateful to him for securing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/2">The debate has been consensual. All the parties that were represented here&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2030" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> has left us now&mdash;agree that neighbourhood policing is a good thing and the Liberal Democrats certainly support it. As a party, we are very much in favour of &quot;pavement politics&quot;, so it is no surprise that we are in favour of &quot;pavement policing&quot;, which is what neighbourhood policing is largely about.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/3">We have some concerns about the level of resources that are available. We know from research that in the period up to March 2007, 20 out of 43 police forces experienced a drop in the number of police officers. We can only hope that when the figures for the period up to March 2008 become available, we will see that that trend has been reversed in those forces. Of course, we know that the total number of community support officers who were going to be deployed was reduced from the 24,000 that the Government had pledged to 16,000. No doubt, when the Minister responds he will point out that that lower number was the number that the police thought they could work with. However, I think that all hon. Members who have spoken here today are aware of areas in their own constituencies where there is still a high level of antisocial behaviour, for example, and where additional resources, if they could be brought to bear, could make a significant difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/4">There is one thing that is perhaps surprising about neighbourhood policing. I suppose I am slightly too young to have been brought up on &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;. None the less, I was under the impression that intelligence about individuals in a particular neighbourhood was something that was accessible to the police and that they had people on their force who knew who the local hoodlums were and so on. However, it is only as a result of neighbourhood policing that there are now sufficient police resources available to enable that very individual identification of potentially problem people or households. When that was revealed to me three or four years ago, it was a source of some surprise.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/5">Like other Members, I am happy to endorse the activities of my own safer neighbourhood teams, and have joined several of them on patrol to witness first hand how they work. We did some canvassing in one road where one of the residents raised concerns with me about allegations of drug dealing going on close by. When I went out a few weeks later with the relevant safer neighbourhood team, I reported the matter to the lead officer, who raided the property a few weeks later and found that cannabis plants were being grown there. It is clear that safer neighbourhood teams are working, in that intelligence gets to the right people and can be acted on promptly at the right level. Like other Members, I attend the panel of my own safer neighbourhood team when I can, just to see how it and local councillors and leading members of the community identify what the priorities will be in their ward in the upcoming quarter. That works effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/6">That is not to say that bureaucracy, to which Members have referred, is not real; it needs to be tackled. The Liberal Democrat mayoral candidate, Brian Paddick, who has experience in the police force, will be looking carefully at it. Let me give the Minister one concrete example of bureaucracy, which was raised in the Home Affairs Committee yesterday, in the hope that he will be able to write to me and other Members about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/7">I do not whether the Minister has seen the Committee transcript, but Mr. Gargan, who is an assistant chief constable, raised a problem relating to CCTV cameras. He gave evidence that to change the direction that a CCTV is pointing&mdash;not to install a camera, but to change its direction&mdash;officers are required to fill in a 17-page form. That applies regardless of whether the surveillance is covert or overt. I questioned him further on that and asked whether the police were required to do that, or whether there is some scope for interpreting the law in one way or another. He said that it was probably because of the latter&mdash;interpretation of the law rather than a clear command&mdash;that the form had to be filled in to change the direction of a CCTV camera. If nothing else results from this debate, I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify for our benefit and for that officer's benefit whether that is, in fact, a requirement. If it is not, could it be made clear that it is not, so that if the police want to make such a change&mdash;perhaps to move a CCTV camera so that it focuses on a particular parade where there have been significant problems&mdash;they can deal with it more effectively and without the need to complete a 17-page form?</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/8">We need to tackle problems of bureaucracy, but neighbourhood policing requires other actions to be taken as well. Such actions are not necessarily about policing but to do with licensing, particularly licensing regimes and ensuring responsible behaviour on the part of off-licences, bars, clubs and so on, and ensuring that we design out crime in our town centres. Those matters need to be addressed before we come to the question of neighbourhood policing itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/9">My party can happily sign up to the four key principles that the Government have set out for neighbourhood policing: having visible and accessible police, influencing community safety priorities, interventions that solve local problems, and answers that give solutions to problems and feedback on results. The hon. Member for Stafford said that police accessibility was not simply about bricks and mortar. I agree that it must not simply be about that, but making the police accessible often does boil down to bricks and mortar, or at least to there being a contact point that people know about. It could be a mobile police station as opposed to a permanent base; what is needed is a known location to which people can go to visit their police officers. That is why at local level and, indeed, in London and beyond, the idea of safer neighbourhood teams having their own permanent base in their ward is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/10">The police certainly are more visible and accessible. The surveys that we have done over many years confirm that to be true. When we put out surveys five or 10 years ago that asked, &quot;When did you last see a police officer?&quot;, the responses that often came back were, &quot;Never,&quot; or &quot;Twelve months ago.&quot; Now it is almost not worth putting out such surveys because the responses tend to be much more positive.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/11">Progress is being made on the key principles, and Liberal Democrats support that. It is clear from the statistics that community support officers and safer neighbourhood teams are increasing public confidence in the police through their extra visibility, and, as in the concrete example to which I referred, through ensuring that local intelligence is passed on to the appropriate people and acted on.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/12">One of the key recommendations in Sir Ronnie Flanagan's review of policing was that partnership working between the police and local communities and councils should be prioritised. I commend the example of my own borough, the London borough of Sutton, which for several years has had joint working and a joint appointment. The person happens to be a police officer, but someone from the local authority or, indeed, from outside the local authority could have been appointed. One person is responsible for the parks police, the safer neighbourhood teams, the wardens and aspects of enforcement that the local authority takes on, so that all the resources can be brought to bear in an organised fashion when local problems are identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/13">I conclude by drawing attention to concerns about neighbourhood policing that other Members have referred to and which have been raised by the Police Federation. The Minister will be familiar with the report that the federation produced in December 2006, &quot;24/7 Response Policing in the Modern Police Organisation&mdash;Views from the Frontline&quot;. Things have moved on, and the level of resources is clearly now much more significant, but the concerns that the federation raised then&mdash;only 18 months ago&mdash;were about whether staffing would be sufficient to provide the safer neighbourhood teams, and whether 24/7 response officers would be drawn from their activities and put into safer neighbourhood teams. The federation was also concerned that safer neighbourhood teams would not reduce the work that 24/7 response officers had to do but might, in fact, increase it. I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that discussions with the federation indicate that those issues have either gone away or are not as salient now as they were then.</p>

	<p pid="a.241.1/1">I and my colleagues congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> on securing this timely debate. Let me make it clear that Her Majesty's Opposition support the six broad goals set out in the Government's 2005 document on neighbourhood policing. We believe in the principle that local people should have more influence over setting local safety priorities. We believe in stronger partnership working not just between local authorities, neighbourhood watches and local citizens' groups, but also between primary care trusts and the whole family of partnership workers in crime and disorder reduction partnerships and other groupings. We also believe that having a more visible presence on the streets is vital to neighbourhood policing. We need to cut the paperwork and get more officers and police community support officers back on the beat.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/2">My concerns do not relate to the principle of neighbourhood policing, which we support, but its implementation. The Conservative-controlled borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, which I visited earlier this week, provides an excellent example of delivering 24/7 policing. Two wards are enjoying this piloted experiment, which involves working across 24-hour periods. They have, on average, 30 officers, rather than the London average of six. It is worth while focusing on the results, and I would like the Minister's views on them. In Shepherd's Bush, for example, robberies are down by 48 per cent. In Fulham Broadway, overall crime is down 10 per cent., with burglary down 27 per cent. and theft down 22 per cent. Those are real examples of a very aggressive 24/7 neighbourhood policing policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/3">What is the evidence for crime reductions in non-24/7 areas&mdash;our average neighbourhood policing areas? The Home Office's report this February, &quot;Neighbourhood policing: the impact of piloting and early national implementation&quot;, which I know the Minster will have studied with care, did not provide any numerical evidence for significant reductions in crime in the 16 wards that it studied. I wonder what the Minister's view is of the empirical evidence for crime reduction in neighbourhood policing areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/4">PCSOs are important in the delivery of neighbourhood policing, which was sagely observed by my hon. Friends the Members for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) and for Banbury (Tony Baldry). I do not need to go into the argument about the Government's promise at the time of the last election to recruit 24,000 PCSOs by 2008. That target has been reduced to 16,000. Will the Minister give us an indication of his estimates for the number of PCSOs who will be available in England and Wales to support sworn officers in neighbourhood teams for next year and the year after?</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/5">I have an even more important question about sworn officer numbers, police strength and absent PCSOs. We all believe in neighbourhood policing, but one does not have to be a rocket scientist to understand that the number of sworn officers needs to be kept up. I have one simple question, to which the House deserves an answer, and I am not making a party political point, because every hon. Member who cares about the problem will want the answer. On page 45 of Sir Ronnie Flanagan's final report on the independent review of policing, published in February, he said that</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/6" class="indent">&quot;maintaining police numbers at their current level&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/7">which was about 141,000 in January&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/8" class="indent">&quot;is not sustainable over the course of the next three years...we would not be making the most effective use of the resources dedicated to the police if police officer numbers were sustained at their current level.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/9">I would dearly like to hear whether the Minister and the Government support Sir Ronnie Flanagan's proposition. Until we know what their intentions are over the next three years and whether 141,000 officers is a sustainable number, we cannot have an intelligent debate about the effectiveness of neighbourhood policing.</p>

	<p pid="a.244.3/1">The next thing I have written on my notes is not to forget to say that on the way to Banbury, or on the way back from Banbury, I will, of course, call in at Oxford. Just in case I have missed anyone out geographically, I should say that it is important for Ministers to go to different constituencies and parts of the country. I have been to Burton, Stafford, Copland in Cumbria and other places to see the work that is going on.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.3/2">Hon. Members will know that the Association of Chief Police Officers has asked the National Policing Improvement Agency to review PCSOs and career development will be considered as part of that. On the transfer or movement of officers from Thames Valley and, indeed, other forces into the Metropolitan force, officers recruited after <phrase class="date" code="1994-04-01">1 April 1994</phrase> in south-east forces receive an additional allowance of &pound;2,000 per annum and &pound;1,000 per annum in Bedfordshire and Hampshire. We have been asked to revisit that allowance and to uprate it to deal with inflation. We recently heard the views of Sara Thornton, the chief constable of Thames Valley, who has made representations on that issue. It is a matter for the Police Negotiating Board, but I know that it is under consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.3/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1465" name="Janet Dean">the Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean)</phrase> made an important point about neighbourhood management and the role of neighbourhood watch. There is a need for neighbourhood watch to extend its role and to develop the way in which it works in a modern police setting. There is certainly an important role for neighbourhood watch.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.3/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" name="Tom Brake">The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase> talked about local priorities and the points he made were right. One of the tasks for neighbourhood policing is to ensure that local people feel that they can influence the priorities and have a real say. That should not mean that police operational independence is compromised, but if there is to be true neighbourhood policing in an area, surely it is only right and necessary for people to have some influence.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.3/5">On CCTV and accessibility, when I have been to different parts of the country, including the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1511" name="Jamie Reed">the Member for Copeland (Mr. Reed)</phrase>, I have visited control rooms where they change the direction of CCTV cameras all the time. However, I will consider the hon. Gentleman's point. If it is appropriate, I will write to every hon. Member present with the answer to his question so that it is on the record. As I have said, it is not something that I have heard before, but I will take up the point.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.3/6">I genuinely welcome the support of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1468" name="David Ruffley">the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley)</phrase> for neighbourhood policing. I also welcome the other points that he made. We are trying to get empirical evidence on neighbourhood policing. However, it is fair to say that every police force that we have spoken to says that neighbourhood policing has led to reduction in crime&mdash;and importantly a reduction in the fear of crime&mdash;as happened in Hammersmith and Fulham, to which he referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.3/7">The hon. Gentleman will also know that all the Flanagan review's recommendations are being considered by the Government, including those that he highlighted. Part of that is about reducing bureaucracy. We know that forms are being reduced in size across the country and my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford gave examples of that. As I say, we will push that matter forward. One of the ways in which we will do that is through mobile data sets, although I cannot give him a commitment on that this morning.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-19a.251.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="251"  time="011:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080319/halltext/80319h0005.htm#08031958000496">
	<p pid="a.251.2/1">It was alcohol-related crime&mdash;I am sorry. My hon. Friend works assiduously on behalf of her constituents on a range of matters, not least the need for more affordable housing in Warrington. She has been particularly strong in ensuring that her constituents are heard here in the House, in Whitehall and throughout the north-west region, particularly with regard to housing. <i>Hansard</i> demonstrates her persistence on that subject. Both I and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing can personally testify to the representations that she has made on behalf of those seeking affordable housing in the borough.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/2">If you and my hon. Friend will allow me, Mr. Hood, I wish to mention the national housing picture and then apply it to the circumstances in Warrington. My hon. Friend will welcome the fact, as I do, that housing is back at the top of the political agenda, and that the Government are determined to provide better, greener and more affordable housing. To be frank, this country has not been building enough homes since the early 1970s, which means that concerted effort is needed. Rising prosperity and a thriving economy over the past decade have meant that more people want to get on the property ladder&mdash;particularly, as she said, hard-working families. Equally, more people are living alone as a result of social change, and people are living longer, with the result that we need more homes that are suitable for older people, perhaps with provision for their grandchildren to stay with them to maintain a family network.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/3">The Government published the housing Green Paper, &quot;Homes for the future: more affordable, more sustainable&quot;, in July 2007. It set a target of 2 million new homes by 2016 and 3 million by 2020. Within that total, we have set a target of providing at least 70,000 new affordable homes a year by 2010-11, of which 45,000 should be for rent. The Government expect at least 30 per cent. of new socially rented provision by the Housing Corporation to be family accommodation, to ease the overcrowding pressures that my hon. Friend so eloquently mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/4">With the renewed political priority have come substantially increased resources. The Government have pledged about &pound;8.4 billion over the next three years to tackle the problem of affordable housing. There has been a substantial increase in the resources available for providing new and affordable homes in the north-west region. About &pound;526 million has been allocated to the national affordable housing programme for the next three years, with the aim of aiding the completion of about 6,500 socially rented homes and up to 3,000 affordable properties for sale.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/5">The regional housing strategy in the north-west is currently being refreshed to better reflect the affordability agenda, and I understand that Warrington should be better placed to attract support in future years because of it. I understand also that the borough has so far secured &pound;4.7 million, in strategic partnership with a number of registered social landlords, to fund the development of 94 new homes for rent in the current bidding round. Further bids will be developed for the Housing Corporation's regular market engagement in the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/6">Like my hon. Friend, I represent a northern seat and I am conscious of the fact that pressures on housing and affordability are not confined to London and the south-east. As she so excellently said, there are concerns about affordability in every region, which is why the Green Paper extended the growth points programme to the north for the first time. Growth point status is not a statutory designation, but represents a relationship between central Government and local partners. It is built on four principles: early delivery of housing as part of growth plans; supporting local partners to achieve sustainable growth; working with local partners to ensure that infrastructure and service provision keep pace with growth; and ensuring effective delivery. Levels of growth will be subject to comprehensive testing and public consultation through the regional and local planning processes, and I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend. The aim is to ensure that individual proposals are sustainable, environmentally acceptable and realistic in terms of infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/7">As my hon. Friend said, Warrington, in conjunction with neighbouring authorities, submitted an expression of interest for growth point status in October 2007. In December, the Government office for the north-west held an informal briefing for the region's MPs, at which my hon. Friend expressed her views&mdash;in a somewhat forthright manner, as she said&mdash;about the priority that affordable housing should be given in the delivery of new housing in her patch. The Government office for the north-west passed on her views in writing to the chief executive of Warrington borough council. Again, my hon. Friend is to be commended on her interest in this emerging agenda, which will impact greatly on the level of affordable housing available to her constituents. I fundamentally agree that MPs should be at the heart of this process representing their constituents. At this point, however, I should make it clear that we are still considering all applications for new growth point status, and no decisions have been made, but I cannot say more on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/8">As I have mentioned, and as my hon. Friend said, affordability has emerged as the single most important issue in housing almost everywhere. Warrington is one of many areas suffering the consequences of the market's historical failure to supply enough housing to meet rising demand. Average lower-quartile house prices in Warrington have risen by about 179 per cent. in the past 10 years, which is much faster than comparable incomes. Between 2001 and 2006, the average property price in Warrington rose by 83.7 per cent., compared with an increase of 74.7 per cent. for England and Wales as a whole. As my hon. Friend suggested, the ratio of lower-quartile house prices to income was 3.26 in 1997 and 6.72 by 2007, although it has come down slightly from a peak last year. Taken together, those figures make Warrington the 15th least affordable borough in the north-west.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/9">Warrington's history of new town development and subsequent strong economic growth, as well as the investment that has been put into education, of which my hon. Friend is a massive champion in her area, have attracted many workers to the town, and that, in turn, has fostered significant housing development. However, my hon. Friend is right that we must do more to encourage and enable young families who were born in Warrington and who want to stay there to do so. I am anxious that we do not price them out of their home town. My hon. Friend has often expressed concern&mdash;she has done so in an excellent fashion this morning&mdash;at the apparent disconnect between the rising number of homes in Warrington and the growing number of people looking for social and affordable housing in the borough. My comments on that will form the main part of my response.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/10">My hon. Friend made the important argument that we are talking not simply about housing numbers, but about the type and mix of new housing that is created in the borough. Again, the figures bear out her analysis. Access to social housing has become more difficult: there were about 10,400 households on Warrington's housing waiting list on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>, and that has increased. That compares with 2,516 in 1997. The number of new social lettings has also declined in recent years, from 1,311 in 2003-04 to just 1,112 in 2006-07&mdash;a fall of about 15 per cent. The number of new houses built, as opposed to other properties, such as maisonettes or flats, is slowing more markedly, falling from 421 in 2003-04 to 311 in 2006-07, and I fully understand&mdash;I think that my hon. Friend will share this concern&mdash;that that needs to be tackled. Finally, 90 households were accepted as homeless in Warrington between October and December 2007, which is a 14.5 per cent. increase over the same period the previous year. Bringing those figures together, there is no doubt that housing supply and affordability are crucial issues for the town.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/11">The council has a key role to play in addressing those challenges, as my hon. Friend has said. It must ensure that it stands up for mixed developments that provide a range of buildings, tenures and, crucially, community facilities. Planning policy statement 3 should help to achieve that. To illustrate my point, I will quote from the letter that my Department sent to local planning authorities when PPS3 was released. The letter states:</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/12" class="indent">&quot;PPS 3 puts in place a national policy framework for planning for housing at the local and regional level. It provides an enabling framework for local planning authorities, working with their stakeholders,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/13">&mdash;MPs are crucial stakeholders in this respect&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/14" class="indent">&quot;including developers, to deliver both the right quantity of housing to address need and demand in their area, and the right quality and mix of housing for their communities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/15">That last point is crucial. I know that my hon. Friend agrees that we do not wish to see the physical polarisation of the poor and the affluent. We do not wish to see gated communities on the canal in Warrington, away from ghettos elsewhere in the borough. Such an approach is not conducive to sustainable, prosperous and thriving communities. The local authority needs to aim to create vibrant, mixed-tenure communities by ensuring that the right housing of the highest quality is in the right place.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/16">Our housing Green Paper announced various measures to help councils to carry out their strategic housing role and deliver such communities, such as a new housing and planning delivery grant totalling &pound;510 million to direct extra resources to councils; new approaches to help councils provide more social housing; joint venture vehicles that councils can establish to work in partnership with the newly created Homes and Communities Agency to deliver affordable housing on council land; and encouragement for councils to bring long-term empty homes back into use, making better use of existing stock and partnerships with a wider range of housing providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/17">Our recent efforts have focused particularly on attempts to encourage local authorities to make better use of their statutory planning powers to improve the supply of affordable housing through section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which I understand has played a particular role in Warrington in the recent past. Some 420 affordable units were completed in the six years up to 2005-06, and the local authority has reported to me that an additional 667 units have already been secured for future delivery. The council also expects to receive more than &pound;5.6 million in section 106 commuted sums to be spent solely on future affordable housing projects, move-on accommodation and tackling long-term voids. However, I take on board precisely what my hon. Friend was saying on the matter and I will look closely at it.</p>

	<p pid="a.256.2/1">It is a pleasure to be here under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood. I look forward to an interesting debate. I am grateful for the opportunity to debate this topic. I thank in particular <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>, who cannot be here this afternoon, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1923" name="Tim Farron">the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron)</phrase> for co-signing my letter asking Mr. Speaker for the chance to debate access to safe water in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/2">For us, it is the simplest thing in the world: if we want a drink, we go to a tap or pick up a bottle. It takes only a fraction of a second, and we are all very used to it. Water is one of the handful of substances essential to life&mdash;not a convenience, a whim, a habit or a trend, but a necessity. Without water we die, so we need a regular, easily accessible supply of water. If water is not immediately accessible, we must go to find it. None of us in this room has to go far. This debate aims to draw attention to the fact that for too many people worldwide do not have that ease and convenience of access, and that what we take for granted is far from being taken for granted all over the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/3">World water day, <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-22">22 March</phrase>, is being marked in this place by this debate and an early-day motion tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1965" name="Michael Moore">the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore)</phrase>, who is in his place on the Liberal Democrat Benches. This debate and the early-day motion underline some uncomfortable facts. Half the developing world lacks basic sanitation. Nearly 2.5 billion people in the world, roughly two in five of all of us, do not have proper drains or toilets, and 1.1 billion, roughly one in six, do not have access to safe drinking water. Some 1.8 million people, 90 per cent. of whom are children under the age of five, mostly in developing countries, die every year from diseases related to diarrhoea caused by unsafe water and poor sanitation. Water-related disease is the second biggest killer of children worldwide. The average person in the developing world uses 10 litres of water every day&mdash;the same amount that we use every time we flush the toilet.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/4">The world's recognition of those uncomfortable truths prompted one of the UN millennium development goals, which is to halve by 2015 the proportion of the world's population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. However, the UN millennium development goal progress report of 2007 stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/5" class="indent">&quot;if trends...continue, the world is likely to miss the target by almost 600 million people. Only Eastern, South-Eastern and Western Asia, Northern Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean are on track to halve the proportion of people without basic sanitation by 2015. All other developing regions have made insufficient progress towards this target. In sub-Saharan Africa, the absolute number of people without access to sanitation actually increased&mdash;from 335 million in 1990 to 440 million people by the end of 2004. This number may increase even further if trends do not improve.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/6">For those of us who have been fortunate enough to visit countries in the developing world and work with extraordinary people who cope daily with burdens that we can scarcely comprehend, one of the abiding memories of such a visit is the women and children who line the roads every day as they carry jerry cans and other containers significant distances to find the water that they need for their families for the day. In some circumstances, that parade of graceful, incredibly resourceful people can appear rather romantic&mdash;a traditional pattern of life being carried on in the modern world&mdash;but in reality it is the face of a disaster. Lack of water is one of the single greatest factors restraining developing nations from fulfilling their true potential, as women and children's time and effort is diverted from other activities to the daily grind of securing water&mdash;an act that all of us take for granted. The average distance that women in Africa and Asia walk to collect water is four miles, and the average weight of the water that they carry on their heads is some 20 kg, roughly the same as our baggage allowance in a United Kingdom airport.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/7">That is why, yesterday morning, a collection of hon. Members, religious leaders and some 30 wonderful children from All Souls Church of England primary school in Foley street, London, led by their head teacher, Miss Alex Ascough, assembled in Parliament square to undertake a symbolic four-mile journey to collect water from a fountain in Hyde park, fill some containers and return. We carried nothing like the amount of water that we would actually need for the day.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/8">I asked the House of Commons Library to estimate how much water is used each day on the parliamentary estate, and the Library kindly put together some figures for me. In 2006-07, the estate used 178,084 cu m of water. In working out what that comes to for each of us, one can do various calculations: per Member and peer, per working day or per sitting day. Our best minimum estimate was that all of us&mdash;MPs, peers, parliamentary staff, political staff and visitors&mdash;use 23 gallons of water every day, 365 days a year. Imagine if we had to carry that every day&mdash;fetching it, carrying it, bringing it into our offices&mdash;before starting work and getting on with the day.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/9">I commend those who walked with us yesterday, particularly the children. Their behaviour was impeccable, their interest in what we were doing was remarkable and their sense of solidarity with their brothers and sisters in so many places around the world who do the same for real every day was palpable. I thank them and the school for their efforts. The walk was, we hope, the first of hundreds in the &quot;Turn on the Tap&quot; campaign of challenge walks being organised nationwide by the Christian international development organisation, Samaritan's Purse. Churches, community organisations, schools, clubs and individuals are being encouraged to organise similar four-mile walks on or around <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-10">10 May</phrase> this year. The charity hopes that the simple symbolism captured by the walk will encourage more people to direct their aid efforts towards water provision, and it has prepared aids for schools, including lesson plans and charts, to encourage those who wish to organise a walk. I commend Samaritan's Purse for what it is doing and for its efforts to bring it to the attention of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/10">Samaritan's Purse is far from being the only charity involved with water provision. WaterAid, World Vision and a series of leading non-governmental organisations and charities working in development recognise the importance of the provision of water and provide opportunities for people to donate to support such projects. I am sure that the whole House would commend such work and urge individuals and communities to continue to do what they can to support it. Although government has its role in development&mdash;I shall come to that shortly&mdash;it should not be forgotten that each of us owes an individual responsibility to our neighbours in a rapidly shrinking world. We cannot expect all the burdens to be shouldered by others or by Government. By supporting individual projects and the work of charities and NGOs such as Samaritan's Purse, and by taking part in the &quot;Turn on the Tap&quot; challenge, we are all playing our part.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/11">I should like to say a word about one aspect of the importance of access to water in the developing world, apart from the obvious connection with disease or health, which I think others might cover. The developing world knows that its future does not rely on aid donations, nor has it done so for many years. It relies on countries and their peoples developing their full potential, but if the basics of life are inaccessible, the time spent acquiring them takes people away from the very processes needed to help a country develop in the best possible way.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/12">For children in particular, the absence of water makes a substantial difference to their schooling. Last year, I had the honour of visiting Rwanda with colleagues, including my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1862" name="Andrew Mitchell">the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase>, as part of a substantial project. As we travelled through the country, we saw children taking water to and from places and we visited children in village schools. We saw the quality of some of those schools and of the toilets and sanitation in them. As a result of that, we recognised how important the process of fetching water is.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/13">WELL, the resource centre for water, sanitation and environment health at Loughborough university, says that in Madagascar, for example, 3.5 million school days are lost each year owing to ill health related to poor sanitation, and that children frequently miss school owing to domestic and water-carrying duties. It reports a 12 per cent. increase in Tanzanian school attendance when water is 15 minutes away rather than an hour. Of the 120 million school-age children not in school around the world, the majority are girls. Some 41 per cent. of primary-age girls worldwide not enrolled in school are in south Asia and 35 per cent. are in sub-Saharan Africa. When women and girls have access to water and sanitation, less school time is lost. Where there are working and well maintained separate sanitation facilities for girls, school enrolment increases. In rural Pakistan more than 50 per cent. of girls drop out of school in grades 2 and 3 because the schools do not have toilets.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/14">Many questions surround the provision of water, which cannot and will not always be supplied in exactly the same way. The needs of urban and rural communities are different. There are complex questions about how water is supplied; about the role of non-governmental organisations, charities, Governments and the private sector; about ensuring that a country's resources are best used to provide water; about how utilities are provided all over the world and how those services can be liberalised&mdash;that has been raised in world trade talks&mdash;and about the extent to which communities can, or should, be required to make a financial contribution towards the water that they need in order to help to provide investment for others. Those are all questions with which Governments and others must wrestle, but the basic underlying facts remain undeniable and must challenge us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/15">The debate in this country, which centres on questions such as the provision of bottled or tap water, what we ask for in a restaurant, whether water comes with bubbles or without, and so on, is one of luxury and must seem a world away from the roads lined with women and children as they carry their cans to some hole in the rock from which water is flowing, or to a polluted well where water is not flowing at all. By accidents of birth, they are where they are, and we are here. We cannot put everything right that we would wish to through the stroke of a pen, or the signing of a cheque, but we can individually make a difference by remembering, each time we reach for a bottle or a tap, the difficulties experienced by those who can do neither.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/16">I hope that the &quot;Turn on the Tap&quot; walks will be well supported around the country. I commend Barbara Farquhar, who is promoting the walk for Churches Together in Biggleswade in my constituency on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-10">10 May</phrase>. I urge my constituents to join her and me in this and similar walks.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/17">Will the Minister provide the Government's assessment of progress towards the millennium goals on water and explain the priority given to promoting water access in the aid and development schemes that we support? This debate has aroused interest already, both inside and outside the House, and I know from conversations with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase> that he takes it very seriously. By and large, the subject unites the House. It is a question of how we, as politicians, as a nation and as individuals, can best deliver. The subject might be complex in the detail of how water is supplied, but in essence it is a simple matter of justice and equity and of ensuring that people all over the world have what we take for granted and have so easily available at the turn of a tap.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-19a.261.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1923" speakername="Tim Farron" colnum="261"  time="014:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080319/halltext/80319h0006.htm#08031958000501">
	<p pid="a.261.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase> on securing a very important debate. I want to say some things that are, I suppose, political, vaguely negative and possibly even critical of the situation, but in no way do I wish to break the all-party consensus. The challenges are serious and we face them together.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/2">Every good student of British social history knows about the Rev. Thomas Malthus, who famously predicted in the late 18th century that we would all starve and run out of clean water by the mid-19th century, because, from his standpoint, we were growing geometrically population-wise, but, I think, growing arithmetically in terms of our ability to provide additional food, clean water and sanitation. The poor guy has been held up as a laughing stock for the past 230 years by A-level tutors throughout the country, and with no offence to the memory of Mr. Malthus, I should not like to see him rehabilitated in the coming years on the subject of access to clean water throughout the world. I want him to continue to be proved wrong, but I have my fears, because over the next 40 years, the world's population will increase by 50 per cent. and demand for water will increase by more than that. The sad fact is that Malthus may be proven right if we cannot find ways to ensure that all the world's people have access to that basic human right&mdash;clean and safe water.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/3">Currently, more than 1 billion people do not have access to enough clean water to meet those basic needs&mdash;not the extravagancies that we assume we need, but their basic needs. The consequences are dire, because as the hon. Gentleman said, there are 5 billion cases of diarrhoea each year among children in developing countries. That sickness is the second-biggest killer of children in those countries, and in total 2 million people, predominantly young children under five years old, die each year because they do not have access to clean water.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/4">In this country, however, according to a recent BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; study, we spend &pound;2 billion a year on bottled water, despite having access to perfectly clean and safe water&mdash;tap water. Dare I say it that in western society we have become so prissy and gullible that now we will buy water only in bottles? Although I am pleased to say that the bottled water before me is not imported, some is, and often it is even imported from developing countries. According to the BBC survey for &quot;Panorama&quot;, those countries include Fiji, where one third of the population do not have access to clean and safe drinking water. There is something obscene about that, as I am sure we all agree.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/5">The situation should make us ashamed. It made the world's leaders so ashamed that the millennium development goals were agreed to, including goal 7.3, which aims to halve by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. Sadly, as the hon. Gentleman said, current trends show that we are off target in large parts of the world. Indeed, as things stand, we will miss it by a staggering 600 million people, and the tragedy is that in some parts of the developing world, we may even be going backwards. The United Nations millennium development goals report 2007 states that in the largest part of Africa, the absolute number of people without access to sanitation increased from 335 million at the beginning of the 1990s to 440 million just three years ago. That is outrageous, but it is not the only threat that we face, because climate change threatens access to clean water, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/6">The UN estimates that as things stand, by 2080 an additional 1.8 billion could live in a water-scarce environment. The challenge is huge and it is not getting any easier. Of the 1.1 billion people who do not have access to clean water, most cannot reach it because the provision simply does not exist. However, there is evidence, sadly, that a large minority of those 1.1 billion people do not have access to clean water because of financial constraints, and they are entirely avoidable.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/7">To support the development of water infrastructure, many private companies have taken advantage of aid from western countries as water supplies have been extensively privatised. Hon. Members will, I hope, be reassured that I am not trying to make a gratuitously ideological point, merely a practical one. I contend that the privatisation of supply has on the whole been a failure. It has been a waste of aid money and a means of making profit from impoverished societies while denying the very poorest people access to clean and safe water.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/8">The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, when he was the Secretary of State for International Development, made important steps forward last year when he ensured that additional support was given to enable public utilities to develop water and sanitation infrastructure on a not-for-profit basis in developing countries. However, the European Union continues to promote unfair market solutions, which can hardly be described as either fair trade or free trade. I say so as a strong supporter of that body. The Minister knows about the economic partnership agreements that would allow EU countries to have bilateral arrangements with countries that are essentially their former colonies, and which would formalise a trade-for-aid package that obligated the developing country in the partnership to open their markets to their rich European partner in return for aid. In many cases, the part of the developing country's economy that is of most interest to powerful European companies is its utilities. Therefore, water gets controlled by those aiming to make a profit from it and it is not supplied freely and safely to everybody in need.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/9">To raise the spectre of Malthus again, the great fear is that increased world population will place even greater pressure on this precious resource, especially if it is controlled by self-interested bodies whose motivation is primarily profit. The tensions over water rights will increase. However, the tensions over the ownership of this most natural of resources have been building for many years; it is not a new thing. I suggest that these tensions are going to become worse unless we can ensure fair trade in water supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/10">A story was related to me recently of the old farmer from Colorado who, just after world war two, spoke about the local private water company that had effectively removed his water rights and the rights of others in his rural community. I will not attempt the accent, but the farmer said, &quot;Them folks in Denver, they've reversed the laws of nature: they've made water run uphill towards money.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/11">Although we have heard that the current situation, in which a sixth of the world's population is in water need, is dire, my fear is that, without radical change and political will, which includes understanding that water is a public resource&mdash;if we do not understand that, things will only get worse&mdash;the situation will deteriorate. That is why, in redoubling efforts to meet millennium development goal 7.3, we must face up to some uncomfortable truths and powerful vested interests that lie behind our failure as a world community to meet those targets for access to safe, clean water.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-19a.264.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1965" speakername="Michael Moore" colnum="264"  time="015:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080319/halltext/80319h0007.htm#08031958000502">
	<p pid="a.264.0/1">May I be the latest in the line to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase> on his impressive leadership on this issue and the fact that he has secured this debate today? In doing so, he has allowed us the opportunity to reflect on one of the biggest challenges that the world faces and one of the most important issues that we, as a rich developed country, must tackle, and we must help others to tackle it, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/2">The hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire set out at great length the underlying problems that many people face; I hope that I do not repeat too many of the statistics that he quoted, but some of them bear repeating. He was right to remind us of the gulf between the privileged position that we enjoy in the Palace of Westminster, where water is literally on tap to us for every need and every whim, and the harsh realities of the everyday lives of millions of people around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/3">I also pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase>, who rightly highlighted the work that Oxfam has done. Many other organisations, including NGOs, are also active in this field, but we understand why Oxfam plays such an important part in his view. Like the Ministers to whom he referred, about a year or so ago, I visited Oxfam's headquarters, which is a truly spectacular set-up. It is a symbol, I suppose, of Oxfam's breadth and reach and, as the right hon. Member pointed out, of the important contribution that Oxfam makes in so many different areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/4">Without getting sidetracked, may I also endorse the observations of the right hon. Member for Oxford, East about Gaza? Although most of the comments today will be focused on the crisis in sub-Saharan Africa, the situation in Gaza is truly appalling, as we have said in so many debates in the House recently. It seems likely that the Minister will have a generous amount of time to reply to this debate, and I hope that he will take some time to address the points that have been made about Gaza. I have been pressing the Secretary of State for International Development and other Ministers in correspondence about the extent to which they regard Israel's response to the issues in Gaza as proportionate. I invite the Minister today to address that subject, including the comments of the right hon. Member for Oxford, East.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1923" name="Tim Farron">the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron)</phrase> has put things in very dramatic terms, and he is right to do so. For all the intellectual humour that there may have been at Mr. Malthus's expense over the centuries, my hon. Friend is right to remind us of the basic prediction that Malthus was making and the problems that we may yet have to laugh on the other side of our face about.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/6">Although I do not accept every aspect of what my hon. Friend said about the role of the private sector, he is right to highlight some of the dangers of private sector involvement. It is important that we strike the right balance. We must get the private sector expertise, initiative and input into tackling problems like the lack of access to safe water and sanitation, but we must not tie developing countries in such a way that they are beholden to the profit motive rather than what is absolutely their first priority: ensuring that they get the access to the water and other resources that they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/7">Like the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire, I pay tribute to the staff of Samaritan's Purse, particularly Simon Barrington, Matt Bird and the many others who have been instrumental in bringing Parliament's attention to this issue. As you will know, Mr. Hood, MPs are inundated by invitations to meet groups and organisations, both small and large, from constituents and many others. It takes a special kind of organisation and a special kind of issue to create a stand-out moment that one remembers. Meeting the guys from Samaritan's Purse a few weeks ago, I was immediately impressed both by what they are trying to do as an organisation and, even more crucially, by the fact that they were not puffing their own organisation but focusing on this issue. Through speaking to them and subsequent research, I, for one, have learned a great deal more about the issue, and I am absolutely sure that they are right to expend so much energy on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/8">Again like the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire, I pay tribute to those who joined us yesterday on what was thankfully a fairly modest walk. It took place in reasonably clement conditions; they were a bit chillier than we might have expected and a world away from the temperature that the people of sub-Saharan Africa must cope with day in, day out. The walk, from Parliament square to Hyde park, was a good opportunity for us to reflect on what is a daily responsibility for people in many parts of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/9">MPs and Church leaders went on the walk, but I, too, was very impressed by the teachers and particularly the children of All Soul's primary school. It is clearly a school that has a very outward-looking focus. I asked the children about what was exciting them at the moment, and they were still full of happy memories of a recent visit to a farm in Wales, which had obviously opened their eyes to very early starts in the morning and to some different realities of life here in Britain. More broadly, however, they were very seized of the issue that we were highlighting yesterday by that walk. We were all grateful when we reached Hyde park that, although there were quite a lot of water containers, there was not one each, so we were able to understand a little of the issue without having to endure all the discomfort and physical pain that would go with making such a walk regularly. Perish the thought that we might have to carry what we as individuals use on this estate every day.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/10">&quot;Turn on the Tap&quot;, Samaritan's Purse and many other organisations and campaigns are focusing on this issue and drawing particular attention to the walks that will take place around the country on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-10">10 May</phrase>. I hope that there will be a lot of support then for the different Church organisations and other organisations across the United Kingdom that are participating in this year's efforts. It is fundamentally important that we, in all our communities across the United Kingdom, are conscious of this issue and do our bit, both to raise awareness and to make a material difference to the lives of people across the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/11">We have already heard many of the statistics. None the less, the fact that 1.1 billion people live without access to safe water is something that we should not tolerate. Parliamentary convention requires us to be moderate in our tone in how we conduct these debates, and quite right too, Mr. Hood; I do not intend to challenge that convention. However, the &quot;Turn on the Tap&quot; website quite rightly says that the fact that 1.1 billion people do not have access to safe water is an outrage. We need to get an element of that outrage into the way that we think about the problem that we are trying to tackle.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/12">Hon. Members have already mentioned the millennium development goal, and I am sure that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase>, who is the Conservative shadow Minister for International Development, and the Minister himself will reflect on that goal, too, in due course. Although, as others have said, we are in danger of failing to meet that target, we must remember that it is not to eradicate the problem or to ensure that everyone has access to clean water, but to halve the number of people without access to it. Even if we meet that target, therefore, we will still be only part of the way towards eradicating this terrible problem, and we must not lose sight of that. Not meeting that relatively modest target would therefore be a real failure.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/13">We are talking not just about one development goal; it is interlinked with many others. Indeed, I am sure that a case can be made for each of the millennium development goals to be linked to this issue, because if we are serious about reducing child mortality, promoting better maternal health and achieving universal primary education, we must ensure that people have access to safe water&mdash;the issue must be right up there and it needs to be ticked off as having been achieved. As the kids yesterday showed us, taking a few hours out of the day to go and collect water means that people are in no position to study or to lift themselves out of poverty. We must therefore see the issue in the round.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/14">At the same time that we are trying to tackle these issues, we are also fighting the huge problem of climate change. As we try to mitigate the worst effects of bad sanitation and poor access to water, global warming is making the problem more acute&mdash;not just in the obvious sense that it is warmer, but because the weather is being disrupted, thus threatening what predictable sources exist. Sadly, water and access to it are increasingly a source of conflict, as we see in Gaza and parts of Africa. We can quickly get into a vicious spiral, moving further away from our goals, rather than closer to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/15">The developed world has of course pledged to meet the millennium development goals, which are a wonderful focus for us all, as we seek to reach a point where we are no longer ashamed by the fact that so many people go hungry and do without water and so much else. The European Union has had its water initiative in previous years, and the World Bank has been financing a huge range of projects across the globe through the International Development Association. In recognising the need to speed up our achievement of the development goals that we are talking about, the Government have been central to the call for action, and I hope that the Minister will continue to use that call as a focal point for all countries in the European Union and elsewhere to encourage them to recognise the centrality of those goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/16">DFID has increased its funding in this area, and I, like others, pay tribute to the Government for that. How have they used the increased funding during the current year and how will they achieve their target of doubling expenditure by the end of 2011? Increasingly, particularly on health&mdash;we debated the international health partnerships in this Chamber a couple of weeks ago&mdash;we are looking at how we can focus different channels of aid and assistance through one programme or another to minimise the bureaucracy and ineffectiveness of some of the existing methods of delivery. Does the Minister see some scope for greater co-ordination and focus on the issue?</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/17">The hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire talked about how much we learned from yesterday's walk, and I repeat his point that it was a humbling experience not only to learn so much from the children who took part, but to reflect on why we were taking the trouble to walk four miles on just one day, as opposed to every day of our lives, and not in the conditions that so many others experience. Like the hon. Gentleman, I urge people in my constituency and in others up and down the land to support the &quot;Turn on the Tap&quot; initiative, not only on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-10">10 May</phrase>, but in the following weeks, months and years. We should never lose sight of the fact there is an outrage at the root of this issue, and we must do something about it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-19a.267.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" speakername="Mark Lancaster" colnum="267"  time="015:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080319/halltext/80319h0007.htm#08031958000503">
	<p pid="a.267.0/1">It is a pleasure to be able to contribute to this important debate. If I achieve nothing else in my few remarks, I hope that I will underline the fact that sanitation and clean water must go hand in hand. All too often sanitation has been very much an afterthought, and it is vital that the two issues are considered in partnership.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/2">I start, however, by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase> on securing this important debate. He did a marvellous job of outlining the issues and opening the debate. I also compliment <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> on his excellent speech, which highlighted not only the good work of Oxfam in his constituency, but the contribution that other non-governmental organisations make. In addition, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1923" name="Tim Farron">the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron)</phrase> on his informed speech, which highlighted the impact that not dealing with this problem can have on health. He also made some interesting remarks about the role of the private sector, to which I intend to return. Finally, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1965" name="Michael Moore">the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore)</phrase> once again made a very good speech, and I take this opportunity to commend him on tabling early-day motion 897, which in recent weeks and in the run-up to today's debate has done much to highlight the concern about the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/3">This is a timely debate, not least because 2008 is the United Nations international year of sanitation. As we heard, yesterday saw the &quot;Turn on the Tap&quot; four-mile walk, with my hon. Friend leading the way. That event highlighted the average distance that people have to walk every day to fetch clean water so that they and their families can drink that day. My hon. Friend and other hon. Members highlighted the fact that the distance travelled by such people&mdash;the majority of them women&mdash;is just one of the many negative impacts that the lack of access to clean water has on people in developing countries. Indeed, the impact on health of the lack of access to clean water and basic sanitation is staggering. Various statistics have been quoted, but the fact that every 20 seconds a child dies because of the lack of clean water and sanitation is frightening. That amounts to 1.6 million children under the age of five dying each year because of unsafe water and inadequate hygiene.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/4">It could be argued that when the international community signed up to the millennium development goals, clean water and sanitation were not seen as sufficiently important to appear as one of the eight main headline goals. The issues before us are covered in MDG 7 on ensuring environmental stability&mdash;in MDG 7.3 to be precise. Following the 2002 world summit on sustainable development, however, the world woke up to the crucial role that access to clean water and sanitation can play in helping us to reach the MDGs. In the same year, at the UN special summit on children and the second and third world water forums, three new goals were set for the international community. The first was to halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water by 2015. The second was to halve the proportion of people who do not have direct access to basic sanitation by 2015. The final goal was to equip all schools with sanitation and hand-washing facilities, also by 2015.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/5">Unfortunately, it has been widely recognised, and DFID has been candid in admitting&mdash;I therefore hope that the Minister will take this criticism on the chin; I assure him that it is the only criticism that I shall make of his Department today&mdash;that just as the world was waking up to the importance of water and sanitation, DFID was, unfortunately, restructured and has been criticised for rather taking its eye off the ball. Dr. Darren Saywell of the International Water Association said:</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/6" class="indent">&quot;A major watershed, in my opinion, in 2002 occurred just after the World Summit on Sustainable Development when DFiD restructured itself and a lot of the impetus and momentum that went into water and sanitation was lost at that time.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/7">To be fair and balanced, however, it is clear for the 2006 White Paper that, having identified sanitation as one of the four essential public services for the MDGs, and having recently increased its financial commitment to water and sanitation, the Department has attempted, and continues to attempt, to re-establish its lead on this issue. I am convinced that, with continued effort, it will do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/8">Despite DFID's renewed interest, which I commend, progress towards the goals remains painfully slow. A recently published World Health Organisation report estimated that the sanitation component of the MDG sanitation targets faces</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/9" class="indent">&quot;a projected shortfall of 550 million people in 2015 from target achievement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/10">As of today&mdash;the figures are worth repeating&mdash;an estimated 1.1 billion people still do not have access to improved water supplies, and 2.4 billion do not have access to any type of improved sanitation. I am sure that the Minister agrees that that simply is not good enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/11">It would cost an estimated $42 billion to achieve the goal of providing clean water to half of those who currently go without it, and $322 billion to maintain the current clean water system. Likewise, it would cost $142 billion to halve the number of people who do not have access to basic sanitation, and $216 billion to maintain the current sanitation systems in developing nations. That adds up to spending a staggering $72 billion a year up to 2015 to achieve those goals. Although I commend DFID's uplift in spending, with figures like those, it will take a combined effort from all the nations that have signed up to achieve those important goals. I hope that whichever party is in power, the UK will continue to take the lead.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/12">Last year's report by the Select Committee on International Development, however, highlighted the fact that money alone will neither provide toilets and taps for the billions of people who currently lack access, nor drive the demand and change of behaviour that are required to provide sustainable uptake. The rush to spend money can have unintended consequences, of which I have personal experience. In 2006, I spent some time as a military engineer in Helmand, where I worked alongside DFID to deliver quick impact projects. In our desire to deliver those projects, to show people on the ground how the Government were beginning to make a difference to their lives, we made mistakes. I have raised this issue before in the House. We dug so many new wells in Helmand province without conducting proper water surveys that we ended up lowering the water table, and as a result the ancient karazes that brought water off the mountains no longer flowed. That is a clear example of how we can rush in and spend money to help a community, but instead have a long-lasting negative impact on that community. I hope that we have learned from such lessons.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/13">Last week, I was in Guatemala&mdash;as an aside, I must tell the Minister that many non-governmental organisations there fear that DFID is turning its back on that country&mdash;where I was fascinated by a water project there. A local community managed to raise enough money to bring a 35 km pipeline into its village. Unfortunately, however, it was forced to bring the water through surrounding communities, many of whom were jealous that the pipeline was going through their communities but not serving them. The project took three years to be established because communities along the pipeline were simply smashing the pipe out of jealousy because they were angry that they had no access to the water it carried, while other communities did.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/14">What have we done and what should we be doing? DFID's website states that the targets</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/15" class="indent">&quot;are central to DFID's approach to poverty reduction and sustainable development.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/16">It also recognises that, on current trends, the</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/17" class="indent">&quot;sanitation target will be missed in both Africa and Asia by almost one billion people.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/18">To be fair, the rhetoric is good, but actions and global leadership are needed if we are to achieve what we set out to do. DFID is taking steps in the right direction: it has committed to increase its spending on essential public services such as water, sanitation, health, education and social protection in at least half of the UK's direct support programmes in developing countries. In addition, as I have said, it will double its support for the provision of water and sanitation in sub-Saharan Africa to &pound;95 million a year by 2007-08, and more than double funding again to &pound;200 million by 2010-11. Perhaps the Minister will confirm those figures and give an update on our progress toward the 2010-11 figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/19">We must also consider carefully how the private sector can help in delivering essential services such as water. I return to the point that the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale made. It might well be damaging for water supply to remain a monopoly of the state in countries where the state is manifestly failing to deliver adequate services to its citizens. Well managed privatisation could help to expand access to clean water and to save lives if&mdash;I emphasise &quot;if&quot;&mdash;there is proper supervision, regulatory bodies and contract enforcement. What is the Minister's assessment of the merits of greater private sector participation in service delivery in developing countries?</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/20">Aid predictability is one concern that is repeatedly raised with me when I visit NGOs in the field, as in Guatemala last week. Of course, political situations change in countries, and that may affect funding streams. In Nepal, which I hope to visit next month to monitor the elections, the Department has cut its water and sanitation budget from &pound;4 million in 2003 to just &pound;1.9 million in 2007-08. Its failure to provide long-term, predictable and co-ordinated finance in those sectors is clearly detrimental to achieving success in such projects. What steps is the Minister taking to meet the criticisms of his Department in that regard?</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/21">The Select Committee has made it clear that we must do more than improve the predictability of funding streams. The hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale highlighted some of the problems of tackling killer diseases. Spending money effectively can achieve disproportionate results in the provision of access to clean water and sanitation in developing nations, but, as I have highlighted, money is not the solution to everything. Unfortunately there remain significant barriers to progress on sanitation. For example, access to clean water and basic sanitation seldom features prominently on national political agendas, and people still attach a higher priority to water than to sanitation, even though the two go hand in hand. Unfortunately, factors such as prestige and convenience rank above health as a motivation for people seeking improved sanitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/22">The interconnecting nature of the MDGs has been highlighted, not least by the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, but by helping to provide clean water and basic sanitation, we can provide a catalyst unlike any other to build a platform from which to achieve other MDGs. For example, we can do a huge amount towards MDGs 2 and 3&mdash;achieving universal primary education and promoting gender equality and empowering women. If young girls and women do not have to walk four miles every day, they are more likely to have the opportunity to partake in some sort of educational programme. In turn, as the Select Committee points out, girls who have been educated have improved maternal health, which relates to MDG 5, and are twice as likely to stay safe from AIDS, which relates to MDG 6. Of course, improved access to clean water would also help to reduce diarrhoea and water-borne diseases, thus reducing child mortality by an estimated 30 per cent., which relates to MDG 4.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/23">Finally, I want to touch on the links between water and agriculture, which is the biggest consumer of water in developing countries, accounting for 70 to 90 per cent. of water consumption. As water availability becomes increasingly constrained, perhaps as a result of climate change or population growth, countries will have to make increasingly difficult decisions on how much water they can afford to use for agriculture. However, as several NGOs have pointed out, this appears to be the one area that DFID's water strategy still does not address adequately. When he winds up the debate, will the Minister touch on that important matter and, in particular, say how his Department's water strategy links with helping to achieving MDG 1, which seeks to halve the number of people who suffer from hunger?</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/24">In conclusion, it is clear from today's debate that there is consensus across the House that although we are definitely moving in the right direction, there is slight frustration at the pace of progress. More can&mdash;indeed, must&mdash;be done if our aim of meeting all the MDGs by 2015 is to be a realistic one. I end with a quote from the former South African Development Minister, Ronnie Kasrils, who said:</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/25" class="indent">&quot;Water is the source of life. We cannot think about developing our people if we fail to provide them with a basic supply of water&quot;.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-19a.273.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" speakername="Gareth Thomas" colnum="273"  time="015:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080319/halltext/80319h0008.htm#08031958000506">
	<p pid="a.273.0/1">I cannot currently give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. We are barely on track to meet the millennium development goal on water and we are certainly off track in achieving the target on sanitation. As the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes alluded to, sub-Saharan Africa is seriously off track against the water and sanitation targets. It is that lack of progress that my right hon. Friend the former Secretary of State sought to challenge in setting out the case for more global action on water and sanitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/2">To give the House hope that the situation will continue to change, I give the example that in the 15 years from 1990 to 2005, more than 1.2 billion people gained access to water supply and sanitation services. We know that progress has happened and that it is achievable when the Governments of developing countries, international donors and a variety of other players in developing countries work together to accelerate progress. I hope to say a little about how some of the resources that we are spending in developing countries have made progress and will make further progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/3">I will briefly dwell on some of the broader points that have been raised by hon. Members in noting that simply providing safe drinking water and better sanitation would drastically cut the needless loss of life in poor countries. As I said, the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale was right to highlight that poor people are the least able to deal with the ill health that is caused by unsafe water and how a vicious circle is often created. The water used by poor people is too often contaminated or polluted. That can result in sickness and the medical costs increase the level of debt that they experience, making them less likely to be able to work or send their children to school. Improved access to water and sanitation breaks that cycle. Indeed, hon. Members alluded to the huge economic benefits of access to safe water. Millions of working days are saved and can be achieved, and millions of children, particularly girls, can attend school, with all the resulting economic benefits for the country, as well as the individual. As I said, it is women and girls who have the biggest responsibilities for providing water for drinking and cooking, and for ensuring family hygiene. We need to continue to tackle that implicit discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/4">It is worth noting a point which I do not believe has surfaced in the debate thus far. By 2025, more than two thirds of the world's population will live in water-stressed countries, so the way in which water is shared and used will be critical. The importance of that will be further heightened by an increasing population, by the urbanisation that is taking place, by the increased economic growth that is needed and by the growing challenge of climate change. All those factors will combine to make stress around access to water all the more important. Therefore, we must work with countries to help them strike the right balance between water for growth, for people to live healthy and productive lives, and, crucially, for keeping ecosystems in good shape. If people cannot do that, their long-term development will be threatened.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/5">In order to do that, change is needed, not just within the international community but within developing countries as well. Some developing country Governments, but by no means all, do not pay enough attention to what poor people in their country say, or respond to their needs. As a result, they do not provide enough finance for water or ensure that it is not just the wealthy, the influential and the privileged who are well served in respect of access to water and good sanitation. All too often, we see in some developing countries that the funds to maintain water and sanitation systems and to keep them operating are simply not in place. Forty per cent. of the boreholes in Africa are not working simply because they need to be repaired. They could provide access to water, but they do not because they have not been repaired. That speaks to a broader point about the lack of good governance in water sectors in developing countries. That is a key point on which we are working.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/6">I alluded to the call that my right hon. Friend the former Secretary of State made in November 2006. In essence, he called for five key elements&mdash;five &quot;ones&quot;&mdash;to change. At the international level, he called for one international monitoring report and for one international meeting to chart progress on access to water and sanitation, and to explore what else needed doing. In developing countries, he called for one national water and sanitation plan&mdash;not a plan for how each donor would spend their money, but one clear national water and sanitation plan that everybody would get behind.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/7">My right hon. Friend also made clear the need for all the different donors in country to come behind the leadership of one clearly designated UN agency, be it UNICEF, the World Health Organisation or something else, and support the water plan. One UN agency would take the lead.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/8">In country, there should be one water and sanitation monitoring group of donors&mdash;not groups of donors deciding what they thought needed to happen, but all donors coming together. That may seem like common sense to hon. Member, but the sad reality is that it has not happened in many countries to date. There has often been a series of international meetings and a series of reports, and, in some years, no report. We are funding the first international monitoring report, which should be published shortly. We expect to have an opportunity to debate its implications at an international meeting that will take place in September.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/9">In respect of the three ones principle, we are working in Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Mozambique and Bangladesh in supporting one national water and sanitation plan, seeking one UN agency to take the lead and ensuring that there is only one meeting of donors in country. In addition, we have identified three critical areas for progress over the next 12 months. Sanitation has been a taboo issue for too long. That point was made by the UN Secretary-General and was repeated yesterday at the water resources forum. International donors need to do more about sanitation both internationally and in developing countries directly. We are directly supporting the international year of sanitation to make that happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/10">We need to do more to manage water resources better, and we will prioritise resources and time to achieve that purpose. We must consider how we can ensure that water services are better delivered to the poor. That will be done partly through the three ones principle that I alluded to, but also by ensuring that money goes directly to where it is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/11">I shall give some examples of the progress that we are making and the benefits that are being achieved with British development assistance, provided by my Department. We have approved new funding of some &pound;75 million over five years for water and sanitation in Ethiopia. We are confident that some 3.2 million Ethiopians will benefit from that spend, but between now and 2015, 300,000 more people need to get clean water and 450,000 more people need to get basic sanitation every day if we are to meet the millennium development goals. That is a huge challenge for the international community, and it is why, when the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire intervened on me, I could not give him complete confidence that we would meet the targets. However, we seek to do everything that we can to raise the importance of these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/12">A new global sanitation fund has been launched, in part as a result of the leadership of the WHO, to try to help communities build toilets and improve hygiene, and we have committed &pound;1.5 million over the next three years to that fund. Other donors have pledged funding as well, and we will work on maximising the impact of the fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/13">I mentioned that we need to do more about water resources. Yesterday, at the water resources forum, I was able to confirm our continuing support for the Nile basin initiative, which is an example of co-operation to manage shared waters, and to encourage the peace and stability that underpin economic growth in the region. The countries that are part of the Nile basin have a combined population of some 300 million, and they are among the poorest and most water-starved people in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/14">Hon. Members who know a little about the Nile basin will recognise that there is a history of tension between the countries in the area and that water has been the source of some of that tension. Good water-basin management in the region is essential, given the importance of climate change, to ensure that those countries continue to work together. We have committed &pound;6 million to date to the Nile basin initiative, and yesterday, I was able to pledge a further &pound;8 million to ensure that the initiative continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/15">Similarly, many hon. Members will have seen the weekend coverage of the pace of change in the melting of Himalayan glaciers. They provide water for 1.6 billion people, and it is estimated that climate change could cause them to disappear in as little as 25 years, which is within the lifetime of most of us in the Chamber. Countries must work together to determine how they can manage and better share the water resources in those areas. It is a volatile region, and we want to ensure that water is not a source of conflict or volatility. A south Asia water initiative has been launched to catalyse greater co-operation between countries, and we have pledged &pound;500,000 to that initiative.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-19a.279.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" speakername="Christopher Chope" colnum="279"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080319/halltext/80319h0009.htm#08031958000509">
	<p pid="a.279.1/1">This debate is taking place at the same time as the major debate in the main Chamber on post office closures. Both debates have a common theme: the perceived unwillingness of public corporations&mdash;in the main Chamber debate the Post Office and in this Chamber's debate the Forestry Commission&mdash;to listen to and respond to public concerns and to be properly accountable. I have initiated this debate to seek the intervention of the Minster, whom I welcome to her place, on a local issue of vital importance to my constituents which, if left unaddressed, will undermine the good relationship between the Forestry Commission and the people of east Dorset.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/2">I start with a quote from the Forestry Commission's website. The Forestry Commission states that in its remit it has</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/3" class="indent">&quot;a commitment to make local communities a priority in the way public forests are managed... England's Forestry Minister pledged that local people will have an even greater involvement in decisions which affect their community.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/4">When the Minister has heard what I have to say, I hope that she will reach the same conclusion as I have that that pledge, made in her name, is not being delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/5">Last summer, the Forestry Commission invited tenders for a contractor to extend the annual programme of forest concerts. It included reference to a potential new site in Moors valley in east Dorset. At Moors valley there is a very successful country park, run by the district council in partnership with the Forestry Commission. In January, however, it became apparent that the proposal was not to use the existing country park, but to create a completely new, purpose-built concert venue for 5,000 spectators and 2,000 cars by cutting down 15 acres of woodland in the heart of Ringwood forest.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/6">Ringwood forest, unlike a lot of other concert venues used by the Forestry Commission, is surprisingly close to a residential neighbourhood. That is probably why there has been such reaction to the proposal, which is rather different to the reaction to similar Forestry Commission proposals. When local people heard about the proposal through their parish council, their reaction was one of horror and stunned disbelief. Lots of questions were asked, such as &quot;Why does the Forestry Commission wish to destroy the peace and tranquillity of Ringwood forest at summer weekends and subject local residents to the noise and nuisance generated by rock concerts?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/7">The initial justification, gleaned from the Forestry Commission website, was a desire</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/8" class="indent">&quot;to take the importance of woodlands to new audiences and make them relevant to people in new ways.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/9">In the vicinity of Moors valley, Ringwood forest, Avon heath country park and the New Forest, there is no need to invite people to the forest to find new relevance in the importance of woodlands. People are already aware of that, and they have plenty of opportunities for public access and recreation. That comment on the website as a justification for the proposal was greeted with a lot of scepticism. Local people pointed out that Somerley park, which is less than two miles from the proposed venue, is an existing privately owned facility at which concerts have been successfully held. It also has the advantage of better and safer vehicle access, without the need to cut down 15 acres of woodland.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/10">In the past few weeks, the horror, disbelief and scepticism has turned to intense anger. It is impossible to overstate the extent to which local people are incensed by the proposed intrusion into their treasured local forest environment. The St. Leonards and St. Ives parish council convened an extraordinary general meeting, which was packed to overflowing, with more than 300 people inside the hall and others standing outside in the rain. The Forestry Commission representative failed to answer the concerns raised. At the end of the meeting, a vote was taken that overwhelmingly rejected the proposals. By overwhelming, I mean that two people supported the Forestry Commission proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/11">The Forestry Commission has manifestly failed to address the inconsistencies inherent in its proposal&mdash;for example, the incompatibility of removing 15 acres of forest to create a car park for 2,000 cars with the Forestry Commission's climate change credentials. I am sure that the Minister is as concerned about that as I am. The Forestry Commission has said that no alternative venues are available, but we know that there are. The Forestry Commission has asserted that it wants to work closely with local people, yet it has made such an unpopular proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/12">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-06">6 March</phrase>, the chairman of the Forestry Commission responded to a letter that I had sent to him on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-13">13 February</phrase>. He delayed his response to enable him to report the outcome of the meeting. However, it will not surprise you, Mr. Hood, to learn that I had already received an extensive report on that meeting. The chairman said that the public meeting</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/13" class="indent">&quot;did confirm that there was considerable opposition to the proposal, but the issues raised were not unexpected.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/14">He said that other possible sites for a concert venue had been considered, but land tenure, among other things, was a problem. The problem was that the other sites for concerts, including ones to which I have already referred, were not owned by the Forestry Commission&mdash;in other words, the Forestry Commission would not be able to profit from the activities that took place on those sites. The Minister smiles knowingly. Perhaps she recalls a time when, under a Conservative Government, there was discussion about the possibility of privatising the Forestry Commission. The strongest argument against such a privatisation was that it would lead to all sorts of undesirable commercial activities if the forests were taken into private ownership. Ironically, that is exactly what seems to be happening under the Forestry Commission while it still remains a nationalised body.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/15">On the number of concerts, which was mentioned in my letter, the chairman of the Forestry Commission offered some reassurance, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/16" class="indent">&quot;Even on our most popular and longest established venues, they only host two weekends of concert events each year.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/17">He omitted to say that three venues&mdash;Delamere, Thetford and Cannock Chase&mdash;now have weekend festivals that go on for three days: Friday, Saturday and Sunday. That may not be so bad when people do not live close to a venue&mdash;some of those forests, Thetford in particular, are very large and dense&mdash;but a three-day festival at the Ringwood forest site would give local residents the prospect of a long weekend of hell.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/18">The chairman of the Forestry Commission went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/19" class="indent">&quot;At the present time we have not heard any overriding reason why we should not continue with our plans in view of the benefits that the wider community stands to derive from the project including the reinvestment of the revenue generated back into improving the land we manage.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/20">On examination, however, it appears that the only benefit to the wider community is the profit that the Forestry Commission will make. There is no benefit to the local people in providing them with a concert venue when they already have one. I do not know how familiar the Minister is with the location, but it is not too far to the Bournemouth International Centre, which hosts the largest rock concerts in the country, and it is very close to a lot of other open-air stadiums.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/21">If the only issue for the Forestry Commission is profit, how much will it make? Yesterday, a Forestry Commission staff member told a meeting in Verwood that for just one concert the gross income would be &pound;150,000&mdash;from selling 5,000 tickets at &pound;30 each&mdash;and that the net profit would be &pound;15,000. My constituents are not spoilsports. They are proud to host round 1 of the Pirelli Motor Sports Association National Gravel Rally championship, which took place over 40 miles of Forestry Commission roads largely in my constituency in February this year, as it has for the past 20 years. The commission benefits from the event because it charges &pound;600 per mile for the use of its forest roads, making a profit of &pound;24,000. The event is called the Rallye Sunseeker&mdash;it is sponsored by Dorset's largest employer&mdash;but it takes place in the winter and, in contrast to the proposal for Ringwood forest, it is designed to work with the needs and desires of local people. The money raised by the commission from the event is meant to be reinvested in the locality, although I have been unable to find any hard evidence that that has happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/22">The commission also profits from the Moors valley car park, the income from which is shared with East Dorset district council, so it is already making profits or income from commercial activities in my constituency, if indeed money is the root of the problem. At a meeting, Mr. Rothnie of the Forestry Commission said that it is all about money. He said that if he could not raise the money from the proposed project, he would have to raise it from somewhere else. The question is, is it worth alienating local people for the sake of &pound;10,000 or &pound;15,000 per concert? I think not.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/23">A letter sent to Mr. Rothnie by a local resident, Dr. Jonathan Edwards, who is a member of the parish council, asks:</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/24" class="indent">&quot;Is it worth alienating the local community for such a sum? I have also indicated that should the Forestry Commission listen to the local residents and take their feelings into account and withdraw their proposal, I would be prepared&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/25">as I am sure others would&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/26" class="indent">&quot;to get together...and form a local residents group in order to find ways of generating income from activities which do not involve concerts...I hope we can bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion for all concerned and move on in a constructive manner rather than compound the divisions between us in a long and protracted fight through the licensing and appeals process&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/27">The Minister may be aware that such a long and bitter dispute involving licensing is exactly what happened in Cannock Chase. In the end, it cost the Forestry Commission &pound;50,000 and the local council &pound;25,000 in fees and generated a lot of animosity. We do not want that to happen in this case; instead, we want to get people talking to each other to find a common way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/28">The commission has discovered that there is a lot more money to be made out of promoting rock concerts than from planting and managing woodland. I am not surprised or concerned about that. However, one of the pop concerts being organised is Status Quo, and I was concerned to read that tickets for the Cannock Chase concert that were put on sale for around &pound;30 in January and February are now on sale on the web black market for &pound;80 or &pound;90. That sort of activity causes my constituents a lot of concern. If there is a concert that is so popular and over-subscribed that people will do anything to get into it, what is the point of having a concert in a venue that is not self-contained, as many venues are, and that will generate an enormous amount of traffic from all over the country, to the detriment of local amenities?</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/29">There is stunned disbelief at the proposal and intense anger and frustration at the seeming intransigence of the Forestry Commission. I am going to see Mr. Seddon, the deputy surveyor of the New Forest next week. I hope, in the light of what the Minister says, that the meeting will be held in a constructive spirit and that there will be a desire to find an alternative way to raise funds for the commission locally, in addition to what it already raises. Otherwise, I fear that the prospects of the people of east Dorset working as closely with the commission in future as they have in past will be damaged. I look forward to hearing what the Minister is able to say to pour oil on troubled waters.</p>

	<p pid="a.282.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" name="Christopher Chope">the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)</phrase> on obtaining the debate, which is on an important subject and of great concern to his constituents. The picture he painted was so grim that I have difficulty promising to pour oil on troubled waters, but I shall attempt to put the rock concert proposal, as he called it, into some context.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/2">The management of a 260,000 hectare public forest estate is a significant part of the commission's work. It aims to manage that on behalf of the nation sustainably, to contribute to the economic, social and environmental objectives of the Government's strategy for England's trees, woods and forests. It is not primarily a commercial enterprise; it carries out commercial activities, but it is also required to provide a wide range of public benefits. It might be helpful if I mention some examples of those benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/3">The commission is England's largest provider of countryside recreational opportunities. Almost the entire forest estate is dedicated for public access on foot in perpetuity under the provisions of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. It is has a significant role in enhancing biodiversity by working to bring into and maintain in a favourable condition more than 64,000 hectares of sites of special scientific interest on the estates. It makes great efforts to improve the ancient woodland&mdash;one of our most valuable habitats&mdash; through the removal of non-native conifers and the regeneration of native broadleaf trees. It restores open habitats, including lowland heath and upland mires, where that can make a greater contribution to enhancing biodiversity than the plantations that are being removed.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/4">Over the years, the commission has changed, as have its funding sources, which include Government funding, commercial activities, partnerships and the sale of surplus assets, the proceeds of which have been reinvested. As the hon. Gentleman knows, all Departments are required to maximise the return on their assets, consistent with their objectives. The commission is allowed to sell areas for development when that is in the public interest, the pursuit of which objective has resulted in income of &pound;30 million over the past 10 years, which is significant. The sale of sustainably harvested, independently certified timber, for example, is running at around 1.5 million cu m per year, which makes up around half of the commission's operational income, so it is not true that it has decided that it is more profitable to organise rock concerts than to deal with the proper business of the woodlands.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/5">The remainder of the commercial income comes from a wide variety of sources, as we would expect of any major landowner that seeks to make good use of the assets at its disposal. There are some recreational activities that have a commercial element, including mountain biking for which bike hire franchises are let. In addition, there are catering franchises, shops at visitor centres and, of course, an annual series of live music concerts.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/6">That brings me to the heart of the debate: the proposal to create an events area in Ringwood forest, which is planned to be used on one weekend a year for live music and for the occasional community event. I reassure the hon. Gentleman that there are no weekend festivals such he described at Forestry Commission venues. No facilities are provided for people staying overnight at any of the venues at which it holds concerts. In fact, the sites that he mentioned have three separate events; there is no continuous festival, and there are no plans for one.</p>

	<p pid="a.283.1/1">I have absolutely no evidence that that is what happens or of any complaints, but I shall check, and if there any information that I can usefully share with the hon. Gentleman on that point, I shall be happy to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/2">Live music in the forest is not new. The commission has been hosting concerts for the past seven years and has a good record of understanding how to do so in a way that is compatible with the interests of the forest and with being a good neighbour. Last year, more than 120,000 people enjoyed a concert programme spread over seven Forestry Commission venues around the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/3">It is not right to claim that Ringwood forest was chosen at random, as though proper consideration were not given to the decision. As the hon. Gentleman said, other sites were examined, including Moors valley. I understand that the decision about Moors valley was based on two factors: the country park is already extremely busy, so it would have been difficult to accommodate additional events, and it would be difficult to separate a concert event from the users going about their normal visits to the country park. For that reason, the consideration ended in the decision that that would not be an appropriate venue.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/4">Ringwood forest, however, is entirely appropriate for many reasons. The final choice took into account the experiences of other venues and the planned future management of the forest. That is an important point, because there is always change in forests, and there are always management considerations. In the case of Ringwood, that includes moving from the existing plantations to a more diverse mixture of pines and native woodland, interspersed with open space, including swathes of heathland. In that forest, as in many others, trees are cut down for proper management reasons, to improve the status and condition of the forest.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/5">The site also has particularly good road access, adequate drainage and natural orientation that will allow the stage to face away from the main residential areas. As the hon. Gentleman said, there is also space to accommodate the short-term parking of up to 2,000 cars. I examined the proposal carefully and had a map so that I could examine the major roads and connections in the area and consider how people arriving on the major roads would connect with roads into the forest. The vision is not of hundreds or thousands of cars passing through small villages. If people come from the neighbouring cities, as we anticipate, they will be able to come on a main road and enter the forest in ways that should be perfectly acceptable to people in the neighbourhood.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.1/1">Any forest cannot be the concern only of the people most local to it. Throughout the whole country, forests are available to people from the beyond the local area. It is essential that people from further afield, particularly from cities, have the opportunity to visit our forests.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.1/1">I am pleased to have secured this debate on an issue that is so important to my constituency. I am grateful to the Minister for meeting me recently to discuss licensing issues in Durham. I found the meeting helpful and reassure him that the purpose of the debate is not necessarily to criticise the Licensing Act 2003 but to explore with him those instances in which the Act is perhaps not as effective as it could be and in which local communities are not being protected from inappropriate late licences. It is particularly an issue for Durham because the night-time economy area and local residents are in close proximity.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/2">It might be helpful for me to start with some history of my communication on the issue with constituents and Ministers. I held an initial public meeting last year and invited my constituents to have their say on pub and club licensing in Durham. I raised many of the issues that emerged from that meeting with the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase>, and he agreed to visit Durham to meet local people to discuss their concerns further. He also wrote me a detailed letter in response to many of the matters raised. Some of the outstanding issues were matters for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and were referred to my hon. Friend the Minister, who also offered to meet me and respond in writing.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/3">I am grateful to both my hon. Friends for their helpfulness and willingness to listen to the problems that we have had in Durham. It has moved us on enormously, and some issues that involve local misunderstandings about the Act have been cleared up, but four issues remain. First, local authorities need better guidance, so that they feel confident monitoring and turning down licences that prevent them from promoting the four key licensing objectives. Secondly, is the current appeals system the right one, given its many challenges for local residents? Is the system not too onerous to allow local views to be heard and adequately represented? Thirdly, is better notification needed for residents of what comes before the licensing committee for licensing determination. Fourthly, the general view is that the Act contains a presumption in favour of allowing applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/4">On the first issue, Durham city centre has many late licences. I cannot state the exact number, because the city council has been unable to provide me with that information; it does not have it to hand. How can the council judge the effect of applications on the city overall if it does not monitor daily or weekly the number of late licences granted? I want to put it on record that this is not meant simply as a criticism of the council, but it clearly needs help and further guidance on how to turn down applications or operate the Act better. An example is the interpretation of the word &quot;vicinity&quot; in determining the effect of a licence and the area from which interested parties can be drawn. Current guidance under section 182 of the Act directs licensing committees to consider the vicinity to be about 100 m, but depending on local terrain, that can be too close. Local authorities should be able to set their own definition of the vicinity. The Act allows that, but the guidance directs the use of 100 m. The issue should be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/5">How can one small city cope with the extensive night-time economy, so that it does not have a negative impact on city centre residents? No one is arguing that no late licences should be given; it is merely that the licensing committee does not adequately consider or reflect in its decisions the impact on public nuisance. People are woken up late at night&mdash;or, more usually now, early in the morning&mdash;or have their doors kicked in, their cars damaged and so on. It is my view that too many 2.30 am late licenses are being granted, but I do not have the exact numbers.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/6">It appears that more late licenses have been granted in Durham than in Westminster. Surely, that cannot be right. The local authority, Durham city council, brought in consultants&mdash;no doubt, because of the bad publicity that it has received&mdash;to consider a cumulative impact policy for the city, but I understand that they are likely to argue against the city's adopting one. I am not sure why, although it appears that they feel that it might simply push the problem of granting licences elsewhere in the city. Again, giving local authorities more information about the matter would be helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/7">I wish to put on record that the statement of local licensing policy produced by Durham city council is good. If it were used properly, it would probably give the city reasonable protection. For example, the policy acknowledges that patrons leaving licensed premises at 2 am are likely to have an impact on residents' sleep, and policy 8 seeks</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/8" class="indent">&quot;to strike a fair balance between the benefit to a community and the risk of disturbance to local residents of a licensed venue.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/9">Policy 15 states that</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/10" class="indent">&quot;the licensing authority will give careful consideration to licence applications that may result in adverse impact upon the amenity of the neighbouring population in the late evening/early morning&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/11">The problem is that those and other licensing policies are not being used sufficiently in determining licence applications. In fact, at times, it seems almost as though they are being completely ignored. What can the Government do to ensure that local policy is adhered to, given greater weight and linked specifically to the promotion of the licensing objectives? One simple modification to the 2003 Act that would give greater powers to reach decisions in keeping with local requirements would be the addition of a fifth licensing objective requiring that the granting of a licence must be consistent with locally determined policy, which must in turn reflect the local interpretation and application of the four licensing objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/12">Another issue is lap dancing. I contend that lap dancing clubs should not be licensed under the Act at all but, like sex shops, under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982. I am working with the organisation Object, which seeks to achieve that end. We contend that the Licensing Act 2003 is not the appropriate measure for granting licences to lap dancing clubs. My experience of Durham in that respect highlights the Act's weaknesses most clearly. Durham received an application for a lap dancing licence to 2.30 am for a premises called the Loft. It is located on a street that acts as the main gateway to the city, adjacent to the bus station and on a main route to the city centre from the railway station. It is also in close proximity to the world heritage site and city centre, across the road from a youth club and in the vicinity of three churches. Some 1,000 residents live within a 500 m radius. In the views of local people, the application contravened not only local licensing policies but a number of Government licensing objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/13">Again, the council's licensing policy 14 appears to be helpful. It states that the council</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/14" class="indent">&quot;will discourage applications for licenses which involve a sex related element near schools, places of worship, hospitals, youth clubs&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/15">In my submission to the council, I expressed clearly how local licensing policies 6, 8, 10, 11, 14 and 15, and no doubt others should prevent the licence from being granted. The application was heard at the beginning of August, when everyone was on holiday, and it was approved, despite policy 14 and other local policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/16">Thanks to some very brave residents, including Mrs. Kirsty Thomas and Dr. and Mrs. Evans, an appeal was launched with the magistrates courts. The group of local residents had to fundraise to employ a barrister, organise meetings, gather a lot of information and co-ordinate a large number of objectors. I cannot emphasise enough to the Minister the work required from local people, staff in my office and me in preparing for that appeal. It was disproportionate to the ease with which the decision was made in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/17">I am sure that the Minister can imagine our delight when, in December, the magistrates court found in favour of the appeal. It had concerns about the application in respect of all four licensing objectives and serious concerns with three of them. It found that there was a serious risk of exacerbating problems of crime and disorder and compelling evidence that a lap dancing club on North road would aggravate existing public nuisance problems and, in respect of the protection of children, that the club could hardly be worse sited.</p>

	<p pid="a.289.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a very interesting point, and I am sure that that could be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/2">One possible solution would be to fund an organisation like Planning Aid, which exists to help residents with planning licences. However, some of my constituents have suggested what might be a better way forward: in other cases where it is felt that a costly legal process is inappropriate, such as in industrial relations disputes, a tribunal system has worked well. Perhaps such a system is needed in this case.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/3">My third point is that much better notification and advertising of licensing application is needed, so that local people, other interested parties and responsible authorities can get adequate notice. My fourth point is that both the city council and local residents say that the 2003 Act presumes in favour of the applicant. I do not necessarily agree, but there is a problem with licences being approved where no representations are made from interested parties and responsible authorities. There is also the contention&mdash;I should like the Minister to comment on this in particular&mdash;that a licence can be granted in the absence of objections regardless of the views of the licensing committee, which creates a climate where it is presumed that the 2003 Act operates in favour of licensing applicants.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/4">I recently outlined to the Minister the case of a bus parking in a lay-by to sell alcohol. Other similar circumstances involve areas of transient populations where representations may not be made, but where the impact of the licence might be detrimental to the wider community, so that needs to be looked at. Some of the issues that we are dealing with do not primarily relate to licensing. The city council's decision to promote a night-time economy, at odds with the historical, spiritual and cultural heritage of the city, needs to be addressed. We need a proper plan for the city's development that seeks to achieve a more reasonable balance between the competing uses of the city centre. He will be relieved to hear that I do not think that it is his job to do that. However, it is something that I hope that the new unitary authority for Durham will take on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/5">In the meantime, however, attention needs to be paid to the four areas that I have mentioned today. I should be very grateful for any input that the Minister can give to resolve those issues. I am grateful to him and my the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling for their very active interest in the problems being experienced in Durham&mdash;it really is appreciated&mdash;but we need action, and I would be most grateful if the Minister travelled to Durham to meet a delegation so that he can see, or at least hear about, the issues in Durham and explore with us how a more sensible licensing strategy could be achieved to enable people to have a good night out in Durham, while providing better protection for local residents and the city's heritage.</p>

	<p pid="a.290.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods)</phrase> on giving the Chamber the opportunity to discuss the impact of licensing reform in her area. I also congratulate her on the way she has looked after her constituents. I know that she has put a great deal of effort into that.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/2">I shall answer the specific concerns my hon. Friend raises shortly, but it is important to put them into the context of the 2003 Act. Despite predictions of doom from some quarters, the Act has been successfully implemented, and the consensus among people I talk to who are using it on the ground is that it is a useful tool and working well. Of course, one of the key aims of the reform was to bring licensing decisions, particularly those relating to alcohol licences, closer to the people. I am therefore pleased that one of the key positive messages to come out of our recent evaluation of the impact of the Act was that it had delivered benefits to local democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/3">The 10 scrutiny councils appointed to help to monitor the impact felt that:</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Residents are much more aware of what they can do to resolve problems at a premises and licensees are much more aware of their responsibilities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/5">Researchers at the university of Westminster found that</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/6" class="indent">&quot;the changes in licensing had had a generally positive effect on community relations in the areas examined, with residents and local councillors alike feeling that they had more of a say in the process of granting and challenging licensing decisions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/7">Of course, that does not mean that problems are not occurring. As our evaluation noted, despite some positive signs, we have yet to see the benefits of licensing reform applied consistently across England and Wales, so it is timely to hear from my hon. Friend about experiences in her area.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/8">My hon. Friend is particularly concerned about the control of a lap-dancing establishment in her constituency. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" name="Celia Barlow">the Member for Hove (Ms Barlow)</phrase> also raised some important concerns about such establishments. However, as has been said, I cannot comment on individual licensing decisions, and it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the ruling of a magistrates court or to speculate on the possibility of judicial review and its outcome. I understand the frustrations of my hon. Friend's constituents, but the matter has not yet been fully resolved. She will know that it is an established and fundamental part of our democratic and legal structure, not to mention human rights law, that there must be scope for independent review of court decisions. That must be the case no matter how much each party might think that it is in the right, and even if it is understandably frustrating to parties when appeals and reviews take time to be considered properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/9">I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Hove, whom I met yesterday to discuss the concerns about lap-dancing clubs in her constituency and similar issues that have arisen in other parts of the country. Having reflected on those points and on the matters that have been raised today, I believe that the Licensing Act 2003 is able to control such premises when problems relate to the four licensing objectives. The examples that my hon. Friend gave me yesterday show that the Act has successfully been used in some areas to control lap-dancing premises when there have been problems with the protection of children from harm or with illegal activities being carried on there. The Act can also be used to apply conditions to protect the safety of those working and performing at such premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/10">Much can be legitimately done under the Licensing Act to control such premises, but I appreciate that there may be uncertainty among some local authorities, so I am happy to write to chief executives to clarify the position. It is important that we show some consistency and write to them about the position. The 2003 Act cannot, however, prevent such activities taking place because of concerns about public decency and obscenity, or the inappropriateness of that activity for a particular area. Although those may well be important and legitimate concerns, it is not appropriate to consider them under the Act. To do so would mean adding new licensing objectives that would then apply to all 200,000 premises licensed under the Act, and that would not be efficient or proportionate. It is also important to recognise that the Act is not about censorship and does not in itself regulate the content of entertainment. Those are much wider issues that relate to the balance between public sensibilities and the freedom of speech and artistic expression.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/11">I should add that the Court of Appeal has previously ruled that certain lewd sexual acts should not in any case be considered as public entertainment, so it is questionable whether entertainment licensing could ever cover all those activities. It is precisely because such exhibitions must be in tune with laws on indecency, obscenity, prostitution and pornography that the lead responsibility lies with the Home Office. If the regulation of those premises is inadequate, it might be that regulation akin to the licensing of sex shops under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 would be more appropriate, as my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham said. Alternatively, it might be something that planning law could cover.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/12">I cannot make any commitment at this time, as my hon. Friend will understand, but I certainly shall raise those matters with the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase>, and ask him to consider those points in discussion with me and the relevant Communities and Local Government Minister with responsibility for planning policy. My hon. Friend visited Durham, and I shall certainly consider the opportunity to visit, if we have those meetings with ministerial colleagues, to see if we can come up with something positive.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/13">My hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham also cited areas where she felt that the Licensing Act may not operate in the best interests of her constituents. Without commenting on individual cases, it seems to me that in most instances a satisfactory conclusion has been reached. It is important to remember that the Licensing Act brought in an important additional safeguard: it is possible to seek a licence review if problems occur at a premises. I know from going around with the police in Bradford that they have been very happy to be able to deal through the review process with problems that arise once the licence has been approved.</p>

	<p pid="a.293.1/1">I am happy to do what my hon. Friend suggests and give support to local authorities. Through the Local Government Association and the Local Authorities Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services, there are opportunities for us to continue to get the message out. As I said, beacon council status can be used, too, which then helps us to disseminate best practice. We continue to look at how we can improve. We are looking at how to improve the application processes and to ensure that we have clear rules about advertising type of application that my hon. Friend has discussed, but we must get the right balance and make sure that we have the right costs and burdens, so that we do not prevent people from making applications. We must also consider the effects on village halls, charities and so on. When dealing with applications, it is a question of balance.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.1/2">My hon. Friend talked about &quot;vicinity&quot; being an issue. Last July we were advised that that was not a key element, and that the impacts or the licensable activities were more important. We continue to review what can be done. We have made the right move in delegating the matter to local government, because it is right that local councillors and local government have the right to determine what goes on in their area. It is important that we look at the planning process and its objectives, and I am particularly concerned to hear that in Brighton, six lap-dancing clubs have been established in a very short time. That problem will start to spread throughout the country, so I appreciate my hon. Friend raising the matter today. I will be happy to meet colleagues again to consider what can be done to ensure that local people get what they want in their local area.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.1/3" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.1/4" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at one minute to Five o'clock.</p>
